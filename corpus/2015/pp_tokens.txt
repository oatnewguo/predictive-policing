n
courts
all
over
the
united
states
have
struggled
to
define
high
crime
area
since
the
supreme
court
s
decision
in
illinois
v
wardlow
n
wardlow
essentially
reduced
the
reasonable

totality
of
the
circumstances
analysis
to
a
two
factor
test
in
certain
geographic
areas
permitting
the
characterization
of
a
neighborhood
as
high
crime
to
serve
as
a
plus
factor
for
finding
reasonable
suspicion
n
however
the
wardlow
court
failed
to
define
the
term
high
crime
area
n
furthermore
the
court
did
not
offer
any
guidance
regarding
the
evidentiary
showing
necessary
to
corroborate
a
police
officer
s
assertion
that
a
neighborhood
has
a
high
propensity
for
crime
n
lacking
guidance
the
lower
courts
have
taken
a
haphazard
approach
to
defining
the
term
high
crime
area
leading
to
amorphous
and
inconsistent
definitions
across
jurisdictions
n
thus
courts
have
generally
deferred
to
a
police
officer
s
subjective
belief
that
an
area
is
high
crime
and
have
not
required
law
enforcement
agencies
to
corroborate
an
officer
s
belief
with
quantitative
evidence

the
courts
failure
to
require
law
enforcement
agencies
to
present
concrete
evidence
demonstrating
that
a
neighborhood
has
a
heightened
propensity
for
crime
raises
significant
constitutional
concerns

defined
as
high
crime
tend
to
disproportionately
represent
low

courts
deference
to
police
officers
subjective
experiences
has
created
significant
animosity
between
the
residents
of
these
neighborhoods
and
law
enforcement
n
the
high
crime
label
often
coincides
with
an
increased
police
presence
in
these
neighborhoods
n
moreover
using
the
high
crime
designation
as
a
plus
factor
in
a
two
factor
totality
of
the
circumstances
test
lowers
the
threshold
for
reasonable
suspicion
in
these
neighborhoods
and
ultimately
strips
residents
of
critical
constitutional
protections
n
thus
individuals
living
in
these
neighborhoods
do
not
enjoy
the
same
level
of
fourth
amendment
protections
as
individuals
residing
in
wealthier
whiter
neighborhoods
n
however
the
prevalent
use
of
predictive
policing
software
and
its
increasing
sophistication
provides
courts
with
an
opportunity
to
narrowly
define
high
crime
areas
based
on
both
geography
and
specific
crime
type
requiring
law
enforcement
to
use
narrow
crime
specific
definitions

compstat
to
compile
statistical
data
to
show
when
and
where
different
types
of
crime
occurred
in
the
city
n
the
nypd
used
this
data
to
distribute
personnel
and
tailor
its
policing
strategies
to
address
these
hotspots
of
criminal
activity
revolutionizing
the
nypd
s
operations
n
under
the
compstat
system
data
was
collected
and
analyzed
weekly
and
precinct
commanders
met
every
few
weeks
with
the
department
s
leadership
to
discuss
crime
statistics
and
modify
their
policing
strategies
as
needed
n
compstat
s
implementation
created
a
constant
feedback
loop
for
the
nypd
and
coincided
with
a
staggering
decline
in
crime
in
new
york
city
n
police
departments
across
the
united
states
began
using
the
compstat
system
after
they
learned
about
the
nypd
s
success
n
although
experts
continue
to
debate
the
role
of
compstat
in
facilitating
new
york
city
s
declining
crime
rate
in
the
s
and
early
s
n
this
software
paved
the
way
for
the
development
of
the
latest
emerging
predictive
policing
technologies
which
are
used
today
by
law
enforcement
agencies
across
the
united
states
n
a
general
overview
of
new
predictive
policing
technologies
the
development
of
next
generation
predictive
policing
programs
has
garnered
not
only
national
attention
but
also
federal
financing
because
of
the
software
s
cost
effectiveness
high
tech
image
and
promising
test
results
n
the
latest
predictive
policing
programs
appear
to
reduce
crime
without
significantly
disrupting
other
policing
efforts
in
the
small
geographic
areas
where
they
have
been
tested
n
moreover
in
an
era
of
significant
budget
cuts
law
enforcement
agencies
are
taking
advantage
of
the
fact
that
this
software
seamlessly
blends
into
their
existing
crime
fighting
operations
and
saves
money
by
more
efficiently
allocating
resources
n
predictive
policing
technology
is
built
upon
the
popular
understanding
that
criminals
are
creatures
of
habit
they
repeatedly
commit
the
same
types
of
crimes
at
around
the
same
time
of
day
in
the
same
geographic
area
n
studies
have
generally
shown
that
certain
property
crimes
such
as
burglary
are
highly
predictable
n
generally
predictive
policing
models
rely
on
an
assumption
that
criminals
are
rational
decision
makers
who
commit
crimes
by
exploiting
opportunities
created
under
certain
conditions
n
the
latest
predictive
policing
software
uses
years
sometimes
decades
worth
of
crime
reports
and
the
algorithm
analyses
sic
the
data
to
identify
areas
with
high
probabilities

types
of
crime

n
captain
john
romero
of
the
los
angeles
police
department
explains
burglars
tend
to
be
territorial
so
once
they
find
a
neighborhood
where
they
get
good
stuff
they
come
back
again
and
again
and
that
assists
the
algorithm
in
placing
the
boxes
n
historically
the
use
of
predictive
policing
technologies
has
been
limited
to
tracking
analyzing
and
predicting
property
crimes
n
because
the
software
was
designed
to
predict
where
and
when
crime
is
mostly
likely
to
occur
not
who
will
commit
it
n
however
unlike
compstat
which
relied
on
data
of
past
criminal
activity
to
extrapolate
patterns
and
predict
future
criminal
activity
the
new
generation
of
predictive
policing
technologies
is
forward
looking
and
truly
predictive
n
as
will
be
described
below
the
latest
software

analyze
vast
and
complex
data
sets
in
near
real
time
speeds
to
reveal
previously
unseen
patterns
of
crimes
n
as
the
capabilities
of
these
programs
have
advanced
police
departments
have
begun
to
experiment
with
using
the
software
to
predict
other
types
of
crimes
such
as
gun
violence
and
gang
activity
n
although
predictive
policing
technology
has
many
potential
uses
n
this
note
focuses
on
how
this
software
can
be
used
by
law
enforcement
and
the
courts
to
identify
and
classify
high
crime
areas
by
specific
crime
type
and
geography
to
illustrate
how
this
software
works
and
what
it
is
capable

and
the

terrain
model
rtm
b
the
near
repeat
model
the
near
repeat
model
for
predictive
policing
technology
assumes
that
crime
spreads
through
local
environments
on
a
micro
scale
like
a
contagious
disease
n
thus
when
certain
crimes
occur
at
a
location
these
crimes
tend
to
create
repeat
criminal
activity
in
the
same
location
n
professor
mohler
of
santa
clara
university
has
created
an
earthquake
modeling
algorithm
based
on
this
near
repeat
model
n
the
earthquake
modeling
algorithm
draws
a
grid
over
a
jurisdiction
and
estimates
the
background
rate
at
which
new
crime
appears
in
each
cell
of
the
grid
n
when
a
new
crime
occurs
in
a
cell
the
algorithm
assumes
that
the
rate
for
the
new
crime
will
temporarily
increase
like
an
aftershock
following
an
earthquake
n
over
time
the
rate
for
new
crime
declines
the
longer
the
cell
goes
without
seeing
any
new
crime
similar
to
how
the
aftershocks
of

diminish
over

up

up
again
in
really
complicated
ways
that
are
just
very
very
difficult
if
not
impossible
for
the
individual
to
intuit
n
thus
to
ensure
accuracy
when
using
the
near
repeat
model
agencies
must
regularly
input
new
data
into
the
software
because
without
up
to
date
information
the
utility
of
the
software
s
predictions
will
diminish
over
time
n
software
based
on
the
near
repeat
model
has
a
high
rate
of
success
for
predicting
where
and
when
burglaries
are
likely
to
occur
in
an
area
n
although
the
near
repeat
model
can
accurately
predict
patterns
in
property
crimes
it
is
unclear
whether
this
model
can
effectively
forecast
other
types
of
crime
such
as
gun
violence
or
crimes
of
passion
n
however
the
results
of
one
study
were
promising
the
study
showed
that
the
near
repeat
model
accurately
forecasted
the
location
of
violent
rival
gang
related
activity
n
these
findings
support
the
proposition
that
in
evidence
suppression
hearings
courts
could
rely
on
statistical
outputs
from
predictive
policing
software
to
evaluate
a
police

a

area
c
risk
terrain
modeling
rtm
the
risk
terrain
model
serves
as
the
foundation
for
some
predictive
policing
software
rtm
uses
geographic
information
systems
to
identify
geographic
features
that
contribute
to
elevated
crime
risk
and
overlays
them
onto
a
base
map
n
potential
geographic
features
used
to
predict
crime
risk
in
this
model
include
bars
liquor
stores
and
strip
clubs
n
rtm
is
akin
to
a
base
map
with
layers
of
tracing
paper
laid
on
top
of
it
as
more
environmental
features
are
plotted
on
top
of
each
other
clusters
of
potential
criminal
activity
are
revealed
based
on
these
existing
features
n
the
model
s
algorithm
then
makes
predictions
about
an
area
s
risk
for
crime
based
on
how
close
the
selected
geographic
location
is
to
identified
environmental
features
n
unlike
the
near
repeat
model
the
rtm
predicts
crimes
based
on
the
interactions
between
behavioral
social
physical
and
environmental
factors
instead
of
solely

about
where

when

d
general
limitations
of

although

provides
law
enforcement
agencies
with
a
powerful
tool
that
can
help
them
efficiently
allocate
crime
fighting
resources
these
technologies
have
some
common
limitations
first
effective
use
of
predictive
policing
technologies
requires
reliability
transparency
and
accuracy
in
data
collection
and
analysis
without
safeguards
in
place
data
is
susceptible
to
human
fallibility
n
second
taken
alone
predictive
policing
software
cannot
establish
the
requisite
level
of
particularized
suspicion
required
to
perform
a
lawful
terry
stop
premised
on
reasonable
suspicion
n
humans
create
data
which
leaves
it
fallible
to
human
error
currently
there
are
no
uniform
standards
or
best
practices
in
place
to
guide
police
departments
as
they
collect
the
data
that
will
be
used
as
inputs
for
statistical
analysis
data
creation
requires
humans
to
select
what
information
to
collect
and
what
information
to
discard
similar
to
the
old
adage
garbage
in
garbage
out
n
an
uninformed
user
may
believe
that
the
representation
of
previously
unseen
truths
generated
by
predictive
policing
software
tells
an
entirely
objective
story
n
however
this
is
not
the
case
because
data
is
something
we
create
n
by
making
choices
about
what
information
to
collect
and
the
method
used
to
collect
it
thus
police
departments
and
courts
should
proceed
cautiously
when
evaluating
the
statistical
outputs
from
predictive
policing
algorithms
because
the
word
data
connotes
fixed
numbers
inside
hard
grids
of
information
and
as
a
result
it
is
easily
mistaken
for
fact
n
moreover
humans
select
the
language
used
to
describe
data
there
is
no
mandatory
program
in
place
to
guide
data
classification
unfortunately
there
is
a
common
misconception
that
local
law
enforcement
agencies
are
required
to
conform
to
the
federal
bureau
of
investigation
s
fbi
uniform
crime
reporting
ucr
program
standards
to
classify
crimes
n
however
when
reviewing
the
ucr
handbook
it
becomes
clear
that
this
program
is
permissive
and
the
fbi
merely
recommends
that
agencies
conform
to
its
classification
system
n
as
the
fbi
explains
on
its
website
offense
definitions
may
vary
from
state
to
state
and
the
fbi
asks
agencies
to
report
offenses
not
according
to
local
or
state
statutes
but
according
to
those
guidelines
provided
in
the
handbook
n
the
fbi
notes
that
most
agencies
make
a
good
faith
effort
to
comply
with
established
guidelines
n
however
compliance
is
not
required
hence
law
enforcement
agencies
have
discretion
to
describe
crime
data
even
when
reporting
to
the
fbi
under
the
ucr
program
n
as
such
one
might
say
the
data
is
only
as
good
as
the
people
using
it
n
moreover
critics
of
predictive
policing
technologies
suggest
that
data
driven
policing
may
create
self
fulfilling
cycles
of
bias
for
police
departments
using
this
information
to
make
resource
allocation
decisions
n
for
example
if
statistical
outputs
suggest
that
a
neighborhood
is
a
high
crime
area
a
law
enforcement
agency
may
police
that
area
more
heavily
than
others
this
increased
police
presence
may
in
turn
generate
more
arrests
in
the
neighborhood
because
of
the
increased
crime
detection
capacity
thus
when
new
arrest
data
is
added
to
the
predictive
policing
software
it
may
reinforce
a
department
s
original
prediction
by
directing
crime
fighting
resources
to
an
area
that
is
already
heavily
policed
the
algorithm
then
gives
the
impression
that
there
are
heightened
levels
of
criminal
activity
in
that
neighborhood
when
in
reality
more
criminals
are
getting
caught
because
there
are
more
police
officers
present
to
detect
crime
n
heightened
police
presence
in
a
neighborhood
can
lead
to
more
stop
and
frisks
and
skew
the
data
so
it
appears
that
one
neighborhood
has
a
higher
crime
rate
than
other
areas
n
thus
without
safeguards
in
place
data
analytics
and
data
collection
are
susceptible
to
human
fallibility
predictive

can
be
a
very
useful

it
is
just
that
a

expert
laments

creates
categorical
suspicion
of

be
limited
to
helping

generalized
suspicion
about

however
the

has
chipped
away
at
this
constitutional
protection
since
its
groundbreaking
decision
in
terry
v

in
n
the
terry
court
carved
out
an
exception
to
the
probable

developed
a
new
threshold
standard
of
reasonable
suspicion

in

further
weakened

a
police

must
point
to
specific
and
articulable
facts
which
taken
together
with
rational
inferences
from

facts
reasonably
warrant
that
intrusion

a
practical
nontechnical
conception

balancing
direct
observations
of
a
suspect
s
behavior
and
the
entire

to
establish
particularized
suspicion
that

activity
is
afoot

in

to
perform
a
lawful
terry
stop
an
officer
needs
more
than
a
hunch
he
must
directly
observe

the
officer
must
demonstrate
that

the
suspect
somehow
distinguished

the
scope

the
search
must
be
strictly
tied
to
and
justified
by
the

rendered
its
initiation
permissible

the
terry
court
viewed
this
new
reasonable
suspicion
standard
as
carving
out
limited
exceptions
to
the
general
rule
that
seizures
of
the
person
require
probable
cause
to
arrest

are
two
scenarios
in

lawful
terry
stops
arise

first
type
of
terry
stop
occurs
when
an
officer
fears
imminent
danger
to
himself
and
the
context
in
which
the
terry
court
envisioned
these
stops
would
occur
n
in
this
situation
an
officer
can
conduct
an
over
the
clothes
pat
down
of
a
suspect
limited
to
a
search
for
weapons
n
the
second
scenario
developed
after
the
terry
decision
n
it
arises
when
an
officer
observes
a
suspect
s
behavior
and
believes
that
a
specific
type
of
criminal
activity
is
afoot
based
on
these
observations
n
in
this
scenario
an
officer
s
search
should
be
limited
to
frisking
for
evidence
related
to
the
specific
suspected
criminal
activity
n
for
example
a
police
officer
observes
members
of
hell
s
angels
outside
of
a
motorcycle
shop
after
observing
their
behavior
the
officer
suspects
that
they
intend
to
rob
the
shop
an
officer
may
lawfully
perform
a
limited
over
the
clothes
frisk
for
a
commercial
grade
lock
cutter
or
other
typical
burglary
tools
n
terry
stops
performed
under
the
purview
of
the
second
scenario
can
be
problematic
when
chief
justice
warren
wrote
the
terry
opinion
he
recognized
that
the
seizure
of
a
person
is
more
than
a
mere
minor
inconvenience
and
petty
indignity
rather
it
is
a
serious
intrusion
upon
the
sanctity
of
the
person
which
may
inflict
great
indignity
and
arouse
strong
resentment
and
it
is
not
to
be
undertaken
lightly
n
he
pointed
to
then
current
police
scholarship
to
underscore
his
concerns
that
police
officers
may
abuse
their
authority
to
stop
and
frisk
and
use
it
as
a
means
to
maintain
the
image
of

power
and
control

further
minimized
the

dramatically
expanded

many
wardlow
critics
have
questioned
whether

any
more
indicative

decision
has
significantly
weakened
the
fourth

protections
provided
to
individuals
living

areas
labeled

the

neighborhood
character
alone
could
not
justify
an
officer
s
finding

still
requires
a

officer
to
have

factor

particularized
suspicion
appears
to
carry
more
weight

alone
an

mere
presence
in

without
indicia
that

not
be
enough
to
justify

subjective
belief

to
offer
facts

his
testimony

have
labeled
an

any
data
to

this

generally
courts

typically
do
not

to
present
quantitative

are
rarely
introduced
in

prove
that

stop
actually
occurred
in
a
high

area
n
for
example
in
united
states
v
baskin
the
seventh
circuit
expressly
rejected
the
argument
that
the
government
must
produce
specific
data
to
establish
that
a
location
is
a
high
crime
area
n
the
court
held
that
the
location
of
baskin
s
unprovoked
flight
remained
a
relevant
factor
because
the
terry
stop
occurred
near
a
newly
discovered
methamphetamine
lab
in
a
county
park
n
the
court
accepted
the
government
s
decision
to
designate
a
park
as
a
high
crime
area
without
requiring
the
government
to
present
any
actual
data
to
support
its
assertion
n
the
lack
of
rigor
used
to
establish
an
objective
basis
for
defining
an
area
as
high
crime
has
frustrated
some
judges
n
many
judges
and
scholars
have
expressed
their
concern
about
the
continued
erosion
of
fourth
amendment
protections
in
neighborhoods
haphazardly
designated
as
high
crime
n
for
example
the
majority
opinion
in
united
states
v
montero
carmargo
stated
that
the
court
must
be
careful
that
the
high
crime
label
does
not
just
blanket
communities
in
which
members
of
minority
groups
regularly
go
about
their
daily
business
but
is
limited
to
specific
circumscribed
locations
where
particular
crimes
occur
with
unusual
regularity
n
although
the
montero
carmargo
court
expressed
that
it
wanted
to
exercise
caution
when
applying
the
high
crime
label
it
failed
to
employ
this
rigor
n
judge
kozinski
criticizes
the
majority
for
deferring
to
the
two
arresting
officers
perception
of
an
area
as
high
crime
as
sufficient
to
label
it
as
such
n
he
warns
to
rely
on
every
cop
s
repertoire
of
war
stories
to
determine
what
is
a
high
crime
area
and
on
that
basis
to
treat
otherwise
innocuous
behavior
as
grounds
for
reasonable
suspicion
strikes
me
as
an
invitation
to
trouble
n
judge
kozinski
further
laments
the
question
is
not
whether
the
characteristics
of
the
area
may
be
taken
into
account
but
how
these
characteristics
are
established
in
our
first
opinion
to
interpret
this
language
from
wardlow
the
majority
adopts
a
methodology
for
establishing
the
characteristics
of
the

is

continuing
to
permit

ambiguous
definitions

areas
comes
at
a
significant
cost
to
the
people
who
live
in

neighborhoods
as
noted
previously
the
high
crime
label
tends
to
attach
to
hypersegregated
low
income
minority
neighborhoods
across
the
united
states
n
many
of
these
neighborhoods
became
saturated
with
police
officers
when
the
united
states
began
its
war
on
drugs
during
the
reagan
administration
n
heavy
policing
of
these
low
income
minority
neighborhoods
has
led
to
a
disproportionate
number
of
people
of
color
being
stopped
and
frisked
n
the
wardlow
court
s
transformation
of
the
reasonable
suspicion
totality
of
the
circumstances
test
into
a
two
factor
test
has
made
it
even
easier
for
police
officers
to
justify
terry
stops
in
these
alleged
high
crime
areas
because
courts
are
deferential
to
police
officers
subjective
beliefs
about
elevated
crime
rates
in
particular
neighborhoods
n
thus
the
reduction
of
the
reasonable
suspicion
test
into
a
two
factor
test
and
the
structural
racism
built
into
our
criminal
justice
system
has
helped
fuel
a
culture
of
mass
incarceration
and
has
disproportionately
affected
low
income
minority
neighborhoods
n
mass
incarceration
refers
to
the
american
cultural
phenomenon
of
the
imprisonment
of
comparatively
and
historically
high
proportions
of
the
population
that
cannot
be
accounted
for
by
changes
in
crime
rates
n
currently
the
united
states
has
the
largest
reported
incarcerated
population
in
the
world
and
by
far
the
highest
rate
of
imprisonment
n
the
number
of
prisoners
in
both
federal
and
state
facilities
has
increased
by
nearly
percent
between
and
n
moreover
racial
disparities
in
imprisonment
rates
are
striking

are
disproportionately
overrepresented
in

in
the
new
jim
crow
michelle
alexander
describes
how
the
war
on
drugs
and
the
structural
racism
embedded
in
our
criminal
justice
system
have
devastated
low
income
minority
communities
across
the
united
states
n
the
culture
of
heavy
policing
created
by
the
war
on
drugs
in
low
income
minority
neighborhoods
has
fostered
significant
animosity
between
the
police
and
residents
of
these
neighborhoods
n
alexander
observes
that
even
though
studies
show
that
rates
of
drug
use
are
similar
across
races
each
year
a
disproportionate
number
of
african
american
men
are
swept
into
the
criminal
justice
system
for
low
level
drug
offenses
because
of
racially
biased
police
discretion
n
many
scholars
and
law
enforcement
agencies
have
tried
to
justify
heavily
policing
low
income
minority
neighborhoods
by
arguing
that
residents
of
these
communities
are
more
likely
to
engage
in
illegal
activity
outdoors
and
in
plain
sight
than
in
higher
income
areas
n
these
agencies
argue
that
concentrating
drug
enforcement
efforts
in
these
neighborhoods
enables
them
to
efficiently
allocate
resources
while
combating
illegal
activity
n
however
unlike
their
wealthier
neighbors
who
would
not
tolerate
heavy
policing
residents
of
low
income
minority
neighborhoods
often
lack
power
in
our
political
system
leaving
them
vulnerable
to
this
biased
policing
n
as
alexander
notes
hypersegregation
has
made
the
round
up
easy
confined
to
ghetto
areas
and
lacking
political
power
the
black
poor
are
convenient
targets
n
heavy
policing
of
these
low
income
neighborhoods
has
created
an
expectation
among
residents
particularly
among
young
black
men
that
they
will
be
stopped
interrogated
and
frisked
numerous
times
in
the
course
of
a
month
or
even
a
single
week
n
in
her
book
alexander
shares
a
story
from
a
law
student
who
participated
in
a
ride
along
with
a
chicago
police
officer
the
student
described
how
each
time
we
drove
into
a
public
housing
project
and
stopped
the
car
every
young
black
man
in
the
area
would
almost
reflexively
place
his
hands
up
against
the
car
and
spread
his
legs
to
be
searched
n
these
regular
encounters
with
law
enforcement
are
problematic
because
they
often
function
as
the
gateway
into
the
criminal
justice
system
for
non
violent
low
level
offenses
such
as
marijuana
possession
n
arrests
for
low
level
non
violent
offenses
have
created
a
climate
where
a
staggering
million
people
are
under
community
correctional
supervision
i
e
on
probation
or
parole
n
moreover
an
individual
does
not
even
need
to
be
convicted
of
a
crime
to
be
barred
from
gainful
employment
access
to
public
housing
or
other
public
assistance
getting
arrested
is
enough
to
essentially
lock
someone
out
of
mainstream
society
n
once
a
person
has
been
swept
into
the
criminal
justice
system
it
is
difficult
to
get
out
n
scholar
loic
wacquant
has
described
this
phenomenon
of
people
cycling
in
and
out
of
prison
and
trapped
by
their
second
class
status
as
a
closed
circuit
of
perpetual
marginality
n
thus
requiring
narrower
definitions
of
high

areas
could
reduce

number
of
terry
stops
that
occur
in

reducing
the

the
role
of
technology
in
fourth
amendment
jurisprudence
the
courts
have
not
only
struggled
with
defining
high
crime
areas
and
applying
wardlow
they
have
also
had
difficulty
evaluating
the
role
that
emerging
technologies
should
play
in
fourth
amendment
analyses
in
recent
years
technology
has
become
increasingly
complex
and
judges
have
had
trouble
staying
abreast
of
the
latest
developments
as
judge
posner
lamented
in
his
book
reflections
on
judging
federal
judges
are
on
the
whole
not
well
adapted
by
training
or
experience
to
the
technological
age
that
we
live
in
n
however
as
new
technologies
develop
the
courts
must
figure
out
how
to
embrace
these
technological
advancements
because
the
law
must
apply
itself
to
the
life
of
a
society
driven
more
and
more
by
technology
and
technological
improvements
n
the
supreme
court
has
yet
to
hear
a
case
specifically
addressing
the
use
of
predictive
policing
technology
however
past
cases
have
required
the
court
to
strike
a
balance
between
permitting
law
enforcement
to
use
emerging
technologies
and
safeguarding
americans
fourth
amendment
protections
n
for
example
when
deciding
whether
police
officers
use
of
a
thermal
imaging
device
constituted
an
unlawful
search
of
a
private
home
in
kyllo
v
united
states
justice
scalia
wrote
it
would
be
foolish
to
contend
that
the
degree
of
privacy
secured
to
citizens
by
the
fourth
amendment
has
been
entirely
unaffected
by
the
advance
of
technology
n
in
this
case
police
officers
suspected
that
kyllo
was
growing
marijuana
in
his
home
and
used
a
thermal
imager
to
determine
if
the
heat
emanating
from
his
home
was
consistent
with
the
high
intensity
heat
lamps
typically
required
to
grow
marijuana
n
although
justice
scalia
recognized
that
the
technology
of
the
particular
device
used
by
the
officers
was
crude
n
he
acknowledged
that
as
technology
evolves
these
devices
have
the
potential
to
reveal
all
human
activity
in
the
home
n
anticipating
that
significant
technological
advancement
was
on
the
horizon
the
court
ruled
that
the
use
of
thermal
imaging
devices
constituted
an
unlawful
search
in
violation
of
the
fourth
amendment
n
moreover
writing
for
the
court
justice
scalia
rejected
a
case
by
case
approach
to
deciding
whether
a
law
enforcement
agency
s
use
of
an
emerging
technology
was
lawful
n
justice
scalia
reasoned
that
before
a
law
enforcement
agency
uses
new
technology
as
part
of
its
policing
efforts
it
must
know
whether
the
use
of
such
technology
is
lawful
so
the
agency
can
adjust
its
policing
strategies
accordingly
n
the
court
s
reasoning
in
a
case
riley
v
california
further
illustrates
the
court
s
preference
for
using
a
long
term
and
uniform
approach
to
evaluating
the
role
of
new
technologies
in
fourth
amendment
jurisprudence
n
the
question
presented
to
the
court
in
riley
was
whether
the
police
may
perform
a
warrantless
search
of
the
digital
information
on
a
cell
phone
seized
from
a
person
who
was
lawfully
arrested
n
writing
for
the
court
chief
justice
roberts
focused
on
the
sophistication
of
emerging
technologies
such
as
the
smartphone
and
highlighted
the
pervasiveness
of
technology
in
our
society
n
he
observed
how
quickly
this
technology
has
evolved
citing
a
pew
research
center
study
from
and
noting
that
even
the
outdated
flip
phone
technology
of
one
of
the
arrestees
had
been
around
for
less
than
years
n
after
describing
the
sophistication
and
prevalence
of
these
smartphones
in
our
daily
lives
the
court
rejected
the
government
s
arguments
for
permitting
warrantless
cell
phone
searches
n
chief
justice
roberts
describes
the
court
s
general
preference
to
provide
clear
guidance
to
law
enforcement
through
categorical
rules
n
quoting
michigan
v
summers
the
court
reasoned
if
police
are
to
have
workable
rules
the
balancing
of
the
competing
interests
must
in
large
part
be
done
on
a
categorical
basis
not
in
an
ad
hoc
case
by
case
fashion
by
individual
police
officers

in
order
to
ensure
that
law
enforcement
agencies
understand
how
they
may
lawfully
use
the
technology
on
which
they
rely
they
need
clear
categorical
rules
delineating
these
parameters
even
for
emerging
technologies
as
judge
posner
further
observes
in
his
book
new
technologies
that
rely
on
complex
mathematical
models
and
statistical
analyses
can
be
particularly
difficult
for
judges
to
understand
when
compared
with
technologies
of
the
past
such
as
the
steam
engine
or
the
automobile
n
he
explains
that
compared
to
the
latest
emerging
technologies
even
when
technologies
of
the
past
were
complex
it
was
easier
to
explain
how
they
worked
to
judges
who
did
not
possess
a
technical
background
n
evaluating
emerging
technologies
places
judges
who
do
not
have
technical
or
scientific
backgrounds
in
uncomfortable
territory

they
must
make
sense
of
the
kinds
of
variables
that

measures
rather
than
the
soft
variables

are
accustomed

however
as
predictive
policing
technologies

increasingly
popular

become
an
essential
law
enforcement
tool
the
courts
will
not
be
able
to
ignore
the
existence
of
these
sophisticated
technologies
in
order
for
law
enforcement
agencies
to
fully
integrate
this
technology
into
their
daily
policing
strategies
and
avoid
running
afoul
of
the
fourth
amendment
these
agencies
need
guidance
from
the
courts
moreover
as
law
enforcement
begins
to
increasingly
rely
on
this
technology
americans
will
expect
courts
to
integrate
the
statistical
outputs
from
these

into
their
reasoning
to
ensure
that

are
protected
thus

this
area
n
for
example
the
fbi
already
uses
the
information
it
gathers
to
generate
reports
that
american
law
enforcement
agencies
can
use
to
guide
their
crime
fighting
strategies
in
areas
as
diverse
as
terrorism
and
white
collar
crime
n
because
the
fbi
has
the
capacity
to
serve
as
a
clearinghouse
for
information
it
is
well
suited
to
develop
best
practices
for
collecting
and
analyzing
data
second
providing
oversight
and
establishing
best
practices
for
the
use
of
predictive
policing
technologies
in
municipal
police
departments
aligns
with
both
the
fbi
s
mission
and
its
goal
of
combating
public
corruption
and
protecting
civil
rights
n
the
fbi
s
mission
is
to
uphold
and
enforce
the
criminal
laws
of
the
united

and
to
provide
leadership
and
criminal
justice
services
to
federal
state
municipal
and
international
agencies
and
partners
n
requiring
the
fbi
to
develop
mandatory
uniform
standards
will
help
the
fbi
further
its
mission
because
the
bureau
will
lead
the
way
by
developing
fair
and
appropriate
technology
based
policing
strategies
moreover
the
fbi
will
further
its
goals
of
combating
public
corruption
and
protecting
civil

by
helping
local
law
enforcement
agencies
understand
the
limitations
of
these

n
creating
data
neutral
policies
for
local
law

to
follow
will
minimize
the
risk
of
unreliable
and

and
help
safeguard
americans
fourth
amendment
protections
third
the
fbi
is
well
equipped
to
provide
neutral
third
party
oversight
because
the
agency
has
an
extensive
and
reputable
community
outreach
program
n
over
time
the
bureau
has
formed
many
successful
partnerships
with
law
enforcement
agencies
in
the
united
states
and
around
the
globe
n
the
fbi
often
calls
upon
former
graduates
of
its
national
academy
to
help
train
police
officers
and
build
interagency
relationships
to
increase
the
effectiveness
of
law
enforcement
operations
n
thus
the
fbi
is
already
a
well
established
and
well
respected
organization
capable
of
working
in
unison
with
the
agencies
around
the
country
to
develop
mandatory
standards
and
best
practices
to
ensure
the
responsible
use
of
predictive
policing
technology
b
establish
mandatory
uniform
standards
and
oversight
to
ensure
fairness
accuracy
reliability
and
transparency
establishing
mandatory
uniform
standards
that
guide
how
data
is
collected
and
entered
into
predictive
policing
programs
provide
for
routine
audits
of
local
law
enforcement
s
predictive
policing
systems
and
guide
how
algorithms
are
written
will
significantly
decrease
potential
risks
associated
with
human
fallibility
in
big
data
collection
n
having
the
fbi
implement
uniform
standards
will
help
safeguard
against
blind
reliance
on
the
forecast
divorced
from
the
reason
for
the
forecast
n
in
police
departments
use
of
predictive
policing
technologies
first
new
mandatory
standards
should
prescribe
procedures
that
ensure
data
is
systematically
gathered
and
entered
into
the
software
on
a
regular
basis
developing
a
uniform
system
for
data
collection
and
entry
will
reinforce
the
accuracy
of
the
system
s
algorithms
maximize
their
objective
predictive
utility
and
help
guard
against
human
bias
after
all
if
the
data
collection
recording
analysis
or
retention
is
flawed
then
the
entire
system
is
called
into
question
n
second
when
developing
these
standards
the
fbi
should
require
police
departments
to
provide
mandatory
predictive
policing
training
to
their
staff
during
this
training
law
enforcement
agencies
would
describe
permissible
methods
for
data
collection
the
limitations
of
this
technology
as
a
crime
fighting
tool
and
the
constitutional
concerns
triggered
by
the
use
of
this
technology
the
fbi
should
also
provide
third
party
oversight
by
conducting
routine
audits
of
predictive
policing
systems
during
these
audits
the
fbi
can
ensure
that
local
police
departments
comply
with
its
mandatory
standards
for
training
data
collection
and
analysis
by
auditing
these
systems
the
fbi
can
effectively
allay
concerns
about
human
manipulation
of
crime
data
n
third
fbi
oversight
is
needed
to
validate
and
test
algorithms
of
predictive
policing
software
requiring
neutral
third
party
testing
of
these
algorithms
ensures
that
they
paint
an
unbiased
picture
of
criminal
activity
and
do
not
create
self
fulfilling
prophecies
of
bias
against
any
demographic
or
geographic
location
n
recently
the
need
for
third
party
monitoring
of
police
practices
to
protect
civil
liberties
was
recognized
in
floyd
v
city
of
new
york
where
the
nypd
was
accused
of
abusing
its
power
to
stop
and
frisk
n
although
floyd
s
procedural
history
led
to
debate
about
the
validity
of
the
court
s
decision
n
the
nypd
consented
to
adhere
to
some
of
judge
scheindlin
s
holdings
primarily
the
nypd
consented
to
allow
third
party
oversight
of
its
aggressive
stop
and
frisk
program
which
led
to
a
disproportionate
number
of
stop
and
frisks
taking
place
in
black
and
latino
neighborhoods
n
similar
to
the
nypd
s
stop
and
frisk
program
predictive
policing
algorithms
require
closer
inspection
when
law
enforcement
uses
predictive
policing
software
to
allocate
resources
civil
liberties
are
at
stake
because
inaccurate
data
collection
and
algorithms
can
lead
to
crime
forecasts
tainted
by
human
bias
in
order
to
avoid
abuses
of
police
power
law
enforcement
must
be
held
accountable
for
their
policing
strategies
especially
in
already
vulnerable
low
income
minority
communities
a
neutral
third
party
testing
requirement
would
also
help
legitimize
this
technology
and
make
judges
more
inclined
to
accept
the
statistical
outputs
from
these
programs
as
evidence
in
the
courtroom
using
the
fbi
as
the
gatekeeper
for
this
testing
would
be
particularly
advantageous
because
it
would
enable
private
companies
developing
proprietary
algorithms
to
maintain
their
trade
secrets
while
simultaneously
ensuring
that
the
quantitative
data
output
from
these
programs
is
reliable
additionally
requiring
mandatory
third
party
testing
and
validation
of
these
programs
will
enable
judges
to
rely
on
the
quantitative
data
presented
to
them
by
parties
in
a
courtroom
without
requiring
judges
to
act
as
statisticians
who
must
parse
complex
algorithms
or
evaluate
the
minutia
of
data
collection
techniques
in
this
scenario
judges
could
defer
to
a
sophisticated
neutral
party
s
opinion
about
the
validity
of
the
data
presented
and
focus
on
requiring
police
departments
to
define
high
crime
areas
with
increased
specificity
and
accuracy
moreover
requiring
police
departments
to
narrowly
define
high
crime
areas
is
no
herculean
task
a
lot
of
crime
data
is
readily
available
and
can
be
plugged
into
common
platforms
such
as
google
earth
thus
communities
need
not
even
rely
on
expensive
proprietary
predictive
policing
software
instead
they
can
use
these
rather
rudimentary
programs
to
track
various
types
of
crime
and
demonstrate
a
propensity
for
a
specific
type
of
crime
at
a
specific
location
c
courts
should
use
predictive
policing
technology
to
create
narrow
definitions
of
high
crime
areas
based
on
both
geography
and
crime
type
neutral
third
party
oversight
can
bolster
the
legitimacy
of
predictive
policing
software
and
transform
how
judges
evaluate
high
crime
classifications
at
evidence
suppression
hearings
across
the
united
states
n
as
the
use
of
this
technology
becomes
a
ubiquitous
part
of
policing
and
standards
are
implemented
to
ensure
data
reliability
judges
should
create
narrowly
defined
high
crime
area
designations
based
on
not
only
geographic
location
but
crime
type
as
well
judges
should
require
law
enforcement
agencies
and
prosecutors
to
present
quantitative
data
to
demonstrate
that
an
area
labeled
as
high
crime
is
in
fact
high
crime
law
enforcement
agencies
will
likely
claim
that
procuring
and
preserving
the
quantitative
data
an
officer
used
to
justify
a
finding
of
reasonable
suspicion
is
too
burdensome
of
a
responsibility
however
this
is
not
the
case
technological
advancements
in
the
united
states
have
created
an
overarching
public
expectation
of
transparency
in
government
n
and
have
made
it
easier
for
government
agencies
to
preserve
data
in
order
to
safeguard
this
transparency
many
americans
believe
that
government
agencies
have
an
institutional
responsibility
to
preserve
data
that
is
critical
to
maintaining
this
transparency
n
the
widespread
growth
of
cloud
computing
has
made
it
easy
for
government
agencies
to
store
vast
quantities
of
data
without
overburdening
their
resources
n
and
fulfill
the
public
s
expectations
for
government
transparency
as
explained
in
part
i
predictive
policing
technologies
have
the
capability
of
not
only
forecasting
where
crime
will
occur
on
a
micro
scale
of
a
foot
radius
but
can
also
predict
the
specific
types
of
crime
that
are
likely
to
occur
at
a
given
location
in
a
community
n
therefore
predictive
policing
software
has
the
capability
of
meaningfully
defining
high
crime
areas
based
on
both
geographic
location
and
crime
type
harnessing
the
full
technological
capabilities
of
this
software
enables
law
enforcement
agencies
to
eliminate
the
vague
and
generic
high
crime
area
label
existing
vague
high
crime
area
definitions
can
be
replaced
by
specific
classifications
of
criminal
activity
such
as
designating
a
location
as
a
high
brown
heroin
drug
trafficking
area
or
high
residential
robbery
area
using
these
crime
specific
classifications
will
help
restore
individuals
fourth
amendment
protections
in
communities
that
were
historically
characterized
as
high
crime
under
wardlow
s
vague
and
overbroad
standard
n
narrowly
defining
crime
areas
can
help
restore
fourth
amendment
protections
by
tightening
the
required
nexus
between
direct
observation
of
suspicious
conduct
and
an
area
s
propensity
for
crime
tightening
this
nexus
will
make
police
officers
more
accountable
for
their
stop
and
frisk
activity
and
limit
the
role
that
a
person
s
presence
in
a
high
crime
area
can
play
when
searching
based
on
reasonable
suspicion
moreover
if
law
enforcement
wants
to
benefit
from
predictive
policing
technology
s
ability
to
predict
crime
in
a
foot
radius
then
law
enforcement
should
be
constrained
by
this
same
specificity
an
officer
should
be
required
to
use
the
same
level
of
specificity
to
prove
that
she
had
reasonable
suspicion
to
perform
a
terry
stop
of
a
suspect
in
an
area
alleged
to
have
a
high
propensity
for
a
specific
crime
type
finally
because
predictive
policing
technology
is
more
objective
than
a
patrol
officer
s
hunch
about
an
area
n
and
harnesses
the
power
of
big
data
to
find
patterns
of
criminal
activity
based
on
statistical
algorithms
judges
should
place
the
burden
on
law
enforcement
agencies
and
prosecutors
to
present
quantitative
data
supporting
their
high
crime
designation
law
enforcement
agencies
and
prosecutors
should
carry
the
burden
of
demonstrating
that
the
data
relied
upon
reflects
a
high
crime
rate
for
the
specific
type
of
criminal
activity
the
police
officer
suspected
was
afoot
for
example
if
we
applied
the
facts
of
terry
v
ohio
to
a
community
using
predictive
policing
software
under
this
proposed
model
would
the
court
still
find
that
officer
mcfadden
the
officer
in
terry
had
the
requisite
reasonable
suspicion
to
perform
a
stop
and
frisk
n
officer
mcfadden
could
meet
the
threshold
requirement
for
particularized
suspicion
because
he
watched
the
suspects
walk
back
and
forth
past
the
jewelry
store
alone
dozens
of
time
and
each
time
stopping
to
peer
in
the
window
n
however
officer
mcfadden
s
finding
of
reasonable
suspicion
could
be
further
bolstered
if
ten
minutes
before
seeing
the
two
suspects
walking
by
the
jewelry
store
the
predictive
policing
software
installed
in
his
patrol
car
corroborated
his
belief
that
the
neighborhood
had
a
high
propensity
for
non
residential
burglary
n
although
the
facts
of
terry
are
straightforward
because
of
the

repetitive
behavior
this
example
demonstrates
how
a
court
could
use

as

tool
to
decide

n
text
introduction
the
fourth
amendment
requires
reasonable
suspicion
to
stop
a
suspect
n
as
a
general
matter
police
officers
develop
this
suspicion
based
on
information
they
know
or
activities
they
observe
suspicion
is
individualized
to
a
particular
person
at
a
particular
place
n
most
reasonable
suspicion
cases
involve
police
confronting
unknown
suspects
engaged
in
observable
suspicious
activities
n
essentially
the
reasonable
suspicion
doctrine
is
based
on
small
data
discrete
facts
limited
information
and
little
knowledge
about
the
suspect
n
but
what
happens
if
this
small
data
suspicion
is
replaced
by
big
data
suspicion
n
what
if
police
can
know
personal
information
about
the
suspect
by
searching
vast
networked
information
sources
the
rise
of
big
data
technologies
offers
a
challenge
to
the
traditional
paradigm
of
fourth
amendment
law
with
little
effort
officers
can
now
identify
most
unknown
suspects
not
through
their
observations
but
by
accessing
a
web
of
information
containing
extensive
personal
data
about
suspects
n
new
data
sources
including
law
enforcement
databases
third
party
records
and
predictive
analytics
combined
with
biometric
or
facial
recognition
software
allow
officers
access
to
information
with
just
a
few
search
queries
n
at
some
point
inferences
from
this
personal
data
independent
of
the
observation
may
become
sufficiently
individualized
and
predictive
to
justify
the
seizure
of
a
suspect
the
question
this
article
poses
is
whether
a
fourth
amendment
stop
can
be
predicated
on
the
aggregation
of
specific
and
individualized
but
otherwise
noncriminal
factors
for
example
suppose
police
are
investigating
a
series
of
robberies
in
a
particular
neighborhood
arrest
photos
from
a
computerized
database
are
uploaded
in
patrol
cars
facial
recognition
software
scans
people
on
the
street
n
suddenly
there
is
a
match
police
recognize
a
known
robber
in
the
targeted
neighborhood
the
suspect
s
personal
information
scrolls
across
the
patrol
car
s
computer
screen
prior
robbery
arrests
prior
robbery
convictions
and
a
list
of
criminal
associates
also
involved
in
robberies
n
the
officer
then
searches
additional
sources
of
third
party
data
including
the
suspect
s
gps
location
information
for
the
last
six
hours
or
license
plate
records
which
tie
the
suspect
to
pawn
shop
trades
close
in
time
to
prior
robberies
n
the
police
now
have
particularized
individualized
suspicion
about
a
man
who
is
not
doing
anything
overtly
criminal
or
perhaps
predictive
software
has
already
identified
the
man
as
a
potential
reoffender
for
this
particular
type
of
crime
n
or
perhaps
software
has
flagged
the
suspect
s
social
media
comments
or
other
internet
postings
that
suggest
planned
criminal
or
gang
activity
n
can
this
aggregation
of
individualized
information
be
sufficient
to
justify
interfering
with
a
person
s
constitutional
liberty
this
article
traces
the
consequences
of
a
shift
from
small
data
reasonable
suspicion
focused
on
specific
observable
actions
of
unknown
suspects
to
a
big
data
reality
of
an
interconnected
information
rich
world
of
known
suspects
with
more
specific
information
police
officers
on
the
streets
may
have
a
stronger
predictive
sense
about
the
likelihood
that
they
are
observing
criminal
activity
n
this
evolution
however
only
hints
at
the
promise
of
big
data
policing
the
next
phase
will
use
existing
predictive
analytics
to
target
suspects
without
any
firsthand
observation
of
criminal
activity
relying
instead
on
the
accumulation
of
various
data
points
n
unknown
suspects
will
become
known
to
police
because
of
the
data
left
behind
n
software
will
use
pattern
matching
techniques
n
to
identify
individuals
by
sorting
through
information
about
millions
of
people
contained
in
networked
databases
this
new
reality
simultaneously
undermines
the
protection
that
reasonable
suspicion
provides
against
police
stops
and
potentially
transforms
reasonable
suspicion
into
a
means
of
justifying
those
same
stops
this
article
seeks
to
offer
three
contributions
to
the
development
of
fourth
amendment
theory
first
it
demonstrates
that
reasonable
suspicion
as
a
small
data
doctrine
may
become
practically
irrelevant
in
an
era
of
big
data
policing
second
it
examines
the
distortions
of
big
data
on
police
observation
investigation
and
prediction
concluding
that
big
data
information
will
impact
all
major
aspects
of
traditional
policing
third
it
seeks
to
offer
a
solution
to
potential
problems
using
the
insights
and
value
of
big
data
itself
to
strengthen
the
existing
reasonable
suspicion
standard
part
i
of
this
article
examines
the
development
of
fourth
amendment
law
on
reasonable
suspicion
much
of
this
case
law
involves
unknown
suspects
such
as
when
a
police
officer
sees
an
individual
on
the
street
but
does
not
know
his
or
her
identity
in
these
cases
reasonable
suspicion
necessarily
derives
from
the
suspect
s
observable
actions
most
fourth
amendment
cases
involving
police
citizen
encounters
are
of
this
stranger
variety
n
thus
the
reasonable
suspicion
test
as
it
evolved
required
the
police
officer
to
articulate
individualized
particularized
suspicion
to
distinguish
a
stranger
s
suspicious
actions
from
non
suspicious
actions
n
the
resulting
doctrine
created
around
actions
not
individuals
makes
sense
within
the
context
it
arose
as
presumably
most
officers
would
not
know
all
of
the
potential
criminals
in
their
patrol
areas
n
the
resulting
reasonable
suspicion
test
however
becomes
significantly
distorted
when
officers
have
access
to
more
individualized
or
predictive
information
about
a
suspect
part
ii
of
this
article
addresses
the
rise
of
big
data
in
criminal
law
enforcement
law
enforcement
organizations
are
working
to
grow
the
scope
sophistication
and
detail
of
their
databases
n
agencies
and
their
officers
may
now
search
national
databases
and
gain
instant
access
to
the
information
n
indeed
data
is
the
new
watchword
in
many
smart
policing
districts
n
crimes
are
recorded
n
criminals
are
cataloged
n
some
jurisdictions
record
data
about
every
police
citizen
encounter
making
both
the
person
and
justification
for
the
stop
not
necessarily
even
an
arrest
instantly
available
to
any
officer
n
some
jurisdictions
have
compiled
bad
guy
lists
identifying
suspects
in
a
neighborhood
based
on
computer
analysis
of
past
actions
and
arrests
n
in
addition
law
enforcement
agencies
increasingly
rely
on
predictive
algorithms
to
forecast
individual
recidivism
and
areas
of
likely
criminal
activity
n
just
as
law
enforcement
agencies
now
collect
and
electronically
analyze
more
personal
data
so
do
private
third
party
organizations
n
these
third
party
entities
are
a
familiar
part
of
our
daily
lives
smartphones
record
where
we
go
n
credit
card
companies
record
what
we
buy
and
banks
chronicle
what
we
spend
n
onstar
systems
in
cars
catalog
where
and
how
fast
we
drive
n
phone
records
reflect
our
contacts
and
communications
n
internet
searches
reveal
what
we
read
and
expose
our
interests
n
social
media
sites
such
as
twitter
and
facebook
even
disclose
what
we
think
n
currently
law
enforcement
officers
may
access
many
of
these
records
without
violating
the
fourth
amendment
under
the
theory
that
there
is
no
reasonable
expectation
of
privacy
in
information
knowingly
revealed
to
third
parties
n
while
certain
statutory
protections
exist
most
statutes
include
law
enforcement
exceptions
n
and
in
any
case
these
private
commercial
data
aggregators
have
turned
personal
data
into
a
commodity
available
for
purchase
and
analysis
to
anyone
willing
to
pay
n
the
rise
of
big
data
means
that
this
information
is
potentially
available
for
use
by
law
enforcement
in
the
same
way
that
a
drug
store
can
predict
that
you
will
need
a
coupon
this
month
because
you
bought
a
similar
product
last
month
n
the
police
will
be
able
to
anticipate
that
you
will
be
selling
drugs
this
week
because
you
purchased
an
unusual
number
of
mini
plastic
bags
last
week
n
neither
prediction
is
necessarily
accurate
but
both
are
based
on
individualized
and
particularized
data
that
makes
the
prediction
more
likely
part
iii
analyzes
the
intersection
of
big
data
and
the
current
fourth
amendment
framework
the
wrinkle
of
big
data
is
that
now
officers
are
no
longer
dealing
with
strangers
even
people
unknown
to
officers
can
be
identified
and
with
a
few
quick
searches
revealed
as
a
person
with
recognizable
characteristics
or
about
whom
certain
predictions
can
be
made
n
if

view
those
individualized
and
particularized
identifying
characteristics
such
as
prior
convictions
gang
associations
and
gps
coordinates
near
the
scene
of
the
crime
as
suspicious
then
otherwise
innocent
actions
might
create
a
predictive
composite
that
satisfies
the
reasonable
suspicion
standard
in
essence
reasonable
suspicion
will
focus
more
on
an
individual
s
predictive
likelihood
of
involvement
in
criminal
activity
than
on
an
individual
s
actions
part
iii
then
looks
at
fourth
amendment
reasonable
suspicion
through
three
different
lenses
situations
involving
officers
observing
an
ongoing
crime
situations
involving
officers
investigating
a
past
crime
and
situations
involving
officers
predicting
a
future
crime
big
data
affects
the
analysis
in
each
application
distorting
the
reasonable
suspicion
standard
knowing
who
the
suspect
is
and
having
more
information
even
innocent
information
will
allow
officers
to
meet
the
reasonable
suspicion
threshold
more
easily
because
the
information
will
be
sufficiently
individualized
and
particularized
part
iv
assesses
this
new
technological
reality
can
the
current
reasonable
suspicion
doctrine
adapt
should
it
what
are
the
possible
benefits
or
dangers
of
big
data
reasonable
suspicion
using
big
data
may
help
reduce
the
negative
consequences
of
traditional
policing
techniques
but
at
the
same
time
may
create
a
whole
new
set
of
concerns
this
section
evaluates
the
tradeoffs
of
big
data
as
applied
to
the
fourth
amendment
part
v
offers
a
few
solutions
to
the
problem
presented
by
the
big
data
distortions
of
fourth
amendment
doctrine
this
article
suggests
that
the
nature
of
big
data
itself
might
provide
a
means
of
strengthening
the
reasonable
suspicion
standard
if
big
data
resources
are
used
to
tip
the
scales
of
reasonable
suspicion
in
favor
of
law
enforcement
then
courts
should
require
a
higher
level
of
detail
and
correlation
using
the
insights
and
capabilities
of
big
data
this
requirement
would
involve
precise
statistical
analysis
geospatial
analysis
temporal
analysis
and
link
analysis
of
the
data
big
data
can
provide
information
about
a
person
on
a
generalized
or
granular
scale
and
the
latter
should
be
required
the
power
of
big
data
allows
investigators
to
go
deep
into
the
data
and
make
sure
that
the
information
is
as
tightly
correlated
as
possible
in
this
way
a
big
data
infused
reasonable
suspicion
standard
will
do
what
the
reasonable
suspicion
requirement
was
always
supposed
to
do
distinguish
the
criminal
from
the
noncriminal
in
a
manner
that
balances
the
need
for
effective
law
enforcement
with
a
measure
of
personal
liberty
i
reasonable
suspicion
a
small
data
doctrine
the
fourth
amendment
serves
as
a
constitutional
barrier
protecting
individuals
from
unreasonable
police
intrusion
n
on
the
street
the
police
may
not
constitutionally
stop
seize
or
search
individuals
without
the
requisite
legal
justification
n
to
seize
a
person
temporarily
a
police
officer
must
have
reasonable
suspicion
that
the
individual
is
committing
is
about
to
commit
or
has
committed
a
crime
n
the
reasonable
suspicion
standard
first
arose
in
terry
v
ohio
when
the
supreme
court
created
a
new
threshold
for
fourth
amendment
suspicion
lower
than
probable
cause
to
justify
a
brief
detention
n
in
terry
detective
martin
mcfadden
observed
three
unknown
men
walking
back
and
forth
in
front
of
a
downtown
store
n
mcfadden
an
experienced
police
officer
while
not
knowing
the
men
involved
believed
their
actions
were
consistent
with
the
actions
of
individuals
seeking
to
rob
a
store
n
based
on
this
suspicion
mcfadden
stopped
the
individuals
n
in
the
process
of
frisking
them
mcfadden
recovered
unlawful
firearms
n
possession
of
these
firearms
served
as
the
basis
for
the
arrest
conviction
and
later
appeal
of
the
constitutionality
of
the
initial
stop
and
frisk
n
in
finding
the
stop
permissible
the
court
established
a
new
fourth
amendment
standard
for
investigatory
stops
requiring
that
police
be
able
to
point
to
specific
and
articulable
facts
which
taken
together
with
rational
inferences
from
those
facts
reasonably
warrant
the
intrusion
n
terry
mirrors
a
common
factual
situation
that
recurs
millions
of
times
a
year
across
the
country
officers
on
the
street
observe
a
particular
suspect
or
group
of
suspects
because
police
officers
do
not
know
all
of
the
suspects
in
a
jurisdiction
personally
the
officers
must
focus
on
the
suspect
s
actions
and
on
the
inferences
that
can
be
drawn
from
those
actions
the
amount
of
information
an
officer
knows
about
the
suspect
is
necessarily
limited
like
detective
mcfadden
in
terry
officers
are
usually
limited
to
evaluating
observed
actions
through
intuition
this
practice
epitomizes
small
data
policing
suspicion
generated
by
information
discrete
in
amount
fixed
in
time
and
isolated
in
context
thus
the
predictive
judgments
made
about
the
suspect
are
similarly
limited
and
disconnected
from
other
data
sources
this
part
discusses
how
reasonable
suspicion
has
developed
as
a
small
data
doctrine
the
language
the
supreme
court
used
to
define
reasonable
suspicion
the
standard
s
application
in
a
variety
of
contexts
and
the
law
s
assumption
of
unknown
suspects
and
direct
observations
all
speak
to
the
doctrine
s
utility
in
certain
situations
in
general
the
archetypical
reasonable
suspicion
setting
involves
police
officers
reacting
to
a
quickly
unfolding
criminal
situation
with
unknown
suspects
and
without
the
time
or
resources
to
find
more
information
the
fourth
amendment
calculus
though
changes
when
officers
have
access
to
personal
data
about
the
suspects
specifically
law
enforcement
officers
can
more
easily
satisfy
the
reasonable
suspicion
standard
when
a
third
party
provides
some
minimal
information
about
an
otherwise
unknown
suspect
already
the
reasonable
suspicion
standard
provides
little
protection
in
situations
involving
suspects
previously
known
to
police
this
reality
illustrates
one
of
the
many
shortcomings
of
a
small
data
doctrine
specific
and
particularized
data
about
a
suspect
even
if
not
specific
and
particularized
about
a
crime
tends
in
practice
to
reduce
the
protection
of
the
reasonable
suspicion
standard
because
the
police
can
obtain
information
about
a
suspect
more
easily
in
a
world
of
big
data
this
doctrinal
weakness
points
to
a
problem
in
the
protective
scope
of
current
fourth
amendment
law
a
the
reasonable
suspicion
standard
despite
the
common
application
of
the
reasonable
suspicion
language
in
tens
of
thousands
of
federal
and
state
court
cases
the
contours
of
the
standard
remain
ill
defined
n
cases
from
terry
to
the
present
day
emphasize
that
suspicion
must
be
based
on
specific
and
articulable
facts
n
those
facts
must
be
objective
n
suspicion
must
be
particularized
n
it
must
relate
to
criminal
activity
not
just
to
the
criminal
n
officers
must
have
reasonable
suspicion
before
the
stop
occurs
retroactive
justification
is
not
sufficient
n
the
suspicion
must
relate
to
current
criminal
activity
n
with
some
latitude
for
post
crime
investigative
actions
n
and
pre
crime
intervention
n
courts
evaluate
these
suspicious
facts
under
the
totality
of
circumstances
test
which
means
that
all
relevant
factors
should
be
considered
n
the
content
and
the
quality
of
the
information
are
both
relevant
considerations
n
but
courts
have
not
settled
on
a
required
quantum
of
proof
n
innocent
factors
characteristics
about
an
area
and
specialized
law
enforcement
training
are
all
factors
that
shape
the
totality
of
the
circumstances
n
the
result
has
been
a
standard
which
retains
the
virtue
of
flexibility
and
the
vice
of
malleability
as
the
supreme
court
has
explained
reasonable
suspicion
involves
commonsense
nontechnical
conceptions
that
deal
with
the
factual
and
practical
considerations
of
everyday
life
on
which
reasonable
and
prudent
men
not
legal
technicians
act
n
scholars
have
been
less
charitable
critiquing
the
standard
as
being
at
best
meaningless
and
at
worst
discriminatory
n
at
a
minimum
the
reasonable
suspicion
standard
requires
police
to
articulate
why
an
individual
was
stopped
which
may
reduce
overly
arbitrary
or
animus
based
stops
the
standard
while
applicable
in
many
situations
makes
the
most
sense
for
unknown
suspect
cases
the
requirement
of
specific
particularized
objective
facts
seeks
to
distinguish
by
their
observable
actions
those
individuals
who
have
done
nothing
wrong
from
those
who
have
done
something
wrong
detective
mcfadden

mr
terry
not
because
he
recognized
mr

as
a

because
there

but
because
of
the

in

this
section
traces
how
an
officer
s
knowledge
about
a
suspect
influences
the
reasonable
suspicion
analysis
as
discussed
below
the
more
data
known
or
discovered
about
a
particular
suspect
the
easier
it
is
to
justify
a
stop
based
on
reasonable
suspicion
this
result
is
not
necessarily
negative
or
surprising
as
more
information
connecting
a
suspect
to
a
crime
increases
the
likelihood
that
the
suspect
was
involved
it
does
however
show
how
the
aggregation
of
information
even
innocent
information
can
shift
the
balance
within
a
fluid
legal
standard
unknown
suspect
cases
perhaps
not
surprisingly
many
fourth
amendment
reasonable
suspicion
cases
have
followed
the
terry
small
data
model
n
such
cases
involve
officers
observing
unknown
suspects
n
engaged
in
what
officers
believe
to
be
suspicious
activity
these
encounters
regularly
occur
on
the
street

and
as
part
of

that
lead
to

of

on
speculations
about
the
criminal
nature
of
the
actions
involved
independent
of
the
person
because
the
actor
s
identity
is
unknown
in
determining
reasonable
suspicion
a
court
will
evaluate
whether
the
officer
s
observations
were
objectively
reasonable
to
warrant
the
stop
sibron
v
new
york
is
a
useful
example
of
the
application
of
the
reasonable
suspicion
standard
with
respect
to
unknown
suspects
n
in
sibron
a
case
decided
the
same
day
as
terry
v
ohio
an
officer
observed
an
unknown
suspect
in
a
series
of
meetings
with
known
narcotics
addicts
for
approximately
eight
hours
n
the
police
officer
did
not
know
sibron
personally
and
could
not
overhear
any
of
the
conversations
n
yet
after
observing
sibron
communicate
with
nine
to
eleven
known
addicts
over
the
course
of
the
day
the
officer
concluded
that
he
had
observed
a
series
of
drug
transactions
the
officer
then
approached
sibron
and
searched
his
pockets
recovering
heroin
n
the
supreme
court
held
that
sibron
s
activity
did
not
create
reasonable
suspicion
n
the
officer
did
not
see
any
drug
transactions
did
not
know
the
subject
of
the
conversations
and
accordingly
did
not
have
the
requisite
suspicion
to
justify
the
search
under
the
fourth
amendment
n
while
sibron
might
be
decided
differently
today
the
court
it
should
be
noted
here
determined
that
the
officer
lacked
reasonable
suspicion
because
the
officer
had
no
information
about
sibron
that
gave
rise
to
the
inference
of
criminal
activity
merely
associating
with
addicts
was
not
a
crime
in
both
terry
and
sibron
officers
did
not
know
the
suspect
but
instead
inferred
from
the
unknown
suspect
s
actions
that
criminal
activity
was
afoot
n
in
both
cases
officers
based
their
predictive
judgments
on
limited
data
points
which
were
disconnected
from
larger
information
sources
about
the
suspect
while
the
supreme
court
came
to
different
conclusions
in
terry
and
sibron
about
whether
the
police
had
reasonable
suspicion
it
reached
both
outcomes
based
solely
on
the
facts
observed
by
the
officers
this
reality
has
been
repeated
in
hundreds
of
cases
since
then
some
information
on
the
suspect
a
slight
wrinkle
to
the
classic
unknown
suspect
case
involves
situations
in
which
some
minimal
information
is
provided
about
an
otherwise
unknown
suspect
informant

police
tips
or
further
police
investigation
can
alter
the
reasonable
suspicion
analysis
n
that
is
the
likelihood
that
a
court
will
find
reasonable
suspicion
increases
proportionally
to
the
amount
of
personal
data
the
police
officer
has
about
the
suspect
in
florida
v
j
l
an
anonymous
caller
reported
to
the
miami
dade
police
that
a
young
black
male
standing
at

particular
bus
stop

plaid

found
a
gun
on
j
l
and
arrested
him
n
in
determining
whether
this
anonymous
tip
was
sufficient
to
justify
the
stop
the
court
held
that
such
a
bare
tip
without
either
identifying
information
about
the
suspect
or
predictive
details
corroborated
by
observation
was
insufficient
for
reasonable
suspicion
n
there
was
no
identifying
or
predictive
information
involved
the
only
data
point
was
an
anonymous
accusation
without
context
or
verifiability
in
alabama
v
white
by
contrast
the
supreme
court
found
that
a
tip
including
the
suspect
s
name
location
and
predicted
route
of
travel
was
sufficient
to
establish
reasonable
suspicion
n
in
white
the
anonymous
tipster
claimed
that
the
suspect
would
be
leaving
c
lynwood
terrace
apartments
at
a
particular
time
in
a
brown
plymouth
station
wagon
with
the
right
taillight
lens
broken
that
she
would
be
going
to

and
that
she
would
be
in

about
an
ounce
of
cocaine
inside
a

attache
case

the
police
followed
the
suspect
as
she
left
the
motel
in
a
plymouth
station
wagon
stopped
her
and
requested
to
search
her
car
n
she
consented
and
police
recovered
marijuana
n
the
court
held
that
in
this
situation
the
stop
was
justified
by
reasonable
suspicion
n
the
differences
between
white
and
j
l
are
slight
but
revealing
a
more
descriptive
account
of
the
suspect
and
corroborated
predictive
detail
changed
an
insufficient
anonymous
tip
into
constitutionally
sufficient
reasonable
suspicion
n
note
however
that
many
of
the
same
concerns
that
caused
the
court
to
find
no
reasonable
suspicion
in
j
l
were
still
present
in
white
an
anonymous
tip
revealing
a
single
and
obvious
pattern
of
movement
does
not
provide
much
proof
of
insider
knowledge
most
individuals
drive
a
particular
type
of
car
and
follow
a
predictable
routine
in
parts
of
daily
life
e
g
driving
to
work
to
daycare
to
the
gym
to
the
local
coffee
shop
yet
the
court
still
found
the
additional
individualized
information
about
the
suspect
sufficient
for
reasonable
suspicion
n
the
supreme
court
s
first
transition
to
a
medium
data
case
occurred
in
ornelas
v
united
states
n
in
ornelas
officers
developed
reasonable
suspicion
by
proactively
searching
for
data
to
support
their
hunch
n
the
case
involved
a
milwaukee
detective
who
observed
a
suspicious
car
parked
at
a
local
motel
n
the
car
was
purportedly
suspicious
because
it
was
a
make
and
model
frequently
used
by
drug
dealers
a
two
door
oldsmobile
n
not
having
any
information
about
the
owner
of
the
oldsmobile
the
detective
radioed
his
dispatcher
and
found
the
car
was
registered
under
ornelas
s
name
n
a
further
inquiry
with
the
local
office
of
the
drug
enforcement
administration
revealed
that
ornelas
s
name
appeared
in
a
federal
database
of
known
and
suspected
drug
traffickers
the
narcotics
and
dangerous
drugs
information
system
naddis
n
with
this
additional
information
which
would
otherwise
have
been
unknown
the
detective
stopped
ornelas
and
another
man
when
they
exited
the
motel
and
entered
the
car
the
underlying
constitutional
issue
in
the
case
was
whether
the
information
connecting
the
car
the
name
and
the
criminal
database
was
sufficient
to
create
reasonable
suspicion
n
while
the
supreme
court
deferred
answering
the
fourth
amendment
question
focusing
instead
on
the
appropriate
standard
of
appellate
review
the
trial
court
both
initially
and
on
remand
found
that
the
information
together
was
sufficient
cause
for
reasonable
suspicion
n
note
though
that
ornelas
s
actions
were
not
suspicious
at
all
he
parked
overnight
at
a
motel
and
then
exited
the
motel
and
got
into
his
car
what
created
the
suspicion
was
independent
data
about
ornelas
himself
the
detective
by
searching
for
more
information
about
ornelas
discovered
personal
data
particularized
and
individualized
facts
to
support
his
suspicion
n
this
development
of
reasonable
suspicion
resulting
more
from
aggregated
information
about
a
suspect
and
less
from
the
actions
of
the
suspect
occurs
with
some
regularity
in
the
case
law
n
in
essence
courts
reason
that
the
tip
or
database
hit
provides
information
that
shifts
the
balance
toward
reasonable
suspicion
this
is
true
even
if
the
observable
innocent
actions
on
the
street
remain
the
same
known
suspects
the
third
situation
involves
known
suspects
stopped
by
police
because
of
their
identity
and
not
necessarily
because
of
any
observed
activities
the
supreme
court
has
not
directly
ruled
on
the
issue
but
united
states
v
hensley
provides
an
interesting
example
of
a
stop
based
solely
on
identity
n
hensley
involved
a
stop
based
on
a
wanted
flyer
for
a
suspect
in
an
armed
robbery
n
the
police
department
in
st
bernard
ohio
had
issued
a
flyer
identifying
mr
hensley
as
a
suspect
and
sent
it
to
surrounding
jurisdictions
n
the
flyer
did
not
indicate
that
the
police
had
a
warrant
for
mr
hensley
s
arrest
n
the
covington
police
department
located
in
neighboring
kentucky
received
the
flyer
and
its
officers
were
on
the
lookout
for
mr
hensley
n
based
on
the
wanted
flyer
covington
police
officers
stopped
mr
hensley
and
eventually
recovered
a
handgun
n
the
supreme
court
had
to
decide
whether
this
wanted
poster
identifying
mr
hensley
specifically
created
reasonable
suspicion
to
stop
hensley
in
its
discussion
the
court
noted
that
if
police
have
a
reasonable
suspicion
grounded
in
specific
and
articulable
facts
that
a
person
they
encounter
was
involved
in
or
is
wanted
in
connection
with
a
completed
felony
then
a
terry
stop
may
be
made
to
investigate
that
suspicion
n
the
principle
applies
even
if
another
jurisdiction
s
police
officers
generated
that
reasonable
suspicion
thus
the
covington
police
permissibly
relied
on
the
st
bernard
s
police
department
s
determination
of
reasonable
suspicion
hensley
shows
that
a
stop
can
be
based
simply
on
identifying
information
about
a
suspect
that
is
provided
to
police
in
hensley
the
arresting
officers
did
not
have
an
arrest
warrant
or
any
predictive
detail
about
hensley
s
future
actions
and
they
did
not
corroborate
any
of
the
allegations
of
criminal
activity
the
only
data
point
for
suspicion
was
hensley
s
identity
yet
the
court
nonetheless
held
that
if
information
about
an
identified
suspect
rises
to
the
level
of
reasonable
suspicion
a
stop
is
justified
n
because
police
collect
a
significant
amount
of
information
about
suspects
and
create
regular
target
lists
of
potential
suspects
this
type
of
stop
based
merely
on
identity
raises
serious
questions
hensley
also
substantially
broadened
the
application
of
the
reasonable
suspicion
standard
from
preventing
or
apprehending
ongoing
criminal
activity
to
investigating
it
after
the
fact
after
hensley
reasonable
suspicion
was
no
longer
limited
to
ongoing
criminal
action
but
could
be
used
to
justify
stops
to
investigate
completed
crimes
other
courts
have
been
even
more
explicit
that
prior
knowledge
of
the
suspect
can
factor
into
reasonable
suspicion
the
seventh
circuit
stated
that
knowledge
of
gang
association
and
recent
relevant
criminal
conduct
while
of
doubtful
evidentiary
value
in
view
of
the
strictures
against
proving
guilt
by
association
or
by
a
predisposition
based
on
past
criminal
acts
is
a
permissible
component
of
the
articulable
suspicion
required
for
a
terry
stop
n
courts
in
massachusetts
n
minnesota
n
and
hawaii
n
among
others
n
recognize
that
knowledge
of
a
defendant
s
criminal
history
can
factor
into
the
reasonable
suspicion
analysis
as
one
massachusetts
court
reasoned
the
officers
were
also
entitled
to
consider
their
personal
knowledge
of
the
defendant
including
the
fact
that
he
had
a
pending
court
case
involving
charges
of
firearm
possession
and
armed
assault
with
intent
to
murder
in
several
cases
this
court
has
allowed
police
knowledge
of
a
person
s
arrest
record
or
unspecified
criminal
record
to
be
considered
in
a
reasonable
suspicion
evaluation
n
of
course
courts
draw
a
line
between
using
prior
knowledge
about
a
suspect
to
justify
a
stop
and
using
prior
knowledge
as
one
factor
in
the
totality
of
the
circumstances
n
prior
knowledge
of
past
criminal
activity
alone
is
not
enough
to
stop
an
individual
n
as
one
court
stated
knowledge
of
a
person
s
prior
criminal
involvement
to
say
nothing
of
a
mere
arrest
is
alone
insufficient
to
give
rise
to
the
requisite
reasonable
suspicion
if
the
law
were
otherwise
any
person
with
any
sort
of
criminal
record
or
even
worse
a
person
with
arrests
but
no
convictions
could
be
subjected
to
a
terry
type
investigative
stop
by
a
law
enforcement
officer
at
any
time
without
the
need
for
any
other
justification
at
all
any
such
rule
would
clearly
run
counter
to
the
requirement
of
a
reasonable
suspicion
and
of
the
need
that
such
stops
be
justified
in
light
of
a
balancing
of
the
competing
interests
at
stake
n
thus
knowledge
about
the
suspect
cannot
alone
justify
a
stop
the
officer
s
knowledge
must
be
tied
to
a
suspected
criminal
activity
past
or
present
data
regarding
a
suspect
s
criminal
history
however
can
influence
the
officer
and
be
included
in
the
totality
of
the
circumstances
analysis
for
reasonable
suspicion
c
concluding
thoughts
fourth
amendment
case
law
suggests
that
personal
information
about
a
suspect
influences
the
reasonable
suspicion
analysis
even
if
the
suspect
s
actions
remain
the
same
when
data
about
the
suspect
corroborates
suspicion
from
observation
the
information
helps
the
officer
justify
his
or
her
suspicion
in
simple
terms
personal
data
provide
the
individualized
objective
facts
that
officers
need
to
articulate
their
suspicion
while
it
makes
intuitive
sense
that
information
about
a
suspect
in
connection
with
a
crime
can
help
provide
reasons
for
the
officer
s
suspicion
there
are
real
concerns
associated
with
this
increased
access
to
personal
information
first
the
personal
information
can
be
overbroad
in
ornelas
for
example
the
officer
s
suspicion
that
a
particular
car
was
connected
with
a
known
drug
dealer
did
not
alone
create
a
reasonable
suspicion
that
the
individual
possessed
drugs
at
the
time
n
the
actions
of
the
suspect
including
staying
overnight
at
a
motel
also
did
not
necessarily
suggest
drug
distribution
to
justify
the
stop
the
police
officer
considered
additional
data
points
in
his
calculus
but
the
data
themselves
did
not
meaningfully
relate
to
the
likelihood
of
criminal
activity
at
the
particular
time
second
the
personal
information
can
be
wrong
in
white
for
example
the
tipster
was
wrong
about
some
facts
including
the
type
of
narcotics
police
would
recover
from
the
suspect
n
third
the
personal
information
can
be
unreliable
after
hensley
police
generated
watchlists
can
be
used
to
justify
stops
of
individuals
as
these
lists
are
shared
nationally
there
is
no
guarantee
of
accuracy
or
any
mechanism
to
correct
mistakes
n
potential
clerical
errors
errors
in
judgment
and
a
lack
of
judicial
oversight
all
create
red
flags
for
this
broadening
of
factors
included
in
the
reasonable
suspicion
analysis
n
these
concerns
animate
the
discussion
about
how
new
data
sources
will
affect
the
reasonable
suspicion
doctrine
information
may
shape
reasonable
suspicion
but
as
developed
in
the
next
part
the
available
data
can
also
overwhelm
officers
and
interfere
with
the
determination
of
who
should
be
stopped
for
suspected
criminal
activity
ii
the
rise
of
big
data
policing
big
data
both
as
a
catchphrase
and
a
reality
is
transforming
the
world
n
this
part
outlines
the
growth
of
big
data
and
its
potential
impact
on
law
enforcement
practices
the
big
data
revolution
is
just
beginning
but
it
has
already
begun
influencing
how
police
identify
and
investigate
criminal
activity
big
data
will
affect
police
officers
on
the
streets
in
two
primary
ways
first
in
conjunction
with
facial
recognition
or
other
biometric
identification
technologies
n
unknown
suspects
can
be
known
not
simply
identified
by
name
but
revealed
through
a
web
of
facts
involving
criminal
records
personal
history
and
past
location
data
n
vast
troves
of
networked
data
can
provide
individualized
and
particularized
facts
from
which
to
form
suspicion
n
second
patterns
emerging
from
the
data
will
allow
individuals
to
be
identified
predictively
as
suspects
because
their
past
actions
generate
suspicion
about
future
criminal
involvement
n
law
enforcement
already
uses
predictive
policing
software
to
predict
areas
of
crime
but
big
data
will
soon
predict
actions
if
not
individuals
n
the
data
will
reveal
predictive
profiles
to
identify
those
believed
to
warrant
further
investigation
by
police
n
in
both
cases
the
growth
of
big
data
has
the
potential
to
change
the
reasonable
suspicion
calculus
because
more
personal
or
predictive
information
about
a
suspect
will
make
it
easier
for
police
to
justify
stopping
a
suspect
a
big
data
an
introduction
big
data
refers
to
the
accumulation
and
analysis
of
unusually
large
datasets
n
it
provides
a
shorthand
term
for
data
collection
in
a
variety
of
industries
and
settings
n
as
described
in
the
next
few
sections
this
collection
involves
a
network
of
sources
relying
heavily
on
a
host
of
consumer
social
media
and
law
enforcement
datasets
as
well
as
more
established
surveillance
and
tracking
technologies
n
in
their
book
on
big
data
viktor
mayer
schonberger
and
kenneth
cukier
define
big
data
in
two
ways
first
big
data
is
the
ability
of
society
to
harness
information
in
novel
ways
to
produce
useful
insights
or
goods
and
services
of
significant
value
n
second
they
write
that
big
data
refers
to
things
one
can
do
at
a
large
scale
that
cannot
be
done
at
a
smaller
one
to
extract
new
insights
or
create
new
forms
of
value
in
ways
that
change
markets
organizations
the
relationships
between
citizens
and
governments
and
more
n
jules
berman
describes
big
data
using
the
three
v
s
n
first
you
must
have
volume
large
amounts
of
data
n
second
you
must
have
variety
the
data
comes
in
different
forms
including
traditional
databases
images
documents
and
complex
records
n
third
you
must
have
velocity
the
content
of
the
data
is
constantly
changing
through
the
absorption
of
complementary
data
collections
through
the
introduction
of
previously
archived
data
or
legacy
collections
and
from
streamed
data
arriving
from
multiple
sources
n
to
understand
the
scope
of
the
growth
of
big
data
the
next
few
sections
will
outline
the
sources
volume
and
promise
of
big
data
technologies
with
a
focus
on
those
areas
most
useful
for
law
enforcement
b
the
growth
of
data
collection
in
many
ways
the
building
blocks
of
big
data
are
not
new
at
all
n
data
collection
has
been
increasing
for
the
last
few
decades
n
the
growth
in
the
volume
of
data
collected
the
ability
to
connect
previously
discrete
data
networks
and
the
analytical
capabilities
made
possible
by
faster
computer
processors
and
more
data
storage
capacity
however
are
new
developments
n
these
issues
will
be
addressed
in
turn
volume
of
data
the
volume
of
collected
data
is
growing
exponentially
the
data
surge
just
keeps
rising
doubling
in
volume
every
two
years
just
two
days
of
the
current
global
data
production
from
all
sources
five
quintillion
bytes
a
letter
of
text
equals
one
byte
is
about
equal
to
the
amount
of
information
created
by
all
the
world
s
conversations
ever
n
this
amount
of
information
is
hard
to
comprehend
in
the
amount
of
stored
information
in
the
world
was
estimated
to
be
around
exabytes
of
which
less
than
percent
is
non
digital
there
is
no
good
way
to
think
about
what
this
size
of
data
means
if
it
were
all
printed
in
books
they
would
cover
the
entire
surface
of
the
united
states
some
layers
thick
if
it
were
placed
on
cd
roms
and
stacked
up
they
would
stretch
to
the
moon
in
five
separate
piles
things
really
are
speeding
up
the
amount
of
stored
information
grows
four
times
faster
than
the
world
economy
while
the
processing
power
of
computers
grows
nine
times
faster
n
although
law
enforcement
may
not
use
all
of
this
electronic
data
much
of
it
nonetheless
reveals
information
about
individuals
that
simply
was
not
knowable
in
previous
generations
as
daniel
solove
has
observed
we
are
becoming
a
society
of
records
and
these
records
are
not
held
by
us
but
by
third
parties
n
digital
records
reveal
who
we
talk
to
where
we
go
and
what
we
purchase
they
give
insight
into
our
hobbies
our
financial
status
our
employment
and
our
criminal
histories
n
when
linked
together
these
disparate
data
points
can
create
a
revealing
composite
of
our
identity
and
when
accessible
by
the
government
they
can
serve
as
a
valuable
source
of
investigatory
power

it
s
almost
impossible
to
anonymize

networked
data
the
investigatory
utility
of
standalone
databases
improves
when
law
enforcement
agencies
and
private
companies
connect
those
databases
and
aggregate
their
data
indeed
linking
traditional
criminal
justice
data
with
private
data
provides
a
wealth
of
insights
about
a
person
n
in
recent
years
the
federal
government
created
two
such
networked
database
programs
but
eventually
discontinued
their
use
due
to
public
concerns
about
privacy
the
first
database
the
multi
state
anti
terrorism
information
exchange
program
matrix
included
a
networked
database
that
allowed
police
officers
to
check
a
broad
range
of
information
with
one
search
including
criminal
history
credit
information
driver
s
license
information
vehicle
registration
arrests
utility
connections
ucc
filings
concealed
weapons
permits
faa
aircraft
and
pilots
licenses
hunting
and
fishing
licenses
professional

and
voter
registration
records
n
as
the
electronic
privacy
information
center
argued
in
its
amicus
brief
in
hiibel
v
sixth
judicial
district
court
of
nevada
a
police
officer
using
the
matrix
system
could
develop
an
entire
profile
of
a
suspect
simply
by
running
a
name
in
the
database
during
a
routine
encounter
n
according
to
the
department
of
homeland
security
s
privacy
office
in
its
review
of
the
program
only
of
the
cases
investigated
over
the
course
of
the
matrix
pilot
project
were
related
to
terrorism
in
fact
the
matrix
project
was
predominantly
used
to
investigate
fraud
robbery
and
other
crimes
including
assault
homicide
and
narcotics
cases
underscoring
the
value
of
the
program
as
a
tool
for
traditional
law
enforcement
n
the
second
database
the
even
more
orwellian
sounding
total
information
awareness
system
was
designed
by
the
department
of
defense
to
fight
terrorism
by
linking
data
sources
into
one
searchable
national
information
collection
center
n
renamed
the
terrorism
information
awareness
system
n
this
program
had
several
components
all
designed
to
aggregate
available
information
for
predictive
surveillance
purposes
n
the
department
of
defense
reportedly
designed
the
program
to
connect
the
dots
in
an
attempt
to
avoid
repeating
the
missed
opportunities
to
intervene
before
the
terrorist
attacks
of
september
n
among
other
things
the
program
sought
to
create
predictive
risk
profiles
for
particular
citizens
based
on
the
available
data
n
while
these
two
programs
and
others
were
canceled
over
privacy
concerns
n
law
enforcement
and
private
companies
have
embraced
the
idea
of
networking
and
sharing
personal
information
first
the
federal
bureau
of
investigation
s
criminal
justice
information
services
division
coordinates
access
to
databases
that
include
public
and
private
sources
n
fbi
agents
and
analysts
regularly
access
these
databases
which
contain
hundreds
of
millions
of
records
n
law
enforcement
has
benefited
and
continues
to
benefit
from
the
growth
of
private
surveillance
collection
services
n
for
example
the
technology
that
ran
the
total
information
awareness
program
is
now
owned
by
lexisnexis
a
private
company
n
as
one
expert
has
written
the
private
sector
is
developing
domain
specific
technologies
that
is
applications
developed
specifically
for
law
enforcement
purposes
to
aggregate
and
mine
data
using
both
link
analysis
and
pattern
matching
in
criminal
investigations
and
these
technologies
are
already
being
adopted
and
employed
in
a
variety
of
law
enforcement
environments
n
police
thus
can
and
do
request
information
from
third
party
data
sources
including
commercial
data
aggregators
google
phone
companies
and
social
and
financial
networks
n
this
creates
the
potential
to
replicate
in
the
private
sector
much
of
what
was
envisioned
in
the
original
government
surveillance
projects
that
were
considered
threatening
to
americans
privacy
n
finally
because
commercial
entities
rather
than
the
government
own
these
fourth
party
records
they
avoid
many
of
the
constitutional
and
statutory
protections
that
might
ensure
privacy
of
these
records
n
today
data
aggregators
are
able
to
cross
index
various
sources
of
information
to
produce
incredibly
extensive
and
invasive
lists
for
practically
any
purpose
for
example
many
can
provide
lists
of
people
who
take
prozac
for
depression
believe
in
the
bible
gamble
online
or
buy
sex
toys
n
similarly
the
aggregators
can
tailor
searches
to
identify
those
allegedly
engaged
in
illicit
activities
who
otherwise
would
avoid
suspicion
such
tools
are
increasingly
useful
to
generate
personalized
individualized
information
about
a
suspect
and
remain
largely
unregulated
identifiable
data
to
solve
crimes
law
enforcement
must
not
only
collect
information
but
also
identify
and
link
individuals
to
their
accumulated
data
in
short
data
must
be
connected
with
identifiable
human
beings
facial
recognition
software
biometric
identification
technologies
and
mobile
communication
make
it
easier
to
identify
unknown
suspects
and
access
data
associated
with
these
suspects
n
today
facial
recognition
software
can
identify
a
suspect
by
comparing
the
observed
suspect
s
face
to
a
database
of
stored
faces
n
as
sources
of
photographs
proliferate
and
law
enforcement
databases
link
these
sources
together
the
utility
and
ease
of
the
technology
will
expand
rapidly
n
in
more
technologically
advanced
jurisdictions
mobile
handheld
devices
can
match
faces
to
a
central
database
n
soon
the
technology
will
complete
searches
in
real
time
by
allowing
police
to
scan
multiple
faces
along
a
street
n
as
more
police
use
portable
computers
linked
to
these
photograph
databases
the
ability
of
law
enforcement
to
scan
and
analyze
faces
to
identify
suspects
will
become
more
common
n
the
scale
of
available
photo
databases
demonstrates
the
power
of
networked
data
as
reported
by
the
washington
post
the
fbi
s
own
facial
recognition
database
has
about
million
criminal
mug
shots
bureau
officials
are
pushing
to
expand
that
by
tens
of
millions
more
by
encouraging
states
to
upload
their
criminal
justice
photos
into
the
national
system
n
many
states
have
complied
or
are
complying
with
this
request
and
some
have
created
their
own
systems
the
pinellas
county
sheriff
s
office
in
florida
for
example
has
built
one
of
the
country
s
most
advanced
facial
recognition
programs
n
the
faces
of
more
than
million
people
are
in
searchable
photo
databases
that
state
officials
assembled
to
prevent
driver
s
license
fraud
but
that
increasingly
are
used
by
police
to
identify
suspects
accomplices
and
even
innocent
bystanders
in
a
wide
range
of
criminal
investigations
n
pennsylvania
s
justice
network
which
has
allowed
police
anywhere
in
the
state
to
compare
a
facial
image
with
mug
shot
databases
has
become
a
key
investigative
tool
and
last
month
it
added
access
to
million
driver
s
license
photos
n
these
examples
represent
only
the
beginning
as
twenty
six
states
now
allow
local
law
enforcement
to
access
driver
s
license
photographs
for
facial
recognition
purposes
n
in
addition
facial
recognition
programs
can
easily
search
a
wealth
of
personal
photographs
uploaded
online
n
facial
recognition
is
but
one
technology
used
to
identify
suspects
on
the
streets
law
enforcement
can
also
use
biometric
identification
technologies
n
that
look
to
irises
tattoos
scars
face
shape
and
even
the
habitual
manner
in
which
people
walk
n
the
goal
a
comprehensive
remote
scanning
technology
that
would
allow
instant
identification
of
suspects
through
a
quick
search
of
a
massive
database
n
one
existing
program
dubbed
moris
already
allows
an
ordinary
iphone
user
to
scan
an
iris
and
compare
it
to
a
database
of
biometric
identifiers
n
with
moris
police
can
take
a
picture
of
the
subject
s
face
from
up
to
five
feet
away
and
conduct
an
iris
scan
from
up
to
six
inches
from
the
person
s
eye
the
device
matches
photographs
against
a
national
criminal
records
database
that
is
managed
by
biometric
intelligence
and
identification
technologies
bi
technologies
the
private
company
that
designed
moris
n
other
techniques
will
also
be
developed
that
may
allow
similar
scanning
through
other
surveillance
techniques
n
these
growing
mobile
technologies
not
only
allow
law
enforcement
to
identify
previously
unknown
suspects
but
also
provide
other
networked
personal
information
about
those
suspects
n
as
one
state
law
enforcement
officer
remarked
i
can
call
up
everything
about
you
your
pictures
and
pictures
of
your
neighbors
n
in
addition
these
technologies
will
allow
law
enforcement
to
identify
targeted
populations
easily
such
as
gang
members
or
suspects
identified
on
most
wanted
lists
n
for
example
police
in
lincoln
nebraska
carry
a
mobile
application
called
p
i
proactive
police
patrol
information
that
displays
the
location
of
suspected
gang
members
registered
sex
offenders
people
with
outstanding
warrants
parolees
and
criminal
incident
reports
n
the
result
is
that
big
data
technology
can
provide
vastly
more
identifying
information
to
help
determine
reasonable
suspicion
on
the
streets
c
predictive
data
big
data
also
promises
another
change
in
law
enforcement
techniques
the
expansive
collection
of
data
allows
for
more
sophisticated
analysis
that
might
reveal
previously
unknown
patterns
of
criminal
activity
n
predictive
policing
technologies
are
already
in
use
in
major
cities
such
as
los
angeles
and
seattle
n
while
current
technologies
focus
primarily
on
expected
places
of
criminal
activity
they
also
predict
patterns
of
criminal
actions
computer
programs
can
analyze
these
patterns
and
police
accordingly
could
use
these
patterns
to
stop
unknown
suspects
whose
actions
fit
the
predicted
activity
n
available
technologies
provide
different
levels
of
sophistication
but
the
underlying
theory
that
crime
patterns
can
be
identified
analyzed
and
predicted
is
well
established
n
traditional
hot
spot
mapping
n
compstat
systems
n
and
more
modern
technologies
like
predictive
policing
all
rely
on
data
analysis
to
track
crime
patterns
n
the
logic
behind
these
technologies
is
that
certain
environmental
vulnerabilities
exist
to
encourage
crime
at
a
particular
location
n
repeated
observation
of
these
place
based
vulnerabilities
allows
analysts
or
algorithms
to
predict
the
next
area
of
likely
criminal
activity
n
the
collected
crime
data
also
holds
other
keys
to
understanding
the
actions
of
criminals
n
criminals
adopt
certain
modi
operandi
and
generally
are
creatures
of
habit
n
in
fact
one
reason
why
certain
crimes
encourage
almost
contagious
criminal
activity
in
the
surrounding
areas
is
because
the
same
criminals
or
groups
of
criminals
are
doing
the
acts
n
identifying
these
patterns
may
well
provide
clues
as
to
who
was
involved
in
the
crimes
n
sometimes
these
patterns
in
conjunction
with
other
factors
such
as
bus
routes
escape
routes
weather
patterns
paydays
license
plates
and
special
events
may
also
reveal
a
likely
offender
n
at
a
deeper
level
of
sophistication
with
enough
data
police
will
be
able
to
predict
criminal
networks
from
patterns
or
connections
n
just
as
companies
can
identify
you
and
your
interests
and
associates
from
past
activities
law
enforcement
might
be
able
to
target
criminal
networks
using
similar
pattern
recognition
technologies
n
for
example
police
concerned
with
the
manufacture
of
methamphetamine
could
glean
valuable
information
from
commercial
sales
data
in
a
jurisdiction
big
data
analysts
might
track
all
of
the
purchases
of
individuals
who
bought
several
of
the
component
parts
required
to
make
the
drug
lye
iodine
ephedrine
sudafed
drano
brake
fluid
and
lighter
fluid
n
each
of
these
products
has
a
lawful
use
but
identifying
the
individuals
who
bought
all
of
these
products
would
be
a
valuable
clue
in
determining
who
might
also
be
making
methamphetamine
patterns
of
anonymous
sales
data
alone
might
demonstrate
the
levels
of
meth
manufacture
taking
place
identifying
the
actual
identities
of
repeat
purchasers
would
benefit
investigators
even
more
though
merely
a
more
sophisticated
form
of
criminal
profiling
n
this
possibility
has
drawn
the
interest
of
major
players
including
the
fbi
n
who
see
the
potential
of
big
data
pattern
matching
n
several
jurisdictions
have
even
compiled
bad
guy
lists
of
individuals
they
predict
will
commit
crimes
in
the
future
or
are
involved
in
ongoing
criminal
activity
but
have
not
yet
been
caught
as
rodney
moore
the
chief
of
police
of
charlotte
mecklenburg
north
carolina
stated
we
could
name
our
top
offenders
so
we
will
focus
on
those
individuals
the
persons
responsible
for
the
criminal
activity
regardless
of
who
they
are
or
where
they
live
we
re
not
just
looking
for
crime
we
re
looking
for
people
n
these
unofficial
lists
are
not
based
on
ongoing
observed

instead

few
limits
exist
on
accessing

the
controlling
fourth

standard
derived
from
katz
v

asks
whether
an
individual

an
expectation

that
society
would
consider

reasonable
n
this
expectation

test
has

who
enter
the
criminal

it
also
has
little

the

reasoned
that

n
in
addition

some
inclination
to
reconsider
the
third

doctrine
n
by
and
large
however
fourth
amendment
protection
is
currently
unavailable
for
this
type
of

unlike
these
constitutionally
unprotected
categories
of

there
exists
a
patchwork
of
statutes
that
limit
the
disclosure
of
health
information
financial
information
and
some
online
communication
n
to
be
clear
these
statutes
cover
direct
access
to
third
party
information
for
example
the
health
insurance
portability
and
accountability
act
of
n
hipaa
protects
access
to
medical
records
although
it
allows
law
enforcement
to
access
the
records
through
an
administrative
trial
or
grand

likewise

such
as
the
gramm

n
the
bank
secrecy
act
n
the
right
to
financial

act
of

and
the
fair

n
provide
some
measure
of
protection
from
unauthorized
access
to
financial
records
although
these
protections
can
be
surmounted
by
a
subpoena
or
court
order
similarly
the
content

statutorily
protected
by
the
electronic

privacy
act

lapses

telephone

through
the
telephone

they

if
the
evidence
is
relevant
based
on
specific

articulable
facts
n
in
addition
to
constitutional
and
statutory
protections
certain
consumer
guidelines
established

yet
most
major
commercial

n
these
economic
incentives
combined
with
a
willingness

consider
a
modern
day
terry
v
ohio
situation
detective
mcfadden
is
patrolling
the
street
he
observes
john
terry
and
using
facial
recognition
technology
identifies
him
and
begins
to
investigate
using
big
data
detective
mcfadden
learns
through
a
database
search
that
terry
has
a
prior
criminal
record
including
a
couple
of
convictions
and
a
number
of
arrests
n
mcfadden
learns
through
pattern
matching
links
that
terry
is
an
associate
a
hanger
on
of
a
notorious
violent
local
gangster
billy
cox
who
had
been
charged
with
several
murders
n
mcfadden
also
learns
that
terry
has
a
substance
abuse
problem
and
is
addicted
to
drugs
n
these
factors
all
true
but
unknown
to
the
real
detective
mcfadden
are
individualized
and
particularized
to
terry
alone
they
may
not
constitute
reasonable
suspicion
that
terry
is
committing
or
about
to
commit
a
particular
crime
but
in
conjunction
with
terry
s
observed
actions
of
pacing
outside
a
store
with
two
associates
the
information
makes
the
reasonable
suspicion
finding
easier
and
likely
more
reliable
in
observation
cases
by
using
mobile
facial
recognition
to
identify
the
suspect
the
officer
now
can
turn
any
unknown
suspect
into
a
known
suspect
and
can
search
for
information
that
might
justify
reasonable
suspicion
this
change
allows
the
officer
to
review
traditional
data
sources
known
to
law
enforcement
including
prior
criminal
history
arrests
addresses
gang
associations
known
associates
and
even
concealed
weapons
permits
perhaps
this
individual
is
on
a
local
most
wanted
list
or
a
watch
list
as
someone
who
has
already
been
identified
as
being
trouble
in
the
neighborhood
n
perhaps
his
height
weight
race
hairstyle
facial
hair
or
other
distinguishing
marks
match
a
robbery
suspect
this
traditional
law
enforcement
information
might
also
now
include
data
from
automatic
license
plate
readers
digitally
archived
surveillance
video
and
intelligence
reports
created
and
maintained
by
police
even
this
limited
information
may
be
as
a
constitutional
matter
enough
for
an
officer
to
stop
the
suspect
if
for
example
the
suspect
had
an
extensive
history
of
commercial
robberies
or
if
license
plate
data
connected
him
to
prior
robberies
in
the
area
this
information
might
well
constitute
reasonable
suspicion
that
the
suspect
was
going
to
commit
a
robbery
additional
big
data
innovations
may
also
assist
the
police
for
example
the
new
york
police
department
nypd
has
unveiled
the
domain
awareness
system
das
in
partnership
with
microsoft
n
this
technology
allows
an
officer
to
observe
through
video
surveillance
or
automated
license
plate
readers
the
location
of
a
suspect
prior
to
the
initial
observation
das
is
capable
of
rapidly
blending
and
analyzing
realtime
data
gathered
from
roughly
civic
closed
circuit
cameras
call
recordings
and
license
plate
readers
as
well
as
historical
crime
reports
now
the
nypd
can
do
things
like
track
a
vehicle
and
instantly
determine
nearly
everywhere
it
s
been
for
the
past
few
days
or
weeks
instantly
access
a
suspect
s
arrest
record
and
all
the
calls
related
to
a
particular
crime
and
map
criminal
history
to
geospatially
and
chronologically
reveal
crime
patterns
n
thus
the
officer
could
determine
whether
the
suspect
had
just
arrived
with
a
getaway
driver
had
been
casing
the
store
or
had
merely
been
doing
non
criminal
errands
all
morning
n
these
patterns
may
well
affect
whether
an
officer
has
reasonable
suspicion
that
a
suspect
is
about
to
commit
a
crime
for
a
second
level
of
inquiry
imagine
the
police
officer
uses
networked
databases
owned
by
third
parties
to
discover
personal
information
about
a
suspect
this
data
might
include
credit
information
financial
records
credit
card
activity
employment
past
addresses
and
telephone
numbers
names
and
addresses
of
family
members
neighbors
addresses
and
telephone
numbers
business
associates
make
model
and
color
of
registered
vehicles
social
security
numbers
dates
of
birth
bankruptcies
liens
and
judgments
and
gps
locational
data
while
access
to
some
of
these
data
would
usually
require
particular
legal
authorization
law
enforcement
can
circumvent
statutes
restricting
direct
access
by
instead
using
fourth
party
commercial
aggregators
n
such
personalized
information
will
allow
an
officer
to
develop
a
more
individualized
picture
of
a
suspect
while
generally
unemployment
credit
card
debt
and
bankruptcy
are
not
indicia
of
criminal
activity
when
viewed
in
conjunction
with
suspicious
action
in
front
of
an
expensive
jewelry
store
however
a
personal
financial
crisis
might
be
relevant
to
the
totality
of
circumstances
further
accurate
gps
data
tying
the
suspect
to
a
prior
robbery
or
to
a
pawnshop
might
lead
to
reasonable
suspicion
even
the
otherwise
innocent
purchase
of
a
wool
cap
or
ski
mask
at
walmart
might
tip
a
seasonal
purchase
into
reasonable
suspicion
finally
imagine
if
law
enforcement
could
access
the
suspect
s
social
media
data
n
search
queries
facebook
and
twitter
posts
youtube
videos
emails
texts
and
similar
communications
are
all
available
to
third
party
providers
if
not
publically
available
while
personal
content
is
usually
statutorily
or
commercially
protected
it
is
generally
not
constitutionally
protected
this
mosaic
of
personal
information
might
well
provide
individualized
facts
necessary
to
make
the
police
officer
s
suspicion
reasonable
n
for
example
a
suspect
s
admission
of
financial
difficulties
or
photograph
displaying
the
fruits
of
the
crime
through
social
media
could
appropriately
be
added
to
the
totality
of
circumstances
with
each
level
of
search
officers
can
access
additional
individualized
and
particularized
facts
that
when
viewed
within
the
totality
of
circumstances
help
justify
the
officer
s
stop
of
a
suspect
the
effect
is
that
additional
personalized
information
encourages
a
finding
of
reasonable
suspicion
a
trip
to
a
pawnshop
could
indicate
a
person
is
selling
stolen
goods
or
is
merely
poor
enough
to
have
to
sell
belongings
at
a
steep
discount
a
photograph
of
jewelry
could
be
an
admission
of
theft
or
could
simply
be
a
photograph
of
jewelry
yet
in
a
criminal
investigation
the
inferences
of
suspicion
are
easy
to
develop
and
against
a
low
legal
threshold
easy
to
meet
of
course
suspicious
facts
must
be
connected
with
a
suspected
crime
it
would
not
be
relevant
if
the
searches
revealed
a
pattern
of
domestic
violence
crimes
unrelated
to
robbery
it
would
also
not
be
relevant
if
the
information
was
not
directly
connected
to
the
suspect
being
a
friend
of
a
friend
of
a
known
robber
is
a
fact
but
not
one
that
should
influence
the
constitutional
calculus
but
as
long
as
the
data
are
connected
to
both
the
suspected
criminal
activity
and
the
suspected
criminal
it
would
likely
be
persuasive
in
evaluating
reasonable
suspicion
in
observation
cases
b
investigation
of
completed
crimes
many
crimes
occur
without
direct
police
observation
and
police
must
investigate
the
crime
to
identify
the
perpetrator
reasonable
suspicion
is
still
relevant
in
investigating
past
crimes
assuming
the
information
available
does
not
rise
to
the
higher
level
of
probable
cause
n
in
hensley
the
supreme
court
set
out
the
standard
for
investigating
past
crimes
based
on
reasonable
suspicion
the
precise
limits
on
investigatory
stops
to
investigate
past
criminal
activity
are
more
difficult
to
define
the
proper
way
to
identify
the
limits
is
to
apply
the
same
test
already
used
to
identify
the
proper
bounds
of
intrusions
that
further
investigations
of
imminent
or
ongoing
crimes
that
test
which
is
grounded
in
the
standard
of
reasonableness
embodied
in
the
fourth
amendment
balances
the
nature
and
quality
of
the
intrusion
on
personal
security
against
the
importance
of
the
governmental
interests
alleged
to
justify
the
intrusion
when
this
balancing
test
is
applied
to
stops
to
investigate
past
crimes
we
think
that
probable
cause
to
arrest
need
not
always
be
required
n
while
acknowledging
that
courts
might
balance
these
interests
differently
when
investigating
a
past
completed
crime
as
opposed
to
an
ongoing
crime
n
the
supreme
court
still
held
that
the
ability
to
briefly
stop
that
person
ask
questions
or
check
identification
in
the
absence
of
probable
cause
promotes
the
strong
government
interest
in
solving
crimes
and
bringing
offenders
to
justice
n
by
adopting
a
reasonable
suspicion
test
for
investigation
of
past
crimes
the
court
gave
police
the
flexibility
to
stop
suspects
based
on
this
lower
threshold
of
suspicion
n
as
in
observation
cases
the
primary
use
of
big
data
would
be
to
identify
unknown
perpetrators
for
arrest
and
prosecution
as
one
security
expert
explained
imagine
the
ability
to
instantly
take
a
security
camera
photograph
from
a
bank
robbery
and
match
it
using
a
facial
recognition
algorithm
to
a
photograph
in
an
out
of
state
motor
vehicle
database
and
then
to
link
that
person
s
name
to
a
mobile
phone
from
a
private
sector
marketing
database
n
already
police
have
relied
on
similar
linkages
of
networked
information
in
more
run
of
the
mill
cases
n
with
new
search
technology
disparate
pieces
of
data
are
compiled
to
link
match
and
identify
a
suspect
through
pattern
matching
techniques
this
can
be
done
not
only
with
a
name
address
or
license
plate
but
also
with
a
particular
modus
operandi
n
this
information
specific
to
a
person
and
particularized
to
a
crime
meets
both
requirements
needed
to
establish
reasonable
suspicion
the
value
of
big
data
to
reasonable
suspicion
investigations
is
probably
greater
than
its
value
to
observation
cases
because
police
have
time
to
surmount
the
legal
process
requirements
necessary
to
obtain
third
party
information
n
with
an
official
request
a
court
order
or
a
subpoena
let
alone
a
warrant
or
grand
jury
subpoena
law
enforcement
officers
can
obtain
most
third
party
data
if
doing
so
in
furtherance
of
a
criminal
investigation
n
software
can
isolate
patterns
and
identify
suspects
through
existing
public
and
private
data
in
novel
ways
one
fascinating
example
of
big
data
sleuthing
arose
out
of
the
investigation
of
a
major
swedish
armed
robbery
of
millions
of
dollars
n
police
assumed
that
to
disguise
their
plot
the
thieves
must
have
used
prepaid
disposable
phones
data
analysts
then
searched
through
the
list
of
all
prepaid
disposable
phones
in
the
area
looking
for
a
set
of
phones
that
stayed
within
their
own
miniature
network
n
police
analysts
found
a
single
set
of
phones
that
only
communicated
with
each
other
did
so
only
for
a
few
weeks
leading
up
to
the
heist
and
then
went
silent
after
the
robbery
identifying
this
network
allowed
police
to
solve
the
case
police
traced
the
phones
to
specific
cell
tower
locations
corresponding
with
the
robbers
locations
before
during
and
after
the
robbery
n
in
fact
once
police
knew
the
numbers
they
could
track
location
by
location
exactly
where
the
robbers
had
been
when
police
identified
one
person
who
had
purchased
the
phones
they
were
able
to
determine
how
the
crime
occurred
and
the
location
of
the
thieves
at
all
times
n
major
police
departments
as
well
as
the
fbi
have
adopted
this
type
of
pattern
matching
investigation
technique
n
in
child
abduction
cases
amber
alerts
have
led
to
quick
reviews
of
license
plate
reader
databases
by
searching
the
location
of
a
car
police
can
determine
the
likely
route
of
the
suspect
n
in
gang
cases
recordings
of
gunshots
have
helped
map
out
areas
of
contested
gang
turf
n
returning
to
the
robbery
example
imagine
that
a
particular
jewelry
store
was
robbed
by
an
unknown
suspect
police
officers
have
a
video
still
from
the
robbery
that
does
not
allow
for
a
facial
recognition
match
the
photo
however
clearly
shows
a
neck
tattoo
and
officers
obtain
a
partial
description
of
the
getaway
car
running
a
search
for
the
tattoo
against
a
database
might
narrow
the
list
of
suspects
comparing
the
narrowed
list
with
owners
of
a
particular
type
of
car
might
further
limit
the
list
of
suspects
looking
at
the
remaining
suspects
associates
movements
or
even
bank
deposits
credit
card
expenditures
or
social
media
comments
might
again
tighten
the
search
the
result
is
that
big
data
can
help
identify
the
suspect
with
a
few
search
queries
while
these
data
might
not
be
enough
to
get
an
arrest
warrant
they
would
likely
provide
the
reasonable
suspicion
needed
to
stop
and
investigate
the
suspect
n
c
predicting
crimes
unlike
observation
or
investigation
cases
reasonable
suspicion
based
on
prediction
remains
the
stuff
of
science
fiction
police
have
begun
to
predict
areas
of
heightened
criminal
activity
n
and
may
predict
likely
troublemakers
involved
in
criminal
enterprise
through
an
unofficial
bad
guy
list
but
predictive
analytics
cannot
yet
tell
police
whom
to
stop
for
a
crime
not
yet
committed
to
be
clear
these
are
prediction
based
stops
where
no
crime
has
occurred
and
no
crime
is
observed
yet
big
data
invites
provocative
questions
about
whether
such
predictive
tips
should
factor
into
the
reasonable
suspicion
calculus
for
example
if
a
drug
distribution
gang
is
run
by
a
tight
knit
family
or
neighborhood
organization
such
that
the
pattern
for
several
years
has
been
that
when
one
family
member
is
arrested
another
cousin
or
brother
takes
their
place
then
why
can
we
not
predict
who
will
be
the
next
member
of
the
gang
n
if
burglaries
are
contagious
in
part
because
the
same
gang
of
burglars
commits
similar
crimes
and
police
identify
one
burglar
why
should
we
not
target
a
burglar
s
associates
as
likely
suspects
for
future
burglaries
n
in
these
cases
police
could
show
specific
and
articulable
facts
indicating
that
a
particular
person
is
likely
to
participate
in
ongoing
criminal
activity
e
g
drug
dealing
or
burglaries
n
because
the
criminal
enterprise
is
ongoing
the
terry
standard
might
well
apply
and
police
could
try
to
stop
and
investigate
would
be
members
of
these
criminal
organizations
if
they
were
observed
doing
anything
that
might
suggest
drug
dealing
or
burglary
the
questions
get
harder
when
no
ongoing
criminal
enterprise
exists
yet
the
same
predictive
logic
holds
in
chicago
analysts
have
identified
young
people
at
greater
risk
of
being
involved
in
gun
violence
n
researchers
can
predict
their
likelihood
of
being
a
victim
or
perpetrator
of
gun
violence
using
big
data
metrics
including
place
of
residence
social
associations
e
g
past
experience
with
victims
of
gun
violence
and
gang
connections
and
age
n
assuming
the
accuracy
of
these
data
could
police
target
these
individuals
as
part
of
a
predictive
stop
strategy
n
in
fact
the
chicago
police
department
appears
to
have
adopted
this
predictive
logic
in
its
intervention
program
as
described
by
the
new
york
times
in
recent
months
as
many
as
officers
a
day
working
overtime
have
been
dispatched
to
just
small
zones
deemed
the
city
s
most
dangerous
the
police
say
they
are
tamping
down
retaliatory
shootings
between
gang
factions
by
using
a
comprehensive
analysis
of
the
city
s
tens
of
thousands
of
suspected
gang
members
the
turf
they
claim
and
their
rivalries
the
police
are
also
focusing
on
more
than
people
they
have
identified
as
having
associations
that
make
them
the
most
likely
to
be
involved
in
a
murder
as
a
victim
or
an
offender
n
those
four
hundred
individuals
part
of
a
list
of
predicted
offenders
were
identified
through
big
data
techniques
chicago
police
call
it
a
heat
list
n
young
men
on
the
heat
list
are
targets
of
predictive
intervention
based
strategies
while
a
fourth
amendment
stop
based
solely
on
an
individual
s
inclusion
on
this
list
without
more
might
not
be
sufficiently
particularized
big
data
tools
exist
to
generate
the
necessary
reasonable
suspicion
n
for
example
imagine
one
of
those
four
hundred
individuals
is
a
young
man
whom
police
wish
to
stop
because
they
suspect
that
he
is
up
to
no
good
and
likely
in
possession
of
a
gun
plainly
an
officer
s
suspicion
that
someone
is
up
to
no
good
does
not
constitute
constitutionally
sufficient
justification
for
a
stop
an
officer
sees
the
young
man
on
the
streets
but
not
engaged
in
any
overt
criminal
activity
the
officer
identifies
the
young
man
as
being
on
a
list
of
individuals
that
predictive
analytics
suggested
are
at
a
heightened
risk
of
involvement
in
gun
violence
a
quick
ncic
database
search
reveals
gang
contacts
criminal
associates
and
prior
arrests
including
gun
charges
gang
tattoos
link
the
young
man
to
local
gangs
a
license
plate
reader
places
the
family
car
in
the
general
vicinity
of
a
gang
shooting
in
the
last
month
his
facebook
profile
contains
statements
that
police
could
interpret
as
directing
violence
at
rival
gang
members
n
finally
predictive
policing
software
has
forecast
the
young
man
s
location
as
the
site
of
likely
gun
violence
if
the
police
officer
stops
the
young
man
doing
nothing
overtly
criminal
and
finds
a
gun
during
a
frisk
would
a
court
really
say
there
was
not
individualized
and
particularized
suspicion
that
this
individual
was
involved
in
gun
and
gang
related
activity
though
the
young
man
took
no
action
to
signify
criminal
activity
the
data
suggest
that
he
was
far
more
likely
to
be
in
possession
of
a
gun
than
most
people
in
chicago
how
courts
resolve
these
issues
will
determine
the
impact
of
big
data
on
law
enforcement
on
one
hand
judges
might
require
some
affirmative
imminent
suspicious
activity
correlating
with
gun
possession
before
upholding
the
stop
such
as
furtive
movements
a
suspicious
bulge
or
unexplained
nervousness
n
without
the
requirement
of
some
observable
activity
the
odds
increase
that
predictive
stops
will
target
innocent
people
criminalize
by
association
and
negatively
impact
individuals
based
on
little
more
than
a
hunch
supported
by
non
criminal
facts
on
the
other
hand
many
judges
might
find
this
totality
of
suspicions
even
if
focused
on
a
particular
suspect
and
not
a
crime
sufficient
to
justify
an
investigatory
stop
reasonable
suspicion
is
a
low
threshold
thus
in
practice
aggregated
reasonable
suspicion
would
likely
justify
a
stop
in
many
courtrooms

this
shift

big

suspicion
big
data
s
ability
to
generate
information
about
an
identified
suspect
reveals
the
inherent
vulnerability
in
the
reasonable
suspicion
standard
indeed
along
the
continuum
of
suspicion
more
data
makes
it
easier
to
satisfy
the
standard
for
two
primary
reasons
first
under
a
totality
of
circumstances
test
the
more
factors
a
court
considers
in
the
totality
the
easier
it
is
to
articulate
suspicion
quantity
can
make
up
for
quality
n
second
the
information
provided
by
big
data
is
individualized
and
particularized
consistent
with
the
terry
language
n
to
be
clear
the
data
are
individualized
to
the
criminal
not
the
crime
as
courts
apply
terry
however
which
arose
in
the
unknown
suspect
context
the
difference
becomes
blurred
this
latter
point
is
important
to
emphasize
the
language
in
the
earlier
reasonable
suspicion
cases
speaks
to
a
general
suspicion
of
unspecified
criminal
actions
using
terms
like
criminal
activity
may
be
afoot
n
involved
in
criminal
activity
n
legal
wrongdoing
n
or
illegality
n
the
general
language
does
not
require
discussion
of
a
particular
observed
crime
e
g
drug
distribution
or
gun
possession
because
the
officer
actually
observed
the
illegal
activity
in
question
the
observed
crime
and
the
observed
criminal
were
not
separate
things
to
analyze
no
distinction
was
needed
in
the
analysis
thus
in
a
small
data
world
the
traditional
language
describing
suspicious
behavior
has
no
meaning
outside
of
the
observed
activity
in
a
big
data
world
this
same
generalized
language
becomes
distorted
an
officer
may
know
information
about
a
suspect
but
the
question
becomes
how
does
that
information
relate
to
the
observed
actions
knowing
someone
is
a
drug
dealer
does
not
mean
that
the
individual
is
actively
dealing
drugs
at
the
moment
of
observation
courts
analyzing
big
data
suspicion
should
thus
be
careful
to
require
a
direct
link
between
the
past
data
about
a
suspect
and
the
observed
suspicion
with
big
data
suspicion
it
is
important
for
the
individualized
and
particularized
information
to
relate
to
the
particular
action
observed
if
a
police
officer
identifies
a
suspect
and
learns
information
about
the
suspect
s
arrests
convictions
or
associations
that
has
nothing
to
do
with
the
observed
actions
if
the
officer
observed
any
actions
at
all
then
the
new
information
should
be
irrelevant
to
the
reasonable
suspicion
calculus
only
when
those
particularized
factors
can
be
connected
to
observed
actions
that
signify
criminal
activity
should
they
affect
the
analysis
courts
will
soon
be
asked
to
address
the
impact
of
big
data
on
reasonable
suspicion
but
before
that
time
policymakers
will
need
to
think
through
and
evaluate
whether
this
innovation
is
good
or
bad
for
police
individuals
and
society
iv
evaluating
big
data
and
predictive
reasonable
suspicion
while
big
data
may
expose
the
fragility
of
the
reasonable
suspicion
doctrine
the
technology
has
arrived
and
its
impact
on
fourth
amendment
cases
is
imminent
as
such
it
is
necessary
to
evaluate
the
questions
of
law
and
policy
that
arise
from
the
move
to
big
data
policing
this
part
discusses
positives
and
negatives
of
big
data
policing
and
provides
suggestions
on
how
to
address
the
pending
evolution
of
fourth
amendment
doctrine
a
the
positives
of
big
data
suspicion
as
may
be
evident
from
early
adoption
and
experimentation
with
predictive
technologies
law
enforcement
officials
see
the
potential
of
these
tools
to
reduce
crime
big
data
suspicion
if
used
correctly
can
improve
accuracy
and
efficiency
and
it
will
yield
unexpected
insights
into
the
patterns
of
criminal
activity
improved
accuracy
reasonable
suspicion
based
on
big
data
primarily
benefits
law
enforcement
because
of
the
increased
accuracy
it
purports
to
offer
n
more
information
and
more
precise
information
should
make
it
more
likely
that
police
target
actual
criminals
rather
than
innocent
people
in
a
small
data
environment
police
rely
on
proxies
for
information
to
the
detriment
of
everyone
class
race
age
choice
of
clothing
and
gender
all
factor
into
police
officers
discretionary
decisions
on
the
street
n
police
perceive
ambiguous
actions
as
suspicious
because
of
subtle
cues
or
instincts
these
judgments
also
unfortunately
include
explicit
and
implicit
biases
policing
traditions
and
the
frailties
of
human
perception
n
replacing
those
generalized
intuitions
with
precise
detail
about
actual
people
should
result
in
a
more
accurate
policing
strategy
humans
are
notoriously
bad
at
making
snap
judgments
and
while
police
officers
make
more
snap
judgments
than
most
they
are
not
immune
from
the
imperfections
of
human
nature
n
for
example
stories
of
racial
profiling
involving
famous
celebrities
wealthy
professionals
and
other
citizens
show
how
racial
stereotypes
can
influence
suspicion
n
yet
in
a
big
data
world
a
quick
license
plate
scan
or
facial
recognition
check
and
a
query
of
other
databases
perhaps
including
professional
licenses
or
even
addresses
could
help
avoid
the
indignity
of
detention
based
solely
on
a
police
hunch
n
of
course
in
many
cases
information
will
not
reveal
that
the
individual
is
a
celebrity
but
even
basic
personal
or
employment
data
or
lack
of
criminal
information
might
provide
police
with
a
clue
that
a
suspect
is
just
an
ordinary
citizen
not
involved
in
criminal
activity
while
vulnerable
to
abuse
predictive
suspicion
ultimately
may
make
police
stops
more
reliable
at
its
core
reasonable
suspicion
is
a
doctrine
of
predictive
suspicion
the
collected
totality
of
circumstances
must
justify
an
officer
s
prediction
that
criminal
activity
is
afoot
n
thus
having
more
information
about
an
individual
should
result
in
more
reliable
predictions
n
if
police
focus
their
efforts
on
people
placed
on
bad
guy
lists
it
may
protect
individuals
who
are
not
on
the
lists
if
police
are
forced
to
use
big
data
to
identify
and
link
a
suspect
to
a
crime
they
may
also
see
patterns
that
suggest
that
the
suspect
was
not
involved
in
the
crime
in
this
way
big
data
policing
may
be
a
measure
more
protective
of
individuals
on
the
street
the
accuracy
that
big
data
provides
not
only
increases
the
likelihood
that
police
target
the
right
suspects
but
also
in
turn
prevents
the
resulting
physical
face
to
face
interactions
that
generate
tension
n
many
police
stops
involve
confirming
or
disproving
suspicion
n
even
if
no
arrest
results
the
unpleasant
and
perhaps
unnecessary
police
citizen
contact
breeds
resentment
and
distrust
n
allowing
police
to
confirm
a
person
s
lack
of
involvement
in
criminal
activity
through
a
database
search
rather
than
a
physical
stop
avoids
unnecessary
conflict
exculpatory
facts
suspicion
is
not
a
one
way
street
suspicion
can
be
disproved
suspicion
can
be
alleviated
the
advent
of
big
data
suspicion
may
require
consideration
of
exculpatory
factors
that
lessen
suspicion
just
as
big
data
enables
a
wealth
of
suspicious
inferences
it
also
generates
an
equal
number
of
potentially
exculpatory
facts
for
example
if
detective
mcfadden
learned
that
john
terry
s
wife
worked
near
the
downtown
location
of
the
observation
pacing
outside
a
store
might
turn
from
casing
a
robbery
to
waiting
for
a
loved
one
the
potentially
exculpatory
nature
of
big
data
is
a
strong
positive
argument
for
its
use
in
policing
presumably
if
big
data
information
exists
about
a
suspect
police
should
be
obligated
to
check
before
initiating
a
stop
n
the
totality
of
circumstances
should
not
be
understood
as
the
totality
of
suspicious
activities
it
should
include
exculpatory
information
that
reduces
suspicion
as
well
this
is
an
established
part
of
the
probable
cause
analysis
n
and
big
data
technology
allows
it
to
be
included
in
the
reasonable
suspicion
analysis
thus
existing
exculpatory
information
should
be
factored
into
the
totality
of
circumstances
and
weighted
just
as
heavily
as
suspicious
factors
courts
might
even
require
police
to
factor
in
exculpatory
information
as
a
self
contained
check
on
the
regular
discretionary
powers
granted
to
police
when
big
data
is
available
an
officer
who
did
not
use
it
in
an
exculpatory
manner
might
be
deemed
to
have
acted
recklessly
n
in
the
same
way
that
courts
may
take
a
negative
inference
from
an
unrecorded
confession
in
a
jurisdiction
where
videotaping
confessions
is
the
norm
a
failure
to
use
the
available
search
technology
might
be
held
against
the
officer
n
in
this
way
using
big
data
to
determine
reasonable
suspicion
might
actually
prevent
certain
stops
that
would
have
been
allowed
under
a
traditional
small
data
reasonable
suspicion
standard
accountability
focusing
on
big
data
sources
also
provides
the
potential
for
increased
documentation
of
stops
in
general
police
do
not
document
their
suspicions
before
a
stop
nor
does
anyone
do
so
on
their
behalf
n
data
driven
suspicion
though
can
be
documented
beforehand
police
officers
could
demonstrate
the
steps
they
took
to
investigate
a
suspect
by
producing
records
of
which
databases
they
accessed
and
which
search
queries
they
used
in
this
way
police
would
replace
the
ex
post
justification
for
a
stop
with
an
ex
ante
description
of
the
steps
taken
to
validate
a
hunch
before
conducting
a
stop
in
simple
terms
a
police
officer
could
show
that
she
checked
the
ncic
database
and
ran
a
license
plate
check
before
explaining
why
this
information
corroborated
her
initial
suspicion
this
record
has
the
potential
not
only
to
limit
whom
police
stop
but
also
to
make
a
judge
s
determination
of
an
officer
s
reasonable
suspicion
significantly
easier
this
documentation
will
also
encourage
the
development
of
a
culture
that
allows
for
auditing
of
data
standards
for
record
collection
and
perhaps
even
notice
requirements
for
targeted
suspects
for
example
police
administrators
as
an
internal
monitoring
strategy
might
examine
an
officer
s
history
of
stops
to
see
what
factors
influenced
his
decision
to
stop
a
suspect
looking
through
the
documented
history
of
big
data
searches
and
comparing
them
with
the
justifications
for
a
stop
might
help
police
develop
better
training
tools
and
build
stronger
accountability
measures
independent
of
any
court
case
internal
monitoring
measures
can
improve
hit
rates
for
arrests
in
other
data
driven
contexts
these
types
of
retention
and
accountability
efforts
are
built
into
the
regulating
structure

efficiency
a
move
toward
data
driven
policing
will
also
improve
the
efficient
use
of
police
resources
in
many
cases
better
information
will
lead
police
to
focus
scarce
resources
on
more
serious
risks

prevent
unnecessary
contacts
with
law
abiding
citizens
the
rise
of
predictive
policing
signals
the
beginning
of
this
shift
to
data
driven

underlying
the
theory

that

predictive

will
suggest

such
suspicion
will
often
be
unfounded
perhaps
a

might
stop
the
suspected
burglar
solely
because
of
this
correlation
one
can
imagine
that
those
individuals
who
find
themselves
on
a
bad
guy
list
will
be
marked
for
more
than
their
fair
share
of
borderline
suspicious
stops
n
big
data
suspicion
creates
the
real
concern
that
certain
individuals
by
virtue
of
their
past
criminal
activities
will
always
be
at
risk
to
be
stopped
those
with
lengthy
criminal
records
or
gang
associations
may
be
stopped
because
of
who
they
are
and
not
what
they
are
doing
prior
police
contacts
will
become
the
digital
scarlet
letter
marking
certain
people
in
a
community
as
suspicious
n
over
the
past
several
decades
poor
people
and
people
of
color
have
had
disproportionate
contact
with
the
criminal
justice
system
n
if
these
contacts
become
data
points
that
can
be
used
in
a
reasonable
suspicion
analysis
then
these
data
may
become
proxies
for
race
or
class
with
similar
effect
for
example
the
aclu
s
recent
national
study
on
marijuana
arrests
demonstrates
that
african
americans
are
more
likely
to
be
arrested
for
marijuana
than
whites
despite
equivalent
usage
rates
n
thus
more
data
has
been
collected
about
minority
marijuana
possession
even
though
whites
commit
the
crime
at
the
same
rate
if
data
are
collected
only
about
certain
classes
of
people
then
those
people
are
more
likely
to
become
future
targets
of
suspicion
simply
because
of
the
initial
selection
bias
thus
important
questions
remain
about
who
collects
interprets
and
chooses
the
big
data
to
study
n
worse
like
other
quantitative
systems
used
for
decisionmaking
big
data
based
predictive
policing
will
appear
to
be
objective
and
fair
when
it
may
in
fact
reflect
subjective
factors
and
structural
inequalities
just
as
we
have
credit
ratings
that
allow
lenders
to
predict
future
creditworthiness
police
could
develop
criminal
ratings
to
predict
future
criminal
proclivity
n
similarly
data
can
lead
us
to
believe
our
own
worst
instincts
n
if
published
data
demonstrate
a
higher
arrest
rate
for
people
of
color
then
this
information
may
well
influence
discretionary
decisions
about
who
to
stop
n
implicit
bias
and
confirmation
bias
will
result
in
police
seeing
what
they
have
been
told
to
see
even
if
it
is
not
actually
occurring
n
implicit
bias
involves
unconscious
prejudices
that
influence
individuals
making
discretionary
decisions
n
this
can
result
in
unequal
outcomes
for
similarly
situated
individuals
n
implicit
bias
inevitably
exists
in
the
ordinary
course
of
police
activities
but
is
even
more
damaging
when
combined
with
confirmation
bias
the
tendency
to
bolster
a
hypothesis
by
seeking
consistent
evidence
while
minimizing
inconsistent
evidence
n
thus
an
officer
conditioned
to
believe
that
a
particular
type
of
person
may
be
more
likely
to
commit
a
criminal
act
will
likely
see
that
person
through
the
lens
of
suspicion
by
providing
the
information
to
confirm
this
suspicion
big
data
will
make
it
easier
for
police
to
justify
a
stop
even
more
dangerously
an
officer
with
discriminatory
animus
may
be
able
to
justify
a
knowingly
unconstitutional
stop
using
an
aggregation
of
otherwise
innocent
data
n
this
risk
demonstrates
how
suspicions
about
past
criminal
actions
can
all
too
easily
morph
into
suspicions
about
current
criminal
activity
it
highlights
the
importance
of
requiring
a
nexus
between
the
suspected
criminal
and
the
suspected
criminal
activity
it
also
highlights
the
dangers
of
how
big
data
can
target
certain
populations
based
on
correlations
with
possible
criminal
activity
rather
than
causation
from
real
criminal
activity
justification
to
stop
these
individuals
marked
by
big
data
will
be
too
easily

this
article
is
an
attempt
to
sketch
the
potential
impact
of
big
data
information
on
a
small
data
reasonable
suspicion
doctrine
it
has
exposed
real
distortions
and
potential
vulnerabilities
as
well
as
clear
advantages
that
arise
from
this
technological
innovation
the
debate
over
big
data
is
noisy
and
contested
perhaps
revealing
its
immature
state
of
development
this
last
part
addresses
tentative
solutions
in
this
changed
landscape
a
doctrinal
changes
initially
we
could
simply
require
a
more
stringent
standard
of
reasonable
suspicion
to
be
clear
the
supreme
court
has
been
steadfast
in
articulating
that
it
has
no
intention
of
quantifying
or
even
clarifying
the
standard
instead
recognizing
that
police
officers
operate
within
the
factual
and
practical
considerations
of
everyday
life
on
which
reasonable
and
prudent
men
not
legal
technicians
act
n
but
if
the
underlying
logic
of
a
standard
based
on
unknown
suspects
has
been
upended
by
all
knowing
technology
then
perhaps
the
standard
needs
to
be
altered
the
factual
and
practical
considerations
are
no
longer
limited
to
small
data
observations
so
why
shouldn
t
the
factual
and
practical
considerations
include
requiring
more
data
now
easily
available
one
could
imagine
that
in
the
context
of
big
data
predictive
suspicion
where
police
can
more
easily
access
information
courts
might
require
more
information
to
satisfy
the
reasonable
suspicion
standard
n
in
practical
terms
this
could
result
in
a
different
standard
of
reasonable
suspicion
when
big
data
information
is
used
if
big
data
makes
more
information
available
with
relatively
little
effort
then
big
data
should
be
required
to
be
part
of
the
reasonable
suspicion
calculus
this
would
include
both
potentially
suspicious
and
potentially
exculpatory
information
after
all
if
the
original
justification
for
reasonable
suspicion
arose
out
of
a
situation
necessarily
limited
by
practicality
unknown
suspect
potentially
imminent
crime
limited
information
then
better
information
about
a
known
suspect
suggests
a
different
standard
should
be
used
n
b
big
data
changes
if
changing
the
standard
of
reasonable
suspicion
is
not
a
realistic
option
then
perhaps
the
solution
lies
in
the
nature
of
big
data
itself
at
its
core
big
data
encourages
a
heightened
focus
on
statistical
analysis
geospatial
and
temporal
analysis
and
link
analysis
adapting
these
three
methods
of
analysis
to
big
data
suspicion
on
the
streets
might
provide
some
precision
and
thus
some
limitation
for
an
otherwise
malleable
standard
statistical
analysis
first
big
data
not
only
involves
making
predictions
but
also
quantifying
the
likelihood
that
these
predictions
will
come
true
the
statistical
analysis
behind
the
predictive
analytics
provides
actual
observable
numbers
for
example
a
predictive
policing
algorithm
might
report
a
chance
of
a
burglary
on
a
particular
block
n
a
pattern
match
might
provide
police
with
a
percentage
likelihood
that
a
particular
suspect
associates
with
another
individual
in
these
cases
if
part
of
the
predictive
suspicion
of
an
individual
comes
from
big
data
courts
could
require
when
available
a
numerical
prediction
of
accuracy
n
this
quantification
process
would
necessarily
result
in
courts
having
to
confront
the
ultimate
question
of
how
certain
a
police
officer
must
be
to
constitute
reasonable
suspicion
n
this
has
been
a
forbidden
discussion
in
the
courts
and
the
possibility
of
such
a
discussion
would
likely
forestall
any
adoption
of
this
proposal
yet
big
data
creates
the
promise
of
using
quantitative
and
empirical
evidence
to
refine
what
has
ordinarily
been
a
quasi
subjective
judgment
courts
and
police
could
adapt
this
hallmark
of
the
big
data
revolution
to
sharpen
the
reasonable
suspicion
analysis
thus
a
court
might
find
a
likelihood
of
to
be
insufficient
in
the
reasonable
suspicion
analysis
but
a
likelihood
of
to
be
enough
even
if
courts
were
unwilling
to
establish
a
particular
percentage
threshold
as
reasonable
suspicion
the
quantified
likelihood
could
still
be
included
in
the
totality
of
circumstances
calculation
related
to
this
threshold
determination
would
be
the
more
difficult
question
of
whether
the
threshold
should
change
depending
on
the
type
of
crime
at
issue
should
a
predictive
judgment
be
enough
for
a
murder
investigation
but
not
a
drug
crime
should
the
scale
be
a
sliding
one
based
on
risk
of
harm
to
society
n
again
going
back
to
first
principles
terry
involved
a
potential
armed
robbery
this
may
be
different
than
a
potential
shoplifting
offense
risk
assessment
mechanisms
already
exist
that
use
an
adjusted
actuarial
model
that
starts
with
a
fixed
percentage
and
then
adjusts
based
on
other
factors
n
while
not
perfectly
aligned
this
type
of
model
may
prove
useful
in
designing
a
quantifiable
percentage
that
courts
would
be
comfortable
adopting
at
this
early
stage
of
the
development
of
big
data
any
normative
argument
about
how
statistical
precision
should
be
incorporated
into
a
police
officer
s
calculations
will
ultimately
be
unsatisfying
the
algorithms
do
not
yet
exist
that
would
project
numerical
likelihoods
while
one
could
demand
a
specific
numerical
target
we
simply
do
not
know
how
big
data
technology
will
be
integrated
in
everyday
policing
nor
do
we
know
how
data
will
influence
police
officers
discretionary
decisions
the
focus
of
this
article
is
to
highlight
the
existence
of
big
data
policing
and
instead
of
ignoring
it
or
pretending
it
will
not
affect
police
officers
on
the
street
make
courts
and
scholars
aware
of
the
constitutional
concerns
precision
of
place
and
time
second
in
evaluating
big
data
s
influence
courts
could
focus
on
the
precision
of
the
data
in
terms
of
place
and
time
to
observe
how
the
data
correlate
with
the
predicted
suspicion
big
data
s
value
as
a
predictive
tool
involves
its
ability
to
drill
down
to
specific
factors
that
identify
a
specific
person
at
a
specific
time
at
a
specific
place
because
all
predictions
might
come
true
at
a
certain
level
of
abstraction
big
data
also
poses
risks
an
officer
who
sees
a
suspect
on
the
street
outside
the
jewelry
store
and
looks
up
the
suspect
s
criminal
history
which
includes
several
theft
convictions
would
at
one
level
have
persuasive
information
to
consider
in
the
totality
of
circumstances
if
after
further
examination
however
the
officer
found
that
the
thefts
were
exclusively
downloading
digital
music
the
data
would
not
support
suspicion
of
a
jewelry
store
robbery
or
if
the
timing
of
the
prior
thefts
were
several
years
old
or
in
another
state
the
correlation
might
not
be
strong
reliance
on
big
data
because
it
can
provide
granular
information
on
particular
events
or
linkages
should
also
necessitate
a
requirement
of
precision
a
requirement
of
geospatial
and
temporal
precision
would
provide
some
measure
of
protection
as
a
related
point
if
the
reasonable
suspicion
standard
incorporated
an
imminence
requirement
such
that
the
predicted
crime
must
be
imminent
or
occurring
the
general
suspicion
created
by
big
data
would
be
limited
such
a
requirement
would
conflict
with
hensley
which
allows
for
reasonable
suspicion
of
already
completed
crimes
n
but
would
provide
a
counterweight
to
the
power
of
general
suspicion
of
some
unstated
criminal
activity
police
officers
would
need
to
be
able
to
articulate
the
particular
crime
that
was
imminent
based
on
the
data
or
be
foreclosed
from
using
the
information
grafting
on
an
imminence
requirement
could
offer
more
protection
within
the
existing
reasonable
suspicion
analysis
requiring
a
heightened
level
of
technological
precision
is
consistent
with
general
fourth
amendment
principles
requiring
particularity
and
individualization
n
and
preventing
arbitrary
invasions
of
individual
security
n
in
addition
the
availability
of
big
data
sources
now
allows
for
this
level
of
specificity
the
question
for
reviewing
courts
will
be
whether
to
require
it
if
it
were
possible
to
obtain
more
particularized
information
from
available
sources
and
officers
choose
not
to
obtain
that
information
instead
relying
on
generalized
data
then
judges
like
they
routinely
do
with
warrants
could
deny
the
use
of
generalized
data
in
their
reasonable
suspicion
findings
judges
will
be
in
the
best
position
to
make
these
decisions
and
the
more
precision
that
judges
demand
the
more
incentive
there
will
be
for
police
to
generate
precise
information
to
support
their
suspicion
limited
link
analysis
finally
predictive
suspicion
must
embrace
the
cautions
arising
from
link
analysis
which
examines
the
connections
between
data
points
n
in
the
context
of
criminal
activity
link
analysis
refers
to
the
connections
between
criminals
and
between
crimes
though
link
analysis
can
help
find
matches
in
patterns
identify
anomalies
where
known
patterns
are
absent
and
discover
new
patterns
it
remains
fundamentally
overinclusive
there
will
always
be
links
that
demonstrate
nothing
suspicious
correlations
do
not
prove
causation
in
order
to
overcome
uncertainty
in
data
analysts
have
to
go
beyond
direct
links
sometimes
several
links
or
hops
out
and
instead
look
for
approximations
in
identifying
data
this
indirectness
invites
error
in
identification
people
have
the
same
names
n
people
are
related
to
criminals
without
being
criminals
themselves
people
forsake
the
criminal
life
n
in
a
wired
world
people
are
more
closely
connected
than
we
think
researchers
have
validated
the
six
degrees
of
separation
theory
in
the
information
age
n
one
study
of
facebook
users
showed
that
the
average
number
of
acquaintances
separating
any
two
people
in
the
world
was
not
six
but
n
thus
a
link
analysis
that
goes
out
three
hops
can
cast
a
very
wide
net
accidentally
capturing
many
people
who
are
only
suspicious
by
this
loose
associative
relationship
in
response
predictive
suspicion
based
on
link
analysis
must
demand
a
tighter
connection
between
suspects
courts
must
not
blindly
accept
associational
suspicion
created
by
an
algorithm
stretched
to
link
two
people
instead
the
link
must
be
tightly
controlled
currently
no
rules
govern
these
links
but
in
order
to
prevent
the
use
of
associational
correlations
to
determine
suspicion
some
tighter
limits
must
be
required
conclusion
the
question
that
opened
this
article
was
whether
a
fourth
amendment
stop
can
be
predicated
on
the
aggregation
of
specific
and
individualized
but
otherwise
noncriminal
factors
n
in
a
big
data
world
the
answer
appears
to
be
perhaps
troublingly
yes
if
those
particularized
factors
can
be
connected
to
observed
actions
for
those
who
are
concerned
that
the
reasonable
suspicion
standard
has
already
allowed
for
overly
aggressive
policing
discriminatory
policing
and
unaccountable
policing
this
conclusion
will
only
raise
the
level
of
concern
at
the
same
time
more
accurate
data
may
well
prevent
many
of
the
rough
justice
tactics
that
are
based
on
class
race
or
age
profiling
and
that
have
nothing
to
do
with
the
actual
individual
involved
in
either
case
the
rise
of
big
data
is
only
just
beginning
the
search
for
new
data
sources
and
connections
has
just
commenced
and
as
society
s
technological
capabilities
improve
the
law
must
similarly
evolve
police
officers
on
patrol
in
may
not
be
able
to
immediately
scan
a
crowd
to
reveal
identities
but
that
technology
is
coming
n
as
with
many
technological
innovations
the
law
has
lagged
behind
the
concerns
raised
in
this
article
will
soon
be
addressed
by
courts
forced
to
confront
how
to
evaluate
reasonable
suspicion
in
a
big
data
world
perhaps
this
change
will
involve
new
interpretations
of
the
reasonable
suspicion
standard
or
perhaps
courts
or
legislatures
will
adopt
wholly
new
legal
standards
but
the
law
will
have
to
adapt
because
the
current
small
data
reasonable
suspicion
standard
cannot
survive

with

whom
he
patrolman

knew
from
past
experience
to
be

the
officer
testified
that
he
did
not
overhear
any
of
these
conversations
and
that
he
did
not
see
anything
pass
between
sibron
and
any
of
the
others
late
in

sibron
entered
a

patrolman
martin
saw
sibron
speak
with
three
more
known
addicts
inside
the
restaurant
once
again
nothing
was
overheard
and
nothing
was
seen
to
pass
between
sibron
and
the
addicts
sibron
sat
down
and
ordered
pie
and
coffee
and
as
he
was
eating
patrolman
martin
approached
him
and
told
him
to
come
outside
once
outside
the
officer
said
to
sibron
you
know
what
i

after
according
to
the

sibron
mumbled
something
and
reached
into
his
pocket

thrust
his
hand
into

id
n

id
at
because
sibron
was
decided
on
the
same
day
as

there
is
some
debate
about
whether
the

found
the
search
unconstitutional
because
the
officer
lacked
probable
cause
to
search
or
because
the
police
lacked
reasonable
suspicion
to
stop
and
frisk
the
majority
opinion
echoed
the
reasonable
suspicion
language
in
terry
without
specifically
using
the
term
the
inference
that
persons
who
talk
to
narcotics
addicts
are
engaged
in
the
criminal
traffic
in
narcotics
is
simply
not
the
sort

reasonable

not
meet
the
terry
reasonableness
standard
in
the
first
place
although
association
with
known
criminals
may
i
think
properly
be
a
factor
contributing
to
the
suspiciousness
of
circumstances
it
does
not
entirely
by
itself
create
suspicion

to

j
concurring
n
id
at
the
officer
was
not
acquainted
with

and
had
no
information
concerning
him
he
merely
saw
sibron
talking
to
a
number
of
known
narcotics
addicts
over
a
period
of
eight
hours
it
must
be
emphasized
that
patrolman
martin
was
completely
ignorant
regarding
the
content
of
these
conversations
and
that
he
saw
nothing
pass
between
sibron
and
the
addicts
so
far
as
he
knew
they
might
indeed
have
been
talking
about

contradicting

that
dominate
the

it
also
distorts
perceptions

in
ways
that
have
lasting
policy
consequences
moreover
this
distortion
is
visited
especially
heavily
on
minority

and
constitutes
an
engine

in
its

it

text
introduction
technological
and
scientific
advances
in
recent
decades
have
enabled
an
unprecedented
level
of
surveillance
and
permitted
law
enforcement
to
gather
store
and
retrieve
in
real
time
enormous
amounts
of
data
from
computerized
rap
sheets
and
dna
databases
to
sex
offender
and
other
registries
records
of
a
person
s
contact
with
the
criminal
justice
system
no
longer
rest
in
a
file
folder
or
card
catalog
in
a
local
precinct
instead
they
reside
indefinitely
on
law
enforcement
servers
and
in
many
cases
the
publicly
searchable
internet
n
for
most
of
the
last
century
the
criminal
justice
system
limited
recordmaking
and
increased
the
confidentiality
of
data
about
juveniles
n
that
reticence
and
protectiveness
no
longer
prevails
because
it
has
been
overwhelmed
by
technology
and
a
fervid
commitment
to
data
collection
today
the
criminal
justice
system
collects
and
stores
a
tremendous
amount
of
information
about
juveniles
n
state
and
federal
laws
compel
thousands
of
young
people
to
register
as
sex
offenders
and
provide
personal
information
that
is
posted
online
and
mandate
dna
collection
from
juveniles
as
a
result
of
delinquency
adjudications
and
arrests
children
as
young
as
ten
years
old
are
entered
into
databases
of
known
and
suspected
gang
members
often
in
the
absence
of
an
arrest
or
even
a
suspicion
of
wrongdoing
public
schools
across
the
nation
are
required
to
notify
law
enforcement
when
students
commit
certain
behaviors
at
school
and
law
enforcement
agencies
return
the
favor
providing
schools
with
criminal
or
delinquency
information
n
all
of
this
supplements
the
information
collected
by
police
during
street
encounters
and
bookings
and
the
records
amassed
and
maintained
by
criminal
and
juvenile
courts
the
numbers
of
which
have
also
greatly
expanded
in
recent
years
public
and
private
services
aggregate
much
of
this
information
making
it
available
to
law
enforcement
nationwide
private
employers
public
housing
authorities
colleges
and
the
general
public
often
at
no
cost
n
in
the
late
s
roger
clarke
offered
the
term
dataveillance
as
a
way
to
conceptualize
the
new
forms
of
surveillance
facilitated
by
the
widespread
use
of
computer
based
technology
n
this
article
critically
examines
the
expansion
of
the
modern
culture
of
dataveillance
to
youth
collectively
the
robust
and
expanding
data
collection
and
distribution
practices
described
in
this
paper
produce
what
i
call
criminal
justice
biographies
of
young
people
n
these
one
sided
negative
biographies
written
by
a
coercive
institution
label
youth
in
permanent
and
stigmatizing
ways
this
harms
individual
youth
and
distorts
the
perceptions
of
them
as
a
group
with
lasting
policy
implications
yet
the
literature
on
law
enforcement
surveillance
on
the
one
hand
and
traditional
juvenile
justice
on
the
other
have
yet
to
recognize
much
less
fully
grapple
with
the
databasing
of
delinquency
this
article
reveals
the
incoherence
and
destructiveness
of
databasing
delinquency
and
argues
that
we
must
rethink
this
practice
mindful
of
the
public
safety
benefits
and
inevitability
of
law
enforcement
information
gathering
it
calls
for
reforms
that
limit
the
amount
of
information
gathered
stored
and
shared
about
juveniles
this
would
not
prevent
data
collection
but
would
instead
add
appropriate
restraints
so
that
public
safety
gains
from
databasing
do
not
come
at
the
expense
of
privacy

or

itself
part
i
sets
the
context
instead
of
widely
discussed
constitutional
protections
like
the
fourth
amendment
or
privacy
n
this
article
examines
delinquency
databasing
through
the
lens
of
the
constructed
category
of
childhood
too
little
legal
scholarship
has
critically
examined
the
role
of
the
concept
of
childhood
in
shaping
law
and
social
practices
and
the
role
that
law
and
social
practices
play
in
shaping
the
conceptions
of
childhood
n
this
vacuum
leaves
juvenile
justice
scholarship
less
nuanced
than
it
could
be
drawing
on
the
insights
of
critical
childhood
studies
n
part
i
establishes
the
prevailing
conception
of
childhood
as
a
protected
space
separate
from
adult
society
marshaling
adolescent
brain
science
psychosocial
research
and
recent
supreme
court
jurisprudence
it
shows
that
young
people
s
vulnerability
their
capacity
for
change
and
their
future
as
adult
members
of
society
each
play
an
important
background
role
in
guiding
public
policy
regarding
youth
part
ii
uncovers
the
vast
extent
of
modern
delinquency
databasing
it
explains
how
despite
youths
vulnerability
to
harm
and
capacity
for
change
juveniles
now
find
themselves
indefinitely
cataloged
in
sex
offender
registries
gang
databases
and
dna
databases
it
documents
the
unprecedented
breadth
and
permanence
of
law
enforcement
and
court
recordkeeping
it
shows
how
schools
have
become
mandated
law
enforcement
informants
and
it
maps
the
many
ways
that
this
information
travels
within
and
outside
of
the
criminal
justice
system
while
extensive
data
collection
and
publicly
available
criminal
records
can
be
a
rational
law
enforcement
strategy
that
promotes
public
safety
part
iii
identifies
the
many
harms
that
databasing
delinquency
inflicts
on
juveniles
they
include
devastating
impacts
on
their
immediate
lives
in
the
form
of
punishment
restrictions
on
their
life
choices
stigma
and
perhaps
increases
in
recidivism
compiled
early
in
the
life
of
their
subject
when
identities
and
character
are
still
taking
shape
n
and
skewed
in
content
these
criminal
justice
biographies
also
distort
perceptions
of
juveniles
in
ways
that
facilitate
support
for
punitive
policies
toward
youth
and
discrimination
against
them
this
distortion
and
discrimination
is
visited
especially
heavily
on
minority
youth
and
constitutes
an
engine
of
racial
bias
in
its
own
right
part
iii
further
shows
that
databasing
delinquency
reshapes
the
very
meaning
of
childhood
breaching
its
protected
space
and
contradicting
the
special
understandings
that
guide
the
regulation
of
youth
n
rather
than
honoring
the
particular
developmental
characteristics
of
youth
databasing
delinquency
ignores
them
and
treats
young
people
like
adults
this
contradicts
the
long
dominant
diversionary
approach
to
juvenile
wrongdoing
n
and
gainsays
the
fundamental
message
of
a
quartet
of
recent
supreme
court
cases
that
criminal
law
and
the
police
cannot
proceed
against
young
people
as
though
they
were
not
children
n
cognizant
that
this
is
a
critical
time
in
the
rebuilding
of
juvenile
justice
norms
n
part
iv
proposes
limitations
on
what
information
law
enforcement
should
gather
how
long
that
information
should
be
stored
and
with
whom
the
information
may
be
shared
the
principles
and
values
discussed
in
part
i
young
people
s
vulnerability
their
capacity
for
change
and
their
future
as
adult
members
of
society
inform
the
recommendations
the
proposed
reforms
would
reduce
the
short
and
long
term
harms
caused
by
databasing
delinquency
enabling
the
criminal
justice
system
to
promote
public
safety
and
hold
juveniles
accountable
without
unduly
hindering
their
development
into
productive
adults
i
childhood
we
recognize
and
accommodate
many
values
when
we
choose
how
to
marshal
technology
s
unprecedented
data
collection
abilities
for
law
enforcement
purposes
that
we
have
extended
the
reach
of
law
enforcement
dataveillance
to
juveniles
necessarily
injects
the
developmental
characteristics
of
youth
and
the
purpose
and
meaning
of
childhood
into
the
debate
therefore
a
brief
introduction
to
the
concept
of
childhood
is
necessary
childhood
is
an
essential
and
permanent
component
of
the
social
order
n
it
is
a
natural
fact
children
are
different
from
adults
in
known
and
measurable
ways
n
yet
childhood
marks
something
more
than
empirical
biological
realities
or
chronological
age
n
it
is
also
a
social
construction
a
contingent
category
whose
boundaries
are
not
inevitable
or
fixed
but
are
instead
defined
and
maintained
by
law
n
as
such
childhood
is
the
product
of
our
collective
imagination
reflecting
prevailing
societal
priorities
and
aspirations
n
this
leads
to
varying
definitions
of
the
scope
of
childhood
individuals
cannot
lawfully
drive
a
vehicle
until
sixteen
vote
until
eighteen
or
drink
alcohol
until
twenty
one
n
the
variety
in
cut
offs
is
inevitable
as
different
activities
require
different
levels
of
skill
or
maturity
wherever
the
lines
between
childhood
and
adulthood
rest
the
expressive
function
of
the
law
then
feeds
the
law
s
definition
s
of
childhood
back
to
society
shaping
or
reinforcing
popular
views
of
childhood
n
the
prevailing
conception
of
childhood
today
is
a
protected
space
separated
from
the
broader
adult
society
n
childhood
is
separate
from
adulthood
because
children
are
different
from
adults
and
require
their
own
spaces
rules
and
institutions
n
childhood
is
protected
because
young
people
are
vulnerable
they
make
mistakes
and
have
a
greater
capacity
for
change
than
adults
as
a
result
the
law
applies
special
rules
to
young
people
n
indeed
it
provides
an
entirely
separate
forum
for
adjudicating
juvenile
matters
n
that
delivers
youth
focused
services
and
developmentally
appropriate
levels
of
accountability
as
a
matter
of
first
principles
the
law
aims
to
avoid
imposing
harsh
enduring
consequences
and
stigmas
so
that
juveniles
do
not
carry
the
burden
of
their
youthful
mistakes
into
adulthood
n
the
ultimate
goal
is
to
shepherd
children
into
a
self
sufficient
democratic
productive
and
autonomous
adulthood
n
this
part
explains
how
three
foundational
truths
about
youth
that
they
are
vulnerable
that
they
change
and
that
they
are
future
adults
guide
the
law
s
approach
to
childhood
a
youth
are
vulnerable
young
people
by
definition
are
immature
juveniles
are
in
the
earlier
stages
of
their
emotional
growth
their
intellectual
development
is
incomplete
they
have
had
only
limited
practical
experience
and
their
value
systems
have
not
yet
been
clearly
identified
or
firmly
adopted
n
their
immaturity
profoundly
impacts
how
they
live
their
lives
first
and
foremost
it
makes
them
vulnerable
according
to
leading
juvenile
developmental
psychologist
laurence
steinberg
adolescence
is
often
a
period
of
especially
heightened
vulnerability
n
two
particular
vulnerabilities
of
youth
their
susceptibility
to
poor
decisionmaking
and
their
physical
and
emotional
immaturity
shape
the
legal
regulation
of
juveniles
juveniles
incomplete
cognitive
and
psychosocial
development
undermines
their
ability
to
make
competent
decisions
n
young
people
are
less
able
to
process
information
quickly
and
thoughtfully
and
have
less
general
knowledge
and
experience
to
draw
upon
leading
to
poorly
reasoned
choices
n
in
addition
adolescents
are
less
likely
to
consider
the
long
term
consequences
of
their
actions
and
are
more
reward
sensitive
and
less
risk
averse
than
adults
n
this
poor
impulse
control
is
compounded
by
the
fact
that
they
are
profoundly
attuned
to
and
influenced
by
peers
n
taken
together
these
qualities
often
lead
to
delinquent
behavior
indeed
largely
on
account
of
these
attributes
offending
peaks
during
late
adolescence
n
leading
many
to
consider
delinquency
a
part
of
the
normal
life
course
n
their
physical
and
emotional
immaturity
also
makes
youth
especially
vulnerable
to
harm
young
people
suffer
specific
and
often
greater
harms
as
youth
and
they
are
more
likely
to
suffer
them
because
of
their
youth
n
they
are
for
example
more
susceptible
to
suffering
psychological
harms
than
their
adult
counterparts
under
similar
circumstances
n
they
are
especially
vulnerable
to
victimization
in
adult
institutions
and
are
at
a
greater
risk
than
adult
inmates
of
psychological
harm
and
suicide
n
young
people
are
also
particularly
vulnerable
to
lasting
problems
as
a
result
of
stigma
including
mental
health
problems
substance
abuse
and
re
offending
n
moreover
particular
practices
such
as
a
life
long
criminal
record
or
a
life
without
parole
sentence
impose
greater
harms
on
juveniles
by
virtue
of
the
simple
fact
that
juveniles
will
live
with
the
sanction
longer
n
on
account
of
their
immaturity
and
vulnerability
the
regulation
of
youth
has
long
been
infused
with
the
idea
that
they
deserve
special
protections
n
this
protective
regime
first
came
to
legal
fruition
in
the
late
nineteenth
century
when
progressive
era
reformers
the
so
called
child
savers
passed
compulsory
education
laws
restricted
child
labor
and
created
the
child
welfare
system
and
juvenile
court
n
over
one
hundred
years
later
it
still
prevails
rules
protect
juveniles
from
being
subjected
to
the
same
procedures
and
punishments
imposed
on
adults
in
civil
tort
proceedings
for
example
children
are
judged
by
a
reasonable
person
of
like
age
intelligence
and
experience
under
like
circumstances
standard
that
leads
to
limited
civil
responsibility
for
damages
they
cause
n
to
protect
minors
from
foolishly
squandering
their
wealth
through
improvident
contracts
with
crafty
adults
who
would
take
advantage
of
them
in
the
marketplace
n
a
contracting
minor
may
repudiate
the
contract
at
any
time
before
reaching
majority
or
within
a
reasonable
time
afterwards
n
the
protective
approach
to
childhood
necessarily
includes
the
criminal
law
the
juvenile
court
was
founded
over
a
century
ago
on
the
proposition
that
children
are
different
from
adults
and
should
avoid
the
punitive
and
stigmatizing
consequences
imposed
by
criminal
court
n
it
survives
today
because
society
continues
to
recognize
that
youth
deserve
a
separate
more
protective
forum
that
will
impose
accountability
while
honoring
the
childhood
of
those
before
the
court
many
protections
extend
to
those
juveniles
processed
in
criminal
court
n
for
instance
the
supreme
court
has
held
that
the
death
penalty
cannot
be
constitutionally
imposed
on
juveniles
because
their
vulnerability
and
comparative
lack
of
control
over
their
immediate
surroundings
mean
juveniles
have
a
greater
claim
than
adults
to
be
forgiven
for
failing
to
escape
negative
influences
in
their
whole
environment
n
their
vulnerability
similarly
prevents
law
enforcement
from
ignoring
childhood
during
criminal
investigations
n
this
is
not
to
say
that
youth
are
innocents
while
vulnerable
juveniles
are
autonomous
actors
who
have
the
ability
to
recognize
right
from
wrong
and
they
exercise
that
autonomy
by
choosing
at
times
to
do
bad
things
n
moreover
they
require
and
respond
to
accountability
but
youths
reduced
culpability
and
increased
vulnerability
to
harm
mean
that
the
quantity
of
accountability
appropriate
for
juvenile
behavior
is
necessarily
limited
n
b
youth
change
young
people
are
developing
in
almost
every
arena
physically
biochemically
intellectually
emotionally
and
psychosocially
their
physical
bodies
undergo
a
growth
spurt
between
the
ages
of
ten
and
eighteen
n
and
neuroscientists
describe
adolescence
as
a
period
of
profound
social
cognitive
change
n
it
is
also
a
time
when
identity
is
taking
shape
and
character
forms
n
as
the
supreme
court
observed
the
signature
qualities
of
youth
are
transient
n
the
dynamism
of
youth
matters
greatly
to
the
law
s
response
to
juvenile
offending
as
explained
above
youths
immaturity
contributes
to
delinquent
behavior
yet
most
youth
desist
from
delinquency
as
they
mature
into
adulthood
n
studies
frequently
find
that
only
five
percent
to
ten
percent
of
adolescent
offenders
continue
offending
in
adulthood
n
this
is
because
many
of
the
factors
associated
with
antisocial
risky
or
criminal
behavior
lose
their
intensity
as
individuals
become
more
developmentally
mature
n
in
fact
it
has
proven
nearly
impossible
to
researchers
to
identify
which
few
among
the
many
youthful
offenders
will
persist
into
adulthood
n
courts
and
policymakers
have
regularly
affirmed
the
relevance
of
youths
capacity
for
change
to
the
proper
regulation
of
childhood
it
goes
a
long
way
in
explaining
why
juvenile
court
was
invented
and
why
it
aims
to
privilege
rehabilitation
over
punishment
the
notion
of
change
pervaded
the
words
of
one
of
the
nation
s
earliest
juvenile
court
judges
who
explained
that
the
purpose
of
the
juvenile
court
was
not
so
much
to
punish
as
to
reform
not
to
degrade
but
to
uplift
not
to
crush
but
to
develop
not
to
make
him
a
criminal
but
a
worthy
citizen
n
as
such
delinquency
adjudications
do
not
necessarily
become
part
of
a
young
person
s
permanent
criminal
record
n
instead
stricter
confidentiality
provisions
protect
them
against
disclosure
and
juvenile
court
records
typically
can
be
sealed
or
expunged
when
the
young
person
reaches
a
particular
age
n
youth
s
capacity
for
change
likewise
protects
them
when
they
are
charged
in
criminal
court
in
a
trio
of
recent
sentencing
cases
the
supreme
court
recognized
that
the
character
of
a
juvenile
is
not
as
well
formed
as
that
of
an
adult
and
that
their
personality
traits
are
more
transitory
less
fixed
n
because
juveniles
are
more
capable
of
change
than
are
adults
their
actions
are
less
likely
to
be
evidence
of
irretrievably
depraved
character
than
are
the
actions
of
adults
n
in
short
a
greater
possibility
exists
that
a
minor
s
character
deficiencies
will
be
reformed
n
as
a
result
the
law
seeks
to
protect
them
from
conclusive
judgments
and
permanent
legal
disabilities
according
to
the
supreme
court
from
a
moral
standpoint
it
would
be
misguided
to
equate
the
failings
of
a
minor
with
those
of
an
adult
n
the
constitution
thus
forbids
the
imposition
of
the
death
penalty
and
mandatory
life
without
parole
sentences
for
crimes
committed
by
youth
and
protects
youthful
offenders

a

limited

as
leading
critical
childhood
scholars
allison
james
and
adrian
james
observed
all
children
do
grow
up
and
in
doing
so
leave
their
childhood
behind
them
n
that
young
people
will
leave
childhood
and
become
adults
has
two
important
consequences
for
the
regulation
of
childhood
first
children
must
be
taught
social
norms
including
that
society
imposes
consequences
for
misbehavior
n
second
that
lesson
must
be
delivered
in
a
way
that
preserves
their
chances
for
a
productive
adulthood
n
the
juvenile
court
was
created
to
accomplish
both
those
tasks
n
its
purpose
was
to
divert
juveniles
from
the
criminal
process
and
its
debilitating
punishments
and
stigma
to
a
forum
where
their
cases
would
be
handled
by
trained
specialists
dedicated
to
imposing
accountability
while
promoting
the
youth
s
rehabilitation
n
because
children
are
future
adults
the
criminal
justice
system
as
a
whole
including
law
enforcement
and
criminal
courts
has
a
greater
interest
in
promoting
youth
development
and
rehabilitating
those
who
offend
than
punishing
stigmatizing
and
marginalizing
them
thus
some
jurisdictions
have
recently
sought
to
make
transfer
of
youth
charged
with
crimes
to
adult
court
more
difficult
n
and
attempted
to
minimize
the
consequences
for
youth
processed
in
criminal
court
through
legislatively
created
classifications
like
youthful
offender
status
n
other
statutes
limit
the
amount
of
restitution
juveniles
may
be
ordered
to
pay
to
avoid
saddling
them
with
debts
that
would
cripple
their
transition
to
independent
adulthood
n
these
policies
aim
to
protect
youth
from
full
accountability
to
preserve
their
future
life
chances
these
protective
impulses
reflect
the
view
that
severe
punishments
permanent
disabilities
and
lasting
stigma
for
youthful
mistakes
do
not
serve
the
long
term
interests
of
society
while
reforms
have
not
gone
as
far
as
they
might
n
the
vulnerability
of
youth
their
capacity
for
change
and
their
future
as
adults
have
taken
a
more
central
role
in
policymaking
in
the
twenty
first
century
one
notable
exception
to
this
trend
is
law
enforcement
data
collection
where
special
protections
for
youth
are
falling
away
compiling
criminal
justice
biographies
of
youth
disregards
their
vulnerability
discounts
their
capacity
for
change
and
makes
more
difficult
the
transition
to
adulthood

those
practices
ii
the

concerns
raised
by

people

ii
of
this
article
demonstrates
in
contrast
to
decades
of
practices
that
mostly
shielded
young
people
from
accumulating
law
enforcement
records
the
criminal
justice
system
today
largely
treats
juveniles
like
adults
when
it
comes
to
the
collection
and
retention
of
information
all
told
the

justice
system
collects
a
remarkable
amount
of
information
about
youth
contacts
with
police
suspicions
misbehavior
arrests
charges
convictions
and
sentences
but
it
is
not
just
criminal
information
that
is
being
collected
stored
and
shared
law
enforcement
collects
genetic
samples
from
juveniles
it
catalogs
their
friends
family
associations
and
movements
and
the
law
requires
that
personal
information
of
youth
convicted
or
adjudicated
delinquent
of
sex
offenses
such
as
their
home
address
and
school
be
posted

linked

n
anticipating
that
these

will
become
offenders
law
enforcement
seeks
to
gather
as
much
information
as
it
can
about
them
the
modern
tool
it
uses
to
collect
organize
and
disseminate
intelligence
information
prior
to
a
criminal
case
is
the
gang
database
gang
databases
are
repositories
for
information
about
known
and
suspected
gang
members
the
los
angeles
county
sheriff
s
department
instituted
the
first
modern
gang
database
in
n
similar
gang
databases
are
now
maintained
across
the
nation
at
the
local
state
and
federal
levels
n
gang
databases
can
include
almost
anything
but
typically
record
the
youth
s
name
address
dress
tattoos
locations
behaviors
criminal
histories
vehicles
school
family
and
friends
n
law
enforcement
collects
the
information
entered
into
the
database
primarily
through
routine
stops
on
the
street
and
in
schools
n
gang
membership
is
not
a
crime
and
a
conviction
is
not
necessary
before
an
individual
s
information
can
be
entered
into
a
gang
database
n
indeed
neither
an
arrest
nor
a
criminal
investigation
need
precipitate
the
categorization
of
a
youth
as
gang
involved
n
instead
police
decide
who
gets
included
n
inclusion
can
be
triggered
by
street
encounters
with
police
self
admission
or
a
combination
of
other
indicators
in
some
jurisdictions
qualifying
criteria
are
statutory
while
that
ostensibly
limits
police
discretion
the
qualifying
criteria
can
include
vague
and
perfectly
lawful
things
such
as
being
in
a
photograph
with
a
known
gang
member
corresponding
with
known
gang
members
frequenting
a
gang
area
or
wearing
certain
clothing
n
in
victor
rios
s
study
of
oakland
youth
he
described
how
a
fifteen
year
old
who
was
not
in
a
gang
ended
up
in
a
gang
database
after
he
was
attacked
while
sitting
on
his
front
door
steps
talking
with
friends
n
because
the
attackers
were
gang
members
detectives
assumed
that
the
victim
was
as
well
and
registered
him
as
an
active
gang
member
n
the
broad
criteria
for
inclusion
in
gang
databases
and
the
discretion
afforded
to
law
enforcement
in
deciding
whom
to
include
make
it
difficult
for
young
people
living
in
gang
heavy
communities
to
avoid
qualifying
criteria
law
enforcement
s
desire
to
collect
as
much
intelligence
and
potential
evidence
as
possible
about
those
it
expects
to
be
offenders
encourages
it
to
be
over
inclusive
in
its
classifications
n
the
lack
of
age
limits
for
inclusion
in
gang
databases
means
that
children
as
young
as
ten
are
present
in
gang
databases
n
while
the
particularities
of
gang
databases
vary
most
use
a
software
platform

the
aggregation
and
organization
of

of

highest
penalty
possible
in

related
prosecutions
n
school
officials
use
gang
information
to
direct
security
resources
and
assign
counseling
resources
n
the
structure
and
management
of
gang
databases
make
it
difficult
if
not
impossible
to
know
whether
a
particular
person
has
been
classified
as
a
gang
member
the
information
in
gang
databases
is
not
publicly
available
according
to
the
california
attorney
general
website
release
of
calgang
r
criminal
intelligence
information
is
on
a
right
to
know
a
law
enforcement
officer
and
need
to
know
legitimate
law
enforcement
purpose
basis
only
n
only
a
few
gang
databases
have
provisions
that
require
law
enforcement
to
notify
parents
when
youth
are
classified
as
gang
members
n
moreover
law
enforcement
typically
does
not
offer
a
procedure
for
individuals
to
contest
their
inclusion
or
to
seek
or
confirm
their
purging
from
a
gang
database
this
means
that
youth
classified
as
gang
involved
by
police
can
remain
in
a
gang
database
often
unbeknownst
to
them
for
years
even
where
purging
procedures
are
in
place
they
are
rarely
carried
out
n
there
is
little
incentive
for
law
enforcement
to
purge
records
from
their
intelligence
databases
and
because
of
how
the
guidelines
governing
many
gang
databases
work
purging
is
allowed
only
if
no
new
information
is
entered
regarding
an
individual
for
two
or
five
years
n
police
can
intentionally
avoid
purging
by
checking
in
on
someone
regularly
entering
gang
related
information
gained
during
the
encounter
perhaps
about
friends
or
family
members
of
the
juvenile
though
gang
databases
are
not
publicly
available
and
despite
the
fact
that
many
youth
never
know
they
have
been
classified
by
law
enforcement
as
a
gang
member
the
information
in
gang
databases
leaks
beyond
law
enforcement
as
a
general
matter
criminal
law
scholar
james
jacobs
noted
that
once
information
is
entered
into
an
investigative
or
intelligence
database
it
can
easily
migrate
to
other
public
and
private
databases
and
therefore
can
become
more
difficult
to
purge
or
edit
effectively
n
specific
studies
of
gang
database
information
have
found
this
to
be
true
according
to
one
study
information
collected
in
calgang
has
been
shared
with
employers
landlords
public
housing
and
section
and
school
administrators
n
others
have
found
that
police
share
gang
information
with
schools
n
b
schools
as
informants
schools
have
increasingly
become
a
contact
point
for
youth
and
the
criminal
justice
system
scholars
in
many
fields
including
law
education
political
science
and
sociology
have
traced
the
rise
of
the
culture
of
control
in
the
classroom
and
its
devastating
impacts
on
youth
n
from
metal
detectors
and
fingerprint
identification
required
for
entry
to
video
surveillance
and
police
presence
on
campuses
schools
are
policed
more
than
ever
n
in
addition
schools
have
criminalized
normal
adolescent
behavior
pushing
and
shoving
has
become
battery
swiping
a
classmate
s
headphones
has
become
theft
or
robbery
and
talking
back
to
staff
has
become
disorderly
conduct
or
obstructing
n
as
a
result
young
people
are
intentionally
and
increasingly
diverted
from
the
classroom
to
the
juvenile
and
criminal
justice
systems
n
these
practices
are
particularly
prevalent
in
urban
public
schools
attended
primarily
by
minority
youth
n
a
disparity
that
is
not
explained
by
more
frequent
or
more
serious
misbehavior
by
students
of
color
n
the
upshot
of
these
changes
is
that
schools
are
less
likely
to
handle
disciplinary
matters
internally
n
this
criminalization
of
school
discipline
n
makes
schools
the
first
institution
in
which
most
youth
have
an
opportunity
to
be
marked
as
failures
criminals
or
deviants
n
the
fact
that
schools
increasingly
turn
to
law
enforcement
to
deal
with
misbehavior
reinforces
the
perceived
criminality
of
the
acts
in
the
last
two
decades
legislatures
across
the
country
have
turned
schools
into
mandated
informants
requiring
school
officials
to
report
to
law
enforcement
a
wide
variety
of
behaviors
and
suspected
acts
by
students
at
school
as
a
result
all
sorts
of
behavior
and
suspicions
that
in
the
past
would
have
stayed
on
campus
are
now
shared
with
law
enforcement
n
this
leads
to
more
criminal
justice
contact
for
youth
disruptions
in
their
education
and
negative
outcomes
n
one
main
reason
that
schools
are
now
in
the
collecting
and
reporting
business
is
that
congress
has
incentivized
it
two
major
pieces
of
legislation
do
most
of
the
work
the
improving
america
s
schools
act
of
provided
funds
to
public
schools
that
demonstrated
an
existing
crime
problem
compelling
schools
nationwide
to
develop
data
collection
systems
and
define
crimes
broadly
so
that
they
could
qualify
for
federal
funds
n
many
of
these
funds
were
spent
on
school
police
partnerships
such
as
hiring
security
or
law
enforcement
officers
to
patrol
school
campuses
n
the
mere
presence
of
these
officers
both
facilitates
reporting
and
makes
more
crime
possible
as
refusing
to
follow
the
orders
of
these
school
security
officers
is
a
crime
n
then
in
the
no
child
left
behind
act
required
school
districts
receiving
federal
funds
to
have
a
policy
requiring
that
any
student
who
brings
a
firearm
or
weapon
to
school
be
referred
to
law
enforcement
n
with
federal
money
tied
to
documenting
crime
in
school
and
reporting
it
to
law
enforcement
it
is
no
surprise
that
almost
all
states
require
school
officials
to
report
to
law
enforcement
suspected
violent
crimes
or
incidents
that
involve
deadly
weapons
or
dangerous
instruments
n
other
states
go
much
farther
many
including
california
require
schools
to
report
when
students
use
sell
or
possess
drugs
or
alcohol
n
connecticut
requires
principals
to
notify
law
enforcement
when
the
principal
believes
that
any
acts
of
bullying
constitute
criminal
conduct
n
and
illinois
requires
principals
to
notify
law
enforcement
of
each
incident
of
intimidation
and
each
alleged
incident
of
intimidation
which
is
reported
to
him
or
her
n
kansas
requires
an
immediate
report
to
law
enforcement
by
or
on
behalf
of
any
school
employee
who
knows
or
has
reason
to
believe
that
a
misdemeanor
was
committed
at
school
or
a
school
supervised
activity
n
given
the
funding
incentives
schools
are
likely
to
err
on
the
side
of
reporting
even
when
they
do
not
believe
or
know
that
an
act
constitutes
a
crime
the
failure
of
a
school
employee
to
report
incidents
to
law
enforcement
can
carry
consequences
for
example
it
is
a
class
b
misdemeanor
in
kansas
to
willfully
and
knowingly
fail
to
report
suspected
crimes
to
law
enforcement
n
and
it
is
an
infraction
punishable
by
a
fine
of
up
to
in
california
for
any
employee
of
a
school
district
who
is
attacked
assaulted
or
physically
threatened
by
any
pupil
to
not
promptly
report
the
incident
to
the
appropriate
law
enforcement
authorities
n
schools
are
not
just
sharing
behavioral
information
with
law
enforcement
reports
have
surfaced
of
schools
sharing
records
with
noncriminal
justice
government
agencies
such
as
immigration
enforcement
authorities
n
information
also
flows
from
law
enforcement
to
the
schools
at
least
nineteen
states
now
require
courts
or
law
enforcement
agencies
to
provide
criminal
or
delinquency
information
to
schools
n
c
police
and
court
records
while
gang

relatively
recent

nothing
new

the
quantity

that
can
be
gathered
and
the
ability
to
retrieve
that
information
at
will
at
the
same
time
the

has
expanded
the
kind
and

of
information
it
keeps
about

are
increasingly

n
policing
data
legislatures
and
law
enforcement
have
a
history
of
restricting
law
enforcement
s
ability
to
create
records
of
juveniles
for
decades
most
states
prohibited
police
or
juvenile
authorities
from
taking
fingerprints
or
photographs
of
juvenile
suspects
unless
taking
them
was
necessary
to
an
investigation
or
was
otherwise
approved
by
a
court
n
such
restrictions
were
an
extension
of
the
efforts
to
protect
the
identities
of
juveniles
and
to
make
their
contact
with
the
police
and
the
court
less
like
that
experienced
by
adult
offenders
n
by
restricting
the
practice
they
sought
to
safeguard
the
child
from
unwarranted
indicia
of
misconduct
becoming
a
part
of
police
and
court
records
and
protect
their
privacy
n
identity
records
of
juveniles
once
created
benefitted
from
enhanced
confidentiality
and
other
protections
compared
to
adult
law
enforcement
records
juvenile
records
kept
by
police
were
typically
held
in
decentralized
local
systems
apart
from
adult
criminal
records
n
this
confined
knowledge
about
a
juvenile
s
prior
contact
with
the
police
to
the
juvenile
s
locality
statutory
confidentiality
combined
with
sealing
and
expungement
provisions
further
ensured
against
any
lasting
effect
of
criminal
records
n
these
practices
continued
well
into
the
late
twentieth
century
as
recently
as
only
a
quarter
of
law
enforcement
agencies
fingerprinted
juveniles
n
today
these
protections
have
faded
juvenile
law
enforcement
records
increasingly
resemble
adult
law
enforcement
records
they
are
more
regularly
created
include
more
information
are
stored
with
adult
records
and
are
more
widely
available
nearly
every
state
allows
juveniles
to
be
fingerprinted
at
arrest
n
all
states
allow
juvenile
arrestees
to
be
photographed
and
nearly
all
send
information
about
juvenile
arrestees
to
statewide
repositories
n
the
fbi
authorizes
the
inclusion
of
juvenile
criminal
history
record
information
in
the
fbi
s
national
crime
information
center
ncic
database
on
the
same
basis
as
adult
records
n
the
supreme
court
has
held
that
the
media
cannot
be
stopped
from
disclosing
a
juvenile
arrestee
s
identity
as
long
as
it
acquired
the
information
lawfully
n
the
impact
of
eroded
protections
for
youth
has
been
multiplied
because
technology
has
enabled
law
enforcement
to
record
store
organize
and
retrieve
more
data
than
ever
a
traditional
method
for
police
to
gather
information
on
individuals
is
the
field
interview
fi
card
known
by
different
names
these
are
forms
filled
out
by
police
officers
after
encounters
with
individuals
n
they
record
pedigree
information
such
as
name
address
and
date
of
birth
and
details
about
the
encounter
n
police
often
complete
fi
cards
after
routine
encounters
done
without
probable
cause
a
great
many
of
which
did
not
end
in
an
arrest
n
the
fi
card
practice
has
been
transformed
by
technology
law
enforcement
staff
used
to
record
and
organize
the
information
by
hand
a
laborious
manual
entry
process
the
information
is
now
aggregated
and
stored
in
computers
making
it
easy
to
search
and
retrieve
software
companies
have
developed
computer
and
smartphone
applications
that
allow
officers
to
complete
fi
cards
using
their
smartphones
n
these
applications
eliminate
the
need
to
manually
enter
information
recorded
by
the
officer
on
the
paper
form
into
a
database
because
both
processes
happen
at
once
this
reduces
the
amount
of
time
required
for
data
entry
enabling
law
enforcement
to
record
more
information
after
more
encounters
n
it
also
makes
retrieval
and
analysis
of
the
information
gathered
much
easier
the
archetypal
police
record

of

and
prosecution

is
a
lifetime
record
of
an
individual

at
the
beginning
of
the
twentieth
century
the
rap
sheet
was
created
by
police
for

use
to
enable
police
to
link
records
with
people
n
rap
sheets
are
no
longer
just
for
the
police
congress

states
have
directly
authorized
certain
industries

other
groups
to
obtain
criminal
histories
from
the

in
the

some
seventeen
million
criminal
background
checks
for
employment
and
licensing
purposes
made
possible
by
networked
computers
n
moreover
some
police
departments
go
beyond
what
constitutional
and
statutory
law
requires
aggressively
disseminating
arrestee
information
n
as
a
result
a
system
created
by
police
for
the
police
is
now
more
often
used
to
provide
criminal
biographies
for
non
criminal
justice
purpose
n
law
enforcement
agencies
across
the
nation
also
maintain
a
variety
of
intelligence
databases
that
store
much
more
than
just
records
of
arrests
including
the
gang
databases
already
mentioned
as
well
as
tattoo
databases
birthmark
and
scar

teeth
databases
and
many
others
n
information
in
these
databases
comes
from
all
the
information
collected
by
officers
during
street
encounters
and
reported
in
fi
cards
as
well
as
from
bookings
calls
complaints
by

reports
on

and
moving

n

databases
collect
images
taken
at

and
those

n
the
granddaddy
of
all
law

databases
is
the

for
those

n
convictions

court
records
are
recorded
as
they
are
for
adults
other
than
the
limited
availability
of
youthful
offender
status
and
its
narrow
protections
no
special
provisions
protect
the
records
of
juveniles
convicted
in
criminal
court
n
this
is
significant
because
criminal
court
records
have
long
been
available
for
public
inspection
according
to
jacobs
only
the
united
states
and
canada
permit
anyone
to
look
at
case
files
without
having
to
persuade
a
judge
or
clerk
that
she
has
a
good
reason
to
see
the

n
before
the
computerization
of
court
records
though
they
were
difficult
to
access
n
review
required
physical
travel
to
the
local
courthouse
or
record
repository
and
time
spent
retrieving
and
reviewing
the
records
today
court
records
are
much
more
accessible
meaning
that
police
and
non
law
enforcement
personnel
can
access
an
individual
s
court
history
with
minimal
effort
most
state
court
systems
have
websites
that
allow
anyone
sometimes
for
a
fee
to
search
docket
sheets
and
retrieve
criminal
court
record
information
on
individuals
approximately
twenty
state
court
systems
sell
copies
of
their
criminal
court
docket
sheets
to
commercial
information
vendors
n
the
vast
majority
of
juveniles
charged
with
crimes
have
their
cases
handled
in
a
juvenile
court
instead
of
a
criminal
court
n
consistent
with
the
institution
s
diversionary
aim
to
prevent
children
from
being
treated
as
criminals
n
juvenile
courts
have
offered
more
robust
protections
against
the
creation
of
a
criminal
dossier
at
its
inception
juvenile
court
proceedings
were
held
in
private
before
only
a
judge
and
not
a
jury
by
design
such
proceedings
were
not
criminal
and
resulted
in
something
other
than
a
criminal
conviction
n
most
states
limited
disclosure
of
information
about
juveniles
adjudications
and
required
court
case
files
to
be
automatically
sealed
when
the
juvenile
turned
twenty
one
n
when
judicial
opinions
regarding
delinquency
proceedings
were
issued
they
protected
a
juvenile
s
identity
by
using
the
juvenile
s
initials
instead
of
her
full
name
many
of
these
protective
policies
remain
today
there
still
are
no
juries
n
and
case
opinions
continue
to
mask
the
juvenile
s
identity
delinquency
adjudications
do
not
necessarily
become
part
of
a
young
person
s
permanent
criminal
record
instead
stricter
confidentiality
provisions
protect
against
disclosure
of
juvenile
adjudications
and
juvenile
court
records
typically
can
be
sealed
or
expunged
at
a
particular
age
n
but
as
with
police
records
these
confidentiality
provisions
have
eroded
over
time
juvenile
court
proceedings
today
are
less
likely
to
be
closed
to
the
public
n
juvenile
court
records
are
also
more
broadly
available
as
no
state
completely
protects
juvenile
court
records
from
dissemination
to
certain
entities
outside
the
court
and
law
enforcement
n
only
nine
states
require
a
court
order
before
juvenile
court
records
can
be
released
only
eighteen
states
ensure
that
juvenile
record
information
is
not
available
to
the
public
or
accessible
on
any
online
database
n
in
maine
for
example
anyone
can
obtain
a
person
s
delinquency
adjudications
for
a
thirty
one
dollar
fee
n
juvenile
records
can
be
obtained
in
florida
for
twenty
four
dollars
n
arizona
and
idaho
provide
no
confidentiality
protections
to
juvenile
court
records
n
compounding
the
significance
of
this
confidentiality
erosion
the
supreme
court
has
also
ruled
that
state
laws
cannot
protect
testifying
witnesses
from
impeachment
by
these
juvenile
records
n
while
juvenile
courts
used
to
seal
or
expunge
juvenile
court
records
on
their
own
initiative
today
only
five
states
automatically
expunge
juvenile
records
n
in
all
other
states
the
youth
or
another
party
must
file
a
petition
and
convince
a
court
at
a
hearing
to
seal
or
expunge
a
juvenile
court
record
n
in
many
of
those
states
youth
are
not
advised
of
their
obligation
to
initiate
sealing
or
expungement
and
as
a
result
many
do
not
even
when
juveniles
do
initiate
sealing
or
expungement
procedures
more
than
half
the
states
include
statutory
exceptions
to
sealing
and
expungement
based
on
age
at
time
of
offense
the
nature
of
the
offense
and
the
amount
of
time
that
has
passed
since
the
case
was
closed
n
the
end
result
is
that
police
and
courts
create
more
records
about
youth
than
ever
the
records
last
longer
and
they
are
more
accessible
by
those
outside
of
courts
and
law
enforcement
than
ever
before
d
dna
databases
another
controversial
criminal
justice
practice
that
has
similarly
expanded
to
include
juveniles
is
dna
profiling
in
short
it
works
as
follows
a
biological
sample
containing
a
person
s
entire
genetic
code
is
collected
via
buccal
swab
or
blood
draw
n
and
analyzed
by
a
laboratory
to
create
a
dna
profile
n
dna
profiles
are
then
entered
into
one
or
more
government
databases
n
the
combined
dna
information
system
codis
is
a
software
program
that
facilitates
the
matching
of
the
dna
profiles
of
known
offenders
or
arrestees
to
profiles
generated
from
crime
scene
dna
evidence
n
dna
databasing
is
a
powerful
tool
that
makes
it
possible
to
solve
crimes
quickly
and
confidently
including
very
old
crimes
and
can
even
exonerate
the
wrongfully
convicted
n
collection
of
biological
samples
is
accomplished
primarily
through
contact
with
the
criminal
justice
system
the
federal
government
and
all
fifty
states
compel
dna
collection
from
anyone
convicted
of
a
felony
in
criminal
court
n
in
every
state
except
hawaii
this
includes
any
juvenile
convicted
of
any
felony
in
criminal
court
n
all
but
four
states
also
mandate
collection
from
all
persons
convicted
of
certain
misdemeanors
including
juveniles
n
dna
collection
from
juveniles
is
not
limited
to
those
charged
as
adults
twenty
nine
states
compel
dna
samples
from
juveniles
following
a
finding
of
juvenile
delinquency
n
of
those
twenty
nine
states
twenty
collect
dna
for
all
felony
adjudications
while
nine
collecting
only
for
a
subset
of
felony
adjudications
n
nineteen
states
mandate
dna
collection
from
juveniles
adjudicated
delinquent
for
a
misdemeanor
n
neither
a
conviction
nor
a
delinquency
adjudication
is
a
necessary
predicate
for
dna
collection
in
some
states
a
mere
arrest
can
trigger
compulsory
dna
collection
as
of
the
federal
government
and
twenty
seven
states
require
individuals
arrested
but
not
yet
convicted
or
adjudicated
delinquent
to
provide
dna
samples
n
of
the
twenty
seven
nineteen
permit
collection
from
juveniles
at
arrest
n
law
enforcement
also
acquires
dna
samples
from
juveniles
based
on
consent
most
notable
in
this
regard
is
orange
county
california
s
dna
collection
and
crime
deterrence
program
known
colloquially
as
the
spit
and
acquit
program
n
in
place
since
spit
and
acquit
permits
individuals
who
are
arrested
to
have
their
charges
dismissed
or
reduced
if
they
provide
law
enforcement
with
a
dna
sample
n
this
dna
collection
initiative
has
reportedly
generated
over
dna
profiles
n
the
program
does
not
restrict
collection
from
juveniles
even
in
the
absence
of
such
organized
dna
collection
initiatives
law
enforcement
seeks
dna
samples
from
juveniles
based
on
consent
for
example
police
went
to
albert
einstein
middle
school
in
sacramento
california
to
obtain
dna
cheek
swabs
from
adolescents
as
part
of
a
murder
investigation
n
authorities
in
brighton
colorado
similarly
acquired
consent
based
dna
samples
from
a
twelve
and
eleven
year
old
when
their
parents
were
not
home
as
part
of
an
investigation
into
car
break
ins
n
all
told
law
enforcement
has
already
compiled
dna
profiles
of
hundreds
of
thousands
of
juveniles
n
going
forward
as
many
as
several
hundred
thousand
juveniles
could
be
required
each
year
to
provide
a
genetic
sample
for
purposes
of
dna
profiling

while
most
criminal

for

use
some

a
much
broader
purpose
they
seek
to
publicize
criminal
record
information
about
those
who
have
committed
particularly
heinous
offenses
in
doing
so
they
enable
public
shaming
and
lasting
discrimination
the
leading
example
of
these
data
systems
are
sex

various
federal
and
state
laws
juveniles

not
specify
whether

the
states
decided
themselves
whether
such

were
subject
to

feel

the

research
has
shown

delinquent

criminal
labels
embed
juveniles
into
deviant
social
groups
through
association
and
exclusion

in
some
cases
the
stigmatized
person
is
thought
to
be
so
different
from

as
to
be
not
really
human
n
this
has
certainly
happened
with
juvenile
offenders
most
infamously
in
the
mid
s
when
john
diiulio
described

as
severely
morally
impoverished

super
predators
n
these
attitudes

your
youthful

labels
are

fulfilling
prophecies
when

are
identified
as

are
more
likely
to
act

delinquency
databasing
communicates
to
the
juveniles
subject
to
it
that
the
state
believes
they
already
committed
crimes
that

collection
will
help
solve
and
that
they
will
commit
crimes
in
the

then
internalize
this
label

leads
to
marginalization

additional

recent
research
has
suggested
a
slightly
different
mechanism
for
how
stigmatic
criminal
labels
impact
individuals
and
lead
to
deviance

labeling
theory
posits
that
the
individual
s
desire
to
manage
shame
leads
him
to
follow
strategies
such
as
withdrawal
and
secrecy
which
generate
secondary
deviance
n
sex
offender
registration
and
community
notification
requirements
for
example
cause
sex
offenders
to
isolate
themselves
in
the
community
away
from
support
systems
that
help
prevent
recidivism
n
the
harm
is
magnified
for
juveniles
the
label
of
sex
offender
child
molester
or
sexual
predator
can
cause
profound
damage
to
a
child
s
development
and
self
esteem
n
the
stigma
continues
even
when
a
juvenile
is
no
longer
subject
to
registration
and
law
enforcement
no
longer
publishes
her
information
on
a
website
n
perhaps
it
is
no
surprise
then
that
evidence
indicates
that
sex
offender
registration
actually
raises
the
risk
of
recidivism
amongst
juveniles
n
likewise
including
marginal
youth

gang
databases
so
called
wannabes
n
potentially
drives
them
into
gang
membership
because
they
are
being
treated
as
and
known
as
gang
members
n
rather
than
reducing
the
crime
problem
linked
to
gangs
it
exacerbates
it
the
same
effect
appears
when

the
first
social
institution

most

have
an
opportunity
to
be
marked

one
international
court
has
recognized
the
risk
of
stigmatization
brought
by
collecting

stigmatic
labels

criminal
justice
actors

others
to
stop
seeing

this
is
the
external
stigma

follows
which
is
then
accompanied
by
formal
and
informal
discrimination
n
it
should
not
be

less
mobility
than

making
it
more
difficult
for
them
to
escape
from
a
community
in

has
cast

character
n
indeed
experts
agree
that

to
predict

will
persist
into

n
therefore
because

information
has
much
less
value
than
it
does

in

less
deterrable

is
minimal

andrew
guthrie
ferguson
has
shown
how
police
access
to
the
kind
of
data
gathered
in
these

makes
it
easier
for
law
enforcement
to
believe
that

cause
exists
to
arrest
an

according
to
guthrie
ferguson
if
officers
view

individualized
and
particularized
identifying
characteristics
such
as
prior
convictions

associations
and
gps
coordinates

the
scene
of
the

innocent
actions
might
create

standard

of

stops
after
they
were
erroneously
entered

the

be

this
proclivity

heightens
the
harmful
impact
of

discussed
in
the
next
section
that
the
mistaken

widely
distributed

the

the
false

likely
remains

n
the
inaccuracy
problem
could
be
minimized
if
law

offered
a
procedure
for
youth
to
seek
or
confirm
the
purging
of
their
information
from
a
database
but
it
rarely
does
as
described
above
those
required
to

cannot
exit
the

they
can
provide

available
in

is
difficult

the
burden
to
initiate
and

is
almost
always
placed
on
the

procedures
are
in
place
they
are
rarely
carried
out
n
by
storing
negative
information

including
inaccurate

databasing
delinquency
ignores
the
foundational
principle

instead

a

label

increase

itself
troublesome
as
law
and
philosophy
scholar
anita
allen
has
explained
accountability
for
conduct
is
a
pervasive
feature
of
human
association
n
accountability
includes
being
accountable
to
individuals
often
in
the
form
of
providing
information
about
oneself
and
accountable
for
conduct
typically
in
the
form
of
negative
consequences
for
wrongs
n
criminal
law
and
law
enforcement
are
strong
forms
of
accountability
modern
surveillance
and
the
data
collection
practices
discussed
above
represent
a
technologically
supercharged
form
of
informational
accountability
n
some
amount
of
accountability
is
necessary
to
regulate
childhood
n
as
future
full
members
of
society
children
must
be
taught
social
norms
and
learn
that
society
imposes
consequences
for
misbehavior
n
no
one
maintains
that
children
not
be
held
to
some
amount
of
accountability
under
the
law
the
characteristics
that
define
youth
however
mean
that
the
quantity
of
accountability
appropriate
during
childhood
is
necessarily
limited
n
and
the
harms
imposed
by
databasing
delinquency
which
frustrate
juveniles
ability
to
succeed
in
adulthood
go
too
far
b
databasing
undermines
childhood
childhood
is
fragile
n
shifts
in
public
mood
can
lead
to
profound
changes
in
the
rights
and
responsibilities
of
young
people
one
such
shift
took
place
in
the
late
s
and
s
when
a
spike
in
violent
crime
by
young
people
triggered
a
moral
panic
about
juvenile
offending
n
events
like
the
central
park
jogger
case
where
five
youth
were
convicted
of
a
beating
and
rape
that
left
a
woman
comatose
a
crime
it
turned
out
that
none
of
the
five
committed
n
and
school
shootings
like
the
one
at
columbine
high
school
n
ignited
the
panic
academics
in
the
popular
press
fueled
the
flame
by
promising
a
coming
generation
of
severely
morally
impoverished
juvenile
super
predators
n
in
the
public
eye
juveniles
ceased
to
be
wayward
youth
in
need
of
help
and
became
hardened
criminals
in
need
of
being
locked
up
n
reforms
throughout
the
criminal
justice
system
led
to
more
juveniles
being
increasingly
treated
like
and
punished
alongside
adults
n
sentences
increased
and
laws
changed
permitting
the
prosecution
of
more
juveniles
in
criminal
court
the
supreme
court
refused
to
extend
or
recognize
special
protections
for
youth
n
confidentiality
waned
as
the
authors
of
a
report
on
juvenile
records
wrote
if
an
individual
wishes
to
be
protected
under
the
law
then
that
individual
must
first
act
within
the
law
when
a
juvenile
chooses
a
lifestyle
of
crime
and
violence
that
individual
should
not
expect
to
have
these
activities
shielded
from
disclosure
to
others
n
juvenile
justice
scholar
franklin
zimring
calls
this
the
forfeiture
theory
where
loss
of
the
protected
status
of
youth
becomes
in
effect
one
penal
consequence
of
the
forbidden
act
n
juveniles
who
break
the
law
are
seen
as
having
forfeited
by
their
conduct
the
protections
typically
afforded
to
youth
n
the
forfeiture
happens
despite
their
remaining
chronologically
developmentally
and
legally
children
as
zimring
observed
there
is
certainly
no
logically
necessary
reason
that
protective
features
of
youth
policy
are
only
for
nice
kids
n
databasing
delinquency
is
a
stout
and
expanding
remnant
of
the
forfeiture
era
it
subjects
juveniles
to
record
practices
and
consequences
akin
to
those
for
adults
including
juveniles
who
have
committed
no
crimes
sex
offender
registration
gang
databases
dna
collection
and
laws
turning
schools
into
informants
all
emerged
after
holistically
they
reflect
a
narrower
conception
of
the
protective
space
of
childhood
than
the
prevailing
notion
and
are
at
odds
with
developmental
science
the
continued
existence
of
juvenile
courts
and
recent
supreme
court
jurisprudence
as
a
result
databasing
delinquency
does
more
than
cause
immediate
and
lasting
harm
to
individual
juveniles
it
reshapes
the
very
meaning
of
childhood
breaching
its
protected
space
and
contradicting
the
special
understandings
that
policymakers
insist
must
dominate
the
regulation
of
youth
the
prevailing
concept
of
childhood
and
the
necessity
and
propriety
of
enhanced
protections
is
grounded
in
part
on
a
notion
of
childhood
as
innocence
n
that
childhood
is
marked
by
innocence
is
certainly
contested
and
undoubtedly
false
especially
with
regard
to
adolescents
despite
their
immaturity
juveniles
are
autonomous
actors
who
have
the
ability
to
recognize
right
from
wrong
and
exercise
such
autonomy
by
choosing
on
occasion
to
do
bad
things
n
indeed
delinquency
appears
to
be
a
normal
part
of
adolescence
n
their
offenses
however
do
not
make
them
adults
yet
the
criminal
justice
system
more
so
than
other
arenas
tends
to
treat
young
people
who
do
not
fit
the
innocent
image
as
outside
of
childhood
and
thus
not
cloaked
by
or
deserving
of
its
protections
in
the
last
decade
however
a
shift
back
to
first
principles
has
been
evident
the
superpredator
era
has
been
replaced
by
the
rebuilding
n
from
the
appropriate
amount
of
punishment
to
the
proper
treatment
by
police
courts
and
legislatures
have
displayed
a
renewed
commitment
to
the
primacy
of
special
protections
for
youth
n
in
the
wake
of
a
sharp
and
steady
decline
in
juvenile
offending
since
n
and
perhaps
in
response
to
the
punitive
extremes
of
s
reforms
courts
and
legislatures
have
made
it
clear
that
the
law
must
take
account
of
the
differences
between
youth
and
adults
n
as
a
result
several
juvenile
justice
policies
grounded
in
the
forfeiture
theory
have
been
rejected
in
recent
years
n
yet
it
is
not
just
the
dubious
forfeiture
theory
that
undergirds
delinquency
databasing
minority
youth
need
not
break
the
rules
before
they
lose
the
protections
of
childhood
n
for
them
by
virtue
of
being
black
or
brown
they
are
perceived
as
more
likely
to
be
criminal
more
culpable
for
the

behavior
committed
by
white

and
older
than
their
actual
chronological

it
seems
overrides

the
criminal

apparatus

justifying
their

like
law
enforcement
practices
like
databasing
americans
have
long
associated
blackness
and
criminality
n
the
perceived
link
between
blackness
and
criminality
has
contributed
to
racial
disparities
throughout
criminal
justice
including
skews
in
enforcement
and
punishment
of
black
juveniles
n
one
study
for
example
found
that
african
american
youth
are
disproportionately
arrested
in
twenty
six
of
twenty
nine
offense
categories
overrepresented
in
cases
referred
to
juvenile
court
more
likely
to
be
formally
charged
more
likely
to
be
waived
into
adult
court
and
disproportionately
detained
in
both
juvenile
and
adult
facilities
n
these
enforcement
skews
then
result
in
racial
skews
in
data
collection
as
law
enforcement
is
more
likely
to
collect
and
retain
information
on
minorities
because
it
disproportionately
makes
contact
with
minorities
n
emerging
research
connects
this
racial
perception
and
skew
data
to
the
expanding
surveillance
of
minority
youth
researchers
have
found
that
black
youth
are
seen
as
older
than
their
actual
age
and
more
culpable
for
the
same
behavior
as
white
youth
in
one
study
researchers
tested
police
officers
in
large
urban
areas
mostly
white
males
average
age
thirty
seven
and
mostly
white
female
undergraduate
students
from
large
public
u
s
universities
to
determine
their
levels
of
certain
types
of
bias
n
they
found
that
black
youth
were
more
likely
to
be
mistaken
as
older
than
their
actual
age
by
an
average
of
years
n
the
same
study
found
that
white
undergraduate
female
students
judged
children
up
to
nine
years
old
as
equally
innocent
regardless
of
race
but
considered
black
children
significantly
less
innocent
than
other
children
in
every
age
group
beginning
at
age
ten
n
in
another
study
researchers
had
a
nationally
representative
sample
of
white
americans
participate
in
an
online
study
about
support
for
life
without
parole
sentences
for

n
participants
read
a
sample
about
a
recipient
of
the
sentencing
option
a
fourteen
year
old
male
with
seventeen
prior
juvenile
convictions
on
his
record
who
brutally
raped
an
elderly
woman
researchers
manipulated
just
one
word
across
the
two
study
conditions
in
the
description
of
the
example
recipient
of
the
sentencing
option
the
juvenile
was
described
as
either
black
or
white
the
researchers
found
that
in
the
black
prime
condition
participants
perceived
juveniles
as
more
similar
to
adults
in
blameworthiness
than
they
did
in
the
white
prime
condition
n
this
led
participants
in
the
black
prime

to
express
more
support
for
life
without
parole
sentences
for
juveniles
in
non
homicide
cases
than
did
those
in
the
white
prime
condition
n
in
short
when
test
subjects
knew
the
subject
of
a
potential
criminal
justice
sanction
was
black
they
showed
increased
support
for
punitive
policies
n
this
effect
is
occurring
in
schools
as
well
professor
ann
arnett
ferguson
spent
over
three
years
observing
a
racially
mixed
public
intermediate
school
grades
four
to
six
n
she
concluded
that
african
american
boys
are
not
seen
as
childlike
but
adultified
as
naturally
naughty
and
as
willfully
bad
n
their
misbehavior
was
not
seen
as
typical
childishness
but
was
likely
to
be
interpreted
as
symptomatic
of
ominous
criminal
proclivities
n
in
one
example
a
white
teacher
described
african
american
children
who
borrowed
books
from
a
classroom
without
returning
them
as
looters
as
ferguson
put
it
what
might
be
interpreted
as
the
careless
behavior
of
children
is
displaced
by
images
of
adult
acts
of
thefts
that
conjure
up
violence
and
mayhem
n
as
a
result
of
this
adultification
black
male
youth
became
exempted
from
the
dispensations
granted
the
child
and
the
boy
justifying
increased
surveillance
and
harsher
more
punitive
responses
to
rule
breaking
behavior
n
this
research
shows
that
race
profoundly
affects
the
degree
to
which
juveniles
are
afforded
the
established
protection
associated
with
childhood
status
n
this
happens
even
in
the
absence
of
wrongdoing
indeed
race
appears
to
override
youth
when
it
comes
to
support
for
punitive
juvenile
justice
policies
black
youth
are
viewed
as
older
than
their
actual
age
are
associated
with
criminality
and
are
seen
as
responsible
for
their
actions
at
an
age
when
white
youth
remain
protected
by
the
reduced
culpability
conception
of
childhood
as
a
result
law
enforcement
practices
like
the
databasing
described
here
that
treat
youth
of
color
like
adults
flourish
iv
reforms
there
is
ample
evidence
that
policymakers
are
rethinking
the
punitive
adult
like
policies
adopted
in
a
climate
of
fear
and
hostility
toward
juvenile
offenders
in
the
late
twentieth
century
n
this
momentum
toward
first
principles
led
juvenile
justice
scholar
terry
maroney
to
describe
the
current
era
as
the
rebuilding
of
juvenile
justice
n
in
that
spirit
this
part
offers
three
recommendations
to
curbing
delinquency
databasing
that
would
realign
law
enforcement
data
collection
practices
with
current
developmental
research
and
the
prevailing
conception
of
childhood
as
a
separate
protected
space
first
to
account
for
juveniles
unique
vulnerability
to
harms
laws
should
limit
the
amount
of
information
that
law
enforcement
may
collect
about
juveniles
second
because
most
juveniles
do
not
persist
in
offending
but
instead
mature
into
law
abiding
individuals
laws
should
limit
the
length
of
time
that
gathered
information
can
be
retained
third
in
recognition
of
juveniles
future
lives
as
adults
laws
should
restrict
law
enforcement
s
ability
to
share
the
information
it
gathers
and
stores
this
would
have
no
impact
on
law
enforcement
s
mission
and
would
facilitate
access
to
the
employment
higher
education
and
housing
that
is
so
critical
as
youth
transition
to
adulthood
a
limiting
what
information
is
gathered
the
easiest
way
to
limit
the
harms
caused
by
databasing
delinquency
is
to
not
gather
the
information
in
the
first
place
n
it
would
avoid
the
privacy
intrusion
attendant
to
the
gathering
of
information
and
would
prevent
the
additional
punishments
and
stigma
discussed
above
that
ensue
it
would
also
eliminate
the
long
shadow
of
a
young
person
s
mistakes
helping
to
ensure
that
juveniles
enter
adulthood
with
the
greatest
chance
for
a
productive
life
but
law
enforcement
will
not
be
prohibited
from
gathering
information
in
any
foreseeable
future
a
feasible
focus
becomes
limiting
law
enforcement
s
data
collection
abilities
deciding
how
much
to
limit
it
depends
in
part
on
the
role
of
law
enforcement
with
respect
to
juveniles
if
the
police
play
a
role
similar
to
that
of
a
general
welfare
agency
then
all
data
is
potentially
pertinent
and
the
limitations
proposed
here
will
not
come
to
be
n
but
if
law
enforcement
s
mission
is
limited
to
crime
solving
and
suppression
then
much
of
the
information
about
a
young
person
gathered
in
the
delinquency
databases
loses
its
value
to
law
enforcement
instead
a
narrower
universe
of
data
collection
is
justified
this
is
especially
so
for
data
collection
that
occurs
before
a
young
person
has
become
the
target
of
a
criminal
investigation
it
seems
safe
to
say
that
the
police
are
not
child
welfare
officials
n
and
therefore
every
last
bit
of
information
about
young
people
is
not
of
police
concern
gathering
data
about
the
friends
and
associations
of
juveniles
or
logging
reports
from
schools
of
bullying
especially
in
the
absence
of
a
criminal
investigation
that
would
make
the
information
relevant
is
thus
difficult
to
justify
on
the
other
hand
it
is
difficult
to
cull
the
information
that
has
or
might
have
intelligence
value
to
law
enforcement
from
that
which
does
not
n
indeed
the
belief
that
it
is
better
to
have
information
and
not
need
it
than
to
need
it
and
not
have
it
and
the
lure
of
complete
collection
has
proven
irresistible
to
the
government
n
one
guiding
principle
could
be
that
law
enforcement
may
only
collect
information
relevant
to
an
individual
s
identity
or
to
a
specific
investigation
restrictions
on
law
enforcement
s
ability
to
gather
information
are
not
impossible
the
fourth
and
fifth
amendments
stand
as
foundational
hurdles
to
unrestricted
government
data
collection
n
and
states
still
maintain
protective
rules
for
children
with
regard
to
police
identity
records
take
fingerprints
as
an
example
while
some
states
such
as
alaska
make
no
distinctions
between
juvenile
and

fingerprinting

others
maintain
distinct
rules

fingerprinting

thereof

limited
the
content

the

policy
of
treating

differently
from

opportunity
of
rehabilitation
and
re
integration
the
federal
requirement
that

be
placed
on
the
sex

registry
under

is
in
direct
conflict
with
that
public
policy

out

similar
concerns
the
state
of
washington
abolished
child
sex
offender
registration

n
courts
have
also
found

unconstitutional

frustrates

of

fundamental
elements
of

confidentiality
and
the
avoidance
of

that

the
ship

collection

helps

and
plays
some
role
in
promoting

many
crimes
have
been

would
require
a
sea
change
in
attitude
to
generate
support
for

widespread

on
the
information
gathered
by
law

about

change
while
many
participate
in
some
form
of
delinquency
during

most
desist
as

mature
into

because
many
of
the
factors
associated
with
antisocial
risky
or
criminal
behavior
lose
their
intensity
as

that
youth
change
means
that

in
recognition
of
this
truth
limits
on
the
length
of

enforcement
to
keep
information
during
peak
offending
years
while
also
protecting
young
people
from
the
long
shadow
of
youthful
mistakes
numerous
proposals
have
sought
to
limit
the
length
of
time
that
law
enforcement
can
retain
records
about
juveniles
before
the
dawn
of
computerized
dataveillance
the
aba
issued
a
report
entitled
standards
relating
to

and

systems
n
in
it
the
aba
recommended
that
juvenile
police
and
court
records
be
destroyed
if
a
juvenile
who
is
arrested
or
detained
is
not
referred
to
a
court
n
the
report
emphasized
that
unless
the
juvenile
s
police
record
is
also
destroyed
when
the
court
record
is
destroyed
the
destruction
of
the
court
record
alone
would
become
a
relatively
meaningless
reform
n
in
a
foreshadowing
of
what
has
become
the
report
acknowledged
that
the
increasing
use
of
computers
to
disseminate
arrest
records
magnifies
the
risks
created
by
the
existence
of
arrest
records
n
the
juvenile
crime
wave
of
the
s
and
early
s
and
the
punitive
reforms
that
followed
meant
the
aba
s
proposal
was
not
heeded
similar
reform
proposals
are
now
making
headway
as
policymakers
have
begun
to
reimpose
limitations
on
how
long
juvenile
records
may
be
maintained
in
washington
state
passed
a
law
allowing
for
most
juvenile
records
to
be
automatically
sealed
when
the
youth
turns
eighteen

in
explaining
the
bill
representative
ruth
kagi
said
that
up
until
today
youth
in
washington
had
their
mistakes
follow
them
forever
the
sealing
of
juvenile
records
will
give
youth
the
chance
to
get
an
education
a
job
housing
and
a
productive
life
n
senators
rand
paul
and
cory
booker
proposed
a
similar
bill
at
the
federal
level
in
their
redeem
act
would
automatically
seal
juvenile
criminal
records
for
nonviolent
offenses
n
the
movement
toward
protective
juvenile
record
policies
is
not
limited
to
the
united
states
in
recent
commentary
on
the
european
rules
for
juvenile
offenders
the
council
of
europe
advised
that
sanctions
and
measures
imposed
on
juvenile
offenders
should
not
be
held
against
them
for
the
rest
of
their
lives
records
of
the
offences
of
juveniles
should
not
be
kept
for
longer
than
absolutely
necessary
n
just
how
long
is
necessary
would
undoubtedly
be
subject
to
great
debate
empirics
on
juvenile
offending
help
to
identify
an
appropriate
target
expunging
police
and
court
records
could
be
triggered
when
juveniles
hit
a
particular
age
such
as
eighteen
or
twenty
one
this
would
accord
with
offending
data
which
shows
that
offending
peaks
at
seventeen
and
then
sharply
and
steadily
decreases
n
as
a
result
the
intelligence
value
to
law
enforcement
of
all
that
the
delinquency
databases
contain
drops
off
just
as
sharply
and
steadily
into
the
future
since
it
is
increasingly
unlikely
to
be
actionable
information
there
is
less
justification
for
continuing
to
store
it
the
value
of
the
information
about
friends
and
associations
such
as
that
which
fills
gang
databases
diminishes
even
more
sharply
with
time
as
social
groups
and
activity
change
that
databasing
causes
such
extensive
harms
not
just
from
the
mere
gathering
of
the
information
but
also
from
the
retention
of
erroneous
information
and
the
broad
sharing
of
information
increases
the
need
for
limiting
its
storage
alternatively
records
could
be
expunged
when
a
juvenile
avoids
a
conviction
or
adjudication
for
a
certain
period
of
time
this
would
be
expungement
earned
not
by
simply
growing
old
but
by
behavior
data
about
desistance
would
support
such
an
approach
researchers
have
found
that
individuals
with
a
prior
criminal
justice
contact
who
stay
arrest
free
for
seven
years
or
more
pose
very
little
risk
of
future
crime
n
moreover
that
low
risk
converges
with
the
risk
of
a
same
aged
individual
from
the
general
population
at
around
seven
years
after
contact
and
approaches
though
never
equals
that
of
same
aged
individuals
with
a
clean
criminal
record
n
therefore
for
juveniles
who
avoid
arrests
and
conviction
there
would
be
little
risk
to
public
safety
of
destroying
their
old
records
the
upside
would
be
reduced
stigma
and
fewer
barriers
to
housing
education
and
employment
n
indeed
record
sealing
or
destruction
mechanisms
are
already
in
place
all
states
enable
the
destruction
expunging
or
sealing
of
some
juvenile
records
n
new
york
for
example
requires
fingerprint
records
to
be
destroyed
when
a
person
adjudicated
delinquent
reaches
the
age
of
twenty
one
or
has
been
discharged
from
placement
for
at
least
three
years
and
has
no
intervening
criminal
convictions
or
pending
criminal
actions
n
there
are
even
protections
in
some
states
for
juveniles
charged
in
criminal
court
under
youthful
offender
statutes
accusatory
instruments
can
be
sealed
and
records
that
would
otherwise
be
public
kept
confidential
n
the
software
that
enables
the
delinquency
databases
could
easily
accomplish
automatic
record
deletion
all
that
it
would
seemingly
require
would
be
an
allocation
of
resources
from
the
government
to
develop
programs
that
could
identify
records
due
for
sealing
or
destruction
and
accomplish
the
sealing
or
destruction
c
limiting
what
information
is
shared

described
above

are
able
to
access
the
information
in

according
to
leading
criminal
records
scholar
jacobs
the
united
states
which
invented
a
juvenile
court
committed
to
confidentiality
now
is
exceptional
for
the
amount
of
juvenile
offender
information
that
is
disclosed
to
diverse
government
agencies
and
the
public
n
once
the
information
gets
beyond
law
enforcement
and
into
the
hands
of
employers
school
officials
and
landlords
the
harmful
impacts
are
felt
immediately
moreover
once
the
information
gets
beyond
law
enforcement
it
is
almost
impossible
to
make
it
go
away
or
control
the
havoc
it
wreaks
n
as
a
result
its
impact
is
lasting
this
liberal
policy
regarding
disclosure
is
in
part
linked
to
the
american
commitment
to
open
government
and
the
freedom
of
the
press
and
it
is
also
a
result
of
the
gradual
shift
of
law
enforcement
records
from
a
system
created
by
police
for
police
to
one
used
heavily
by
noncriminal
justice
actors
like
employers
and
schools
distributing
the
information
is
particularly
harmful
because
of
its
devastating
impacts
on
an
individual
s
ability
to
secure
employment
housing
and
school
that
accompany
sharing
criminal
history
n
not
only
does
criminal
history
information
sharing
frustrate
the
ability
of
young
people
and
adults
with
a
youthful
criminal
record
to
earn
a
living
educate
themselves
and
find
a
place
to
live
all
of
these
factors
are
linked
to
desistance
n
instead
of
punishing
youth
far
into
the
future
the
law
should
cabin
the
information
that
is
gathered
and
stored
by
law
enforcement
to
law
enforcement
as
much
as
possible
this
is
especially
true
for
intelligence
information
like
that
gathered
in
gang
databases
and
nonconviction
records
like
those
for
arrests
noncriminal
justice
actors
like
employers
are
likely
to
believe
that
an
arrest
reflects
a
guilty
act
when
upwards
of
fifty
percent
of
arrests
are
not
followed
by
a
conviction
n
moreover
the
presumption
of
innocence
that
bedrock
axiomatic
and
elementary
principle
whose
enforcement
lies
at
the
foundation
of
the
administration
of
our
criminal
law
n
demands
that
the
criminal
justice
system
only
share
police
record
information
when
it
reflects
certainty
that
the
act
was
committed
a
number
of
reforms
limiting
the
sharing
of
law
enforcement
records
have
recently
been
put
in
place
as
discussed
above
jurisdictions
are
limiting
the
extent
to
which
juveniles
are
subject
to
sex
offender
registration
and
federal
guidelines
do
not
require
that
juveniles
be
subject
to
community
notification
procedures
n
there
is
a
nationwide
movement
to
restrict
what
criminal
history
information
employers
can
access
n
colleges
are
beginning
to
add
nuance
to
their
use
of
criminal
history
information
in
admissions
instead
of
using
it
as
a
blunt
sorting
tool
n
public
schools
have
also
been
seeking
ways
to
minimize
law
enforcement
involvement
in
school
matters
n
as
these
efforts
demonstrate
limiting
what
criminal
history
information
gets
shared
beyond
law
enforcement
is
probably
the
most
attainable
reform
proposal
it
is
also
arguably
the
most
important
cabining
the
information
to
law
enforcement
reduces
the
negative
impact
the
criminal
justice
biography
may
have
while
they
are
still
subject
to
privacy
invasions
and
stigma
harms
and
law
enforcement
is
more
likely
to
police
them
and
their
communities
each
no
small
consequence
law
enforcement
does
not
hire
them
for
jobs
accept
them
to
colleges
or
act
as
their
landlord
without
access
to
the
information
employers
colleges
and
landlords
will
not
be
able
to
so
easily
discriminate
against
individuals
based
on
criminal
history
conclusion
because
adolescents
are
vulnerable
because
they
change
and
because
they
are
future
adults
we
must
strive
for
a
constellation
of
practices
that
protect
them
from
harm
and
promote
their
positive
development
the
criminal
justice
system
is
a
critical
part
of
that
constellation
with
renewed
vigor
courts
legislatures
and
policymakers
today
are
correcting
the
missteps
of
the
s
that
favored
treating
juveniles
like
adults
in
the
criminal
justice
system
by
reinstating
the
primacy
of
special
protections
for
youth
databasing
delinquency
a
broad
data
collection
retention
and
distribution
system
that
treats
juveniles
on
par
with
adults
reveals
that
two
pernicious
distortions
continue
to
inform
this
aspect
of
juvenile
justice
policy
first
youth
who
break
the
rules
are
seen
as
having
forfeited
the
protections
of
childhood
second
childhood
status
is
particularly
fragile
for
minority
youth
who
age
out
of
childhood
s
protective
space
sooner
than
white
youth
as
a
result
many
youth
are
saddled
with
a
record
of
mistakes
and
suspicions
that
haunt
them
into
adulthood
the
unwillingness
to
forgive
and
forget
youthful
mistakes
embedded
in
databasing
delinquency
ignores
the
fundamental
nature
of
adolescence
rather
than
pursuing
adult
like
surveillance
practices
in
the
name
of
public
safety
that
inflict
debilitating
short
and
long
term
harms
the
developmental
characteristics
of
youth
and
the
purpose
and
meaning
of
childhood
must
guide
juvenile
justice
policy
to
that
end
we
must
avoid
practices
that
unduly
stigmatize
that
permanently
punish
and
that
promote
or
entrench
criminal
behavior
by
limiting
the
information
that
the
criminal
justice
system
gathers
stores
and
shares
about
juveniles
we
can
avoid
those
harms
without
frustrating
public
safety

community

in

shares
some

community

efforts

the

in

overpoliced
communities
and
exacerbate
intracommunity
inequalities
rather
than
enhance
participation
community
engagement
may
simply
provide
opportunities
for
select
members
of
muslim

to
approve
preexisting

this

illustrates
what

want
from

efforts
at
improving
communication

collaboration
with
communities
typically
on
the
wrong
side
of
the
gun
on
the
surface
it
appears
the
fbi
is
working
to
build
open
lines
of
communication
with
muslim
communities
to
learn
about
community
concerns
and
to
provide
reassurance
that
law

is
committed
to
equal
protection
for
all

the
federal

anchors
its
community
engagement

attempts

the

of

approaches
it
is
essential
to
appreciate
the
larger
context
of
law
enforcement
scrutiny
in
which
they
occur
the
article
provides
three
larger
frameworks
in
which
community
engagement
must
be
understood
first
law
enforcement
community
engagement
efforts
are
properly
understood
within
the
larger
context
of
the
rise
of
radicalization
theories
and
counterradicalization
and
countering
violent
extremism
cve
programs
n
radicalization
theory
posits
that
increased
religiosity
and
politicization
among
muslims
provokes
an
increased
threat
of
terrorism
incorporating
this
framework
government
counterradicalization
and
cve
programs
aim
to
monitor
and
influence
the
political
and
religious
cultures
of
muslim
communities
so
as
to
prevent
radicalization
and
violent
extremism
this
approach
brings
tremendous
government
scrutiny
to
bear
on
the
religious
and
political
beliefs
and
activities
of
american
muslim
communities
n
the
overlay
with
counterradicalization
and
cve
is
also
what
sets
community
outreach
with
muslim
communities
apart
from
outreach
with
other
communities
second
community
engagement
is
in
practice
and
effect
closely
intertwined
with
other
policing
methods
and
functions
n
unlike
other
types
of
national
security
policing
such
as
mapping
voluntary
or
pretextual
interviews
recruitment
and
deployment
of
informants
and
internet
monitoring
community
engagement
draws
its
legitimacy
from
community
policing
s
ideas
of
inclusion
and
democratic
participation
but
law
enforcement
deploys
community
engagement
as
one
among
several
of
its
national
security
policing
tools
creating
tension
between
trust
building
intelligence
collection
and
counter
radicalization
efforts
and
raising
questions
about
the
quality
of
inclusion
and
democratic
participants
these
programs
facilitate
n
third
community
engagement
with
american
muslim
communities
must
be
understood
in
conversation
with
community
policing
in
the
ordinary
criminal
context
and
more
specifically
with
the
earlier
debates
on
community
policing
inflected
by
broken
windows
theory
in
both
contexts
advocates
celebrate
communication
and
collaboration
as
ways
to
foster
inclusion
and
civic
engagement
in
marginalized
communities
on
the
one
hand
and
to
reduce
crime
and
increase
order
on
the
other
so
as
with
community
policing
community
engagement
initiatives
emphasize
the
idea
that
law
enforcement
must
build
trust
and
create
greater
channels
of
communication
with
american
muslims
to
this
end
law
enforcement
representatives
reach
out
to
muslim
communities
attend
community
events
host
career
fairs
and
so
on
in
the
same
way
that
community
policing
in
the
s
and
s
relied
on
partnerships
with
african
american
churches
and
youth
in
poor
neighborhoods
the
federal
government
s
current
community
engagement
programs
focus
on
mosques
community
institutions
and
youth
in
muslim
communities
the
realities
are
more
top
down
than
grassroots
in
both
contexts
aggressive
theories
of
crime
control
broken
windows
theory
in
the
context
of
ordinary
crime
counterradicalization
in
the
context
of
national
security

overlaid
atop
ambiguous
commitments
to
community
partnerships
narrowing
the
space
for
open
communication
and
contestation
by
the
subject
communities
in
preserving
law
and
order
police
occupy
an
important
role
in
the
balance
between
a
democratic
and
a
coercive
state
with
community
policing
painted
as
a
more
democratic
tactic
community
policing
and
community
engagement
trade
on
the
moral
authority
of
community
partnerships
by
invoking
ideas
about
popular
participation
in
government
and
localized
democracy
n
but
critics
have
challenged
the
normative
and
empirical
bases
for
community
policing
and
tactics
influenced
by
broken
windows
theory
calling
for
a
critical
assessment
of
the
costs
of
order
and
how
police
work
with
marginalized
communities
in
these
efforts
the
concern
in
essence
is
that
community
policing
allows
the
police
to
expand
their
power
and
reach
into
already
marginalized
communities
without
giving
subject
communities
the
opportunity
to
meaningfully
influence
or
determine
policing
priorities
or
strategies
a
central
insight
of
this
article
is
as
straightforward
as
it
might
be
surprising
community
engagement
in
the
national
security
context
shares
some
of
the
problems
of
community
policing
in
the
ordinary
criminal
context
as
with
the
criticisms
lodged
against
broken

styled
community
policing
counterradicalization
fueled
policing
serves
to
further
marginalize
an
already
marginalized
community
on
the
grounds
of
its
difference
moreover
as
with

policing
community
engagement
efforts
increase
the
presence
of

overpoliced
communities
and
exacerbate
intracommunity
inequalities

parts

the

frameworks

the
practices

the
links
between
the
burgeoning
enterprise
of
federal
community
engagement
efforts
and
the
larger
context
of
national

tactics
and
the
roots
of
such

ii
draws
on
earlier
literature
debating
community
policing
inflected
by
broken

theory
community
policing
theory
aims
to
reorder
relations
between
the
marginalized
and
the
police
through
community
and
collaboration
but
community
policing
programs
often
fail
to
fulfill
this
goal
when
they
rely
on
preventative
theories
of
crime
control
broken
windows
theory
posits
a
correlation
between
the
aesthetics
of
disorder
and
crime
calling
police
into
the
service
of
countering
disorder
as
a
way
to
keep
more
serious
crime
at
bay
in
the
ordinary
criminal
context
broken
windows
theory
is
used
to
shape
and
justify
forms
of
community
policing
while
counterradicalization
is
the
scaffold
in
the
national
security
context
broken
windows
and
counterradicalization
bring
government
visions
of
crime
control
to
bear
on
police
community
partnerships
and
grant
local
social
and
cultural
norms
an
outsized
role
in
the
origination
of
criminal
activity
these
assumptions
create
a
rationale
for
law
enforcement
to
police
and
surveil
the
minutiae
of
everyday
life
in
marginalized
communities
in
linking
noncriminal
activity
to
the
potential
for
crime
both
theories
reinforce
a
punitive
lens
through
which
police
interact
with
marginalized
communities
in
turn
policing
motivated
by
theories
of
radicalization
serve
to
racialize

significant
ways

moves
to
the
material
implications
of
community
engagement
community
engagement
efforts
constitute
one
of
many
entry
points
for
federal
law
enforcement
into
muslim
communities
today
but
unlike
other
types
of
radicalization
policing
community
engagement
efforts
draw
their
legitimacy
from
ideas
of
inclusion
and
democratic
participation
most
acutely
my
concern
is
that
community
engagement
turns
on
itself
by
providing
police
with
greater
power
and
discretion
over
marginalized
communities
rather
than
enhance
participation
community
engagement
may
simply
provide
opportunities
for
select
members
of
muslim
communities
to
approve
preexisting
law
enforcement
commitments
and
create
an
additional
source
of
pressure
on
muslim
communities
to
perform
their
americanness
without
meaningful
openings
for
muslim
communities
to
communicate
collaborate
and
contest
the
relationship
its
modalities
and
its
outputs
the
coercive
effect
of
these
practices
has
been
underexplored
even
as
their
success
at
increasing
democracy
and
inclusion
is
taken
for
granted
while
it
is
beyond
the
scope
of
this
article
to
engage
the
premise
that
cultivating
pro
law
enforcement
attitudes
is
necessary
for
democracy
the
article
does
raise
questions
about
how
the
government
should
cultivate
these
attitudes
and
how
cultivating
such
attitudes
may
clash
with
the
duty
of
people
to
hold
their
governments
accountable
by
putting
the
mirror
of
the
community
policing
literature
to
community
engagement
more
specifically
by
placing
the
literature
from
the
s
and
s
on
community
policing
with
african
american
communities
alongside
community
engagement
with
muslim
communities
the
article
engages
the
way
that
police
practices
are
discursive
experimental
and
derivative
my
aim
is
to
contribute
to
the
larger
discourse
on
the
relationship
between
policing
racialization
and
inequality
in
the
united
states
and
to
understand
the
continuities
and
distinctions
between
contexts
on
the
one
hand
positioning
these
practices
side
by
side
is
descriptive
in
that
it
reflects
the
federal
government
s
situating
of
community
engagement
efforts
within
a
history
of
community
policing
efforts
with
marginalized
communities
on
the
other
hand
the
cross
pollination
is
normative
in
that
it
reflects
my
effort
to
deconstruct
the
sharp
distinctions
often
drawn
between
the
ordinary
criminal
and
national
security
contexts
national
security
scholars
can
learn
from
longstanding
conversations
in
criminal
law
especially
regarding
criminal
justice
techniques
retooled
for
the
national
security
context
my
hope
is
that
this
article
will
contribute
to
our
thinking
about
the
role
of
police
in
comparative
racialization
that
in
thinking
about
community
policing
and
community
engagement
in
the
same
breath
we
will
see
new
possibilities
and
problems
in
the
way
that
police
relate
to
communities
of
color
and
thereby
construct
and
constitute
the
experience
of
race
in
the
united
states
including
for
american
muslims
n
i
do
not
mean
to
draw
overly
neat
parallels
or
to
manufacture
ghost
genealogies
between
the
two
sets
of
theoretical
frameworks
or
practices
nor
does
this
article
comprehensively
survey
historical
or
contemporary
practices
of
community
policing
or
community
engagement
my
concrete
focus
is
the
contemporary
national
security
context
in
the
united
states
and
i
am
working
with
the
limited
material
much
of
it
produced
through
government
accounts
available
on
these
initiatives
this
article
provides
a
sketch
of
the
problems
inherent
in
approaching
community
engagement
through
a
counterradicalization
and
cve
lens
particularized
case
studies
are
left
for

the
idea
of

may
capture
our
imaginations
now
as
community
policing
did
in
the
s
and

then
as
now

it
should
not
capture

policing
a
the
schematic
of
policing
radicalization
the
accounts
of
post

emphasize
the
federal
government
s
new
commitments
to
a
preventative
framework
for
fighting
terrorism
and
to
comprehensive
intelligence
gathering
n
although
this
narrative
obscures
the
existence
of
preventive
approaches
and
intelligence
gathering
before
it
embodies
important
kernels
of
truth
the
overt
merger
of
prevention
intelligence
gathering
national
security
and
criminal
power
has
changed
the
nature
of
contemporary
policing
in
the
united
states
less
commented
on
is
the
shift
from
emergency
policing
measures
n
to
the
routinization
of
national
security
policing
unquestionably
important
continuity
exists
between
the
emergency
response
and
the
routinized
police
practices
not
simply
because
many
of
the
practices
are
similar
but
because
they
borrow
their
legitimacy
from
the
same
discursive
universe
in
which
the
attack
is
a
fundamental
moment
of
authority
n
theories
of
radicalization
counterradicalization
and
cve
have
been
important
engines
in
the
movement
of
national
security
policing
from
the
realm
of
emergency
to
the
realm
of
routine
n
radicalization
theory
which
also
grounds
ideas
about
violent
extremism
was
exported
from
the
british
government
to
the
u
s
government
through
doj
and
the
new
york
police
department
nypd
the
theory
posits
a
correlation
between
religiosity
and
politicization
in
muslims
and
the
potential
for
terrorism
when
the
government
embraces
radicalization
theories
it
provides
a
new
imperative
to
surveil
and
shape
religious
and
political
activities
of
muslim
individuals
and
within
muslim
communities
that
same
embrace
has
also
spawned
a
growing
number
of
counterradicalization
and
cve
initiatives
of
which
law
enforcement
and
community
engagement
efforts
are
an
increasingly
important
part
n
law
enforcement
s
embrace
of
radicalization
and
counterradicalization
has
become
a
central
tenet
in
our
domestic
approach
to
national
security
a
fbi
report
and
nypd
report
constitute
the
building
blocks
of
this
evolution
n
since
the
publication
of
these
reports
both
entirely
focused
on
muslims
n
u
s
federal
and
local
government
literature
has
taken
for
granted
that
a
problem
of
muslim
radicalization
exists
in
plagues
even
the
united
states
the
fbi
s
intelligence
assessment
the
radicalization
process
from
conversion
to
jihad
asserts
the
existence
of
an
identifiable
and
predictable
process
by
which
a
muslim
becomes
a
terrorist
n
the
fbi
identifies
the
four
stages
of
radicalization
as
preradicalization
identification
indoctrination
and
action
n
the
assessment
is
vague
about
the
data
on
which
it
relies
with
almost
no
citations
sourcing
or
clear
methodology
the
nypd
s
report
radicalization
in
the
west
the
homegrown
threat
posits
a
similar
four
stage
process
pre
radicalization
self
identification
indoctrination
and
jihadization
n
each
stage
has
specific
signatures
associated
with
it
n
the
first
three
stages
of
radicalization
focus
on
where
muslims
live
and
congregate
manifestations
of
their
religious
and
political
beliefs
and
political
social
or
religious
activities
n
the
process
culminates
in
the
final
stage
jihadization
when

a
criminal
act

despite
deep
contestation
of
this
theory

to
national

these
ideas

the
following
first
radicalization
is
a
somewhat
predictable
process
with
visible
markers
and
geographies
by
which
muslims
become
willing
and
able
to
commit
violence
against
the
united
states
or
american
interests
in
the
name
of
islam
or
the
global
muslim
community
n
second
the
government

part
of
its
investment
in
national
security
must
monitor
and
counter
radicalization
third
radicalization
emerges
from
religious
and
political
currents
within
muslim
communities
n
radicalization
and
counterradicalization
have
become
the
language
of
prevention
in
national
security
criminal
law
with
the
federal
government
at
the
helm
this
commitment
is
echoed
far
and
wide
from
state
and
local
police
to
dhs
doj
fbi
and
u
s
attorneys
offices
n
as
a
result
federal
law
enforcement
with
the
aid
of
state
and
local
police
spend
considerable
resources
monitoring
and
shaping
political
and
religious
cultures
in
muslim
communities
the
federal
government
has
undertaken
numerous
initiatives
to
counter
radicalization
and
violent
extremism
almost
entirely
focused
on
muslims
despite
assurances
to
the
contrary
n
the
house
and
senate
homeland
security
committees
for
example
have
held
hearings
and
issued
reports
emphasizing
the
need
for
government
agencies
to
monitor
and
respond
to
radicalization
n
the
white

issued
two
national

papers

n
dhs

have
also
prioritized
counterradicalization
and

n
most
recently
the
attorney
general
has
announced
a
pilot
program
to
respond
to
the
lure
of
isis
for
american
muslims
the
white
house
held
a
three
day
cve
summit
and
the
dhs
secretary
has
been
touring
mosques
around
the
country
n
community
engagement
represents
but
one
of
a
range
of
policing
techniques
deployed
in
counterradicalization
efforts
the
specific
techniques
essential
to
policing
radicalization
include
mapping
voluntary
or
pretextual
interviews
recruitment
and
deployment
of
informants
internet
monitoring
and
community
engagement
n
these
tactics
are
aimed
at
gathering
intelligence
on
as
well
as
shaping
the
religious
and
political
currents
in
muslim
communities
the
geographies
where
muslims
gather
and
collective
identities
emerge
n
the
tactics
also
attempt
to
identify
individuals
of
concern
by
relying
on
participation
from
muslim
community
members
and
forms
of
coercion
that
vary
from
mild
to
severe
including
incentivized
cooperation
the
tactics
of
policing
radicalization
exist
in
symbiosis
all
feeding
into
each
other
n
given
the
dynamic
relationship
between
these
techniques
a
brief
summation
is
necessary
in
order
to
appreciate
national
security
community
engagement
in
context
mapping
refers
literally
to
the
practice
of
generating
maps
that
detail
where
muslims
gather
whether
in
schools
mosques
or
hookah
bars
n
the
fbi
s
domestic
intelligence
and
operations
guide
diog
empowers
fbi
field
offices
to
collect
map
and
analyze
racial
and
ethnic
demographic
information
including
the
location
of
businesses
and
other
facilities
servicing
those
demographic
groups
n
drawing
on
commercially
available
information
and
government
databases
fbi
offices
have
mapped
the
demographics
of
concentrated
muslim
communities
n
the
fbi
puts
such
maps
to
use
in
its
community
engagement
efforts
n
voluntary
or
pretext
interviews
known
as
knock
and
talks
in
the
ordinary
criminal
context
are
a
more
visible
method
of
policing
radicalization
n
agents
may
approach
individuals
at
mosques
home
work
or
community
institutions
they
may
identify
the
agency
for
which
they
work
or
may
simply
cite
a
generic
relationship
with
the
u
s
government
in
theory
voluntary
the
mode
of
approach
and
questioning
often
involves
substantial
coercive
force
n
individuals
targeted
are
often
led
to
believe
they
are
compulsory
n
law
enforcement
officials
regularly
ask
about
religious
and
political
opinions
and
activities
the
purpose
of
a
recent
trip
to
pakistan
or
saudi
arabia
for
example
or
opinions
on
the
arab
spring
or
drone
strikes
in
pakistan
n
these
interviews
appear
to
be
triggered
by
national
origin
and
ethnicity
as
well
as
travel
and
speech
activity
including
consumption
of
speech
for
example
watching
lectures
online
or
visiting
particular
websites
n
interviews
are
regularly
geared
toward
collecting
information
on
religious
and
political
opinions
whether
individual
or
collective
n
or
cultivating
informants
both
formal
and
informal
n
informants
are
key
to
national
security
policing
just
as
they
are
in
the
ordinary
criminal
context
problems
of
police
coercion
secrecy
and
lack
of
accountability
persist
in
both
contexts
n
the
nypd
for
example
recruits
informants
for
counterterrorism
projects
by
scanning
the
general
citywide
arrest
rolls
for
individuals
hailing
from
muslim
countries
regardless
of
the
crime
for
which
they
were
arrested
n
informants
are
widespread
in
muslim
communities
stationed
within
mosques
muslim
student
groups
social
networks
and
so
on
n
the
approach
is
less
likely
to
be
geared
toward
collecting
information
on
a
specific
individual
or
criminal
plot
and
more
likely
tilted
toward
gathering
as
much
information
on
as
many
people
in
the
muslim
community
as
possible
n
law
enforcement
uses
informants
to
gather
and
test
opinions
in
a
practice
reminiscent
of
past
police
infiltration
of
radical
political
groups
such
as
the
communist
party
and
various
black
liberation
organizations
n
informants
may
serve
as
passive
listeners
n
gathering
information
about
individuals
religious
and
political
views
or
vulnerabilities
such
as
immigration
status
lgbt
queer
identities
or
marital
indiscretions
that
can
be
used
to
pressure
individuals
into
becoming
informants
n
informants
also
test
impressionability
n
attempting
to
provoke
reactions
by
making
radical
or
extreme
statements
and
then
monitoring
people
s
responses
and
their
susceptibility
to
radical
or
extreme
points
of
view
n
perhaps
even
more
troubling
according
to
a
recent
report
by
human
rights
watch
and
columbia
law
school
s
human
rights
institute
all
but
four
of
the
last
decade
s
high
profile
terrorism
prosecutions
resulted
from
fbi
sting
operations
in
which
the
fbi
informant
was
directly
involved
in
proposing
crafting
facilitating
and
inducing
a
terrorist
plot
n
law
enforcement
also
monitors
what
muslims
consume
and
post
on
the
internet
about
their
opinions
and
activities
via
email
listservs
blogs
websites
chatrooms
and
social
media
n
these
efforts
seem
to
focus
on
those
who
download
content
by
particular
muslim
scholars
such
as
anwar
al
aulaqi
post
on
muslim
identified
news
websites
or
participate
in
muslim
identified
chat
discussion
forums
focused
on
religious
discourse
and
u
s
foreign
policy
or
watch
jihadi
videos
n
internet
monitoring
triggers
voluntary
interviews
as
well
as
informants
and
undercover
law
enforcement
urging
young
men
down
the
perceived
path
toward
radicalization
n
post
changes
to
the
fbi
s
investigative
guidelines
allow
for
broad
minimally
regulated
use
of
these
tactics
no
suspicion
of
criminal
wrongdoing
is
required
before
an
ordinary
agent
can
deploy
these
investigative
powers
n
the
fbi
can
use
unlimited
physical
surveillance
conduct
pretextual
interviews
and
deploy
confidential
informants
absent
any
suspicion
of
wrongdoing
or
particular
factual
predication
n
moreover
these
tools
can
be
mobilized
based
mostly
on
first
amendment
activity
for
example
on
attendance
at
a
particular
mosque
or
harsh
criticism
of
american
foreign
policy
n
nor
are
these
techniques
meaningfully
regulated
by
the
constitution
the
techniques
do
not
require
a
warrant
moreover
the
fourth
amendment
s
protections
against
unreasonable
search
and
seizures
can
be
waived
if
law
enforcement
obtains
consent

without

initiatives
are
premised
on
the
idea
that
muslim

can
serve
as
key
partners
in

work
n
community
engagement
depends
on
some
form
of
buy
in
from
and
contacts
in
muslim
communities
n
cultivating
these
contacts
is
an
important
aspect
of
these

obviates
any
concern

overpoliced
as

must
know
that

interactions
with
the
police
are
recorded

shared
the
fbi
thinks
otherwise
the
recently
released
fbi
policy
directive
on
community
engagement
asserts
that
members
of
the
public
contacted
through
a
community
outreach
activity
generally
do
not
have
an
expectation
that
information
about
them
will
be
maintained
in
an
fbi
file
or
database
n
how
can
communities
later
complain
that
they
are
under
watch
even
as
they
exchange
pleasantries
at
a
mosque
outreach
event
with
the
local
fbi
agent
this
is
to
miss
however
a
larger
set
of
normative
concerns
about
the
dialectic
between
the
exercise
of
police
power
and
the
ways
it
restricts
the
options
available
to
communities
of
color

concerns

approach

proved
sufficiently
flexible

be
put
to
use
in

adopted

policing
like
tactics
nationwide
with
muslim
communities
in
response
to
national
security
concerns
deploying
the
vocabulary
and
aspirations
of
community
policing
n
while
community
engagement
is
regularly
invoked
in
the
same
breath
or
included
in
the
same
conceptual
universe
as
community
policing
unnamed
is
the
dynamic
between
counterradicalization
cve
and
broken
windows
theory
at
first
blush
there
is
an
obvious
parallelism
counterradicalization
defines
the
contours
of
community
engagement
as
broken
windows
often
shaped
practices
of
community
policing
both
counterradicalization
and
broken
windows
theories
are
preventative
theories
of
crime
control
laid
atop
efforts
at
bettering
relationships
between
marginalized
communities
and
law
enforcement
n
both
theories
also
motivate
traditional
policing
tactics
and
approaches
beyond
those
that
claim
as
their
central
normative
force
partnerships
with
the
community
yet
there
are
important
theoretical
and
material
distinctions
between
broken
windows
and
counterradicalization
and
between
community
policing
and
community
engagement
in
focusing
on
the
critiques
of
community
policing
inflected
by
broken
windows
theory
i
do
not
mean
to
suggest
that
all
community
policing
is
defined
by
broken
windows
theory
or
that
order
maintenance
which
is
more
directly
linked
to
broken
windows
in
theory
as
well
as
practice
follows
from
community
policing
n
community
policing
and
broken
windows
theory
can
certainly
be
decoupled
n
community
policing
s
center
of
gravity
is
in
communication
and
collaboration
with
local
communities
while
broken
windows
theory
centers
police
discretion
to
pursue
disorder
and
minor
crimes
n
in
practice
and
in
particular
in
the
s
and
s
the
divide
has
proven
more
illusory
n
when
community
policing
and
broken
windows
theory
have
been
linked
in
practice
and
in
study
the
combination
provides
an
important
lens
through
which
to
see
the
problems
that
emerge
when
a
theory
of
crime
control
that
attaches
predictive
authority
to
social
markers
of
difference
shapes
police
communication
with
marginalized
communities
the
literature
examining
community
policing
shaped
by
broken
windows
theory
provides
insights
on
similar
problems
that
emerge
when
community
engagement
is
shaped
by
counterradicalization
this
part
first
provides
background
on
the
emergence
of
broken
windows
theory
and
community
policing
in
the
ordinary
criminal
context
with
its
focus
on
african
american
communities
then
it
explains
how
counterradicalization
has
come
to
racialize
american
muslims
providing
context
necessary
to
understand
the
coercive
qualities
of
community
engagement
a
community
policing
broken
windows
ordinary
crime
n
the
basic
intuition
behind
community
policing
is
that
increased
communication
and
collaboration
between
police
and
communities
will
benefit
both
parties
and
cultivate
a
stronger
ethos
of
civic
engagement
in
marginalized
communities
those
with
less
social
power
and
socioeconomic
standing
n
the
precise
causal
mechanics
of
this
process
however
are
far
from
clear
n
while
the
literature
takes
as
a
starting
point
the
poor
relationships
between
law
enforcement
and
marginalized
communities
it
generally
fails
to
meaningfully
engage
the
question
of
how
community
policing
practices
should
account
for
the
power
differential
between
police
and
those
communities
instead
assuming
that
the
communication
will
itself
have
a
democracy
enhancing
function
n
proponents
advocate
for
more
interaction
and
flexibility
but
provide
little
guidance
on
how
to
ensure
that
communication
and
police
action
is
not
predetermined
by
the
more
powerful
police
prerogative
n
beyond
its
basic
orientation
toward
communication
the
theory
and
practices
of
community
policing
are
muddled
n
reading
the
literature
one
encounters
an
avalanche
of

on
n
these
concepts
represent
an
evolving
spectrum
of
approaches
to
policing
n
often
these
concepts
fill
in
the
vagaries
of
or
complement
one
on
another
but
they
also
clash
and
confuse
where
one
set
of
practices
ends
and
the
other
begins
is
often
unclear
and
subject
to
debate
n
broken
windows
theory
defines
much
community
policing
in
the
context
of
ordinary
crime
one
could
even
argue
that
it
is
a
central
spoke
in
contemporary
preventive
policing
concepts
for
purposes
of
this
article
a
basic
account
of
the
theory
s
adaptation
to
policing
should
suffice
in
in
a
famous
psychology
experiment
two
cars
were
left
in
two
very
different
neighborhoods
without
license
plates
and
with
hoods
open
one
in
wealthy
palo
alto
and
one
in
a
poor
neighborhood
in
the
bronx
n
the
bronx
car
was
quickly
stripped
of
its
valuables
the
palo
alto
car
went
untouched
until
the
study
s
progenitor
publicly
smashed
in
the
windows
precipitating
others
to
codemolish
and
rob
the
car
n
in
social
scientists
george
l
kelling
and
james
q
wilson
announced
their
broken
windows
theory
in
the
atlantic
parlaying
the
psychology
experiment
into
a
theory
of
crime
control
they
argued
that
outward
signs
of
disorder
invite
law
breaking
criminality
by
signaling
to
would
be
criminals
that
the
geography
s
inhabitants
lack
effective
practices
of
social
cohesion
and
control
n
if
the
police
can
fix
the
visible
signs
of
disorder
broken
windows
the
argument
goes
they
can
reduce
serious
criminal
activity
the
translation
from
psychology
experiment
to
preventive
policing
theory
n
was
not
the
only
translation
at
work
however
kelling
and
wilson
also
forwarded
broken
windows
as
a
theory
to
motivate
collaboration
between

community
policing
was
framed
as
a
powerful
tool
for
the
government
to
address
the
legitimacy
deficit
in
african
american
communities
wherein
relationships
with
police
were
defined
by
histories
of
distrust
and
police
violence
n
but
community
policing
also
had
its
critics
n
many
of
whom
pointed
to
how
broken
windows
theory
even
in
a
community
policing
guise
had
shifted
the
focus
of
policing
from
criminal
conduct
to
disorder
broken
windows
theory
assumed
dichotomies
between
order
and
disorder
insider
and
outsider
and
the
law
abiding
and
lawless
n
assumed
these
categories
were
stable
and
observable
and
then
privileged
order
insiders
and
the
law
abiding
over
their
counterparts
n
the
meanings
of
disorder
outsiders
and
lawlessness
were
left
to
police
discretion
assuming
the
police
would
not
inevitably
draw
from
preexisting
terrains
of
difference
and
particularly
the
anti
black
racial
text
linking
blackness
and
criminality
in
making
these
distinctions
n
indeed
more
recent
work
has
contested
broken
windows
theory
s
assumption
that
the
perception
of
disorder
is
governed
by
actual
observed
levels
of
disorder
n
instead
racial
and
immigrant
concentration
proved
more
powerful
predictors
of
perceived
disorder
than
did
carefully
observed
disorder
n
broken
windows
theory
in
its
construction
of
the
disorderly
the
lawless
and
the
outsider
as
legitimate
subjects
of
policing
rendered
already
vulnerable
individuals
as
even
more
vulnerable
to

like

radicalization
theory
has
been
highly
contested
and
yet
broadly
influential
in
shaping
contemporary
policing
while
u
s
government
accounts
take
for
granted
a
problem
with
radicalization
that
warrants
government
intervention
the
literatures
of
governments
academics

stakeholders
around

world
express
profound
disagreement
over
the
meaning
of
radicalization
and
the
nature
and
extent
of
threat
embodied
by
muslims
n
radicalization
discourse
purports
to
predict
future

from
studies
of
prior
terrorist
acts
to
identify
trends
and
details
that
will
aid
in
identifying

and
expands
the
legitimate
scope
of
government
concern
from
terrorism
a
question
of
political
violence
of
crime
even
of
war
crime
to
radicalization
a
question
of
religious
and
political
cultures
and
beliefs
before
moving
further
into
the
problems
inherent
in
overlaying
radicalization
theory
onto
community
engagement
it
is
worth
exploring
the
similarities
and
differences
between
the
work
of
radicalization
theory
and
broken
windows
theory
the
primary
similarities
are
threefold
first
both
radicalization
and
broken
windows
are
preventative
theories
of
crime
control
calling
for
prophylactic
state
action
against
noncriminal
behavior
second
while
both
theories
appear
concerned
with
disorder
or
radicalization
in
the
abstract
their
practical
effect
is
to
bring
considerable
scrutiny
to
communities
already
marginalized
by
virtue
of
race
and
religion
as
a
practical
matter
broken
windows
theory
foregrounds
race
and
inequality
as
instigators
or
signs
of
disorder
n
counterradicalization
and
cve
in
practice
and
in
theory
are
almost
exclusively
focused
on
muslims
n
moreover
when
manifest
in
community
policing
and
community
engagement
approaches
the
theories
work
to
cultivate
partnerships
with
community
members
in
order
to
increase
the
legitimacy
and
reach
of
law
enforcement
into
the
subject
communities
third
in
addition
to
shaping
community
policing
engagement
approaches
both
theories
have
had
great
influence
on
the
broader
field
of
policing
tactics
in
the
relevant
communities
and
beyond
there
are
at
least
two
important
differences
in
terms
of
contested
causal
claims
broken
windows
theory
focuses
on
physical
signs
of
disorder
as
signals
of
deteriorating
social
order
whereas
radicalization
emphasizes
ideological
currents
of
disorder
as
motivators
for
acts
of
terrorism
radicalization
s
concern
is
predicated
on
a
false
belief
in
the
teleological
character
of
islam
that
if
muslims
communities
witness
conservative
religious
practice
and
critical
politics
they
will
view
such
currents
as
acceptable
and
gravitate
toward
radicalism
thereby
producing
more
terrorists
second
the
theories
arguably
have
propelled
different
types
of
police
action
whereas
broken
windows
theory
leads
to
aggressive
enforcement
against
misdemeanor
and
minor
crimes
counterradicalization
produces
increased
surveillance
n
this
distinction
has
its
limits
since
broken
windows
policing
serves
an
intelligence
gathering
function
and
counter
radicalization
shapes
prosecutorial
priorities
but
while
both
theories
expand
the
role
of
the
state
and
the
blueprint
of
policing
their
mechanics
are
distinct
to
be
clear
i
m
less
concerned
with
anaologies
between
the
causal
mechanics
of
the
theories
and
more
concerned
with
how
the
theories
construct
the
categories
of
the
disorderly
and
the
radical
and
the
implications
those
constructions
have
for
policing
and
the
subject
communities
blurring
dissent
and
difference
with
violence
even
aside
from
the
disproportionate
focus
on
politically
motivated
violence
by
muslims
in
terrorism
studies
there
are
key
definitional
problems
with
radicalization
discourse
most
fundamentally
the
terms
radicalization
and
extremism
are
used
sloppily
and
with
unclear
meaning
with
a
causal
connection
assumed
between
radical
ideas
and
committing
acts
of
terrorism
n
empirical
research
has
emphatically
and
repeatedly
concluded
that
there
is
no
single
terrorist
profile
and
no
obvious
markers
for
the
process
by
which
someone
becomes
a
terrorist
n
the
process
by
which
people
embrace
violence
is
not
linear
but
complex
n
importantly
studies
of
so
called
homegrown
terrorism
also
reject
the
ideas
that
islam
and
terrorism
are
linked
or
that
observing
the
muslim
faith
constitutes
a
step
toward
violence
n
nor
is
there
data
to
suggest
that
muslims
are
becoming
more
radical
in
their
views
let
alone
more
violent
n
national
security
prosecutions
in
the
headlines
provide
a
skewed
sense
of
the
threat
the
vast
majority
of
those
prosecutions
do
not
charge
defendants
with
any
violent
crime
or
with
any
intent
to
commit
violent

instead
with
material
support
for
terrorism
a
very
broad
concept
typically
far
removed
from
violence
n
despite
their
continued
hold
on
law
enforcement
the
nypd
and
fbi
reports
are
transparent
paper
tigers
now
deconstructed
many
times
over
n
the
stages
and
factors
of
radicalization
are
internally
inconsistent
and
vague
enough
to
justify
surveillance
of
any
person
who
identifies
as
muslim
or
is
linked
with
muslim
religious
or
political
community
consider
for
example
that
the
nypd
report
marks
as
radicalization
incubators
cafes
cab
driver
hangouts
flophouses
prisons
student
associations
nongovernmental
organizations
hookah
water
pipe
bars
butcher
shops
and
book
stores
mostly
locations
where
muslims
or
those
from
muslim
majority
countries
are
likely
to
spend
their
time
whether
for
religious
political
or
sentimental
reasons
n
the
reports
offer
little
to
no
data
in
support
of
their
ambitious
conclusions
with
the
lack
of
substantiation
reflecting
and
reconstituting
the
marginalization
and
stigmatization
of
american
muslims
the
data
on
which
the
reports
rely
include
national
security
prosecutions
involving
questionable
tactics
by
law
enforcement
constructing
the
plot
providing
the
means
and
incentivizing
the
conduct
in
other
words
the
data
results
in
part
from
cases
in
which
the
fbi
created
or
molded
the
behavior
it
then
purported
to
model
n
in
other
cases
the
defendants
never
committed
a
violent
act
confounding
the
link
between
their
behavior
and
a
willingness
to
commit
terrorist
acts
n
overall
there
remains
no
trustworthy
empirical
account
of
radicalization
that
suggests
the
idea
has
explanatory
or
predictive
power
n
racializing
muslims
under
the
guise
of
predicting
future
terrorism
radicalization
provides
a
guide
for
government
activity
in
so
doing
it
redefines
and
expands
the
relevant
field
of
state
concern
from
terrorism
to
radicalization
in
muslim
communities
marking
religious
and
political
activities
as
the
indicators
of
radicalization
the
discourse
links
religious
and
political
practices
in
muslim
communities
with
the
likelihood
of
terrorism
inviting
state
scrutiny
into
the
halls
of
muslim
communities
and
changing
the
terms
of
engagement
with
the
state
for
muslims
the
theory
creates
the
muslim
her
religious
and
political
habits
as
an
object
of
policing
the
theory
is
racially
productive
n
contributing
to
the
racialization
of
american
muslims
n
i
use
the
term
racialization
knowing
that
it
imperfectly
describes
the
shape
and
nature
of
the
stigma
that
has
attached
to
american
muslim
communities
after
not
least
because
african
americans
make
up
a
considerable
portion
of
the
muslim
population
in
the
united
states
american
muslims
are
unique
in
their
diversity
varying
by
race
language
ethnicity
nationality
and
class
still
racialization
best
approximates
the
process
by
which
a
diverse
group
of
people
become
lumped
together
by
stigma
stereotype
and
fear
all
of
which
draw
from
a
range
of
physical
attributes
and
signifiers
mobilized
by
law
as
a
method
of
control
and
subordination
as
with
other
subordinated
and
racialized
groups
for
example
blacks
latinos
native
americans
there
are
for
example
physical
attributes
associated
with
muslim
identity
from
skin
color
to
facial
hair
to
garb
n
by
focusing
on
the
post
era
i
do
not
mean
to
minimize
the
reality
that
muslims
were
racialized
before
or
that
a
significant
portion
of
american
muslim
communities
are
african
american
and
have
long
been
central
to
the
story
of
race
in
america
while
crime
is
the
primary
lens
through
which
african
americans
figure
in
the
american
imaginary
terrorism
is
the
lens
through
which
muslims
appear
african
american
and
muslim
identities
are
carved
by
and
in
opposition
to
particularized
types
of
suspicion
so
the
politics
of
respectability
of
each
group
is
distinct
with
the
pressure
on
african
americans
to
disavow
and
respond
to
black
on
black
crime
and
for
american
muslims
to
disavow
and
respond
to
terrorism
a
creating
muslim
suspects
the
categories
of
law
abiding
and
lawless
n
radical
and
moderate
are
both
overinclusive
and
indeterminate
n
depending
entirely
for
their
meaning
on
police
deployment
and
creating
deep
vulnerability
for
muslim
communities
n
muslims
are
forced
to
carry
the
stigma
borne
of
such
intense
scrutiny
and
are
powerless
to
escape
it
given
that
both
playing
up
and
minimizing
muslim
identity
can
be
seen
as
potentially
suspicious
n
evidence
suggests
however
that
muslims
have
changed
their
behaviors
in
response
to
the
reality
and
perception
of
extensive
surveillance
for
example
individuals
report
signaling
their
muslimness
less
openly
by
praying
at
home
rather
than
at
the
mosque
avoiding
political
conversation
in
mosques
and
other
muslim
specific
spaces
or
reducing
donations
to
muslim
organizations
similarly
mosques
may
ask
speakers
to
avoid
political
content
including
criticism
of
u
s
foreign
policy
n
radicalization
discourse
crystallizes
the
muslim
as
a
figure
of
legitimate
police
scrutiny
n
as
harcourt
observed
in
the
context
of
broken
windows
theory
the
theory
of
deterrence
and
punishment
focuses
on
the
disorderly
person
rather
than
the
criminal
act
and
thereby
facilitates
a
policy
of
control
relocation
and
exclusion
of
the
disorderly
the
category
of
the
disorderly
is
the
product
in
part
of
the
policing
itself
n
broken
windows
theory
does
its
work
in
a
two
step
dialectic
it
shifts
the
object
of
policing
from
crime
to
the
out
of
place
person
and
in
so
doing
constructs
the
out
of
place
person
as
someone
who
needs
to
be
surveilled
and
controlled
by
the
state
similarly
radicalization
theory
and
policing
shift
law
enforcement
s
attention
from
actual
plans
to
commit
a
terrorist
crime
to
muslim
religious
and
political
activity
by
literally
marking
observance
of
muslim
religious
practice
or
expressions
of
political
solidarity
with
other
muslims
as
within
its
causal
framework
the
radical
muslim
by
virtue
of
noncriminal
behavior
attending
a
halaqa
religious
study
group
visiting
family
in
pakistan
growing
a
beard
or
paying
off
a
mortgage
n
embodies
the
potential
threat
of
terrorism
and
in
so
doing
becomes
a
legitimate
object
of
policing
even
when
engaging
in
wholly
noncriminal
now
suspicious
behavior
politicization
becoming
involved
in
social
activism
and
community
issues
and
watching
jihadi
videos
that
highlight
atrocities
committed
against
muslims
bring
you
within
the
third
stage
it
is
not
until
the
fourth
stage
that
the
theory
concerns
itself
with
any
intent
to
undertake
a
criminal
act
in
other
words
you
could
be
three
fourths
radicalized
a
nearly
full
blown
threat
one
would
imagine
and
have
yet
to
form
any
concrete
thoughts
of
committing
any
crime
you
might
have
radical
beliefs
but
no
intent
to
commit
a
violent
crime
the
conservative
muslim
rolling
up
his
pant
sleeve
in
accord
with
a
certain
religious
practice
or
attending
the
friday
sermon
criticizing
u
s
foreign
policy
embodies
this
disorder
and
the
potential
for
a
much
larger
threat
the
religious
and
political
vectors
of
radicalization
theory
work
in
different
if
intersecting
ways
both
vectors
reflect
concerns
with
the
ideas
and
activities
of
muslim
communities
the
religious
vector
marks
basic
observant
behavior
and
conservative
modes
of
muslim
religious
practice
as
radical
and
therefore
worthy
of
suspicion
giving
up
cigarettes
drinking
and
gambling
for
example
or
wearing
traditional
islamic
clothing
are
markers
of
radicalization
n
it
matters
both
what
type
of
islam
you
believe
in
and
what
you
practice
whether
your
actions
do
you
follow
to
a
tee
the
hadith
of
the
prophet
muhammad
or
level
of
devotion
and
study
do
you
regularly
attend
a
halaqa
adhere
to
more
conservative
modes
of
practice
the
more
muslim
you
are
in
the
religious
sense
the
more
radical
and
the
more
potentially
threatening
you
appear
to
be
n
the
political
vector
marks
your
relationship
to
the
project
of
american
statecraft
vis
a
vis
your
concern
and
commune
with
other
muslims
the
ideological
questions
are
awash
in
a
loyalty
calculus
focused
on
whether
you
foreground
concern
with
muslim
community
and
muslim
suffering
at
home
and
abroad
or
the
imperatives
of
the
u
s
government
in
effectuating
its
policies
implicit
here
is
the
idea
that
such
concern
is
compatible
with
american
identity
only
to
the
extent
that
it
comes
second
or
does
not
compete
with
u
s
government
interests
n
the
activity
dimensions
focus
on
muslim
engagement
with
political
issues
vis
a
vis
other
muslims
and
the
u
s
government
does
this
person
or
community
protest
u
s
foreign
or
national
security
policy
does
this
person
or
community
comply
with
requests
to
inform
on
the
local
mosque
when
asked
by
the
fbi
to
do
so
the
radicalization
and
counterradicalization
discourses
have
clear
implications
for
the
meaning
of
good
citizenship
on
the
part
of
american
muslims
to
be
a
good
citizen
is
to
have
a
compliant
relationship
with
the
state
rather
than
to
relate
from
an
oppositional
or
contesting
stance
are
you
with
us
or
against
us
n
remains
the
question
if
radicalization
creates
ideological
force
for
the
idea
that
the
state
should
monitor
muslims
and
radical
muslims
in
particular
then
counterradicalization
initiatives
operationalize
the
distinction
offering
american
muslims
an
opening
to
perform
their
americanness
by
partnering
with
the
government
n
the
distinction
emerges
not
simply
from
how
muslims
signal
their
identity
or
allegiance
with
regard
to
muslim
religious
practices
or
other
muslims
the
distinction
between
the
radical
and
american
muslim
emerges
in
part
from
how
muslims
relate
to
u
s
statecraft
or
u
s
government
initiatives
counterradicalization
creates
friction
between
loyalty
to
the
u
s
project
and
practices
of
muslim
identity
in
particular
the
muslim
concept
of
the
ummah
or
global
muslim
community
comes
into
conflict
with
counterradicalization
commitments
resistance
to
or
criticism
of
american
foreign
policy
in
muslim
lands
is
a
factor
of
radicalization
n
so
is
concern
for
muslim
casualties
abroad
or
discrimination
against
muslims
in
the
united
states
n
traveling
abroad
to
muslim
countries
even
for
hyphenated
second
generation
americans
visiting
family
suggests
suspicious
connection
n
in
classifying
muslims
who
attend
mosque
who
travel
or
send
money
abroad
or
who
oppose
the
u
s
drone
policy
in
yemen
and
pakistan
as
within
the
process
of
radicalization
toward
terrorism
the
theory
marks
individuals
and
geographies
as
sufficiently
different
to
be
outside
the
protections
of
the
state
transforming
them
into
legitimate
objects
of
state
scrutiny
n
radical
muslims
become
the
lawless
out
of
place
subjects
deserving
of
little
protection
n
counterradicalization
cleaves
muslim
from
american
identities
in
another
way
equating
cooperation
with
the
state
with
americanness
and
loyalty
and
dissent
with
muslimness
radicalization
and
terrorism
efforts
at
partnering
with
muslim
communities
in
counterradicalization
efforts
create
opportunities
for
american
muslims
to
signal
their
allegiance
like
the
regulars
and
the
lawful
in
the
broken
windows
account
those
considered
american
muslims
are
partners
in
counterradicalization
they
stand
for
the
state
s
values
will
cooperate
with
the
police
in
their
efforts
to
monitor
and
influence
coreligionists
and
will
step
down
in
the
face
of
conflict
by
exercising
a
right
of
refusal
to
cooperate
with
the
state
the
american
muslim
moves
toward
radicalism
the
radical
emerging
in
response
to
the
state
s
policing
b
creating
the
terms
of
racial
obedience
radicalization
and
counterradicalization
place
identity
pressures
on
american
muslims
in
their
interactions
with
each
other
the
public
and
the
state
n
to
cooperate
no
matter
the
substance
of
law
enforcement
s
demand
and
expectation
is
to
validate
one
s
american
identity
to
refuse
or
to
dissent
is
to
express
radicalism
or
at
least
openness
to
it
n
radicalization
policing
creates
the
racial
obedience
toward
and
fear
of
the
police
manifested
in
particular
kinds
of
performances
to
signal
acquiescence
and
respectability
n
of
course
this
racialized
pressure
emerges
from
a
larger
social
context
people
of
color
are
subject
to
more
frequent
and
more
severe
police
scrutiny
and
they
are
fearful
that
refusing
the
police
will
stoke
racial
animosity
or
race
based
suspicion
and
aggravate
an
already
bad
situation
n
immigrants
in
particular
are
less
likely
to
know
their
rights
in
all
these
contexts
accountability
is
minimal
so
the
police
have
an
incentive
to
exploit
vulnerabilities
n
radicalization
theory
has
created
a
post
reality
in
which
muslims
are
more
vulnerable
to
compliance
requests
more
likely
to
comply
and
have
to
give
up
more
privacy
to
do
so
n
radicalization
informed
policing
produces
a
loyalty
discourse
in
which
there
are
good
and
bad
muslims
and
thereby
entrenches
the
idea
of
muslimness
as
a
crime
of
identity
n
encourages
group
surveillance
and
incentivizes
muslims
to
be
available
for
indeed
advocate
for
white
racial
inspection
of
muslimness
n
as
with
the
politics
of
respectability
in
black
communities
this
approach
does
not
protect
the
good
muslims
but
instead
renders
all
muslims
vulnerable
to
racial
profiling
n
indeed
radicalization
creates
geographies
of
suspicion
while
the
geography
of
broken
windows
theory
was
effectively
one
of
class
and
race
hoisting
the
specter
of
the
poor
black
neighborhood
the
sphere
of
radicalization
is
religious
and
cultural
though
of
course
inflected
by
race
and
class
as
well
n
in
large
metropolitan
centers
there
are
certainly
physically
contiguous
neighborhoods
where
muslims
of
similar
racial
or
class
backgrounds
reside
in
the
rest
of
the
country
however
muslims
of
different
classes
races
nationalities
and
linguistic
and
ethnic
groups
are
more
dispersed
in
these
places
government
surveillance
creates
a
different
kind
of
geography
out
of
the
places
where
muslims
gather
the
mosque
the
halal
butcher
or
the
indian
or
somali
grocery
store
and
visiting
these
places
makes
you
vulnerable
to
police
scrutiny
n
beyond
the
policing
practices
themselves
there
is
the
realm
of
public
discourse
and
debate
in
which
muslims
make
their
choices
the
most
public
and
theatrical
government
initiative
drawing
attention
to
radicalization
occurred
with
peter
king
s
first
in
a
series
of
hearings
before
the
house
homeland
security
committee
in
and
meant
to
address
a
crisis
of
radicalization
to
violence
within
the
muslim
american
community
n
and
a
refusal
by
muslims
to
cooperate
n
those
called
by
king
as
representatives
of
muslim
communities
testified
that
american
muslims
were
ignoring
concerns
with
radicalization
and
could
do
more
to
cooperate
n
the
witnesses
lampooned
a
number
of
mainstream
and
prominent
american
muslim
advocacy
organizations
muslim
advocates
the
council
on
american
islamic
relations
and
the
muslim
public
affairs
council
all
of
which
have
met
regularly
with
federal
state
and
local
city
officials
for
undermining
muslim
cooperation
with
law
enforcement
efforts
the
organizations
and
other
community
leaders
came
under
fire
especially
for
their
recent
initiatives
counseling
community
members
to
retain
a
lawyer
before
dealing
with
the
fbi
n
a
loyalty
discourse
thus
took
shape
during
the
king
hearings
as
cooperation
with
law
enforcement
was
counterposed
with
muslims
exercise
of
their
right
to
counsel
n
in
essence
muslims
were
encouraged
to
waive
their
rights
and
cooperate
with
the
state
without
undertaking
any
method
of
self
protection
as
a
way
to
demonstrate
their
americanness
and
their
loyalty
to
the
american
project
no
scrutiny
was
given
to
the
law
enforcement
efforts
with
which
they
were
being
asked
to
cooperate
n
while
the
king
hearing
is
a
particularly
egregious
example
of
a
government
initiative
that
creates
a
binary
between
muslim
and
american
identity
other
initatives
contribute
to
the
same
identity
cleavage
n
for
example
the
white
house
s
various
counterradicalization
cve
and
community
government
partnerships
have
all
contributed
to
this
discourse
charging
all
american
muslims
with
the
task
of
protecting
the
nation
against
terrorist
threats
n
in
this
context
joining
hands
with
counterradicalization
efforts
whatever
they
may
entail
becomes
the
good
american
thing
to
do
while
refusing
becomes
the
wrong
terrorist
or
muslim
option
c
racializing
ideology
in
addition
to
shaping
modes
of
political
engagement
with
the
state
radicalization
discourse
and
counterradicalization
practice
affect
the
parameters
of
religious
and
political
conversations
and
contestation
by
rendering
certain
viewpoints
or
topics
as
off
limits
n
of
course
it
is
not
just
the
existence
of
the
discourse
at
work
here
it
is
the
recurring
and
regularized
interactions
with
police
that
serve
as
constant
reminders
of
the
stakes
for
american
muslims
much
of
terrorism
and
radicalization
discourses
are
enshrouded
in
a
politics
of
anti
knowledge
n
terrorism
studies
tend
to
reduce
complex
social
historical
and
political
dynamics
n
chief
among
the
constraints
shaping
what
can
be
said
about
terrorism
is
denial
of
the
possibility
of
rational
causes
and
the
attribution
of
terrorism
to
pure
evil
n
the
mainstream
narrative
implies
that
once
an
individual
has
adopted
an
extremist
religious
ideology
terrorism
will
result

n
similarly
radicalization

discourse
displaces
any
attention
on

a
focus
on
theological
and
psychological
factors
that
supposedly
foment
radicalization
n
radicalization
theory
marks
certain
topics

as
beyond
the
pale

suggesting
that
they
are
un
american

likely
to
draw
government
scrutiny
n
as
a
result
radicalization
discourse
puts
pressure
on
the
contours
of
conversation
among
muslim
communities
about
the
public
issues
of
our
times
to
which
many
american
muslims
are
particularly
attuned

thus

about
the
exercise
of

power
in
iraq
afghanistan
pakistan
somalia
yemen
and
so
on
n
the
absence
of
muslim
voices
on
these
issues
is
particularly
notable
given
how
much
of
contemporary
u

is
focused

other
muslim
community
space
has
also
shrunk
and
warped

since
mosque
leaders
have
been
under
pressure
to
eject
anyone
expressing
radical
views
rather
than
engaging
with
them
and
seeking
to
challenge
their
religious
interpretation
address
their
political
frustrations
or
meet
their
emotional
needs
n
moreover
radicalization
discourse
may
serve
to
pathologize
complex
social
problems
displace
focus
from
the
role
of
government
activity
in
creating
those
problems

place
the
burden
of
solving

while
community
engagement
aims
to
build

with

to
gain
trust
and
enhance
communication
it
also
functions
as
a
technique
of
policing
radicalization
encouraging
all
encompassing
surveillance
of
muslim
communities
and
working
to
cultivate
in
muslims
a
suspicion
of
coreligionists
religiosity
and

n
community
engagement
becomes
yet
another
pressure
point
at
which
muslims
must
participate
in
surveillance
or
else
suggest
disloyalty
to
the
american
project
given
its
anchoring
in
counterradical
ization
the
order
that
community

seeks
to
impose
draws
from
ideas
about
the
proper
ways
to
practice
islam
in
america
the
right
balance
between
religious
and
secular
life
and
a
demand
for
a
certain
form
of
political
assimilation
n
it
closes
or
at
least
narrows
possibilities
for
meaningful
contestation
and
collaboration
while
obscuring
and
even
reinforcing
the
power
differential
between
muslim
communities
and
law
enforcement
the
space
between
how
community
engagement
appears
as
a
democracy
or
inclusion
enhancing
venture
and
the
work
it
actually
does
to
reinforce
coercive
policing
is
what
this
part
explores
throughout
the
foregoing
discussion
i
have
emphasized
the
dangers
associated
with
law
enforcement
s
community
engagement
efforts
in
particular
how
counterradicalization
and
community
engagement
work
to
cultivate
pro
law
enforcement
attitudes
and
affectations
such
that
muslims
open
up
their
communities
in
various
ways
for
government
inspection
and
regulation
in
so
emphasizing
i
do
not
mean
to
disparage
civic
engagement
which
is
no
doubt
constitutive
of
democracy
the
quality
of
civic
engagement
has
to
matter
though
if
the
end
is
democracy
of
any
meaningfully
participatory
or
accountable
variety
and
if
the
goal
is
to
bring
outsider
communities
into
the
fold
i
am
not
convinced
that
encouraging
marginalized
citizens
interactions
with
their
government
is
constructive
of
democracy
when
it
is
achieved
through
coercive
means
which
do
not
allow
for
contestation
of
terms
or
meaningful
input
and
instead
provide
pressure
on
communities
to
participate
in
the
very
policing
tactics
that
create
the
gulf
in
trust
that
propels
the
need
for
forays
into
trust
building
when
this
participation
and
consent
are
shaped
by
a
pressure
to
perform
americanness
and
to
dispel
racialized
assumptions
about
loyalty
and
allegiance
the
coercion
raises
acute
equality
and
antisubordination
concerns
the
federal
government
has
an
interest
in
community
engagement
apart
from
democracy
national
security
through
the
surveillance
and
acculturation
of
communities
marked
as
vulnerable
to
anti
american
persuasion
the
government
hopes
to
prevent
attacks
on
its
non
muslim
citizens
but
while
a
fear
of
muslims
or
so
called
islamic
terrorism
fuels
the
push
for
community
engagement
the
data
does
not
substantiate
the
extent
of
the
concerns
when
one
considers
the
size
of
the
global
muslim
population
or
even
simply
the
american
muslim
population
the
few
acts
of
terrorism
committed
by
muslims
in
the
united
states
are
infinitesimal
including
as
compared
to
other
threats
n
the
bloated
concern
with
terrorism
seems
to
be
motivated
more
by
politics
than
by
facts
community
policing
generates
its
moral
authority
by
tapping
into
the
ideas
of
community
support
and
democratic
legitimacy
but
the
slippery
quality
of
the
term
community
and
the
terrain
of
inequality
that
gives
rise
to
the
push
for
such
programs
provokes
two
nested
concerns
first
community
engagement
programs
are
largely
top
down
with
federal
government
prerogatives
imposed
on
muslim
communities
community
engagement
creates
the
aesthetics
of
democracy
and
inclusion
without
necessarily
reflecting
any
substantive
commitments
to
those
values
concretely
the
police
may
select
partners
that
ratify
preexisting
police
practices
n
or
pursue
community
engagement
primarily
as
another
entry
point
for
surveillance
and
norms
molding
as
opposed
to
a
source
of
accountability
or
contestation
the
appearance
of
collaboration
without
any
real
possibility
of
significant
contestation
may
undermine
rather
than
bolster
democracy
augmenting
the
coercive
power
of
the
state
moreover
to
the
extent
community
engagement
draws
on
racialized
pressures
on
muslims
to
perform
their
americanness
and
disavow
their
muslimness
as
a
way
to
prove
their
american
bona
fides
the
police
partnerships
exacerbate
autonomy
equality
and
subordination
concerns
implicated
in
the
broader
regime
of
policing
radicalization
second
the
police
partnerships
may
exacerbate
hierarchies
within
muslim
communities
police
partnerships
may
have
distributive
effects
internal
to
the
community
such
that
the
elite
may
be
further
empowered
over
the
marginalized
even
as
they
themselves
are
subject
to
coercive
state
power
if
the
inclusive
and
democratic
work
of
community
engagement
is
questionable
and
the
fear
of
muslims
outsized
we
must
be
suspect
of
the
heightened
push
for
community
engagement
with
muslim
communities
my
primary
concern
here
is
to
test
or
problematize
the
democratic
claims
of
this
tactic
n
a
a
top
down
approach
if
we
are
to
take
the
democracy
and
inclusion
claims
of
community
engagement
seriously
we
should
expect
that
communities
are
able
to
exert
meaningful
influence
n
or
have
a
determinative
role
in
setting
policing
goals
priorities
and
strategies
n
if
community
engagement
does
not
provide
opportunities
for
meaningful
or
determinative
input
but
rather
facilitates
involvement
only
to
the
extent
that
participants
lend
support
to
preexisting
law
enforcement
priorities
then
its
claim
to
democratic
legitimacy
should
be
questioned
there
is
strong
reason
to
question
the
democratic
claims
of
community
engagement
as
with
community
policing
in
the
ordinary
criminal
context
a
basic
tenet
of
community
engagement
is
that
there
is
value
for
muslim
communities
and
law
enforcement
in
cultivating
channels
of
communication
the
emphasis
in
official
government
statements
is
on
relationship
and
trust
building
inclusion
and
democracy
but
community
engagement
efforts
steeped
in
counterradicalization
play
important
norms
molding
and
intelligence
gathering
functions
raising
important
questions
about
the
implicit
claims
to
democracy
enhancement
on
which
the
efforts
rely
moreover
whereas
building
trust
and
relationships
is
based
generally
on
the
idea
of
two
way
obligations
in
reality
the
government
has
done
little
to
address
the
fundamental
root
of
distrust
which
starts
with
the
overly
broad
and
punitive
approach
to
policing
entire
muslim
communities
n
interacting
with
muslim
communities
law
enforcement
s
prevailing
focus
is
national
security
foregrounding
threat
potential
in
government
s
interactions
with
muslim
communities
n
above
and
beyond
the
concerns
with
community
engagement
serving
as
a
cover
for
surveillance
and
norms
molding
the
federal
government
has
repeatedly
signaled
little
room
for
american
muslim
communities
to
play
a
determinative
role
in
setting
priorities
community
engagement
provides
opportunities
for
american
muslims
to
partake
in
and
ratify
law
enforcement
s
work
in
a
community
engagement
push
by
federal
law
enforcement
with
minnesota
s
somali
communities
for
example
an
fbi
private
acknowledged
there
was
no
possibility
of
the
community
having
influenced
how
the
investigations
were
carried
out
n
to
the
contrary
the
aims
were
more
one
sided
to
correct
what
its
agents
called
misperceptions
such
as
that
suspects
in
somalia
might
be
imprisoned
without
trial
or
targeted
for
drone
killings
such
community
fears
were
consistent
with
official
us
policy
and
to
encourage
community
leaders
to
pass
information
to
federal
agents
about
young
people
n
while
there
might
be
space
to
raise
concerns
with
the
government
there
is
little
reason
to
suggest
any
real
possibility
for
meaningful
or
determinative
input
n
the
detachment
of
community
engagement
from
its
claim
to
democratic
authority
starts
at
the
foundational
level
community
policing
s
historical
aim
has
been
to
reduce
crime
in
an
inner
city
or
even
a
particular
neighborhood
the
subject
community
could
in
some
sense
be
imagined
to
be
working
with
the
police
to
enhance
its
own
welfare
central
to
proponents
arguments
for
community
policing
has
been
the
idea
that
african
american
communities
suffer
from
underenforcement
by
police
and
need
more
policing
to
rid
their
communities
of
crime
n
in
its
national
security
manifestation
however
community
engagement
s
aim
is
to
secure
the
state
muslims
are
made
responsible
not
for
their
own
condition
but
for
the
welfare
of
the
entire
nation
and
for
protecting
the
nation
against
terrorists
it
is
a
particularized
responsibility
for
the
welfare
of
the
nation
not
shared
by
other
groups
n
the
assignment
of
responsibility
should
trouble
us
for
a
number
of
reasons
including
basic
american
proscriptions
against
guilt
by
association
and
racial
and
religious
profiling
muslim
communities
had
not
identified
radicalization
or
violent
extremism
as
an
issue
of
concern
before
the
government
s
framing
of
radicalization
and
violent
extremism
as
a
national
priority
n
by
and
large
muslim
communities
and
advocacy
groups
have
not
only
objected
to
the
radicalization
framework
and
the
assertion
of
growing
radicalization
in
muslim
communities
n
but
have
also
insisted
that
they
are
cooperating
with
law
enforcement
efforts
n
community
engagement
in
its
current
manifestation
grounded
in
counterradicalization
and
cve
has
in
some
sense
been
foisted
on
muslim
communities
n
the
federal
nature
of
the
underlying
concern
also
undercuts
community
engagement
s
democratic
potential
federal
law
enforcement
entities
national
in
scope
and
in
responsibility
take
the
lead
in
community
engagement
efforts
whereas
local
police
embody
community
policing
as
originally
conceived
even
in
the
community
policing
context
critics
worried
that
more
marginalized
communities
or
more
marginalized
segments
of
communities
the
ones
most
in
need
of
protection
from
abusive
unaccountable
policing
would
be
unable
to
exert
enough
power
to
contest
or
hold
police
accountable
in
the
federal
context
not
to
mention
the
politically
charged
realm
of
national
security
the
concern
is
even
more
acute
the
idea
that
marginalized
dispersed
and
diverse
muslim
communities
could
hold
accountable
the
federal
government
or
federal
law
enforcement
on
national
security
issues
is
dubious
if
muslims
had
the
political
power
to
hold
the
police
accountable
community
engagement
programs
would
not
be
necessary
from
a
democracy
or
inclusion
perspective
to
begin
with
at
the
heart
of
radicalization
discourse
is
the
idea
that
muslims
and
islam
are
responsible
for
terrorism
radicalization
discourse
creates
false
and
stigmatizing
equivalences
between
islam
muslims
and
terrorism
and
between
islam
muslims
and
violence
in
turn
community
engagement
becomes
a
tool
of
counterradicalization
in
which
muslims
are
asked
to
participate
instru
mentalizing
muslim
leaders
to
share
information
on
their
co
religionists
in
a
regime
that
conflates
islam
with
the
problem
n
this
information
sharing
happens
knowingly
and
unknowingly
directly
and
indirectly
and
with
varying
degrees
of
consent
and
coercion
through
community
participation
in
community
engagement
efforts
the
well
intentioned
community
leader
seeking
to
forge
ties
with
law
enforcement
as
a
way
to
help
his
community
may
unwittingly
share
intelligence
that
renders
coreligionists
even
more
vulnerable
n
the
recently
released
fbi
policy
directive
on
community
engagement
reflects
the
sense
of
the
agency
that
community
members
do
not
have
an
expectation
that
community
engagement
will
generate
information
for
an
fbi
file
or
database
n
indeed
when
advocacy
groups
publicized
the
records
obtained
by
the
freedom
of
information
act
foia
demonstrating
the
bay
area
fbi
mosque
outreach
program
served
as
a
cover
for
surveillance
muslim
communities
reacted
with
surprise
n
the
revelations
that
community
engagement
initiatives
have
served
to
collect
intelligence
on
entire
muslim
communities
have
had
devastating
effects
on
the
ability
of
these
communities
to
function
cohesively
and
trust
in
law
enforcement
n
nonetheless
muslims
are
asked
to
choose
the
state
over
self
determination
and
autonomy
n
muslim
communities
are
asked
to
participate
in
political
and
religious
acculturation
of
their
communities
to
ensure
their
coreligionists
are
sufficiently
american
not
too
conservative
not
too
critical
of
the
united
states
there
is
pressure
on
muslims
to
moderate
their
religious
and
political
views
and
to
pressure
coreligionists
to
do
the
same
for
the
good
of
the
nation
a
significant
aspect
of
this
duty
is
to
facilitate
the
state
s
reach
into
muslim
communities
by
partnering
in
surveillance
and
culture
shaping
including
by
opening
doors
to
and
participating
in
law
enforcement
community
engagement
n
community
engagement
may
also
incentivize
community
members
to
share
information
about
coreligionists
day
to
day
activities
with
law
enforcement
this
incentivization
may
occur
through
opportunities
to
perform
americanness
an
american
muslim
specific
politics
of
respectability
perhaps
and
may
come
with
concrete
benefits
such
as
access
to
government
officials
invitations
to
other
community
engagement
programs
or
even
help
with
immigration
issues
n
but
the
pressure
to
participate
in
the
acculturation
does
not
end
at
the
town
hall
or
meet
and
greet
effort
the
community
engagement
contact
becomes
a
conduit
through
which
participants
become
part
of
the
larger
surveillance
apparatus
this
requires
accepting
the
premises
of
counterradicalization
and
the
view
that
conservative
modes
of
religious
practice
or
harsh
criticism
of
the
united
states
is
suspicious
or
dangerous
it
also
requires
adopting
the
view
that
muslims
have
a
role
in
sharing
information
on
and
regulating
the
political
and
religious
currents
in
their
communities
and
that
they
must
condemn
radicalism
and
extremism
in
any
form
in
their
communities
a
muslim
businessman
who
has
partnered
in
community
engagement
efforts
explained
the
fbi
is
really
helping
us
to
know
what
to
look
for
if
you
see
someone
changing
overnight
growing
a
beard
and
starting
to
wear
different
clothes
we
need
to
find
out
what
is
happening
n
similarly
in
a
presentation
to
muslim
community
leaders
in
houston
fbi
agents
asked
attendees
to
report
on
community
members
who
were
taking
extreme
positions

constitutive

around
a
desire
to
work
with
the
police

power

partnership
may

incredibly
diverse

infinite
varieties
of

specific
ethnic
or
religious
group
as
particularly
relevant
to
the
project

national
security
n
while
the
white
house
goes
to
some
length
to
emphasize
that
terrorist
recruitment
could
happen
in

the
force
of

been
on

to
blame
and
they
hold
entire
religious
communities
to
account
for
the
acts
of
individuals
community
engagement
initiatives
necessarily
focus
on
subgroups
within
muslim
communities
n
recent
data
suggests
community
engagement
efforts
focus
on
arab
american
muslims
to
the
relative
exclusion
of
african
american
south
asian
and
other
american
muslims
of
various
decent
n
in
focusing
on
certain
subgroups
youth
for
example
the
government
seems
to
have
assigned
them
a
particularly
high
threat
of
radicalization
which
in
turn
is
likely
to
intensify
vulnerability
in
these
communities
there
s
an
observable
synergy
between
the
focus
of
community
engagement
efforts
policing
radicalization
and
foreign
policy
priorities
n
government
focus
on
the
american
somali
community
in
the
form
of
community
engagement
and
other
policing
as
well
for
material
support
prosecutions
n
dovetailed
with
u
s
foreign
policy
concerns
about
al
shabaab
a
somalia
based
designated
foreign
terrorist
organization
n
which
several
somali
americans
allegedly
traveled
abroad
to
join
n
similarly
the
latest
focus
on
isis
has
come
with
a
resurgent
push
on
community
engagement
policing
and
material
support
prosecutions
in
american
muslim
communities
n
in
practice
then
community
engagement
is
closely
intertwined
with
other
policing
methods
and
functions
as
well
as
the
security
crisis
of
the
day
reconstituting
the
idea
that
federal
community
engagement
approaches
muslims
first
as
potential
threats
and
then
as
partners
n
while
community
engagement
initiatives
do
not
overtly
make
distinctions
based
on
class
they
inevitably
prioritize
community
elites
leaders
imams
businessmen
and
other
centers
of
influence
in
muslim
communities
n
other
more
blatantly
coercive
techniques
of
policing
radicalization
those
recruited
into
formal
informant
relationships
or
targeted
by
informants
for
radicalization
or
entrapment
are
likely
to
focus
on
community
members
more
vulnerable
by
virtue
of
their
class
immigration
status
or
criminal
records
thus
while
relative
elites
may
partner
with
law
enforcement
to
facilitate
access
those
that
suffer
the
most
acute
consequences
are
more
likely
more
vulnerable
there
may
be
financial
mechanics
to
counterradicalization
programming
n
both
with
regard
to
funding
for
state
and
local
law
enforcement
and
for
community
partners
raising
a
whole
host
of
other
issues
federal
dollars
may
induce
state
and
local
law
enforcement
to
approach
local
muslim
communities
with
a
new
counterradicalization
lens
and
may
warp
the
work
of
community
based
organizations
n
consider
the
st
paul
example
st
paul
s
police
department
secured
doj
funding
to
take
a
counterradicalization
community
engagement
approach
in
a
longstanding
outreach
program
with
local
american
somali
communities
n
in
turn
muslim
american
society
of
minnesota
got
funding
through
the
program
to
hire
a
police
liaison
n
in
other
words
doj
funded
the
local
police
department
which
in
turn
funded
the
community
based
organization
s
effort
the
executive
director
of
the
organization
was
asked
to
keep
track
of
attendees
at
outreach
meetings
but
when
asked
by
the
police
department
to
share
the
list
of
participants
he
refused
n
certainly
there
are
ideological
dimensions
to
partnership
with
the
federal
government
n
counterradicalization
programs
will
bolster
muslim
leaders
who
are
seen
as
moderate
in
their
religious
and
political
views
and
thereby
involve
the
government
in
shaping
of
acceptable
forms
of
islam
and
palatable
forms
of
political
engagement
n
equally
troublingly
community
engagement
programs
may
work
only
with
those
muslims
who
are
relatively
more
amenable
to
the
government
s
counterradicalization
approach
community
engagement
tends
to
empower
those
who
want
more
policing
at
the
expense
of
those
who
want
more
control
of
the
police
and
to
exclude
those
whose
interests
are
in
less
aggressive
policing
n
those
interested
in
more
policing
are
likely
to
be
more
politically
organized
have
more
political
capital
and
be
more
likely
to
be
invited
to
or
to
attend
police
community
forums
n
those
uninterested
in
more
policing
may
avoid
any
interactions
with
the
police
let
alone
cultivate
partnerships
refusal
to
participate
in
such
efforts
may
even
be
construed
as
a
sign
of
radicalization
n
more
generally
law
enforcement
plays
an
important
role
in
who
gets
a
seat
at
the
table
to
represent
the
american
muslim
community
take
the
case
of
the
council
on
american
islamic
relations
cair
the
largest
muslim
american
civil
rights
organization
in
the
fbi
cut
off
ties
with
cair
not
viewing
the
group
as
an
appropriate
liaison
partner
n
the
islamic
shura
council
of
southern
california
registered
its
complaint
with
the
los
angeles
field
office
suspending
the
membership
organization
s
participation
in
the
fbi
s
outreach
work
n
the
american
civil
liberties
union
later
complained
to
the
doj
office
of
inspector
general
about
the
fbi
s
publicly
and
selectively
ostracizing
cair
from
its
official
outreach
events
without
adequate
basis
to
exclude
the
civil
rights
organization
n
in
the
aftermath
the
muslim
public
affairs
council
mpac
started
to
play
a
more
significant
role
in
the
federal
government
s
outreach
and
counterradicalization
efforts
in
los
angeles
and
around
the
country
n
behind
the
vision
of
community
in
accounts
of
community
policing
and
community
engagement
there
tends
to
be
a
nostalgic
aspirational
idea
of
community
disconnected
from
reality
a
community
where
there
are
bright
boundaries
demarcating
who
is
inside
and
outside
and
the
community
s
wants
are
clear
and
unanimous
n
in
relying
on
this
imagined
community
community
policing
has
prioritized
order
over
dissent
and
agreement
over
disagreement
it
has
failed
moreover
to
take
communities
seriously
in
their
messy
realities
and
has
fallen
short
of
its
potential
to
be
a
more
democratic
form
of
policing
the
desire
to
partner
with
antiradical
or
moderate
elements
in
american
muslim
communities
imposes
a
similar
imaginary
for
american
muslims
creating
a
community
engagement
program
that
is
inflexible
and
unresponsive
to
dissent
or
contestation
c
push
back
since
muslim
communities
have
consistently
articulated
a
fear
of
being
outspoken
or
involved
in
the
public
sphere
for
fear
of
retribution
or
scrutiny
from
the
federal
government
n
the
concern
is
that
any
heightened
visibility
may
draw
the
surveillance
of
the
state
to
their
door
this
concern
has
manifested
in
a
reluctance
to
organize
or
articulate
criticism
of
u
s
policies
toward
muslims
at
home
and
abroad
and
in
changed
relationships
to
spaces
of
community
and
worship
n
at
the
same
time
muslim
communities
have
become
increasingly
vocal
in
their
objections
to
broad
based
surveillance
and
in
particular
the
use
of
informants
in
their
communities
n
in
the
most
recent
wave
of
community
engagement
initiatives
muslim
communities
have
notably
used
the
forums
discussed
herein
to
contest
the
modes
through
which
the
federal
government
is
interacting
with
them
when
the
secretary
of
homeland
security
visited
an
ohio
mosque
for
example
he
faced
a
litany
of
grievances
including
complaints
of
humiliating
border
inspections
by
brusque
federal
agents
and
f
b
i
sting
operations
that
wrongly
targeted
muslim
citizens
as
terrorists
n
the
mosque
s
youth
coordinator
told
the
new
york
times
our
relationship
has
to
be
built
on
trust
but
the
u
s
government
hasn
t
given
us
very
many
reasons
to
build
up
that
trust
n
public
boycott
of
high
profile
community
engagement
events
at
the
white
house
have
become
a
tool
for
organizing
and
resistance
n
in
advance
of
the
annual
white
house
iftar
during
the
month
of
ramadan
a
wide
ranging
debate
emerged
among
american
muslims
when
a
petition
calling
for
boycott
of
the
iftar
emerged
on
social
media
and
the
american
arab
anti
discrimination
committee
adc
issued
a
statement
in
support
n
the
boycott
was
framed
as
a
response
to
the
administration
s
support
for
israel
s
massacre
of
palestinians
in
gaza
and
the
latest
snowden
revelations
about
the
nsa
spying
on
american
muslim
leaders
including
those
involved
in
community
engagement
initiatives
n
the
adc
explained
that
political
engagement
is
important
and
having
a
seat
at
the
table
is
crucial
but
only
when
the
seat
is
intended
to
amplify
our
voice
as
a
community
not
tokenize
or
subdue
it
n
while
many
boycotted
the
iftar
many
attended
despite
sharing
the
concerns
motivating
the
boycott
n
similarly
a
number
of
muslim
american
community
groups
boycotted
and
protested
the
three
day
cve
summit
held
at
the
white
house
in
february
n
a
coalition
of
american
muslim
and
civil
rights
groups
issued
a
joint
statement
in
advance
of
the
summit
outlining
concerns
that
community
engagement
from
a
cve
standpoint
sets
american
muslim
communities
apart
as
inherently
suspect
that
cve
tasks
community
members
to
expansively
monitor
the
beliefs
and
expressive
or
associational
activities
of
other
muslims
and
creates
a
climate
of
fear
and
chills
constitutionally
protected
activity
and
that
mutual
trust
is
difficult
if
not
impossible
given
the
fbi
s
larger
set
of
police
practices
including
deceptively
conducting
intelligence
gathering
under
the
guise
of
community
outreach
and
relying
on
law
enforcement
agencies
to
play
the
lead
role
in
implementing
cve
n
while
some
of
the
signatories
declined
the
invitation
to
the
summit
the
groups
collectively
decided
that
representatives
from
some
of
our
groups
will
attend
in
order
to
provide
a
sorely
missing
critical
perspective
on
the
cve
framework
and
to
seek
more
information
about
the
rollout
and
implementation
of
cve
pilot
n
at
the
same
time
a
number
of
muslim
student
association
chapters
issued
a
strong
statement
opposing
cve
programs
to
ensure
that
our
american
muslim
community
is
not
mistreated
and
that
our
youth
are
able
to
live
their
lives
free
from
fear
of
surveillance
racial
and
religious
profiling
and
as
strong
active
members
of
their
communities
n
it
is
too
soon
to
know
whether
american
muslims
publicly
organizing
and
debating
the
merits
of
community
engagement
will
lead
to
change
or
lead
to
programs
that
simply
work
around
the
protest
and
protesters
law
enforcement
s
response
may
portend
the
democratic
potential
of
community
engagement
n
conclusion
this
article
has
attempted
to
identify
the
problems
with
community
engagement
and
counterradicalization
in
the
national
security
context
drawing
from
the
critiques
of
community
policing
and
broken
windows
in
the
ordinary
criminal
context
the
canvas
for
this
critical
engagement
was
limited
insofar
as
muslim
communities
experiences
in
these
programs
have
been
largely
sheltered
from
public
view
harvesting
those
experiences
is
no
doubt
essential
to
understanding
the
possibilities
and
limitations
of
these
programs
this
article
provided
a
sketch
of
the
problems
lurking
near
the
surface
that
is
left
to
future
work
is
community
engagement
salvageable
moving
community
engagement
toward
its
most
democratic
aspirations
toward
a
more
genuine
exercise
in
community
consultation
contestation
and
collaboration
would
involve
ridding
the
program
of
its
pernicious
baggage
for
example
law
enforcement
could
end
community
engagement
s
integration
with
community
wide
intelligence
gathering
or
could
decouple
community
engagement
from
cve
and
counterradicalization
certainly
there
are
strong
normative
reasons
including
those
that
motivate
this
article
to
expect
and
demand
that
law
enforcement
account
for
the
realities
of
marginalized
communities
but
we
cannot
expect
that
dialogue
will
necessarily
lead
to
accountability
meaningful
contestation
or
realignment
of
police
approaches
in
marginalized
communities
after
all
law
enforcement
is
itself
a
significant
vehicle
for
marginalization
and
racialization
in
the
united
states
it
is
reasonable
to
question
whether
community
policing
or
policing
at
all
can
be
expected
to
be
the
vehicle
for
the
change
we
are
seeking
the
problem
and
the
solution
may
be
entirely
mismatched
the
allure
of
community
policing
rests
in
part
on
a
broader
construct
of
dialogue
as
inherently
valuable
while
dialogue
can
certainly
be
valuable
its
value
will
depend
on
the
context
and
the
point
of
view
from
which
it
is
being
evaluated
dialogue
often
serves
a
different
function
for
the
more
powerful
in
the
conversation
than
the
less
powerful
the
idea
that
dialogue
is
the
cure
all
for
poor
relationships
between
police
and
marginalized
communities
emerges
from
a
failure
to
recognize
the
structures
and
histories
of
police
impunity
in
these
communities
as
well
as
the
material
realities
that
keep
inequality
in
place
when
the
dialogue
in
question
is
with
the
police
initiated
by
the
police
and
on
the
police
s
own
terms
not
only
is
the
function
of
the
dialogue
necessarily
limited
the
entire
initiative
should
raise
red
flags
how
will
the
dialogue
change
the
material
reality
of
policing
in
the
community
does
the
dialogue
further
exacerbate
inequality
or
simply
validate
preexisting
policing
practices
through
the
performance
of
democratic
legitimacy
or
is
it
really
allowing
for
messy
democratic
contestation
and
the
possibility
for
change
in
the
material
conditions
of
the
relationship
between
the
police
and
the
marginalized
for
community
policing
to
be
an
effective
tool
in
changing
the
relationship
between
the
marginalized
and
law
enforcement
marginalized
communities
cannot
simply
be
offered
a
seat
at
the
table
to
participate
in
preconceived
policing
programs
they
must
have
the
political
power
to
hold
police
accountable
for
community
policing
mechanisms
to
offer
potential
for
real
change
to
marginalized
communities
communities
must
build
capacity
and
political
power
to
demand
accountability
so
while
we
might
advocate
for
law
enforcement
to
engage
marginalized
communities
we
cannot
rely
on
law
enforcement
initiatives
to
recalibrate
relationships
long
rife
with
deep
inequality
the
pressure
for
meaningful
change
must
come
from
outside
from
the
communities
themselves
organizing
for
change

n
it
could
be
argued
that
the
relative
lack
of
details
on
these
community
engagement
programs
undermines
the
possibility
of
stigma
attaching
to
muslim
communities
that
raises
the
question
of
how
much
and
what
kind
of
detail
about
these
programs
translates
into
stigmatization
separate
and
apart
from
what
is
reported
and
what
the
public
hears
about
stigmatization
occurs
by

of
these
contacts

at
the
request
of
his

officer
tyrone
c
brown
came
to
a
community
auditorium
here
in
june
and
sat
alongside
about
other
mostly
young
black
men
with
criminal
records
men
who
were
being
watched
closely
by
the
police
just
as
he
was
he
expected
to
hear
an
admonition
from
law
enforcement
officials
to
help
end
violence
in
the
community
but
mr
brown
got
more
than
he
had
bargained
for
a
police
captain
presented
a
slide
show
featuring
mug
shots
of
people
they
were
cracking
down
on
up
popped
a
picture
of
mr
brown
linking
him
to
a
criminal
group
that
had
been
implicated
in
a
homicide
i
was
disturbed
said
mr
brown
who
acknowledges
having
been
involved
in
crime
but
denied
that
he
had
ever
been
involved
in
a
killing
that
discomfort
was
just
the
reaction
the
authorities
were
after
mr
brown
whose
criminal
record
includes
drug
and
assault
charges
is
at
the
center
of
an
experiment
taking
place
in
dozens
of
police
departments
across
the
country
one
in
which
the
authorities
have
turned
to
complex
computer
algorithms
to
try
to
pinpoint
the
people
most
likely
to
be
involved
in
future
violent
crimes
as
either
predator
or
prey
the
goal
is
to
do
all
they
can
to
prevent
the
crime
from
happening
the
strategy
known
as
predictive
policing
combines
elements
of
traditional
policing
like
increased
attention
to
crime
hot
spots
and
close
monitoring
of
recent
parolees
but
it
often
also
uses
other
data
including
information
about
friendships
social
media
activity
and
drug
use
to
identify
hot
people
and
aid
the
authorities
in
forecasting
crime
the
program
here
has
been
named
the
kansas
city
no
violence
alliance
or
kc
nova
and
the
message
on
that
june
night
to
mr
brown
and
the
others
was
simple
the
next
time
they
or
anyone
in
their
crews
commit
a
violent
act
the
police
will
come
after
everyone
in
the
group
for
whatever
offense
they
can
make
stick
no
matter
how
petty
such
was
the
case
for
mario
glenn
a
year
old
with
a
criminal
history
that
includes
drug
trafficking
and
assault
after
he
attended
a
program
meeting
called
a
call
in
last
year
he
was
caught
during
a
police
sting
to
take
down
a
group
implicated
in
several
homicides
mr
glenn
robbed
a
confidential
informer
trying
to
buy
a
gun
from
him
the
police
said
he
has
been
convicted
and
prosecutors
are
now
seeking
the
maximum
year
prison
sentence
we
have
a
moral
reason
to
do
a
better
job
at
addressing
violence
in
this
community
said
jean
peters
baker
the
prosecutor
for
jackson
county
which
includes
kansas
city
i
don
t
know
that
this
will
work
but
we
need
to
try
the
use
of
computer
models
by
local
law
enforcement
agencies
to
forecast
crime
is
part
of
a
larger
trend
by
governments
and
corporations
that
are
increasingly
turning
to
predictive
analytics
and
data
mining
in
looking
at
behaviors
typically
financed
by
the
federal
government
the
strategy
is
being
used
by
dozens
of
police
departments
including
los
angeles
miami
and
nashville
and
district
attorneys
offices
in
manhattan
and
philadelphia
at
a
time
when
many
police
departments
are
under
fire
for
aggressive
tactics
particularly
in
minority
neighborhoods
advocates
say
predictive
policing
can
help
improve
police
community
relations
by
focusing
on
the
people
most
likely
to
become
involved
in
violent
crime
civil
liberties
groups
take
a
dim
view
of
the
strategy
questioning
its
legality
and
efficacy
and
asserting
that
it
may
actually
worsen
the
rapport
between
the
police
and
civilians
ezekiel
edwards
the
director
of
the
criminal
law
reform
project
of
the
american
civil
liberties
union
said
predictive
policing
tended
to
legitimize
the
profiling
of
racial
minorities
who
live
in
poor
high
crime
neighborhoods
and
prompted
officers
to
enforce
laws
selectively
our
concern
is
guilt
by
association
mr
edwards
said
because
you
live
in
a
certain
neighborhood
or
hang
out
with
certain
people
we
are
now
going
to
be
suspicious
of
you
and
treat
you
differently
not
because
you
have
committed
a
crime
or
because
we
have
information
that
allows
us
to
arrest
you
but
because
our
predictive
tool
shows
us
you
might
commit
a
crime
at
some
point
in
the
future
but
researchers
working
with
the
police
to
develop
the
predictive
algorithms
say
that
they
can
come
closer
than
traditional
detective
work
to
figuring
out
who
is
most
apt
to
break
the
law
they
say
criminals
commit
violent
crimes
in
fairly
distinctive
patterns
and
often
have
similar
attributes
those
include
previous
arrests
unemployment
an
unstable
home
life
friends
and
relatives
who
have
been
killed
are
in
prison
or
have
gang
ties
and
problems
with
drugs
or
alcohol
in
chicago
the
police
have
developed
a
heat
list
of
people
who
are
considered
far
more
likely
than
the
average
person
to
be
involved
in
violent
crime
factors
in
compiling
that
list
included
their
criminal
records
social
circles
and
gang
connections
also
a
factor
was
whether
they
had
been
victims
of
an
assault
or
a
shooting
these
are
the
people
with
the
highest
propensity
for
violence
in
the
city
of
chicago
said
robert
j
tracy
chief
of
crime
control
strategies
for
the
chicago
police
department
in
the
year
since
its
program
has
been
fully
in
place
kansas
city
has
had
a
significant
decrease
in
homicides
the
city
had
averaged
homicides
a
year
over
a
four
and
a
half
decade
period
through
and
the
number
of
murders
hovered
over
in
the
roughly
five
years
before
nova
s
inception
but
murders
plummeted
to
last
year
a
percent
drop
from
while
assaults
with
guns
also
decreased
last
year
overall
assaults
increased
whether
those
changes
were
linked
to
nova
is
difficult
to
say
because
fluctuations
in
crime
are
almost
always
a
result
of
multiple
factors
at
the
same
time
a
report
released
recently
by
the
university
of
missouri
kansas
city
found
that
while
crime
decreased
drastically
early
last
year
as
nova
was
fully
in
place
the
drop
tapered
off
it
is
too
soon
to
determine
if
decreased
crime
will
be
a
long
term
trend
the
report
said
in
other
places
the
success
of
the
algorithms
has
been
spotty
or
difficult
to
assess
john
s
hollywood
a
senior
operations
researcher
at
the
rand
corporation
said
that
in
the
limited
number
of
studies
undertaken
to
measure
the
efficacy
of
predictive
policing
the
improvement
in
forecasting
crimes
had
been
only
or
percent
better
than
regular
policing
methods
the
memphis
police
force
a
pioneer
in
predictive
policing
has
worked
with
the
university
of
memphis
for
about
a
decade
to
forecast
crime
by
noting
time
and
location
of
episodes
and
information
about
victims
officers
then
flood
those
areas
with
marked
and
undercover
police
cars
and
also
increase
traffic
stops
the
department
said
but
violent
crime
has
proved
stubborn
in
memphis
and
the
city
continues
to
be
one
of
the
most
dangerous
places
in
the
nation
according
to
f
b
i
data
in
kansas
city
nova
officials
gather
about
to
patrol
officers
about
once
a
quarter
to
discuss
and
examine
intelligence
gathered
on
the
street
details
not
necessarily
captured
in
official
documents
the
information
often
comes
from
informal
conversations
that
officers
have
with
people
on
the
street
about
things
like
who
is
arguing
and
who
might
have
committed
a
violent
crime
the
authorities
have
identified
about
people
who
belong
to
criminal
groups
in
the
city
said
maj
joe
mchale
the
project
leader
for
nova
who
also
commands
the
police
department
s
violent
crime
division
and
there
are
about
people
whom
the
authorities
consider
central
figures
in
those
groups
he
said
the
kansas
city
authorities
say
they
hope
that
if
their
zero
tolerance
for
violence
message
gets
through
to
these
influential
figures
it
will
be
passed
on
to
others
who
listen
to
them
one
of
those
powerful
individuals
according
to
the
police
was
mr
brown
who
said
he
began
selling
drugs
at
because
he
was
raised
in
poverty
by
a
crack
addicted
single
mother
when
he
was
first
drawn
into
the
program
said
mr
brown
who
most
recently
served
jail
time
for
robbery
his
probation
officer
told
him
he
had
to
go
to
the
june
meeting
which
is
known
as
a
call
in
call
ins
are
central
to
the
program
the
authorities
invite
about
of
the
group
leaders
they
have
identified
to
usually
show
up
to
hear
from
a
range
of
officials
including
the
local
and
federal
prosecutors
the
police
chief
and
the
mayor
during
an
august
call
in
the
speakers
told
the
men
that
this
was
their
last
chance
tammy
dickinson
the
united
states
attorney
for
the
western
district
of
missouri
related
the
story
of
a
man
in
the
program
who
was
given
a
year
prison
sentence
for
being
caught
with
a
bullet
in
his
pocket
another
man
she
said
got
years
for
having
recreational
designer
drugs
known
as
bath
salts
and
posting
a
photograph
of
himself
with
a
gun
on
facebook
a
week
after
the
june
call
in
a
social
worker
called
mr
brown
into
a
meeting
he
said
his
heart
was
thumping
when
he
entered
the
room
and
saw
several
police
officers
waiting
for
him
we
know
that
you
are
the
head
of
this
and
of
that
mr
brown
recalled
the
officers
telling
him
if
we
can
change
you
you
can
change
them
people
who
have
gotten
in
trouble
with
the
law
often
think
they
can
keep
getting
away
with
minor
offenses
without
serious
consequences
said
mr
brown
whose
nickname
bird
slang
for
a
brick
of
cocaine
came
from
his
drug
dealing
but
what
resonated
with
him
he
said
was
the
nova
team
saying
that
harsh
penalties
will
be
imposed
for
even
petty
slights
once
warnings
have
been
given
mr
brown
has
come
to
see
some
benefit
in
the
program
nova
officials
have
helped
him
find
housing
he
said
and
pushed
him
to
get
a
job
he
now
works
as
a
delivery
driver
for
back
porch
bar
b
q
the
authorities
connected
him
with

to
help
him

he
has
four
children
ranging
from
months
to
years
and
he
works
with
young
people
to
help
keep
them
out
of
trouble
still
mr
brown
is
hardly

the
clear
domestic
assault
charges
are
pending
against
him
after
his
girlfriend
accused
him
of
choking
her
and
hitting

head
against

door
last

a
handful
of
shoddily
written
emails
spread
shock
waves
across
the
us
last
week
the
threats
were
familiar
warning
of
gunfire
backpack
bombs
and
mayhem
in
new
york
and
los
angeles
schools
sent
at
am
est
the
messages
were
routed
electronically
through
germany
though
the
author
s
whereabouts
are
still
unknown
the
two
cities
responded
in
dramatically
opposing
fashion
the
los
angeles
unified
school
district
shut
down
more
than
facilities
preventing
over
children
from
attending
class
officials
searched
buildings
and
police
patrols
were
expanded
throughout
the
week
the
price
tag
was
estimated
at
m
but
could
cost
much
more
new
york
on
the
other
hand
swiftly
dismissed
the
threats
as
a
hoax
their
assessment
was
made
possible
by
the
city
s
massive
investments
in
counter
terrorism
capabilities
following
the
tough
talking
chief
of
police
william
bratton
suggested
the
sender
had
indulged
in
too
many
episodes
of
homeland
though
called
out
by
new
york
s
mayor
for
overreacting
la
can
hardly
be
faulted
for
taking
the
terrorist
threat
seriously
it
came
on
the
heels
of
this
month
s
massacre
of
people
in
san
bernardino
less
than
miles
from
la
and
counter
terrorism
experts
have
been
expecting
attacks
for
months
the
goal
is
to
shut
cities
down
separate
people
from
one
another
and
push
them
into
mental
fortresses
david
kilcullen
nevertheless
the
jittery
reaction
seemed
to
reveal
a
chink
in
our
cities
armour
a
vulnerability
not
just
to
terror
attacks
but
to
the
mere
threat
of
such
attacks
post
paris
the
sense
of
unease
is
pervasive
us
homeland
security
regularly
issues
alerts
including
last
week
s
warning
of
self
radicalised
actors
who
could
strike
with
little
or
no
notice
that
come
without
any
specific
information
there
are
dozens
of
warnings
a
day
law
enforcement
agencies
are
bogged
down
and
the
probability
of
actual
attacks
seems
to
be
growing
which
means
that
pranksters
or
not
terrorists
are
inflicting
real
costs
both
in
terms
of
life
and
money
on
our
cities
which
is
of
course
the
point
in
other
words
our
increasingly
panicky
reaction
to
terror
threats
mean
you
can
inflict
a
degree
of
damage
on
a
city
at
the
click
of
a
mouse
it
s
no
surprise
then
that
there
has
been
a
increase
in
the
number
of
threats
to
us
schools
in
more
than
a
third
of
these
were
sent
electronically
many
resulted
in
evacuations
and
shutdowns
the
goal
is
to
shut
cities
down
for
as
long
as
possible
separate
people
from
one
another
break
down
communities
and
push
them
into
mental
fortresses
says
counter
insurgency
specialist
david
kilcullen
he
believes
that
cities
themselves
are
under
assault
precisely
because
they
are
the
places
that
different
communities
come
together
and
the
result
of
the
assault
is
that
different
ethnic
and
religious
communities
stop
trusting
one
another
and
become
more
susceptible
to
exploitation
terror
in
cities
is
nothing
new
of
course
la
was
rocked
by
home
made
bombs
in
and
parts
of
wall
street
were
decimated
by
a
wagonful
of
explosives
in
the
single
deadliest
act
of
domestic
terrorism
in
us
history
occurred
in
oklahoma
in
and
with
the
exception
of
violent
attacks
in
the
us
are
almost
all
homegrown
european
cities
are
even
more
accustomed
to
it
well
before
al
qaida
and
isis
the
people
of
london
madrid
and
rome
were
battered
respectively
by
the
ira
eta
and
anni
di
piomi
there
were
more
than
terrorist
attacks
in
europe
over
the
past
years
according
to
the
university
of
maryland
s
global
terrorism
database
most
of
them
during
the
s
and
s
moreover
it
is
easy
for
westerners
to
forget
that
the
vast
majority
of
terrorist
actions
occur
elsewhere
a
recent
study
of
more
than
cities
ranked
baghdad
mosul
and
ramadi
as
the
most
terrorism
prone
it
also
showed
that
cities
in
afghanistan
egypt
libya
nigeria
pakistan
and
somalia
are
far
more
vulnerable
to
devastating
violence
than
those
in
the
uk
france
or
us
from
there
were
terrorist
related
deaths
in
all
western
countries
combined
in
iraq
there
were
in
alone
what
can
the
worst
hit
cities
teach
the
rest
about
how
to
respond
unfortunately
not
much
there
is
no
one
size
fits
all
response
to
urban
terrorism
preventing
attacks
by
lone
wolves
or
sleeper
cells
in
america
requires
a
very
different
set
of
tactics
than
countering
sophisticated
networks
of
highly
trained
operatives
in
an
active
war
zone
such
as
yemen
where
terrorists
are
more
like
guerrillas
with
highly
elaborate
operations
and
weaponry
nevertheless
cities
aren
t
passive
for
example
many
are
installing
extra
layers
of
police
surveillance
in
crowded
spaces
and
re
routing
traffic
away
from
critical
infrastructure
others
are
adding
unobtrusive
adaptations
and
reinforcements
to
city
landscapes
to
reduce
blast
exposure
installing
physical
barriers
around
government
offices
and
major
businesses
and
hiring
counter
terrorism
advisers
positive
police
community
relations
are
also
widely
acknowledged
as
an
essential
feature
of
counter
terrorism
strategy
the
goal
of
all
this
is
to
minimise
risk
without
choking
city
life
altogether
as
the
saying
has
it
that
s
when
the
terrorists
win
in
the
meantime
technology
firms
are
lining
up
from
baghdad
to
boston
to
equip
city
authorities
with
the
software
and
skills
to
disrupt
terrorism
today
there
are
more
than
data
fusion
centres
in
major
us
cities
which
share
information
between
federal
state
and
municipal
agencies
it
is
increasingly
routine
to
use
crime
forecasting
programmes
the
los
angeles
police
department
has
itself
used
predictive
policing
algorithms
since
and
is
reportedly
mapping
historical
crime
trends
to
predict
future
incidents
not
without
some
controversy
new
york
too
launched
a
controversial
cyber
intelligence
unit
that
taps
into
conversations
of
potential
jihadi
recruits
and
advanced
electronic
surveillance
systems
are
commonplace
from
city
air
terminals
to
city
streets
civil
liberty
specialists
are
fearful
that
these
measures
confuse
lines
of
authority
undermine
privacy
legislation
and
militarise
law
enforcement
the
real
question
is
how
to
make
a
society
more
resilient
in
a
way
that
does
not
destroy
the
very
way
of
life
in
the
city
says
kilcullen
after
the
paris
killings
french
security
agencies
clamoured
for
more
power
leading
to
a
backlash
from
citizens
who
were
unwilling
to
let
terrorism
restrict
their
freedoms
so
how
does
a
city
judge
how
seriously
to
take
a
threat
why
did
la
shut
down
while
new
york
shrugged
the
short
answer
is
that
judging
a
threat
is
very
difficult
each
threat
needs
to
be
surfaced
and
addressed
in
the
context
of
the
public
safety
officials
existing
programmes
says
gary
margolis
ceo
of
social
sentinel
a
threat
awareness
group
focused
on
schools
alert
services
can
augment
the
existing
safety
and
security
plans
within
schools
municipalities
and
those
responsible
for
protecting
critical
infrastructure
by
alert
services
he
means
a
new
generation
of
social
media
monitoring
systems
the
tracking
of
millions
of
facebook
twitter
and
instagram
feeds
to
detect
would
be
perpetrators
who
telegraph
their
intentions
but
the
fact
is
that
there
are
limitations
to
what
physical
policing
and
technological
enhancements
in
cities
can
achieve
not
every
bit
of
critical
infrastructure
can
be
made
blast
proof
cctv
cameras
may
help
with
investigations
but
likely
won
t
prevent
new
attacks
although
french
railway
authorities
are
planning
to
roll
out
up
to
new
security
cameras
that
can
monitor
excessive
body
temperature
and
signs
of
anxiety
in
the
somewhat
orwellian
hopes
of
identifying
thought
crimes
before
anyone
gets
killed
in
truth
there
are
not
many
examples
of
cities
getting
it
right
in
baghdad
they
ve
essentially
resorted
to
the
urban
tourniquet
of
gated
communities
in
tel
aviv
the
locals
are
simply
getting
used
to
a
heightened
threat

are

the

said
we

technology
should
be

not
a

he
said
i
think
technology
as
a

are
good
for

he
said
adding
that

described
reynoso
as
a
perfect
match
for
our
community
when
i
saw
this
opportunity
i
could
not
pass
up
the
chance
to
be
part
of
the
process
reynoso
said
there
s
something
different
about
this
department
he
said
it
really
is
a
family
atmosphere
el
monte
at
a
time
when
police
agencies
throughout
the
nation
are
under
heightened
scrutiny
el
monte
s
new
police
chief
david
reynoso
says
ethical
policing
and
community
relations
are
the
keys
to
fostering
trust
in
law
enforcement
a
positive
relationship
between
police
officials
and
the
communities
they
serve
is
not
automatic
said
reynoso
who
was
sworn
in
as
el
monte
s
top
cop
last
week
the
public
expects
a
lot
from
us
they
trust
us
and
we
have
to
earn
the
public
s
trust
he
said
and
building
relationships
between
police
and
the
community
will
be
reynoso
s
primary
focus
as
he
leads
the
department
s
officers
he
said
video
chief
reynoso
on
how
he
came
to
be
el
monte
s
new
police
chief
i
want
to
continue
to
build
the
trust
that
s
already
established
in
the
community
reynoso
said
we
need
them
as
our
eyes
and
ears
out
in
the
community
and
the
key
to
fostering
community
relationships
is
essentially
simple
he
said
treat
people
in
a
fair
and
respectful
manner
at
all
times
el
monte
mayor
andre
quintero
agreed
with
reynoso
s
community
policing
based
approach
a
police
department
is
only
as
successful
as
the
relationships
it
has
with
the
community
the
people
need
to
feel
comfortable
that
they
re
there
to
protect
and
serve
everybody
he
said
the
mayor
described
reynoso
s
appointment
as
historic
as
he
is
the
first
chief
selected
from
outside
of
the
department
s
ranks
reynoso
joins
the
department
after
years
as
a
baldwin
park
police
captain
as
high
profile
and
increasingly
commonly
caught
on
camera
police
shootings
and
incidents
bring
a
heightened
public
scrutiny
of
law
enforcement
officials
the
longtime
police
veteran
said
his
approach
to
police
work
hasn
t
changed
i
want
what
all
chiefs
want
and
that
is
for
their
personnel
to
lend
themselves
toward
ethical
constitutional
based
policing
whether
they
are
on
camera
or
not
the
chief
said
we
expect
our
officers
to
conduct
themselves
in
a
professional
manner
regardless
of
being
videotaped
technology
should
be
viewed
as
a
resource
for
police
not
a
challenge
he
said
i
think
technology
as
a
whole
to
include
body
cams
and
dash
cams
are
good
for
police
work
he
said
adding
that
they
preserve
a
record
of
what
took
place
and
the
footage
can
be
a
valuable
training
tool
the
el
monte
police
department
does
not
currently
outfit
its
officers
with
body
cameras
reynoso
said
he
hopes
to
add
six
additional
officers
in
the
near
future
to
bring
the
el
department
to
full
force
what
we
are
looking
for
in
a
police
recruit
is
a
good
smart
ethical
person
because
smart
ethical
people
become
smart
ethical
police
officers
reynoso
said
reynoso
said
he
was
also
excited
about
a
new
piece
of
predictive
policing
technology
just
now
being
implemented
in
el
monte
called
predpol
the
computer
system
analyzes
historic
crime
data
to
help
police
deploy
resources
to
areas
most
likely
to
need
them
video
chief
reynoso
on
predictive
policing
the
system
is
already
being
used
in
el
monte
but
reynoso
said
he
looks
forward
into
full
department
wide
implementation

reynoso
said
there
s
something

about
this

he
said
it
really
is
a
family
atmosphere
new
delhi
it
s
like
precrime
only
four
decades
early
the
predictive
policing
system
seen
in
tom
cruise
starrer
minority
report
is
now
taking
shape
in
delhi
but
instead
of
the
three
slime
immersed
psychic
precogs
that
system
relied
on
delhi
police
s
crime
prediction
will
be
based
on
cold
hard
data
once
enterprise
information
integration
solution
or
ei
s
a
system
that
puts
petabytes
of
information
from
more
than
a
dozen
crime
databases
at
police
staff
s
fingertips
is
ready
delhi
police
will
be
able
to
implement
its
crime
forecast
plan
to
predict
when
and
where
criminals
will
strike
the
technology
is
not
as
fanciful
as
it
seems
at
first
and
is
already
being
tried
out
in
many
important
cities
including
new
york
los
angeles
london
and
berlin
officers
associated
with
the
plan
say
the
software
will
analyze
police
data
for
patterns
compare
it
with
other
data
from
jails
courts
and
other
crime
fighting
agencies
and
alert
police
to
the
likely
threats
data
will
be
available
not
only
on
the
suspects
but
also
their
likely
victims
a
global
tender
has
been
floated
for
the
project
and
delhi
police
is
in
talks
with
various
firms
for
the
technology
a
senior
officer
told
toi
the
system
can
help
pre
empt
many
situations
for
example
a
violent
clash
between
two
gangs
it
can
identify
individuals
who
are
likely
to
join
gangs
or
take
to
crime
in
an
area
based
on
the
analyses
of
their
behaviour
and
network
those
out
on
bail
or
parole
are
most
likely
to
commit
crimes
it
can
also
curb
domestic
violence
by
identifying
a
pattern
and
predicting
the
next
attack
the
officer
said
it
all
boils
down
to
spotting
patterns
in
mountains
of
data
using
tremendous
computing
power
investigators
should
be
able
to
perform
crime
series
identification
crime
trend
identification
hot
spot
analysis
and
general
analysis
of
criminal
profiles
then
there
will
be
a
crime
link
analysis
which
will
spot
common
indicators
of
a
crime
by
establishing
association
groups
of
events
that
regularly
occur
together
a
police
document
about
the
plan
states
using
neighbourhood
analysis
police
will
be
able
to
understand
crime
events
and
the
circumstances
behind
them
in
a
small
area
as
all
the
crime
activity
in
a
neighbourhood
will
be
available
for
analysis
criminal
cases
will
be
classified
into
multiple
categories
to
understand
what
types
of
crime
an
area
is
prone
to
and
the
measures
needed
to
curb
them
classification
will
be
done
through
profiles
of
victims
suspects
localities
and
the
modus
operandi
another
technique
called
proximity
analysis
will
provide
information
about
criminals
victims
witnesses
and
other
people
who
are
or
were
within
a
certain
distance
of
the
crime
scene
by
analyzing
demographic
and
social
trends
investigators
will
be
able
to
understand
the
changes
that
have
taken
place
in
an
area
and
their
impact
on
criminality
network
analysis
will
also
be
a
part
of
this
project
to
identify
the
important
characteristics
and
functions
of
individuals
within
and
outside
a
network
the
network
s
strengths
and
weaknesses
and
its
financial
and
communication
data
while
the
system
could
help
fight
crime
and
rid
delhi
of
its
crime
capital
tag
it
is
bound
to
raise
concerns
over
privacy
and
abuse
as
no
predictive

thursday
february
was
a
unique
day
in
the
history
of
los
angeles
a
day
when
no
recorded
crime
occurred
the
city
s
officers
made
the
claim
with
pride
last
year
thanks
to
a
software
package
they
say
stops
crime
before
it
occurs
now
forces
from
england
are
testing
the
same
system
as
coalition
cuts
continue
to
reduce
frontline
police
numbers
where
the
film
minority
report
had
precrime
specialised
police
departments
the
real
world
now
has
predictive
policing
or
predpol
using
the
most
recent
five
years
data
on
crimes
including
where
and
what
time
they
occurred
predpol
draws
areas
on
a
google
map
each
day
which
allows
forces
to
predict
where
crime
is
more
likely
to
take
place
and
patrol
areas
accordingly
kent
police
became
the
first
force
in
the
uk
to
use
the
a
year
package
and
scotland
yard
is
evaluating
the
results
of
a
week
trial
of
a
very
similar
system
from
accenture
using
the
same
techniques
once
the
information
is
fed
into
the
system
red
boxes
on
computerised
maps
tell
officers
which
areas
they
should
be
concentrating
on
policing
three
years
anti
social
behaviour
data
is
added
to
the
five
years
crime
data
and
all
fed
into
the
software
to
create
an
algorithm
i
ve
come
across
algorithms
before
that
claim
to
help
police
and
they
tended
to
be
not
that
robust
but
this
was
very
different
mark
johnson
the
head
of
analysis
at
kent
police
told
i
it
was
very
simple
in
terms
of
the
variables
looking
at
human
behaviour
and
it
was
good
to
go
because
it
was
so
easy
to
use
sevenoaks
in
kent
where
the
system
is
used
much
more
than
in
any
