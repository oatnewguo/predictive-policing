the

a

the

comes
during
mayor
eric
garcetti
s
first
full
year
in
office
acknowledging
a
significant
increase
in
violent
crimes
beck
attributed
the
rise
to
three
factors
increased
accuracy
of
internal
lapd
reporting
more
domestic
abuse
cases
and
more
street
fights
as
part
of
the
violent

the

reported
a
nearly

in
rapes
in
compared
with
the
year
earlier
there
were
rapes
last

compared
with
a

beck
referenced
an
increase
in
acquaintance
rapes
and
mentioned
young
people
he
provided
no
other
information
on
why
the
city
saw
more
acquaintance
rape
cases
last

a
breakout
of

numbers
by

wasn

available
monday
the
lapd
said
for
the
year
ending
dec
the
san
fernando
valley
saw
violent
crime
rise
percent
and
gang
crime
grow
percent
the
lapd
reported
earlier
this
month
the
valley
increase
mirrors
the
citywide
trend
still
questions
remain
about
whether
the
city
is
truly
more
violent
or
if
the
lapd
is
merely
now
accurately
reporting
violent
crimes
the
spike
in
violent
crime
comes
after
the
los

times
reported
last
summer
the
lapd
inaccurately
misclassified
more
than
violent
crimes
as
less
serious
crimes
since
then
the
lapd
has
changed
its
reporting
approach
beck
has
said
asked
about
the
inaccurate
crime
statistics
garcetti
said
monday
he
would
support
having
an
outside
audit
of
crime
numbers
every
few
years
but
neither
garcetti
nor
beck
blamed
the
rise
in
crime
solely
on
the
lapd
s
inaccurate
reporting
standards
this
year
went
in
the
wrong
direction
garcetti
said
to
combat
the
rise
in
reported
domestic
abuse
cases
garcetti
announced
a
citywide
expansion
of
the

s
domestic

response

an

in

beck
and
garcetti
also
repeatedly
praised
figures
that
they
said
showed
an
overall
slowdown
in
crime
compared
with
some
past
years
aggravated

are
down

also
dropped

dropped

on

defended

that

is
fudging

to
keep

this

bill
bratton
is
the
gold
standard
he
certifies
percent
we
re
using
the
exact

standard
to
track
crime
that
ray
kelly
used
de
blasio
said
on
radio
station
wins
referring
to
his
police
commissioner
it
was
inherited
from
ray
kelly
it
s
the
exact
same
set
of
metrics
and
so
i
m
surprised
to
see
commissioner
kelly
raising
those
questions
but
the
los
angeles
police
department
fudged
violent
crime
stats
including
during
a
period
when
bratton
led
that
department
a
los

times
analysis
released
earlier
this
year
claimed
on
tuesday
kelly
questioned
the
nypd
s
latest
crime
statistics
under
the
current
administration
i
think
there
are
some
issues
with
the
numbers
that
are
being
put
out
kelly
said
in
a
radio
interview
on
am
i
think
there
s
some
redefinition
going
on
as
to
what
amounts
to
a
shooting
that
sort
of
thing
feb
a
new
advertising
campaign
was
launched
in
burbank
this
week
to
bring
awareness
to
a
state
program
that
helps
victims
of
violent
crimes
the
ads
which
are
appearing
on
burbank
bus
vehicles
feature
stark
sometimes
bloody
depictions
of
victims
women
children
and
the
elderly
we
took
a
darker
look

a

the

is
to
reach

to
the

of

such
as
sexual

child

human

elder

in

the

is
currently
providing
about
million
in
benefits
to
about
applicants
but
that
s
only
about
of
the
victims
of
violent

here
myers
said
that
s
a
large
gap
that
the
agency
is
seeking
to
close
application
rates
in
orange
county
are
around
of
violent
crime
victims
and
some
of
the
more
sparsely
populated
regions
of
the
state
have
rates
of
more
than
he
added
the
campaign
comes
after
a
similar
effort
in
the
san

bay
area
last
fall
that
led
to
a
rise
in
victim
compensation
applications
officials
with
the

announced
in
a
statement
last

one
ad
features
an
image
of
an
elderly
woman
lying
on
the
ground
as
a
hand
inside
a
latex
glove
checks
her
pulse
her
own
hand
is
bruised
and
bloody
another
ad
features
an
image
of
a
woman
with
tears
welling
up
in
her
eyes
and
one
of
them
has
a
purple
and
blue
bruise
she
has
her
fingers
pressed
together
over
her
lips
as
if
in
prayer
elder
abuse
rates
are
rising
myers
said
but
overall
victims

and

make
up
the
largest

a
third
of
applicants
for

in
the

christine
ramos
director
of
family
violence
services
and
transitional
housing
at
the
family
service
agency
of
burbank
said
some
people
think
it
doesn
t
happen
in
burbank
but
it
absolutely
does
victims
who
choose
to
escape
from
a
domestic
violence
situation
typically
lose
of
their
income
ramos
said
any
assistance
they
can
have
is
obviously
of
great
benefit
said
ramos
adding
that
financial
impacts
include
a
myriad
of
different
things
such
as
loss
of
jobs
the
need
to
pay
for
child
care
and
the
expenses
of
relocation
financial
insecurity
can
be
a
reason
some
victims
stay
in
abusive
situations
or
the
reason
they
return
to
such
situations
she
said
but
ramos
said
that
some
victims
of
domestic
abuse
may
not
identify
with
images
of
bruised
and
battered
victims
abuse
can
take
many
forms
and
pictures
of
physical
injuries
may
give
a
false
impression
about
the
complete
picture
of
domestic
violence
if
you
don
t
fit
that
category
of
abuse
you
wouldn
t
necessarily
recognize
yourself
as
a
victim
ramos
said
burbank
city
councilwoman
emily
gabel
luddy
who
has
been

with
the

said
victims
come
from

income
brackets
straight
gay
and
all
races
but
she
said
there
s
no

for

the

authored

said
because
the

reduction
does
not

rather
residents
must
file
a

with

the

it

itzcalli
said
garcetti
avoided
any
mention
of
the
contract
negotiations
in
his
speech
he
instead
focused
on
the
accomplishments
of
the
last
year
repeatedly
mentioning
the
phrase
back
to
basics
that
helped
him
win

in
he
pointed
to
the
passage
of

also
called
on

is
important
to
the
city
particularly
businesses
if

don

feel
safe
they
re
not
going
to

and
businesses
are
going
to
move
away
waldman
said
homicides
in
los

county
last
year
were
at
their
lowest
level
since
and
overall
violent
crime
was
down
nearly
percent
from
according
to
los

county
sheriff
s
data
unveiled
at
the

s
headquarters
on
wednesday
the
numbers
also
showed
a
five
year
decline
in
violent

dropping
by
percent
between
and
the
news
overall
is
very
good
sheriff
jim
mcdonnell
said
we
have
an
ongoing
positive
trend
and
i
attribute
a
lot
of
the
successes
we
ve
had
to
our
partnership
with
the
community
to
using
technology
as
wisely
as
we
can
but
we
re
not
looking
here
really
just
at
numbers
this
is
an
indicator
of
the
work
being
done
out
there
every
day
video
sheriff
says
department
is
focused
on
improving
quality
of
life
the
sheriff
s
department
with
employees
and
covering
square
miles
has
seen
its
image
battered
in
recent
years
by
corruption
trials
and
federal
probes
into
deputy
misconduct
in
the
nation
s
largest
jail
system
longtime
sheriff
lee
baca
resigned
a
year
ago
as
the
department
s
image
frayed
amid
the
corruption
and
the
pay
to
play
system
that
had
defined
the
department
s
culture
mcdonnell
ran
on
a
campaign
to
restore
the
shine
to
the
badge
and
wednesday
s
numbers
gave
the
new
sheriff
a
chance
to
relay
some
good
news
in
there
were
homicides
compared
with
in
by
comparison
the
high
water
mark
for
homicides
in
los
angeles
county
dating
back
to
was
in
but
he
acknowledged
most
homicides
are
rooted
in
gangs
last
year
percent
of
the
homicides
in
the
county
were
gang
related
he
said
the
department
will
continue
to
push
youth
based
activities
to
keep
kids
off
the
streets
the
gangs
drive
our
violent
crime
rates
and
particularly
the
homicide
rate
he
said
we
know
most
of
our
gangs
are
young
kids
that
grew
up
in
an
environment
that
was
often
dysfunctional
the
opportunities
that
are
there
for
kids
in
some
of
our
neighborhoods
weren
t
there
for
them
and
they
went
down
the
wrong
track
mcdonnell
also
said
the
enactment
of
ab
which
shifted
some
of
the
prison
load
from
the
state
to
local
counties
last
october
didn
t
result
in
a
spike
in
crime
as
some
had
predicted
the
drop
in
crime
largely
across
the
board
also
carried
over
into
property
crimes
with
the
rate
dropping
by
percent
between
and
last
year
capt
roosevelt
johnson
in
the
santa
clarita
valley
station
said
his
area
is
focusing
on
continuing
to
reduce
property
crime
by
starting
a
new
program
with
big
box
retailers
to
meet
quarterly
and
share
information
about
thefts
crimes
committed
at
their
locations
and
strategies
to
curb
that
crime
he
said
about
stores
met
at
the
first
session
and
the
next
one
will
be
in
late
february
or
early
march
johnson
said
he
hopes
this
new
approach
will
help
reduce
crime
by
percent
each
year
there
is
a
lot
we
can
learn
from
each
other
and
this
is
a
good
way
to
get
that
information
out
there
johnson
said
the
sheriff
s
numbers
were
in
stark
contrast
to
crime
statistics
released
monday
by
the
los
angeles
police
department
where
violent
crime
shot
up
percent
after
an
year
run
of
dropping
crime
statistics
lapd
chief
charlie
beck
attributed
that
spike
to
an
increase
in
domestic
abuse
and
street
fighting
cases
los
angeles
citing
an
alarming
rise
in
shootings
by
police
over
the
last
year
the
civilian
board
that
oversees
the
los
angeles
police
called
on
tuesday
for
an
extensive
review
of
the
department
s
policies
on
the
use
of
force
the
new
president
of
the
los
angeles
police
commission
matt
johnson
said
reducing
officers
use
of
force
was
one
of
his
top
priorities
for
the
department
on
par
with
bringing
down
the
overall
crime
rate
the
number
of
shootings
by
the
police
so
far
this
year
has
nearly
doubled
to
from
during
the
same
period
last
year
mr
johnson
said
he
added
that
like
other
departments
the
los
angeles
police
were
facing
a
crisis
of
confidence
with
minority
communities
particularly
african
americans
in
the
wake
of
police
shootings
of
black
civilians
across
the
country
we
must
fully
commit
to
minimizing
the
number
of
use
of
force
incidents
mr
johnson
said
in
addition
to
review
of
use

possible

the
los

police
spent
more
than
a
decade
under
a
federal
consent
decree
after
dozens
of
officers
were
accused
of
corruption
and
evidence
tampering
from
until
the
federal
government
imposed
reforms
on
the
police
here
which
helped
the
department
move
past
a
history
that
had
often
been
checkered
with
officer
abuse

it
has
come
to
be
regarded
by

as
a

mr
johnson
s
comments
on
tuesday
acknowledged
problems
that
police
had
faced
recently
after
years
of
falling
crime
rates
and
praise
from
the
law
enforcement
community
homicides
violent
crime
and
property
crime
have
all
increased
by
at
least
percent
so
far
in
compared
with
last
year
august
was
the
deadliest
month
since
with
homicides
mr
johnson
said
it
s
concerning
to
me
steve
soboroff
another
member
of
the
police
commission
said
of
the
rising
crime
numbers
the
job
of
being
a
police
officer
is
changing
dramatically
with
all
these
modifications
in
training
dealing
with
the
mentally
ill
use
of
force
but
he
said
to
factors
were
contributing
to
the
rising
crime
rate
such
as
changing
state
laws
that
have
let
many
minor
drug
offenders
stay
out
of
prison
i
don
t
attribute
it
to
something
wrong
with
the
police
department
he
said
the
los
angeles
police
chief
charlie
beck
and
the
department
did
not
comment
on
the
commission
s
action
tuesday
police
departments
across
the
country
are
facing
increased
scrutiny
of
their
use
of
force
just
tuesday
southern
california
public
radio
a
local
radio
station
published
an
investigation
detailing
nearly
police
shootings
in
los
angeles
in
recent
years
none
of
which
have
been
prosecuted
as
homicides
if
there
s
one
major
department
that
has
transformed
itself
in
the
last
years
it
s
the
los
angeles
police
department
said
chuck
wexler
the
executive
director
of
the
police
executive
research
forum
but
every
police
department
in
the
country
is
under
increased
scrutiny
because
of
what
we
ve
seen
in
the
last
year
they
have
to
continue
to
make
progress
and
look
for
ways
to
de
escalate
to
maintain
their
leadership
position
connie
rice
a
civil
rights
lawyer
who
has
worked
to
help
carry
out
reforms
at
the
los
angeles
police
department
over
the
last
decade
said
it
was
encouraging
that
police
officials
were
looking
at
the
complication
question
of
how
to
deal
with
use
of
force
right
now
police
have
a
down
to
the
bone
belief
that
they
have
to
watch
suspects
hands
and
if
the
hands
move
they
can
shoot
ms
rice
said
we
are
going
to
have
to
work
this
through
with
them
and
show
them
why
that
isn
t
so
in
an
interview
after
his
remarks
on
tuesday
mr
johnson
said
he
took
his
position
on
the
police
commission
as
a
direct
response
to
the
national
conversation
that
s
going
on
regarding
police
use
of
force
part
one
is
greater
transparency
he
said
that
will
include
not
only
greater
analysis
of
use
of
force
data
but
also
body
cameras
which
will
soon
be
standard
for
all
los
angeles
police
officers
but
this
is
a
first
step
not
an
end
in
itself
mr
johnson
said
this
will
hopefully
give
us
the
tools
needed
to
continue
significant
reform

while
his

prosecutors
describe
matsri
also

as
a

figure
in

they

large

he
ll
appeal
the
lengthy

years
already

following
his

matsri
would
be
nearly

old
by

assistant

very
well
may
be
a
good
family
man
but
he
was
also
a
major
player
in
the

trafficking
world
the

should
reflect
just
how
serious

moshe
matsri
was
to

bacon

the
man

los

a
recent
change
in
california
law
making
certain
drug
and
property
crimes
misdemeanors
instead
of
felonies
played
a
significant
role
in
the
rising
crime
rate
in
los
angeles
county
and
has
taken
away
the
incentive
for
addicts
to
seek
treatment
sheriff
jim
mcdonnell
said
thursday
in
an
interview
with
the
associated
press
mcdonnell
also
said
legalizing
marijuana
for
recreational
use
is
a
bad
idea
and
that
recent
public
backlash
against
police
over
use
of
force
is
having
an
impact
on
his
agency
the
largest
sheriff
s
department
in
the
country
proposition
many
in
law
enforcement
have
criticized
proposition
which
voters
passed
last
november
to
ease
overcrowding
in
the
prison
system
it
reduced
the
penalties
for
shoplifting
forgery
fraud
petty
theft
and
possession
of
small
amounts
of
drugs
including
cocaine
heroin
and
methamphetamines
so
far
this
year
the
los
angeles
county
sheriff
s
department
reports
a
percent
increase
in
violent
crime
and
a
percent
increase
in
property
crime
we
had
years
of
crime
reductions
we
were
at
year
lows
in
many
areas
on
crime
statistics
and
all
of
a
sudden
right
after
november
when
kicked
in
that
changed
and
fairly
dramatically
very
quickly
he
said
it
would
be
naive
to
say
that
didn
t
play
a
major
role
in
that
treatment
impacted
mcdonnell
said
the
law
prevents
authorities
from
leveraging
the
threat
of
a
felony
charge
to
get
addicts
into
treatment
as
a
result
county
treatment
rolls
are
down
percent
people
are
no
longer
incarcerated
they
re
not
in
treatment
they
re
out
reoffending
on
the
street
mcdonnell
said
proposition
came
after
california
s
prison
realignment
law
which
pushed
many
criminals
into
county
jails
to
decrease
state
prison
populations
jails
previously
housing
only
people
awaiting
trial
or
those
sentenced
to
less
than
a
year
now
also
hold
more
hardened
criminals
serving
longer
terms
mcdonnell
said
one
county
inmate
has
a
year
sentence
that
s
not
something
we
re
equipped
to
deal
with
effectively
mcdonnell
said
the
state
prison
system
has
been
sued
and
had
consent
decrees
over
it
and
it
s
predictable
that
as
a
result
we
re
going
to
have
the
same
kind
of
lawsuits
and
the
same
kind
of
damages
sheriff
what
savings
one
of
the
goals
of
proposition
was
to
use
savings
from
reduced
jail
populations
to
fund
drug
treatment
programs
as
an
alternative
to
incarceration
but
there
s
been
no
savings
in
los
angeles
county
the
jails
are
filled
with
about
inmates
before
proposition
the
jails
were
overcrowded
and
inmates
served
just
to
percent
of
their
sentences
now
they
re
serving
percent
of
the
sentences
mcdonnell
said
but
there
s
no
money
for
the
treatment
services
other
issues
mcdonnell
touched
on
a
number
of
other
law
enforcement
issues
o
body
cameras
are
being
tested
by
the
department
and
he
hopes
to
provide
them
to
deputies
on
patrol
and
in
jails
mcdonnell
said
deputies
shouldn
t
be
able
to
review
the
camera
footage
before
making
an
initial
statement
in
any
use
of
force
incident
after
the
initial
statement
he
said
deputies
could
then
review
the
video
and
make
a
supplemental
statement
o
marijuana
legalization
is
bad
for
society
he
said
pot
is
far
more
potent
today
and
so
the
gentle
buzz
people
expect
is
far
more
intense
and
sometimes
produces
hallucinations
there
are
many
unresolved
questions
about
how
law
enforcement
will
test
for
levels
of
intoxication
o
media
coverage
of
violent
police
encounters
is
having
an
impact
on
law
enforcement
deputies
are
worried
that
any
use
of
force
could
be
misconstrued
when
captured
on
video
mcdonnell
said
less
than
percent
of
the
millions
of
daily
police
contacts
with
the
public
result
in
uses
of
force
but
those
are
what
people
focus
on

journalist
at

her
attempt

write

of

nearly

committed
in

that

embedding
herself

considerable

the

of

the
murder
took
place
in

leovy
notes
was
more
of
a
public
event
than
a
secret
one
and
that
everyone
but
the
police
knew
who
was
responsible
bryant
was
killed

he
was
in

of

else
who
didn

really
have
a
motive
it
was
as
stupid
and
unnecessary
as
that
leovy
argues
that
it
is
the
absence
of
law
enforcement
a
condition
that
only
the
police
can
address
that
leads
to
violent
crime
lawlessness
she
writes
is
its
own
kind
of
order
seen
in
this
light
murder
by
acquaintance
is
the
result
of
a
long
history
of

that
amounts
in

to

money
the
proposal
authored
by

and
mark

was
unanimously
approved
solis
said
because
the
conviction
reduction
does
not
automatically
apply
but
rather
residents
must
file
a
petition
with
the
court
the
county
needs
to
put
a
system
in
place
to
reach
out
to
residents
it
is
our
job
to
make
it
work

mendoza

you

he
the

the

it

never
typically

she

that

trouble
at

several

three

kept
to
themselves
one

a
percent
reduction
in

in

has
reduced
it
to
levels
unseen
since
ronald
reagan
was
president
during
the
s
the
numbers
reported
by
the
los

county
sheriff

for
showed
a
reduction
to
from
in
not
only
was
crime
reduced
significantly
in
la
mirada
but
we
re
at
the
lowest
level
since
said
mayor
larry
mowles
that
s
an
incredible
statistic
it
s
to
the
compliment
of
the
los
angeles
county
sheriff
s
department
and
continuing
efforts
by
our
citizens
the
largest
reductions
came
in
the
areas
of
property
type
crimes
including
burglaries
larceny
theft
and
grand
theft
auto
lt
kevin
beggs
of
the
la
mirada
sheriff
s
station
said
there
were
numerous
reasons
why
crime
decreased
in
we
redirected
our
special
assignment
teams
beggs
said
at
the
beginning
of
the
year
we
focused
on
illegal
narcotics
users
these
are
the
people
who
are
committing
property
crimes
it
worked
for
us
in
addition
the
public
was
notified
in
areas
where
there
were
problems
such
as
burglaries
beggs
said
social
media
websites
also
were
used
he
added
still
not
all
categories
of
crimes
decreased
in
in
particular
violent
type
crimes
such
as
assaults
and
robberies
increased
assaults
increased
by
percent
or
from
in
to
in
beggs
blamed
the
increase
in
assaults
on
gang
problems
we
do
have
a
gang
issue
on
the
west
side
he
said
cutting
down
the
assaults
unlike
property
type
crimes
is
more
difficult
with
burglaries
and
thefts
you
can
have
a
plan
of
action
but
it
s
more
difficult
to
plan
when
assaults
will
happen
he
said
in
addition
some
of
assaults
are
domestic
violence
which
are
hard
to
predict
and
prevent
he
said
robberies
also
increased
by
about
percent
or
from
to
however
those
numbers
went
up
in
part
because
they
are
counted
by
the
number
of
victims
if
you
have
three
victims
that
will
be
counted
as
three
different
robberies
he
said
in
of
the
cases
we
had
multiple
victims
mowles
said
he
is
concerned
about
the
increase
in
assaults
and
robberies
but
added
the
numbers
still
remain
low
i
m
hoping
this
is
an
aberration
a
blip
on
the
radar
he
said
the
sheriff
s
department
is
on
this
they
re
really
over
this
stuff
abstract
as
murders
shootings
rise
in
los

this

beck
said
referring
to

in
one
weekend
of
which
were

the
increases
come
as

attracted
trendy

that

in
response
to
the
rising

the

has
deployed
hundreds
of
elite
officers
to
crime
hot
spots
increased
the
number
of
officers
walking
the
streets
versus
patrolling
in
cars
and
created
a
community
relationship
division
dedicated
to
building
the
public
s
trust
in
police
officers
but
beck
said
his
department
can
t
solve
the
problem
alone
a

of
it
is

he
said
a
will
of
everyone
in

to
say
enough

these

to
train

how
to
counsel
family
and

of
people
who

the
idea
for

to
provide

wherever
possible

common
among

los
angeles
is
x
feff
one
of
a
number
of
major
cities
across
the
u
s
seeing
rises
in
violent
crime
this
year
including
baltimore
washington
d
c
chicago
cleveland
and
houston
other
california
cities
also
have
seen
increases
including
sacramento
oakland
and
long
beach
though
the
numbers
are
up
those
cities
are
far
safer
than
they
were
in
the
early
s
during
the
crack
cocaine
epidemic
in
los
angeles
for
example
murders
peaked
in
with
people
killed
so
far
this
year
there
have
been
homicides
compared
to
during
the
same
time
period
last
year
still
the
lapd
is
taking
this
year
s
uptick
seriously
we
re
not
panicking
said
capt
jeff
bert
commanding
officer
of
the
department
s
strategic
planning
group
but
we
are
in
the
business
of
driving
down
crime
so
when
a
crime
spike
goes
up
we
re
all
over
it
it
is
a
concern
it
s
still
too
early
to
pinpoint
what
s
driving
the
increased
violence
across
the
country
and
in
los
angeles
said
charis
kubrin
a
criminologist
at
the
university
of
california
at
irvine
who
analyzes
crime
in
southern
california
she
said
there
could
be
a
number
of
contributing
factors
including
easier
access
to
guns
the
poverty
rate
a
new
state
law
that
reduced
penalties
for
certain
crimes
and
a
growing
distrust
of
police
which
can
contribute
to
retaliatory
violence
if
you
don
t
see
the
police
as
a
viable
option
when
you
have
a
problem
then
you
handle
things
on
your
own

mayor
eric
garcetti
took
aim
at
earthquakes
drought
and
increased
police
protection
in
his
annual
state
of
the
city
speech
garcetti
continued
to
push
his
so
called
back
to
basics
program
in
the
speech
which
is
usually
the
precursor
to
the
mayor
delivering
a
budget
to
the
city
council
in
addition
to
highlighting
efforts
to
prepare
for
the
big
earthquake
for
which
he
said
the
city
is
overdue
and
the
city
s
efforts
to
deal
with
the
state
s
four
year
drought
he
also
noted
a
push
to
get
federal
funding
to
support
build
out
of
the
city
s
light
rail
system
i
ve
been
aggressive
travelling
frequently
to
washington
to
bring
home
our
fair
share
of
federal
funds
for
transit
the
result
so
far
nearly
billion
and
counting
garcetti
said
in
tuesday
s
speech
this
funding
is
accelerating
subway
construction
under
wilshire
boulevard
as
a
result
we
ll
be
able
to
ride
underground
from
downtown
to
century
city
a
year
earlier
garcetti
also
cited
construction
underway
on
the
new
crenshaw
lax
line
the
downtown
rail
connector
the
gold
line
extension
and
the
expo
line
extension
which
will
connect
the
east
side
to
the
ocean
the
city
finally
got
the
los

county
metropolitan
transportation
authority
and
los

international
airport
to
agree
on
a
plan
earlier
this
year
to
connect
the
airport
to
the
growing
light
rail
network
when
i
took
that
oath
i
told
you
that
i
would
get
us
back
to
the
basics
garcetti
said
i
said
that
it
was
time
for
city
hall
to
improve
core
city
services
to
rebuild
our
city
s
infrastructure
and
to
help
businesses
create
more
middle
class
jobs
and
today
we
are
leaving
the
recession
in
the
rearview
mirror
and
building
a
los
angeles
that
works
among
the
city
s
achievements
according
to
garcetti
are
new
jobs
the
fastest
employment
creation
pace
in
more
than
a
decade
balanced
budgets
an
improved
credit
rating
lowered
business
taxes
and
that
more
people
are
choosing
to
live
work
visit
and
study
in
l
a
than
ever
before
today
i
am
proud
to
report
to
you
that
our
back
to
basics
agenda
is
delivering
results
he
said
los
angeles
and
your
city
hall
are
roaring
back
and
the
state
of
our
city
is
strong
the
city
also
has
reduced
overall
crime
at
the
end
of
last
year
to
its
lowest
level
per
capita
since
though
the
city
s
violent
crime
numbers
were
up
he
rolled
out
a
plan
to
tackle
crime
that
included
nearly
doubling
the
ranks
of
lapd
s
elite
metropolitan
division
so
we
can
quickly
saturate
a
neighborhood
with
additional
officers
when
crime
spikes
his
budget
which
will
go
to
the
city
council
next
week
will
include
million
more
dollars
for
the
city
s
gang
reduction
and
youth
development
program
he
said
in
the
aftermath
of
ferguson
staten
island
and
now

based
policing
has
put
us
on
track
to
be

garcetti
said
referring
to
a
series
of
incidents
around
the
country
in
which
police
killed
unarmed
black
men
today
i

announcing
the
