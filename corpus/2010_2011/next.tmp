change

we
find

depends
on
how
much
and
how
quickly
we
expect
them
to
change
in
his
insightful
essay
nearly
two
decades
ago
albert
reiss
tracked
the
major
features
of
american
police
organization
continuity
and
change
in
the
twentieth
century
indicating
that
some
aspects
of
policing
had
changed
little
whereas
others
had
changed
considerably
he
noted
that
the
public
police
industry
in
america
had
resisted
pressures
to
consolidate
remaining
a
highly
decentralized
system
embedded
in
the
many
thousands
of
local
governments
across
the
nation
however
he
noted
that
how
police
organizations
are
commanded
how
their
patrol
officers
are
mobilized
how
patrol
work
is
carried
out
and
how
information
is
accessed
and
used
changed
considerably
during
the
twentieth
century
american
police
departments
became
more
bureaucratized
but
this
process
was
far
from
total
still
leaving
considerable
discretion
to
the
rank
and
file
and
only
partially
effective
accountability
systems
still
vulnerable
to
corruption
he
observed
that
as
a
result
of
changes
in
demography
political
governance
and
technology
the
twentieth
century
witnessed
the
transformation
of
the
police
from
the
minions
of
local
political
patrons
to
greater
independence
as
they
became
attached
to
legalistic
and
technocratic
sources
of
power
and
legitimacy
he
noted
the
as
yet
unresolved
tension
between
the
structures
and
cultures
of
bureaucracy
versus
those
of
nascent
professionalism
some
of
which
were
playing
out
in
the
emergence
of
community
and
problem
oriented
policing
these
reforms
were
designed
to
counter
some
of
the
pathologies
of
the
growing
strength
of
a
bureaucratic
system
of
internal
organization
that
by
the
restive
s
was
experiencing
a
crisis
in
legitimacy
in
urban
america
due
in
part
to
its
perceived
isolation
from
and
unresponsiveness
to
neighborhood
and
community
concerns
a
decade
into
the
twenty
first
century
is
an
appropriate
time
to
reflect
on
what
has
become
of
american
police
organizations
their
structure
technologies
and
culture
and
the
forces
that
shape
them
although
this
essay
focuses
on
america
s
local
police
organizations
we
take
occasion
to
compare
america
to
other
nations
to
more
fully
appreciate
the
implications
of
the
american
context
for
the
patterns
observed
throughout
the
essay
we
note
opportunities
for
future
research
our
arguments
and
conclusions
are
briefly
summarized
below
american
policing
demonstrates
both
continuity
and
change
as
it
completes
the
first
decade
of
the
twenty
first
century
a
high
degree
of
industry
decentralization
persists
despite
periodic
calls
to
consolidate
service
delivery
a
growing
private
security
sector
adds
to
the
multiplicity
of
service
providers
although
there
are
ways
in
which
the
nation
s
system
is
less
fragmented
than
a
mere
count
of
policing
providers
indicates
the
endurance
of
this
system
may
be
attributable
to
both
its
technical
performance
and
the
ease
with
which
a
more
fragmented
system
provides
responsiveness
to
local
preferences
bureaucratic
structures
of
larger
police
agencies
also
persist
despite
recent
reform
movements
launched
to
de
bureaucratize
them
the
impact
of
structural
variation
on
organizational
innovation
and
success
is
not
well
established
empirically
and
the
structures
and
practices
of
the
nation
s
numerous
small
agencies
remain
underexamined
the
potential
strengthening
of
professional
structures
inside
and
outside
the
police
organization
is
largely
unexplored
the
core
police
patrol
technology
has
remained
essentially
unchanged
for
decades
and
early
police
adaptations
to
the
information
technology
revolution
have
not
yet
profoundly
altered
policing
structures
and
processes
in
easily
observable
ways
yet
the
increasing
centrality
of
police
as
information
workers
bears
close
watching
new
information
technologies
have
the
potential
to
transform
how
police
relate
to
their
task
environment
and
how
they
regulate
themselves
internally
while
much
past
research
indicates
that
technological
innovations
frequently
fail
to
produce
the
expected
benefits
a
long
term
approach
may
be
required
to
perceive
the
impact
on
structures
and
practices
the
demography
and
education
levels
of
police
workers
are
changing
with
racial
minorities
and
females
constituting
increasing
proportions
of
the
nation
s
sworn
force
however
the
consequences
are
not
yet
obvious
and
will
require
a
careful
assessment
of
the
processes
by
which
changes
in
culture
and
practice
are
expected
to
occur
police
culture
is
a
term
used
to
distinguish
policing
as
an
occupation
to
distinguish
police
organizations
and
to
distinguish
individual
police
officers
the
extent
to
which
these
constructs
actually
account
for
police
practices
is
not
well
established
empirically
nonetheless
police
culture
has
been
under
siege
since
the
s
currently
popular
reforms
attempt
to
reduce
the
occupation
s
isolation
from
the
communities
police
serve
and
the
scientific
community
that
presumably
serves
them
but
it
is
not
at
all
clear
how
successful
these
reforms
will
be
mechanisms
and
styles
for
governing
police
retain
considerable
variation
but
the
research
literature
on
how
governance
is
accomplished
is
thin
relying
mostly
on
national
surveys
of
agencies
with
data
of
limited
theoretical
utility
or
in
depth
case
studies
the
growing
role
of
grassroots
community
groups
and
police
professional
associations
remains
underexplored
the
complexity
of
the
dynamics
of
change
manifests
itself
in
the
reaction
of
american
police
organizations
to
the
two
most
consequential
reform
movements
of
the
twenty
first
century
thus
far
community
policing
and
terrorist
oriented
policing
american
police
agencies
have
shown
a
remarkable
capacity
to
absorb
these
reforms
while
buffering
core
structures
and
practices
from
change
however
profound
changes
may
take
more
time
than
a
couple
of
decades
so
observers
should
take
care
to
attend
to
incremental
change
over
longer
time
periods

conclusion
i
the
structure
of
america
s
policing
industry
to
understand
police
organizations
there
is
value
in
first
considering
how
they
are
structured
as
a
public
service
industry

ostrom
and
ostrom
in
that
respect
american
policing
is
local
policing
manning
p
among
police
scholars
america
is
regarded
as
the
most
fragmented
and
complex
system
for
delivering
public
policing
services
in
the
industrialized
world
bayley
klinger
skogan
and
frydl
p
a
national
research
council
panel
of
american
policing
scholars
suggested
that
at
the
end
of
the
twentieth
century
there
were
approximately
federal
state
and
local
police
agencies
of
which
the
bureau
of
justice
statistics
estimated
were
attached
to
local
governments
a
few
years
later
a
census
showed
local
police
agencies
sheriff
s
departments
and
special
jurisdiction
agencies
bureau
of
justice
statistics
p
no
other
nation
matches
the
united
states
in
the
number
of
agencies
embedded
in
different
levels
of
government
and
the
complexity
of
interagency
arrangements
such
as
mutual
aid
agreements
and
interjurisdictional
task
forces
bayley
mawby
skogan
and
frydl
p
this
degree
of
fragmentation
or
multiplicity
may
be
the
most
distinguishing
feature
of
america
s
policing
system
and
also
the
most
consequential
a
character
of
industry
fragmentation
several
things
are
worth
noting
about
american
policing
fragmentation
first
it
appears
to
be
associated
with
a
fondness
for
decentralized
democratic
governance
geller
and
morris
p
some
attribute
this
to
the
absence
of
sustained
violent
threats
to
a
national
government
which
in
the
presence
of
such
threats
would
find
a
need
to
form
and
retain
a
national
police
service
bayley
p
it
is
unclear
whether
the
democratic
predilections
of
americans
fostered
a
fragmented
structure
of
policing
or
whether
the
latter
made
the
former
possible
regardless
of
the
direction
of
causality
this
association
is
not
unique
to
the
united
states
but
is
noted
in
other
english
speaking
democracies
second
the
degree
of
fragmentation
may
be
declining
albeit
at
a
glacial
pace
reliable
national
counts
of
local
police
agencies
over
long
time
periods
are
not
available
maguire
et
al
but
a
detailed
study
of
ohio
departments
from
the
s
through
the
s
shows
a
net
loss
of
agencies
an
percent
reduction
maguire
and
king
p
the
research
also
found
a
net
increase
in
the
number
of
agencies
in
arizona
and
nevada
two
states
with
the
highest
population
growth
in
the
s
there
is
uncertainty
about
this
trend
at
the
national
level
but
if
defragmentation
were
to
continue
at
the
above
rate
for
the
first
half
of
the
twenty
first
century
the
number
of
ohio
agencies
would
decline
from
to
which
would
still
leave
many
more
police
agencies
than
most
nations
currently
have
the
safe
bet
is
that
the
high
level
of
police
industry
organizational
multiplicity
in
the
united
states
will
be
sustained
far
into
the
future
barring
violent
threats
to
the
stability
of
the
national
government
bayley
pp
but
counts
of
police
agencies
do
not
show
the
complete
picture
about
the
nature
and
extent
of
industry
fragmentation
klinger
p
the
census
of
state
and
local
law
enforcement
agencies
showed
that
the
largest
percent
of
state
and
local
agencies
or
more
full
time
sworn
officers
accounted
for
percent
of
all
sworn
personnel
whereas
the
percent
of
the
nation
s
departments
with
fewer
than
officers
accounted
for
only
percent
of
the
nation
s
state
and
local
sworn
force
reaves
p
although
these
statistics
reflect
a
still
impressive
level
of
multiplicity
within
the
police
industry
it
shows
that
most
americans
receive
service
from
fewer
and
larger
police
agencies
that
is
america
s
policing
industry
is
more
concentrated
than
a
mere
tally
of
agencies
suggests
further
the
high
degree
of
police
service
fragmentation
in
america
is
concentrated
in
patrol
services
the
provision
of
many
specialized
services
including
criminal
investigations
detention
communications
training
and
crime
labs
is
more
centralized
often
provided
under
contract
or
by
law
to
smaller
departments
by
nearby
larger
municipal
county
or
state
agencies
or
regional
facilities
ostrom
whitaker
and
parks
fyfe
parks
even
basic
patrol
services
in
small
departments
may
involve
special
arrangements
with
other
agencies
to
provide
service
in
certain
areas
or
at
certain
times
of
the
day
in
addition
mutual
support
and
backup
agreements
often
exist
between
proximate
police
agencies
parks
observers
often
suggest
that
the
american
system
is
rife
with
overlapping
jurisdictions
and
sporadic
coordination
of
agencies
president
s
commission
p
reiss
p
manning
p
but
there
is
some
evidence
that
the
overlap
though
real
is
managed
does
not
merely
rely
on
evanescent
personal
relationships
and
rarely
produces
confusion
inefficient
duplication
and
conflict
in
the
actual
delivery
of
local
service
mcdavid

parks
the
reason
is
that
for
the
most
part
the
web
of
arrangements
is
cooperative
and
institutionalized
and
there
is
not
systematic
evidence
showing
that
the
degree
of
integration
of
units
within
police
agencies
especially
large
ones
is
any
greater
than
the
degree
of
integration
between
them
especially
small
ones
it
may
be
easier
for
andy
of
mayberry
to
coordinate
police
operations
with
the
neighboring
counties
than
it
is
for
the
commissioner
of
the
new
york
police
department
to
coordinate
the
various
components
of
his
massive
organization
b
police
consolidation
movement
the
desire
to
consolidate
small
american
police
agencies
first
surfaced
as
good
government
reform
in
the
s
and
then
again
as
part
of
a
movement
in
the
late
s
and
s
with
the
support
of
a
number
of
national
commissions
and
police
leaders
altshuler
p
douthit

and
plate
walker
pp
parks
it
never
gathered
much
steam
and
has
remained
mostly
low
visibility
except
for
the
rare
occasion
when
large
agencies
are
joined
such
as
the
merger
of
new
york
city
s
housing
school
and
transit
police
with
the
municipal
force
in
the
s
maguire
and
king
p
the
principal
objective
of
the
consolidation
advocates
has
been
to
merge
the
nation
s
many
small
agencies
into
much
larger
entities
the
typical
arguments
for
consolidation
of
these
small
agencies
are
as
follows
new
police
technologies
cost
more
than
most
small
departments
can
afford
large
departments
make
cost
efficient
the
hiring
of
specialist
experts
that
small
departments
cannot
afford
small
communities
cannot
afford
to
deal
with
the
increasing
litigation
or
threat
of
litigation
against
the
police
larger
departments
can
afford
to
hire
better
qualified
personnel
and
give
them
more
training
larger
departments
can
provide
more
and
better
service
by
achieving
economies
of
scale
and
larger
agencies
are
better
equipped
to
adapt
to
the
changing
nature
of
crime
e
g
cybercrime
tully
the
ability
of
so
many
lilliputs
of
policing
ostrom
and
smith
to
withstand
these
criticisms
comes
from
several
sources
first
there
are
the
explanations
that
derive
from
technical
performance
the
rational
evidence
so
to
speak
small
agencies
have
dealt
with
many
of
the
challenges
of
cost
efficiency
and
economies
of
scale
by
seeking
consolidated
assistance
for
the
specialist
functions
expected
of
contemporary
police
while
continuing
to
deliver
more
basic
patrol
service
widely
regarded
as
the
backbone
of
police
work
this
patrol
efficiency
appears
especially
easy
for
small
agencies
to
achieve
because
as
agencies
grow
in
size
they
seem
to
require
disproportionately
more
administrative
supervisory
and
support
staff
ostrom
whitaker
and
parks
pp
but
cf
langworthy
and
hindelang
scott
klinger
p
other
sources
of
small
department
efficiency
undoubtedly
derive
from
the
characteristically
lower
salary
and
benefits
offered
especially
in
rural
areas
and
lower
investment
in
training
weisheit
and
hawkins
weisheit
n
if
the
cost
of
policing
is
directly
related
to
its
quality
smaller
and
rural
departments
should
be
in
trouble
but
at
least
one
standard
indicator
of
performance
suggests
that
they
tend
to
outperform
large
agencies
in
clearance
rates
for
major
offenses
cordner
falcone
wells
and
weisheit
n
second
the
people
served
by
small
departments
may
place
a
special
premium
on
certain
things
that
small
departments
deliver
with
greater
ease
but
that
large
departments
struggle
to
produce
accessibility
and
interpersonal
familiarity
with
the
community
less
red
tape
more
time
on
patrol
and
law
enforcement
that
is
customized
to
the
preferences
of
a
smaller
more
homogeneous
community

this
may
be
reflected
in
the
often
higher
levels
of
satisfaction
with
police
reported
by
residents
of
smaller
communities
which
while
not
always
showing
a
clear
superiority
of
small
town
over
big
city
policing

does
undermine

that

is
necessarily
better
than

is
not

a

degree
of

e
accounting
for
the
persistence
of
fragmentation
we
consider
two
theoretical
approaches
for
accounting
for
the
american
persistence
with
the
fragmentation
and
complexity
of
the
public
policing
industry
mastrofski
and
ritti
maguire
and
king
willis
mastrofski
and
weisburd
one
is
a
technical
rational
or
contingency
theory
that
organizations
strive
to
succeed
in
their
environments
by
a
rational
process
of
adopting
the
structures
and
practices
that
evidence
shows
are
best
suited
to
achieving
their
ostensible
technical
objectives
such
as
community
safety
here
organizations
or
their
leaders
survive
and
thrive
or
wither
or
depart
according
to
their
ability
to
compete
with
others
in
the
marketplace
for
providing
the
relevant
technical
results
another
approach
is
institutional
theory
which
emphasizes
that
organizations
respond
not
to
the
technical
aspects
of
their
environment
but
rather
to
cultural
features
beliefs
about
how
organizations
should
be
structured
and
operate
beliefs
and
systems
that
operate
independently
of
what
the
technical
environment
may
require
organizational
legitimacy
depends
then
on
adhering
to
the
beliefs
and
preferences
of
powerful
entities
in
the
environment
stakeholders
of
consequence
for
police
organizations
sometimes
called
sovereigns
in
what
ways
are
each
of
these
theories
useful
one
can
make
a
straightforward
argument
that
an
industry
populated
with
many
smaller
departments
persists
because
this
arrangement
works
well
in
a
technical
rational
sense
the
preponderance
of
evidence
reviewed
above
suggests
that
most
smaller
communities
are
not
convinced
that
larger
agencies
are
in
general
more
effective
in
keeping
their
communities
safe
but
rather
that
they
are
often
less
efficient
and
usually
less
responsive
in
serving
their
more
diverse
stakeholders
than
their
smaller
generally
less
diverse
counterparts
or
it
may
be
that
a
more
complex
technical
rational
argument
applies
perhaps
smaller
communities
especially
those
with
lower
levels
of
crime
and
disorder
than
their
big
city
counterparts
place
a
higher
priority
on
other
aspects
of
police
service
than
the
assurance
of
public
safety
perhaps
in
less
crime
threatened
environments
citizens
place
a
higher
premium
on
being
able
to
govern
their
police
than
they
would
in
a
more
threatened
environment
and
are
therefore
reluctant
to
consolidate
even
when
consolidation
might
be
the
more
efficient
route
in
terms
of
technical
performance
mastrofski
if
this
were
so
then
rapidly
rising
crime
rates
in
the
smaller
communities
should
be
associated
with
a
subsequent
increase
in
the
likelihood
that
police
service
would
be
consolidated
into
a
larger
agency
we
are
unaware
of
any
tests
of
this
hypothesis
some
cross
sectional
studies
have
attempted
to
compare
the
impact
of
large
versus
small
departments
by
matching
the
character
of
neighborhoods
but
such
studies
are
limited
in
what
they
can
tell
us
about
the
consequences
of
greater
consolidation
or
fragmentation
for
a
given
community
what
is
more
challenging
for
rational
technical
theory
is
explaining
the
persistence
of
the
many
fewer
large
police
organizations
in
the
face
of
their
efforts
to
acquire
the
responsiveness
of
the
smaller
agencies
here
it
may
be
that
the
availability
of
more
resources
for
these
agencies
makes
it
possible
to
acquire
the
trappings
of
legitimacy
that
institutional
theory
predicts
will
be
adopted
because
of
the
acceptance
of
those
structures
and
practices
by
powerful
sovereigns
as
the
right
way
to
organize
a
police
department
the
adoption
of
community
policing
and
compstat
reforms
has
been
understood
in

way

mastrofski
and

the

established
because
determining
that
requires
cross
national
comparisons
which
are
few
and
are
often
more
impressionistic
than
rigorous
it
is
not
established
that
a
fragmented
national

necessarily
more

less
effective
in
coping
with

is
more

efficient

or
more
or
less

of

rights
according
to
some
this
can
be
explained
by
a
highly
unitary
national
police
system
compensating
for
being
highly
decentralized
in
its
internal
command
structure
thereby
affording
the
sort
of
local
flexibility
that

have
felt
is
the
key
to

the

offers
an
interesting
possibility
system
fragmentation
could
facilitate
more
experimentation
and

while
impeding
the
widespread
adoption
of
organizational
innovations
it
has
not
been
empirically
established
that
highly
consolidated
policing
systems
are
more
innovative
or
adaptive
they
may
in
fact
be
less
so
precisely
because
the
risks
challenges
and
visibility
of
change
increase
with
the
size
and
complexity
of
the
more
consolidated
organization
and
the
entrenched
influence
of

the
highly
decentralized
structure
of
the
american

would
appear
to
provide

nurturing
environment
for
the
percolation
and
testing
of
new
ideas

as
they
diffuse
they
are

much
so
that

variation
in
the
execution
of

among
american
police
than
in

in
which

speculation
calls
for

must
be

factors
that
may

the
susceptibility
of

by

and
israel

american

in

more
for

than

another
shortcoming
of

that

while
there

reasons
to
suspect

public
organizations
tend
to
be
more
bureaucratic
than

because
of
the
inclination
of

to
place
more
constraints

measuring
dimensions

and
structural

police
organization
researchers
drawing
on
blau
and
others
have
identified
many
dimensions
of
organizational
structure
relevant
to
police
that
subsume
the
three
described
above
langworthy
maguire
et
al
wilson
one
group
of
characteristics
pertains
to
the
ways
in
which
the
organization
s
work
can
be
divided
functionally
across
different
department
units
such
as
patrol
investigations
and
communications
occupationally
using
persons
from
different
occupations
vertically
the
degree
of
hierarchical
differentiation
and
spatially
geographical
dispersion
such
as
dispersing
police
work
among
precincts
and
patrol
beats
in
addition
there
are
structural
elements
associated
with
control
and
coordination
of
the
organization
s
work
centralization
the
extent
to
which
decision
making
is
concentrated
formalization
the
amount
of
emphasis
on
specific
rules
and
procedures
and
administrative
intensity
the
degree
to
which
organization
resources
are
committed
to
administration
or
support
instead
of
operational
matters
two
questions
arise
about
the
internal
structure
of
policing
how
much
do
american
police
agencies
vary
structurally
and
how
if
at
all
is
this
pattern
changing
students
of
american
police
typically
characterize
the
structure
of
local
agencies
in
the
united
states
as
highly
variable
in
a
way
that
is
virtually
taken
for
granted
yet
it
is
not
so
clear
just
how
much
structural
variation
there
is
in
large
part
because
of
the
difficulties
in
acquiring
comparable
data
for
a
fully
representative
sample
of
local
police
agencies
what
is
available
typically
focuses
on
agencies
with
or
more
sworn
personnel
focusing
only
on
larger
agencies
undoubtedly
reduces
a
great
deal
of
the
variation
but
even
within
this
large
group
the
pattern
of
structural
variability
does
not
exactly
conform
to
expectations
one
study
of
large
departments
based
on
data
sets
showed
impressive
levels
of
variation
on
spatial
differentiation
number
of
stations
and
beats
in
the
jurisdiction
wilson
p
for
example
the
average
number
of
beats
for
the
agencies
surveyed
was
with
a
standard
deviation
of
however
such
variation
is
undoubtedly
driven
in
large
part
by
covariation
with
the
population
of
the
jurisdiction
served
so
that
a
mere
count
of
beats
is
as
much
a
reflection
of
the
jurisdiction
s
size
as
of
the
degree
to
which
it
spatially
subdivides
its
patrol
work
in
the
same
study
comparatively
modest
variation
was
found
on
many
other
structural
indicators
reflecting
other
forms
of
differentiation
and
structural
control
for
example
formalization
was
measured
as
the
number
of
issues
covered
by
policy
directives
up
to
the
average
for
the
departments
was
but
the
standard
deviation
was
only
suggesting
that
there
was
not
a
lot
of
variation
on
this
dimension
one
might
expect
even
less
variation
among
smaller
agencies
especially
the
many
with
fewer
than
officers
because
of
the
constraints
placed
by
small
size
on
the
number
of
beats
hierarchy
functional
specialization
and
administrative
staff
falcone

p
how
much
the
internal
structure
of
police
organizations
has
changed
depends
of
course
on
the
time
frame
reiss
suggested
that
police
departments
had
made
tremendous
changes
toward
greater
bureaucratization
by
the
end
of
the
twentieth
century
these
claims
are
based
largely
on
records
from
departments
archives
and
historians
accounts
recently
researchers
have
attempted
to
track
longitudinal
structural
change
from
surveys
of
large
numbers
of
police
agencies
conducted
at
more
or
less
regular
intervals

tracked
structural
change
in
police

more

increased

most
significantly
the

noted
that

further
the

a
concern

even
more

can
worry
about
the
validity
of

from

about

aside
what
we
may
take
from
these

appears
to
be
that
in

s
there
was
no
dramatic
trend
toward
or
away
from
the
forms
of
bureaucratic
structure
noted
by

early
in

decade
the
absence
of
evidence
of
dramatic
structural
change
among
american
police
agencies
during
the
late

and
early

though
perhaps
not
surprising
is
counter
to
the
hopes
of
many
progressive
reformers
whose
advocacy
of
a
less
bureaucratic
more
flexible
and
community
oriented
policing
began
to
surface
in
the

implications

just

the

of

has
implications
for
its
innovativeness
so
too
does
the
internal
structure
of
a
given
police

some
of
the
innovation
diffusion
research
indicates
that
several
structural
features
may
promote
innovativeness
such
as
decentralization
complexity
measured
as
the
range
of
occupational
specialties
employed
and
their
level
of
professionalism
as
reflected
in

formalization
and
organizational

p
however
no
structural
features
have
emerged
that
distinguish
more
from
less
innovative
organizations

the
adoption
of
community
policing
as
an
innovation
lends
itself
to
a
study
of
this
sort
and
some
have
examined
this
issue
finding
only
weak
or
modest
effects
for
most
structural
features
on
the
adoption
of
community
policing
elements
and
not
necessarily
consistent
with

perhaps
the
most
consistent
finding
is
that
police
department
size
presumably
a
proxy
measure
of
organizational
slack
is
significantly
related
to
the
adoption
and
implementation
of
community
policing
two
points
are
noteworthy
for
researchers
desiring
to
explore
police
structure
innovation
linkages
first
innovation
researchers
have
found
that
structures
that
may
encourage
experimenting
with
or
adopting
an
innovation
may
later
impede
the
scope
intensiveness
or
quality
of
its
actual
implementation

thus
researchers
should
be
careful
to
distinguish
the
initial
acceptance
adoption
of
a
police
reform
from
its
actual
implementation
second
over
the
life
course
of
an
innovation
in
a
police
agency
there
is
clearly
reciprocal
causation
between
the
structure
of
the
organization
decentralization
and
the
practice
of
the
innovation
partnering
with
community
groups
a
feature
that
is
made
quite
explicit
in
the
reform
doctrine
of
community
policing
which
lumps
structural
changes
with
a
host
of
programs
and
officer
practices
wilson
failure
to
model
this
feedback

could
cause
researchers
to
overstate
the
effects

we
care
about
the

of

as
it
has
consequence
for
their

here
we
face
many
challenges
largely
unmet
in
learning
the
influence
of

performance
first
is
the
challenge
of

are
indicators
of
how

use
their

which
is
far
more
frequent
than
formal

the

a
growing
literature
on
many
of
these
outputs
and
outcomes
in

skogan
and
frydl
chap
there
is
much
less
of
this
research
at
the
organization
level
attempting
to
learn
the
impact
of
organizational
features
these
lacunae
are
due
in
part
to
the
priority
given
by
police
policy
makers
and
researchers
on
crime
control
and
law
enforcement
as
central
police
missions
which
has
translated
into
a
reduced
priority
for
gathering
other
sorts
of
information
willis
mastrofski
and
kochel
changing
performance
monitoring
systems
is
a
major
task
and
that
may
not
be
the
highest
priority
of
even
those
police
leaders
who
see
merit
in
it
mastrofski
the
gaps
in
performance
measurement
are
also
due
to
a
disinclination
of
social
scientists
to
develop
measures
that
distinguish
good
from
less
good
performance
for
example
rather
than
predicting
arrests
predicting
the
best
resolution
of
an
incident
which
in
many
cases
might
be
something
other
than
arrest
mastrofski
p
finally
there
is
a
dearth
of
studies
of
the
extent
to
which
different
organizational
structures
contribute
to
the
short
and
long
term
success
of
the
organization
as
an
entity
resource
growth
market
share
prestige
regime
tenure
and
so
on
these
outcomes
may
not
seem
as
compelling
for
the
purposes
of
program
evaluation
but
they
are
very
much
on
the
minds
of
local
police
and
the
officials
responsible
for
them
and
thus
figure
largely
in
a
reform
s
prospects
second
the
research
that
attempts
to
estimate
the
effects
of
police
organization
structure
is
often
captive
to
the
limitations
of
readily
available
data
sets
often
large
surveys
and
censuses
of
american
police
departments
and
the
communities
they
serve
which
means
that
the
empirical
analysis
is
impoverished
by
its
limited
capacity
to
test
interesting
theoretical
propositions

of
his

to

the
conflicting

many
of
the
most
popular
contemporary

call
for
a

of
professionalism

it
may
be
ascending
as
a
means
of

yet
with

have
done
little
to
examine
whether
there
has
been
a
commensurate
strengthening
of
structures

promote
professionalism

trace
their
consequences
instead
structural
studies
focus
almost
exclusively
on
the
classic
elements
that
define
the
extent
to
which
the
police
organization
is
bureaucratized
the
presence
of
professionalism
cannot
be
assumed
by
the
degree
to
which
bureaucracy
is
absent
organizational
indicators
of
professionalism
might
include
for
example
policies
units
and
procedures
designed
to
screen
for
and
develop
certain
aspects
of
moral
character
and
technical
skill
among
police
officers
they
would
also
include
organizational
structures
designed
to
promote
the
development
and
institutionalization
of
a
professional
body
of
police
knowledge
bayley
and
bittner

they
could
include
organizational
elements
that
provide
for
a
professional
as
opposed
to
bureaucratic
review
of
the
degree
to
which
police
practice
conforms
to
professional
standards
one
indicator
of
professional
influence
is
the
extent
to
which
police
organizations
accept
lateral
transfers
between
organizations
of
officers
of
mid
and
upper
ranks
undoubtedly
many
police
professional
structures
are
only
weakly
developed
in
most
police
organizations
yet
the
absence
of
research
that
looks
for
this
starkly
illustrates
the
limited
scope
of
research
on
police
organizational
structures
at
the
intersection
of
both
bureaucratic
and
professional
structures

the
office
of

holding

the

much
of
the
older

emphasizes
how

negotiate
the
tensions
arising

the
often
conflicting
expectations
of
the

more
recent
work
drawn
from
a
single
observational
study
examines
different
supervisory
styles
that
emerge
and
their
consequences
for

engel
one
study
found
that
subordinate
officers
choices
about
how
to
spend
their
time
were
influenced
by
their
perception
of
their

personal
priorities
more
than
their
own
although
subordinates
often
misperceived

of
their

this
suggests
the
dominance
of
a
somewhat
clumsy
bureaucratic
model
over
a
professional
one
future
research
would
benefit
from
distinguishing
the
supervisors
priorities
from
their
methods
of
leadership
so
that
we
might
better
understand
the
role
they
play
regarding
bureaucratic
and
professional
models
of
policing
another
limitation
of
the
research
on
organizational
structures
is
the
concentration
on
comparing
police
organization
structures
at
a
given
time
longitudinal
data
where
available
to
support
quantitative
analysis
cover
only
a
few
years
typically
less
than
a
decade
while
it
may
be
a
valuable
exercise
to
track
short
term
structural
changes
and
their
consequences
the
expectations
of
politicians
and
entrepreneurial
police
leaders
notwithstanding
it
is
hardly
realistic
to
expect
most
trends
to
be
distinguishable
except
over
much
longer
time
periods
neither
rome
nor
most
contemporary
police
structural
reforms
were
built
in
a
day
cross
sectional
data
sets
make
causal
inference
challenging
and
it
is
very
difficult
to
gather
reliable
theoretically
useful
data
across
large
numbers
of
agencies
not
only
on
performance
measures
but
also
to
control
for
other
influences
that
might
mask
or
reveal
as
spurious
the
effects
of
structure
on
performance
for
example
researchers
often
wish
to
take
into
account
the

yet
those
who
try
to
do
this

large

of

find
that
available
measures
are
typically
limited
to
a
narrow
range
of
demographic
and
socioeconomic
indicators
routinely
collected
by
the
census

rather
than

direct

consequential

not
uncommonly
data
on
the
most
interesting
and
policy
relevant
environmental
features
are
not
readily
available
and
so
researchers
are
unable
to
say
much
of

about

interacts
with

one

are

effects
between
a

and
these
features
of

that
determine
how
it
will
respond
and
not
infrequently
measuring
these

requires
a
degree
of
subtlety
and
ability
to
distinguish
variation
in
police
practice
within
a
jurisdiction
mastrofski
and
ritti
that
is
why
the
most
cited
studies
often
rely
on
in
depth
comparisons
of
small
numbers
of
departments
such
as
the
eight
agencies
in
wilson
s
classic
varieties
of
police
behavior
these
small
comparative
studies
also
have
their
challenges
such
as
their
limited
capacity
to
generalize
from
small
nonrepresentative
samples
in
the
face
of
all
these
hurdles
it
is
unsurprising
that
the
national
research
council
panel
on
police
policy
and
practices
skogan
and
frydl
pp
and
others
klinger
concluded
that
relatively
little
can
be
said
about
the
influence
of
police
organization
structure
on
actual
police
practice
they
found
that
there
was
insufficient
research
to
draw
conclusions
about
the
impact
of
decentralized
police
structures
on
meeting
the
needs
of
jurisdictions
the
panel
noted
that
there
were
few
studies
assessing
the
impact
of
occupational
and
functional
specialization
and
the
results
are
mixed
the
committee
found
inadequate
evidence
to
make
any
conclusion
about
the
effects
of
hierarchy
on
police
practices
the
committee
further
concluded
that
there
was
some
evidence
that
spatially
focusing
police
work
e
g
stable
beat
assignments
and
efforts
to
have
officers
spend
time
in
those
beats
did
increase
officer
knowledge
of
and
commitment
to
the
neighborhood
but
that
these
effects
were
sustained
only
when
organizations
employed
other
structures
to
reinforce
this
behavior
finally
the
committee
found
that
the
limited
evidence
available
was
suggestive
that
formalizing
policies
can
produce
desired
effects
the
supporting
research
came
from
case
studies
of
efforts
to
increase
the
formality
and
constraints
on
specific
policies
usually
studied
in
one
or
a
few
organizations
the
results
were
encouraging
for
restrictions
on
the
use
of
lethal
force
especially
when
following
an
organizational
crisis
but
other
policy
areas
failed
to
produce
similar
results
handling
public
drunks
dealing
with
pornography
and
implementing
domestic
violence
policies
klinger
p
perhaps
formal
policies
more
easily
extinguish
undesired
behaviors
than
stimulate
desired
ones
and
of
course
because
the
committee
did
not
conduct
a
full
systematic
review
of
the
entire
body
of
research
it
is
likely
that
many
studies
failing
to
show
a
formalization
effect
were
not
published
thus
perhaps
overstating
the
effects
of
formalization
this
led
to
a
qualified
conclusion
making
obvious
the
need
to
know
more
about
the
aspects
of
formalization
and
other
features
of
the
policy
s
context
that
may
influence
its
success
finally
with
rare
exception
american

avoided

years

the
most

most
common

most

strategy
that
american

of

visible
as
possible
e

using
uniforms

marked
vehicles
on
random
patrol

create
a
sense

to
enable

the
boon
companion
of
preventive

is
reactive
patrol
which
requires
the
patrol
officer
to
interrupt

has

however
that

do
spend
significantly
more
time
on
nontraditional

traditional
patrol
and
engaging
the
public
in

to
dominate
the
work
of
community
policing
specialists
as
well
as

patrol
officers

thus
while
the
last
two
to
three
decades
have
witnessed
an
increasing
willingness
of
american
police
to
experiment
with
new
methods
for
patrol
officers
they
do
not
appear
to
have
supplanted
the
resource
commitment
of
american
police
to
continue
standard
preventive
reactive
patrol
in
the
traditional
fashion
lum
what
could
account
for
the
persistence
of
a
largely
discredited
patrol
technology
while
other
alternatives
are
available
one
possibility
is
that
american
police
are
simply
too
invested
in
the
structures
and
practices
of
the
standard
patrol
technology
even
if
the
scientific
community
considers
it
ineffective
for
decades
police
staffing
levels
have
been
justified
to
meet
calls
for
service
demand
and
to
having
adequate
slack
time
for
preventive
patrol
that
strategy
has
endured
in
bad
economic
times
as
well
as
good
when
crime
was
rising
and
falling
and
whether
public
confidence
in
police
was
ascendant
or
declining
gallagher
et
al
thus
although
the
main
features
of
the
now
standard
technology
were
adopted
over
the
course
of
only
a
couple
of
decades
following
the
rapid
expansion
of
mass
availability
of
motor
vehicle
ownership
beginning
in
the
s
since
then
there
may
be
insufficient
environmental
pressure
to
stimulate
a
similarly
rapid
change
from
that
technology
to
something
else
or
it
could
be
that
transforming
such
a
massive
and
fundamental
technology
just
takes
more
time
american
police
organizations
may
still
be
in
the
early
stages
of
testing
and
experimenting
with
alternative
technologies
such
as
hot
spots
policing
n
but
they
may
be
on
the
road
to
meaningful
change
if
some
early
adopters
develop
and
successfully
implement
an
alternative
technology
on
a
radical
scale
then
that
may
encourage
others
to
follow
rogers
in
the
interim
police
departments
may
be
keeping
the
new
alternative
technologies
at
the
periphery
of
the
organization
s
service
delivery
system
allowing
them
to
learn
by
experimentation
while
receiving
credit
from
relevant
stakeholders
and
peers
for
being
innovative
a
second
possibility
is
that
scientific
evaluations
of
the
standard
model
have
not
measured
the
performance

that
exert
the
greatest
influence

one
of
the
most

that

timely

steps
of

thus
standardizing
the

of
questions
the
officer
asks
the
sorts
of

for
and
hence
the
nature
of
the
entire
inquiry
computerized
systems
can
police
the
inquiry
by
requiring
that
certain
data
entry
fields
be
completed
before
the
officer
may
proceed
to
complete
other
fields
and
the
range
of
acceptable
responses
can
be
controlled
as

the
transparency
of

work
is
facilitated
by
the
ready
availability

the
profound
difference
this
can
make
is
observable

comparing

in

hence
the
quality
of

depends

some
of
the

such
a

undoubtedly
be
treated
with

also
by

more

have
had
unanticipated
and
undesirable

peter

one
of
the
most
prolific
articulators
of
this
perspective
has
argued
that

resist
using

actively
undermine
many
of
the

in
these
important
ways
the

the
key

with

consequence
the
answer
is
that
there
is
not
sufficient
evidence
available
to
answer
with
confidence
and
much
of
what

of

policy
and

concluded
that
the
small
body
of
available
research
provided
no
credible
evidence
that
officers
of
different
racial
or
ethnic
backgrounds
perform
differently
during
interactions
with
citizens
simply
because
of

or

skogan

p
when
considering
the
effects
of
the

behavior
they
found
the
amount
of

too
small

variable

a
notable
deficiency
in

of

its
capacity
to
test
whether
the
effects
of
the
officer

vary
in

here

willing

challenge

traditional
perspective
of

traditional

raises
the
possibility
that
these
new
groups
encourage
and
sustain
a
more
fragmented

we
address
the
evidence
on
fragmentation
of
the
police
culture
in
the
following
section
here
we
suggest
that
it
would
be
useful
to
learn
the
effects
of
different
levels
of
minority
presence
on

forces
by
comparing
the
culture
and
practices
of

in

high
levels

the
lack
of

trend
toward
more

there
is
considerable
public
approval

less
so
on
how
they
should
be
achieved
and
used

example

majorities
of
the

support
the
principle
that

reflect

a
types
of

before
we
address
the
question
of
changes
in
police
culture
we
must
first
acknowledge
the
different
ways
in
which
the
quality
of
culture
has
been
ascribed
to
police
researchers
have
used
three
characterizations
of
culture
paoline
chap
first
occupational
culture
has
been
used
to
capture
those
value
and
belief
orientations
that
are
presumed
to
differentiate
police
as
an
occupation
from
all
others
and
the
general
public
second
the
notion
of
organizational
culture
applied
to
police
has
made
possible
the
observation
that
culture
may
vary
from
one
police
organization
to
another
third
subculture
has
introduced
the
proposition
that
across
the
occupation
and
within
organizations
it
is
possible
to
distinguish
distinctly
different
beliefs
values
and
perceptions
that
police
employ
in
their
daily
work
we
summarize
the
literature
on
each
of
these
approaches
before
turning
to
changes
in
police
culture
drawing
on
paoline
s
review
of
this
literature
in
characterizing
each
when
social
scientists
began
ethnographic
studies
of
police
they
looked
for
and
found
a
number
of
features
of
contemporary
police
work
that
illuminated
a
monolithic
occupational
culture
the
physical
danger
that
might
emerge
even
from
seemingly
innocuous
situations
coupled
closely
with
the
unique
authority
of
the
police
to
coerce
and
control
serves
to
isolate
police
from
the
rest
of
society
inasmuch
as
society
does
not
fully
appreciate
the
requirements
of
dealing
effectively
with
danger
and
using
coercive
authority
effectively
skolnick
westley
consequently
officers
share
a
deep
suspicion
of
situations
and
people
s
motives
and
they
feel
constant
pressure
to
be
alert
for
signs
of
danger
and
anything
that
undermines
their
authority
police
work
is
also
laden
with
uncertainty
officers
routinely
find
themselves
called
on
to
figure
out
what
is
really
going
on
under
circumstances
in
which
the
quality
of
information
is
untested
and
the
pressure
for
timely
diagnosis
is
great

there
may
be

what

and
additional
uncertainty
is
introduced
by
the
asymmetry
of
consequences
for
outcomes
most
police
actions
may
produce
no
visible
consequences

of
those
that
do

perceive
that

derives
also
from
the
widespread
belief
that
the

researchers
have
not
demonstrated
the
extent
to
which
these
or
any
features
of
the
police
culture
distinguish
it
from
other
occupational
groups
indeed
social
isolation
is
a
primary
feature
of
the
military
and
certain
clergy
whereas
group
loyalty
would
seem
pervasive
among

the
ability
of

to

second
the

of

since
then
a
number
of
studies
have
explored
the
variation
in
police
culture
that
may
be
attributable
to
police
organization
characteristics
for
example
klockars
and
colleagues
used
surveys
of
officers
to
measure
the
orientations
of
police
to
hold
and
enforce
integrity
standards
regarding
corruption
and
abuse
they
found
significant
variation
among
police
organizations
in
their
support
of
integrity
and
attributed
that
variation
to
certain
key
features
of
the
organization
and
its
leadership
klockars
et

klockars
ivkovic
and

other
cross
jurisdictional
studies
have
linked
department
size
and
other
features
to
the
inclination
of
officers
to
make
arrests
for
certain
offenses
brown

ritti
and

however
most
of
these
studies
focus
on
central
tendencies
of
officer
attitude
responses
while
some
find
statistically
significant
differences
across
departments
little
attention
is
paid
to
the
size
of
those
effects
relative
to
other
influences
stated
another
way
what
is
the
scope
of
variation
within
departments
one
study
looked
at
officers
orientations
to
aggressive
enforcement
and
community
partnership
in
two
departments
seeking
to
promote
different
styles
of
community
policing
and
found
that
although
there
was
a
small
and
significant
difference
on
one
measure
a
percent
higher
approval
score
on
community
partnership
the
level
of
variation
in
both
departments
on
all
measures
was
quite
modest
terrill
and
mastrofski
the
issue
raised
is
whether
there
is
enough
cultural
coherence
within
police
organizations
to
speak
meaningfully
about
differences
in
culture
between
departments
researchers
have
simply
not
explored
this
issue
in
enough
places
to
offer
a
rigorous
test
of
this
proposition
the
most
examined
aspect
of
police
culture
has
been
how
much
it
may
be
fragmented
into
subcultures
within
police
departments
a
number
of
studies
have
identified
different
styles
of
policing
some
looking
for
distinct
differences
between
management
and
street
officers
reuss
ianni
and
ianni
paoline
but
most
focus
on
the
rank
and
file
only
broderick
muir
brown
paoline
mastrofski
willis
and
snipes
wood
davis
and
rouse
most
of
these
studies
highlight
to
what
degree
officers
within
the
same
department
exhibit
different
cultural
orientations
toward
a
wide
range
of
issues
n
one
should
note
that
although
there
are
some
similarities
among
some
of
the
studies
in
the
sorts
of
attitudes
beliefs
and
perceptions
that
are
measured
there
are
also
important
differences
measures
and
methods
of
observation
vary
considerably
especially
between
the
studies
that
explore
each
of
the
three
general
approaches
to
defining
police
culture
thus
while
it
is
tempting
to
accept
these
findings
as
undermining
the
occupational
and
organizational
cultural
theses
they
constitute
at
best
a
fuzzy
test
careful
attention
to
using
common
measures
and
methods
across
multiple
jurisdictions
would
enable
researchers
to
say
more
conclusively
whether
and
how
culture
varies
at
all
three
levels
b
changes
in
police
culture
we
now
turn
to
the
question
of
whether
police
culture
has
changed
or
is
changing
the
answer
depends
on
what
type
of
culture
we
are
considering
if
there
are
some
aspects
of
police
culture
that
bridge
all
american
police
then
by
virtue
of
the
size
and
diversity
of
the
american
policing
industry
this
would
be
the
slowest
to
change
and
the
most
difficult
to
detect
one
might
do
so
by
tracking
representative
samples
of
american
police
officers
conducting
a
survey
every
several
years
this
has
not
been
done
but
the
police
foundation
conducted
a
single
such
national
survey
weisburd
et
al
the
authors
found
that
certain
police
attitudes
differed
substantially
from
the
traditional
characterization
of
the
occupational
culture
as
isolated
defensive
and
hostile
to
legal
constraints
we
may
also
draw
on
case
studies
of
police
organizations
that
track
the
change
in
police
attitudes
over
time
an
interesting
study
used
a
variety
of
measures
to
assess
whether
the
police
culture
changed
in
two
illinois
police
departments
that
were
trying
to
implement
community
policing
and
get
officers
to
embrace
its
values
and
practices
rosenbaum
and
wilkinson
the
virtue
of
this
research
is
that
five
survey
waves
were
conducted
between
and
an
impressive
effort
by
conventional
social
science
standards
although
some
changes
were
observed
even
here
there
was
backsliding
over
time
causing
the
researchers
to
conclude
that
the
officers
orientations
had
not
changed
for
the
most
part
one
might
attribute
some
of
this
to
failures
and
limitations
in
the
departments
efforts
but
we
think
that
it
more
likely
represents
a
much
broader
challenge
police
organizations
try
to
control
the
transmission
of
culture
through
formal
mechanisms
such
as
selection
training
supervision
and
exhortation
by
top
leaders
muir
chap
but
police
agencies
like
many
other
organizations
transmit
their
culture
largely
through
informal
mechanisms
over
which
police
leaders
simply
have
little
direct
control
at
least
for
the
short
run
changing
fundamental
police
values
and
beliefs
rarely
happens
as
a
pentecost
buerger
but
rather
can
be
expected
to
evolve
only
as
the
old
hands
depart
leaving
more
of
the
new
ones
who
may
have
been
selected
with
a
particular
orientation
or
at
least
may
be
more
open
to
accepting
new
ways
it
is
especially
difficult
to
anticipate
reforming
the
values
of
officers
who
have
developed
their
skill
set
under
one
cultural
system
to
the
extent
that
values
follow
skills
and
habits
the
longer
officers
are
invested
in
the
skill
inventory
they
possess
the
harder
it
is
to
get
them
to
be
positive
about
investing
in
a
radically
different
set
hence
we
should
be
surprised
and
skeptical
if
police
leaders
or
researchers
report
that
in
a
few
or
even
over
the
course
of
several
years
they
have
transformed
the
culture
of
their
department
this
is
not
to
say
that
short
term
behavioral
change
is
impossible
there
are
a
variety
of
ways
to
structure
work
to
achieve
compliance
with
expectations
which
was
one
of
the
principal
virtues
of
bureaucracy
according
to
weber
p
commissioner
william
bratton
reported
turning
around
the
new
york
city
police
department
moving
it
away
from
its
lassitude
about
enforcing
minor
quality
of
life
violations
in
the
city
but
we
doubt
that
much
of
the
impressive
increase
achieved
in
levels
of
enforcement
citations
and
arrests
was
accomplished
by
changing
the
police
culture
rather
it
was
by
changing
the
supervisory
and
incentive
disincentive
systems
that
harnessed
existing
cultural
values
to
the
leader
s
goals
but
we
hypothesize
that
achieving
widespread
internalization
of
a
remarkably
different
set
of
beliefs
and
priorities
from
those
dearly
and
long
held
simply
takes
sustained
effort
over
the
course
of
at
least
a
couple
of
generations
of
workers
to
accomplish
c
sources
of
cultural
change
so
what
forces
might
work
to
transform
police
culture
the
answer
depends
of
course
on
which
aspects
of
culture
we
consider
we
have
selected
three
types
of
cultural
change
that
have
been
the
object
of
reformers
during
the
last
several
decades
reducing
police
alienation
and
isolation
from
the
communities
they
serve
community

shifting
greater
reliance
from
craft
to
science
values
problem
oriented
policing
and
increasing
commitment
to
integrity
over
group
loyalty
corruption
reduction
accomplishing
a
profound
shift
toward
less
police
isolation
from
the
community
and
stronger
police
community
bonds
will
require
structural
changes
that
go
well
beyond
leadership
s
exhortation
and
the
creation
of
special
community
oriented
units
and
programs
reiss
pp
structural
changes
one
might
hypothesize
would
promote
and
reinforce
such
a
cultural
shift
include
recruiting
police
from
populations
that
more
closely
match
the
populations
served
in
terms
of
their
cultural
heritage
particularly
important
in
minority
and
low
income
areas
that
receive
police
attention
disproportionate
to
their
numbers
maintaining
stable
assignments
of
officers
to
specific
areas
over
long
time
periods
years
rather
than
months
and
rationalizing
the
system
of
skills

giving
officers
useful
training
and
measuring
individual
and
unit
performance
in

little
evidence
of
american

being
willing

able
to
implement
these
changes
if
anything
the
pressure

officer

rather
on
what

hence
diffusion
of

engage

an

can
offer
a
significant

of

to

of

ensuring
that
a

approach
to
problem
solving
permeates
to

officers
will

reward
active

it
may
be
that
successful
integration
of
a

will
not
require
police
officers
who
do

so
much
as
ones
who

legitimacy
the

may
serve
as
a
model
here
where
science
based
technologies
and
strategies
are
devised
by
specialists
usually
civilians
the
third
domain
we
explore
is
changing
the
police
culture
from
one
that
prizes
group
loyalty
to
one
that
gives
greater
weight
to
professional
standards
of
integrity
this
requires
that
police
develop
an
intolerance
of
corruption
and
abuse
of
authority
among
their
members
it
requires
a
dramatic
shift
from
the
code
of
silence
thought
to
permeate
the
ranks
of
the
police
skolnick
this
means
not
only
that
officers
apply
those
standards
personally
but
that
they
are
committed
to
applying
them
to
their
peers
which
would
include
whistle
blowing
and
informal
expressions
of
disapproval
when
they
become
aware
of
corruption
and
abuse
n
internalizing
these
norms
requires
at
least
two
things
of
the
police
organization
clearly
stated
standards
of
behavior
that
are
viewed
as
reasonable
and
appropriate
and
a
system
of
discipline
that
is
predictable
fair
and
corrective

opposed

being

that
strong

top
of
the

is
essential
for
emphasizing
the
importance
of

the
willingness

that
they
invest
it
with
good
faith

what

some
analysts
view
it
as
a
system
independent
of
the
self
regulatory
culture
of
integrity
also
influencing
the
culture
of
integrity
is
the
bureaucratic
system
of
command
and
control
this
attempts
to
manipulate
organizationally
controlled
incentives

disincentives
to
act
in
accordance
with
integrity

that

are
motivated

to
maximize
their
personal
outcomes

change

incentives

as

the
specifics
of
how
such
a
system
operates
cannot
but
convey
to
officers
the
organization
s
expectations
as
well
as
its
commitment
to
enforcing
them
what
is
not
particularly
clear
from
the
limited
empirical
research
is
how
police
organizations
can
be
designed
and
led
to
activate
either
system
of
control
so
that
it
will
promote
stronger
systems
of
integrity
with
some
reliability
one
researcher
found
that
when
agencies
became
more
authoritarian
and
bureaucratized
they
increased
their
capacity
to
limit
corruption
through
such
specific
practices
as
holding
supervisors
accountable
for
their
officers
practices
using
closer
surveillance
implementing
covert
integrity
tests
and
ending
quotas
for
units
specializing
in
vice
arrests
hence
reducing
perjury

another
perspective
on
changing
the
culture
of

is
offered
by

the

scenarios

the

misconduct
was
judged
to
be
the
seriousness
of
the
discipline
expected
and
the
willingness
of
the
respondent
to
report
the
misconduct
researchers
found
substantial
variation
among
american
agencies
in
their
level
of
integrity
and
selected
three
that
scored
as
high
integrity
for
the
collection
of
detailed
information
about
the
processes
producing
integrity
in
these
agencies
from

the
likelihood

speculated
that
the
driving
force
behind

was
not
the
values
officers
brought
with
them
when
they
became

the
ethical
persuasiveness
of

but
rather
the
signals
given
by

leadership
in
its
disciplinary
practices
for

the

of

about

these

argued
that
these

will
when
provided
with
consistency
produce
cultural
changes

are
ultimately
manifested

avoid
the

risks
of

by
ensuring
that
measures
of
the

relevant
to

are
independent

governance
of
the

american
democratic
principles
prescribe
that
the
police
are
subject
to
the
governance
of
other
institutions
in
all
three
branches
of

at
the
local
level
this

the

of

the

this
is

nonetheless
these
earlier

had
clearly
given
police
chiefs
and
their
departments
considerable
freedom
from
everyday
political
intervention
but
by
the
late
s
the
police
underwent
intense
public
scrutiny
and
criticism
for
having
become
too
removed
from
the
community
they

those
ethnic

the
emergence
of

is
directly
attributable
to
a
desire
among

rebuild

by
reestablishing
a

with
the

that

have
been
to

that
those

some

stability

in
american

a
leitmotif

been
the
tension
between
the
temptation

the
capacity
of
american
police

resist

guyot

and
the
temptation
to
overstate
their
susceptibility

these
temptations
arise
in
part
from
the
american
habit
of
valuing
change
de
tocqueville
and
depending
on
our
perspective
being
frustrated
by
failing
to
observe
change
that
meets
our
expectations
or
being
inclined
to
find
indicators
that
our
police
are
fulfilling
them
resistance
to
change
arises
from
a
variety
of
ranks
and
units
from
unions
from
other
organizations
that
have
business
with
the
police
from
politicians
and
from
the
public

difficulties

yet
we
must
be
careful
not
to
mischaracterize
police

intransigent

it
is
not
at

clear
that
they
as
a
group
are
any
more
resistant
to
change
than
other
organizations
such
as
schools

and
in
recent
years
american

some
have
argued
that
police
organizations
were
remarkably
susceptible
to
pressures
to
change
in
the
nineteenth
and
twentieth
centuries
albeit
largely
symbolic
ones
that
preserved
the
legitimacy
of
the
core
functions
of
the
police
klockars
and
some
have
argued
that
the
last
three
decades
have
been
a
period

intense
ferment

real
change
for
american
police

all
this
is
to
say
that
generalization
about
police
organization
change
is
hazardous
in
this
section
we
consider
two
movements
for
change
that
are
big
reforms
bayley
community
policing
and
terrorist
oriented
policing
the
former
had
precursors
in
the
s
and
surfaced
in
the
s
the
latter
emerged
in
the
wake
of
the
september
terrorist
attacks
on
new
york
and
washington
we
attempt
to
understand
how
these
reform
movements
have
transformed
american
policing
we
recognize
that
they
represent
broad
and
complicated
innovations
and
do
not
represent
all
movements
for
change
but
for
their
scope
alone
they
deserve
attention
in
both
cases
we
note
that
the
forces
at
work
over
the
life
course
of
each
reform
movement
are
dynamic
and
that
how
innovations
such
as
these
are
initially
conceptualized
and
how
they
are
institutionalized
tend
to
differ
in
both
cases
pressure
for
change
was
initiated
outside
of
police
agencies
but
as
is
often
the
case
weisburd
and
braga
bayley
the
scope
and
direction
of
change
that
actually
occurred
were
heavily
influenced
by
police
efforts
to
protect
the
core
service
oriented
structures
and
operations
that
have
long
sustained
american
police
to
the
extent
that
these
preservationist
efforts
reflect
conscious
leadership
choices
we
suspect
that
the
motivation
is
primarily
one
of
not
putting
at
risk
what
the
public
values
most
in
the
current
environment
a
community
policing
the
key
elements
of
change
introduced
by
community
policing
are
that
the
public
should
be
much
more
engaged
in
policy
making
and
service
delivery
that
the
police
should
engage
in
problem
oriented
policing
which
requires
a
focus
on
outcomes
experimentation
and
empirical
evaluation
and
a
commitment
to
customizing
the
selection
of
a
policing
approach
to
the
particular
problem
at
hand
and
that
decision
making
should
be
decentralized
in
the
organization
to
middle
managers
and
the
rank

progressed
on
these

dimensions

whether
these
changes
are
accomplishing
their
goals

it
is
widely
acknowledged
that
many

that
the

the

little

risk
the

called
for
by
the
more
structurally
disruptive

that

unless
some
compelling

a
good
working
hypothesis
is
that
it
will
be
difficult
for
police
agencies
to
create
or
sustain
momentum
to
make
such
changes
one
might
argue
that
merely

has
not
been

thus
while
it
may
no
longer
be
fair
to
write
community

off

a

circumlocution

appears
not
to
have
done
a

transform

majority
of
american

on

literature
braga

suggest
that
police
innovations
will
be
adopted
to
the
extent
that
they
are
compatible
with
existing
values
and
ways
of
doing
things
given
the
smorgasbord
of
community
policing
innovations

it
is
not
surprising
that
changes
are
modest
making
truly
radical
changes
requires
unsettling
often
well
ensconced
and
powerful
interests
and
this
may
be
accomplished
only
if
a
sense
of
pressing
need
pervades
this
phase
of

if
one
is
struck
by
the
attenuation
of
a
crisis
mentality
to
energize
the
implementation
of
community
policing
in
that
reform
s
third
decade
one
must
certainly
acknowledge
the
crisis
atmosphere

propels
the
movement
to
involve

local
police
in
countering
terrorism
in
the
united

in
the
first

following
the

the

the

some
of

the

of

one
tentative
conclusion
drawn

that

a

on
greater
local
police

strategies
but
failing
a
sustained
crisis
there
simply
does
not
appear
to
be
sufficient
incentive
for
most
local
communities

their
police
leaders
to
resort
to
a
radical
reorientation
of
their
mission

because
counterterrorism
appears
not
to
have
significantly
displaced
routine
policing

does
not

that
new
developments
are

agencies
between
police
and
other
emergency
services
between
the
police
and

enforcement
and

agencies
marks
a
distinct
departure
from
a
long
history
of
loosely
coordinated
interagency
activity
between
local
and
federal
agencies
not
infrequently
fraught
with
misunderstanding
jealousies
suspicions
and
reluctance
to
collaborate
fully

consequence

maguire

forthcoming
only
a
few
years
after
there
appeared
to
be
a
growing
consensus
among
local
state
and
federal
officials
that
substantial
progress
had
been
made
and
would
continue
davies
and
plotkin
indeed
with
regard
to
information
sharing
local
law
enforcement
leaders
have
expressed
a
desire
to
become
full
partners
in
information
networks
run
by
the
federal
government
to
find
ways
for
street
level
officers
to
contribute
more
information
on
a
timely
basis
to
federal
data
bases
but
they
also
want
to
receive
more
usable
information
from
federal
sources
on
threats
to
their
locales
chap
and
they
support
an
all
crimes
approach
to
information
sharing
that
includes
not
only
terrorist
based
threats
but
other
crimes
and
disorders
that
might
threaten
communities
thus
one
predictable
consequence
of
the
movement
toward
involving
local
police
in
counterterrorism
efforts
is
an
industry
that
is
a
bit
less
loosely
coupled
where
once
impermeable
information
membranes
between
local
and
federal
agencies
geller
and
morris
are
increasingly
permeable
networks
designed
for
one
purpose
may
be
exploited
for
others
so
america
s
complex
industry
structure
may
be
becoming
more
tightly
connected
by
information
highways
created
to
combat
terrorism
however
we
are
not
seeing
a
systemwide
centralization
of
policing
structures
to
accommodate
the
war
on
terror
that
several
observers
have
associated
with
an
increased
focus
on
combating
terror
on
domestic
soil
bayley

weisburd
feucht

thus
years
after
concern
about
the
nation
s
vulnerability
to
terrorism
reached
a
fever
pitch
and
even
while
the
threat
of
terrorism
remains
a
daily
news
topic
american
police
remain
heavily
focused
on
the
same
local
problems
using
essentially
the
same
structures
and
systems
that
preceded
this
is
not
to
dismiss
the
peripheral
changes
especially
in
specialist
units
that
have
developed
but
to
note
that
they
operate
largely
independent
from
the
core
policing
operation
of
course
this
could
change
if
the
united

were
to
be
subjected
to
a
much
greater
frequency
of

attacks
such
as
those
experienced

viii
conclusion
we
addressed
several
aspects
of
police
organization
in
the
twenty
first
century
the
american
policing
industry
remains
highly
decentralized
and
has
strong
prospects
for
continuing
to
do
so
this
has
many
powerful
implications
for
how
and
how
well
american
police
practice
their
work
and
with
what
success
but
it
is
difficult
to
test
propositions
without
meaningful
cross
national
comparisons
to
systems
less
fragmented
than
the
american
case
studies
of
the
internal
structure
of
american
police
confirm
the
persistence
of
its
bureaucratic
character
as
we
move
into
the
twenty
first
century
finding
little
change
over
short
time
periods
however
most
of
this
research
ignores
the
effects
of
professional
structures
and
hence
is
unable
to
tell
us
how
much
competing
frameworks
for
organizational
control
may
be
developing
the
need
for
long
term
studies
of
structural
change
and
better
insight
into
the
actual
change
processes
has
been
noted
some
policing
technologies
such
as
standard
patrol
have
changed
little
over
many
decades
whereas
recent
years
have
observed
a
large
number
of
important
changes
in
others
such
as
information
technology
there
are
a
number
of
rational
explanations
for
the
persistence
of
standard
patrol
technologies
in
the
face
of
scientific
evidence
that
discredits
their
effectiveness
although
the
capacity
of
police
organizations
to
resist
and
pervert
the
use
of
new
information
technologies
is
great
in
the
short
run
there
is
evidence
to
suggest
that
profound
long
term
effects
into
the
future
are
possible
there
are
distinct
trends
in
who
does
police
work
as
the
numbers
of
members
of
racial
minorities
women
and
college
educated
and
better
trained
personnel
continue
to
grow
although
there
are
theories
that
predict
that
these
personnel
trends
will
have
profound
consequences
for
the
practice
of
policing
thus
far
the
evidence
has
been
modest
and
mixed
police
culture
can
assume
several
meanings
there
is
not
much
evidence
available
to
test
the
notion
that
policing
is
culturally
distinct
from
other
occupations
relatively
few
studies
exist
that
demonstrate
how
police
organizational
culture
differs
and
with
what
effects
and
although
a
growing
body
of
studies
finds
diversity
in
the
outlook
of
police
on
a
number
of
dimensions
it
is
not
yet
obvious
how
influential
that
diversity
is
for
the
actual
practice
of
policing
traditional
scholarship
has
characterized
the
police
occupational
culture
as
highly
resistant
to
change
but
there
are
many
contemporary
pressures
to
reduce
the
alienation
isolation
and
defensiveness
that
have
been
used
to
describe
it
in
the
past
community
policing
and
efforts
to
weaken
the
blue
code
of
silence
on
matters
of
police
integrity
less
well
developed
but
potentially
no
less
consequential
is
the
movement
to
change
the
dominant
culture
of
policing
from
that
of
a
craft
to
a
science
based
occupation
despite
the
importance
of
external
governance
to
the
preservation
of
democratic
policing
this
topic
remains
underdeveloped
as
an
area
of
study
even
many
decades
after
the
triumph
of
good
government
reform
america
s
local
governments
appear
to
exhibit
considerable
variation
in
the
ways
they
govern
their
police
case
studies
have
tended
to
focus
on
the
role
of
political
officials
largely
unexamined
are
the
roles
of
grassroots
community
organizations
and
police
professional
associations
although
there
is
reason
to
expect
that
they
may
be
having
increasing
influence
on
policies
and
practices
of
local
agencies
although
the
experiences
of
police
agencies
with
innovation
surely
vary
with
the
nature
of
the
innovation
experience
with
the
two
big
innovations
community
policing
and
terrorist
oriented
policing
shows
how
police
organizations
manage
to
adopt
and
absorb
pressures
for
change
while
minimizing
threats
to
the
stability
of
the
core
features
of
the
organization
this
was
the
case
for
community
policing
now
about
three
decades
old
and
also
for
terrorist
oriented
policing
which
is
not
yet
a
decade
old
american
police
agencies
today
as
in
the
nineteenth
century
are
targets
of
change
often
from
forces
outside
their
boundaries
bayley

we
should
not
underestimate
the
capacity
of
those
who
are
members
of
the
organization
to
resist
skogan
but
also
to
channel
these
pressures
to
change
indeed
what
we
may
have
witnessed
in
the
last
few
decades
of
the
twentieth
century
was
an
increasing
capacity
of
police
leaders
to
appropriate
and
engineer
reforms
that
were
originally
powered
by
external
pressure
community

broken

way
whereas
compstat

the

the
progeny
of
the
police
themselves
that
does
not
mean
that
police
leaders
are
becoming
masters
of
the
industry

destiny
but
it
does
suggest
that
in
our
efforts
to
discern
and
predict
the
trajectory
of
police
organization
stability
and
change
we
need
to
attend
closely
to
the
inclinations
and
capacities
of
the
police
themselves
to
shape
it
throughout
this
essay
we
have
suggested
opportunities
for
future
research
we
do
not
restate
suggestions
about
what
to
study
here
but
conclude
with
some
recommendations
on
how
to
study
police
organizations
first
scholars
and
policy
makers
would
benefit
from
expanding
the
study
of
police
organizations
to
include
more
cross
national
comparisons
it
not
only
places
the
american
situation
in
a
larger
context
but
also
provides
insights
into
alternative
ways
of
organizing
the
delivery
of
policing
this
sort
of
research
is
costly
and
funding
sources
in
america
have
rarely
supported
such
comparisons
perhaps
because
they
appear
more
academic
than
practical
nonetheless
a
recent
u
s
government
funded
foray
into
this
sort
of
project
has
yielded
useful
policy
as
well
as
theoretical
insights
from
cross
national
comparisons
weisburd
et
al
we
encourage
the
u
s
government
to
explore
the
possibility
of
developing
a
well
supported
cross
national
research
and
evaluation
program
so
that
developed
and
developing
nations
can
learn
from
each
other
s
experiences
most
police
researchers
are
hampered
by
their
ability
to
track
the
changes
in
police
organizations
over
long
time
periods
at
best
some
can
invest
in
tracking
a

agency

occasional
useful

but
we
could
learn
more
from
the
history
of
police
if
there
were
a
systematic
effort
to
track
a
large
number
of
police
organizations
over
long
time
periods
the
u
s
department
of
justice
has
funded
a
small
pilot
version
of
such
a
project
the
national
police
research
platform
rosenbaum
and
hartnett
the
project
is
developing
instruments
and
methods
to
study
the
life
course
of
police
organizations
as
well
as
longitudinal
changes
of
individual
police
officers
and
supervisors
most
of
the
research
on
police
organizations
is
based
on
mail
surveys
of
large
numbers
of
police
organizations
or
on
site
case
studies
of
one
or
a
few
organizations
both
are
useful
but
each
has
severe
limitations
although
they
enable
researchers
to
draw
large
more
or
less
representative
samples
of
american
police
agencies
they
are
limited
in
the
validity
and
reliability
of
the
data
they
gather
and
they
also
afford
poor
opportunities
to
learn
much
about
the
structures
processes
and
outcomes
that
are
of
greatest
interest
the
case
studies
afford
an
opportunity
for
greater
validity
and
reliability
of
observations
but
their
representativeness
is
always
questionable
and
their
small
number
limits
the
capacity
to
compare
and
control
for
a
variety
of
possible
influences
on
whatever
is
being
studied
two
alternatives
seem
valuable
but
both
are
costly
one
is
to
develop
a
consortium
of
police
researchers
around
the
nation
who
agree
to
use
a
common
set
of
methods
and
instruments
to
observe
key
aspects
of
police
organizations
the
second
is
for
research
funding
agencies
to
support
more
midrange
studies
that
permit
researchers
to
conduct
in
depth
on
site
observation
of
police
organizations
in
a
substantial
number
of
departments
a
model
for
this
is
the
police
services
study
which
in
conducted
on
site
observation
in
police
agencies
and
urban
neighborhoods
over
the
course
of
months
icpsr
studies
of
police
organization
are
at
least
as
valuable
to
policy
makers
as
studies
that
evaluate
the
effects
of
police
interventions
police
strategies
and
tactics
are
relevant
only
to
the
extent
that
they
are
implemented
and
implementation
is
determined
in
large
part
by
the
capacity
of
police
organizations
to
manage
guide
and
structure
the
operations
of
their
people
and
organizational
components
fernandez
and
rainey
those
who
fund
rigorous
studies
to
test
the
effects
of
police
interventions
should
commit
as
much
funding
to
help
police
learn
how
to
implement
and
sustain
the
changes
that
these
innovations
require

in

technology
has
been
praised
by

agencies
around
the

for
its
innovation
including

in
the
new

and

news
with
diane
sawyer
among
others
being
recognized
by
time
is
a
big
honor
but
what
s
more
important
is
that
since
the
program
was
implemented
the
department
has
seen
a
large
reduction
in
crimes
said
zach
friend
spokesman
and
crime
analyst
for
the
department
we
re
focused
a
lot
less
on
the
coverage
and
the
accolades
than
we
are
on
the
actual
reduction
said
friend
who
was
instrumental
in
bringing
the
program
to
santa
cruz
friend
first
read
about
the
predictive
policing
program
being
worked
on
by
santa
clara
university
s
dr
george
mohler
in
the
los
angeles
times
last
year
and
decided
to
approach
mohler
about
implementing
it
in
santa
cruz
mohler
developed
the
program
with
a
team
of
ucla
researchers
using
an
earthquake
aftershock
model
to
determine
where
future
crimes
will
occur
initially
using
data
from
the
los
angeles
police
department
it
s
similar
to
the
predictability
of
an
aftershock
after
an
earthquake
in
that
the
model
predicts
that
there
will
be
so
called
after
crimes
following
an
initial
crime
friend
and
santa
cruz
police
leaders
met
with
mohler
and
provided
him
with
crime
data
from
with
a
focus
on
property
crimes
the
department
became
the
first
in
the
nation
to
use
the
predictive
program
which
it
implemented
in
july
and
since
then
they
ve
already
seen
a
decrease
in
the
targeted
crime
types
which
includes
burglaries
and
motor
vehicle
thefts
in
january
the
police
department
will
work
with
the
researchers
to
do
a
full
analysis
of
the
program
after
the
first
six
months
of
implementation
other
police
departments
are
also
looking
into
implementing
the
program
which
lapd
has
started
testing
in
one
of
its
divisions
friend
and
lt
bernie
escalante
visited
lapd
earlier
this
week
to
speak
to
members
of
the
division
which
is
three
times
the
size
of
the
entire
santa
cruz
police
department
about
using
the
program
and
how
its
worked
in
santa
cruz
the
program
can
also
help
ease
the
pain
of
departments
dealing
with
shrinking
staffing
due
to
budget
cuts
a
matter
of
increasing
importance
given
the
nation
s
economic
troubles
technological
programs
like
this
can
help
equalize
the

simple

seemingly
as
far

as
esp
such
scenes
are
becoming
more
common
police
departments
from
minneapolis
to
los
angeles
are
turning
to
the
emerging
science
of
using
recent
crime
data
to
predict
where
criminals
will
strike
next
the
potentially
revolutionary
step
could
fundamentally
alter
the
nature
of
police
work
the
idea
is
that
everyone
even
criminals
are
creatures
of
habit
with
enough
information
about
past
crimes
it
s
possible
to
forecast
their
future
target
we
usually
look
at
the
last
week
and
say
this
is
what
happened
in
the
last
week
said
minneapolis
chief
tim
dolan
well
we
ve
added
to
that
saying
this
is
what
we
think
s
going
to
happen
next
week
that
kind
of
thinking
has
just
begun
in
minneapolis
but
dolan
says
it
s
already
paid
off
in
north
and
southwest
minneapolis
areas
that
led
the
city
last
year
in
reducing
overall
crime
rates
the
strategy
looks
slightly
different
everywhere
it
s
used
but
predictive
policing
relies
mainly
on
a
police
department
s
ability
to
accumulate
deep
databases
of
crime
information
that
detail
time
location
methods
and
numerous
other
bits
of
revealing
data
crunched
by
a
computer
analyst
the
numbers
reveal
patterns
that
s
the
task
facing
a
crew
of
five
such
crime
analysts
who
work
out
of
a
second
floor
office
in
city
hall
every
day
they
pore
over
recent
crime
data
slicing
it
different
ways
and
sometimes
using
software
to
crunch
it
further
if
a
pattern
emerges
they
mark
it
down
for
consideration
on
an
internal
crime
map
that
gets
passed
along
to
the
chief
for
his
weekly
meeting
with
top
inspectors
and
lieutenants
a
handful
of
police
departments
around
the
country
have
spent
tens
of
thousands
of
dollars
on
more
advanced
software
or
are
working
with
university
researchers
and
technology
companies
on
algorithms
to
help
them
spot
crime
trends
it
s
akin
to
predicting
where
an
earthquake
s
aftershocks
will
be
felt
says
a
santa
clara
university
mathematician
developing
formulas
for
such
police
work
as
for
hughes
prediction
of
where
the
minneapolis
robber
would
strike
next
it
was
made
using
free
software
distributed
by
the
national
institute
of
justice
the
software
examines
the
location
and
timing
of
each
crime
to
draw
its
conclusions
the
estimate
of
the
robber
s
next
target
turned
out
to
be
a
mile
off
but
in
the
world
of
crime
prediction
that
s
still
counted
as
a
success
the
kind
of
information
that
could
put
a
patrol
car
close
to
the
action
hughes
who
hopes
the
minneapolis
department
will
eventually
use
more
high
powered
software
for
predictive
policing
said
that
his
maps
have
accurately
predicted
the
locations
of
percent
of
the
city
s
violent
crime
i
have
a
better
batting
average
than
joe
mauer
hughes
said
stocking
pop
tarts
to
better
understand
predictive
policing
consider
the
pop
tarts
story
businesses
such
as
wal
mart
have
long
anticipated
customers
needs
based
on
weather
and
time
of
year
coastal
stores
knew
that
as
hurricanes
approached
customers
stocked
up
on
bottled
water
and
duct
tape
those
things
made
sense
but
looking
more
closely
at
customer
data
and
comparing
it
to
weather
patterns
analysts
at
wal
mart
noticed
that
customers
anticipating
a
hurricane
also
bought
more
strawberry
pop
tarts
it
s
the
sort
of
anecdote
that
the
emerging
industry
of
predictive
policing
embraces
because
it
shows
how
analyzing
data
can
turn
up
surprises
things
that
can
be
used
to
predict
future
behavior
the
promise
of
doing
the
same
thing
with
crime
has
prompted
some
large
police
departments
such
as
los
angeles
to
invest
in
partnerships
with
university
researchers
to
devise
predictive
algorithms
or
formulas
as
exotic
as
it
sounds
it
s
just
the
next
step
in
the
changing
world
of
police
work
said
william
bratton
the
celebrated
former
chief
of
police
in
los
angeles
and
new
york
city
it
s
really
the
continuation
of
the
evolution
of
policing
bratton
said
starting
in
the
s
when
police
began
using
crime
reports
to
identify
hot
spots
the
focus
has
been
on
putting
police
officers
near
high
crime
areas
putting
laptops
in
squad
cars
and
publishing
crime
maps
helped
shorten
response
time
now
police
departments
can
quickly
analyze
a
lot
of
crime
data
to
spot
crime
trends
as
they
re
occurring
so
after
two
or
three
incidents
we
can
put
a
stop
to
it
instead
of
waiting
for
or
said
bratton
who
now
works
as
an
independent
security
consultant
this
is
potentially
labor
saving
he
said
that
s
very
important
because
as
we
re
going
into
very
tough
times
with
public
financing
it
s
going
to
become
more
and
more
critical
the
hope
is
that
predictive
policing
will
help
supplant
random
patrolling
which
studies
have
shown
doesn
t
work
well
it
s
not
enough
to
send
people
out
and
expect
that
they
will
have
an
impact
on
crime
said
chuck
wexler
executive
director
of
the
police
executive
research
forum
in
washington
narrowing
the
field
minneapolis
police
estimate
that
half
of
the
city
s
most
serious
crime
takes
place
on
percent
of
its
land
area
many
of
the
worst
areas
are
under
video
surveillance
as
the
city
expands
its
use
of
closed
circuit
cameras
but
even
within
those
high
crime
areas
there
might
be
a
few
blocks
that
are
particularly
rough
on
any
given
week
said
sgt
jeff
egge
the
head
of
the
department
s
crime
analysis
unit
his
staff
of
five
analysts
make
predictions
by
printing
color
coded
maps
that
show
blocks
or
small
sectors
where
they
expect
crimes
such
as
burglary
robbery
and
aggravated
assaults
the
techniques
are
less
effective
for
episodic
crimes
such
as
homicide
which
are
more
random
the
strategy
adds
a
predictive
element
to
the
department
s
codefor
program
begun
in
to
map
the
city
s
crime
hot
spots
when
we
started
codefor
we
looked
at
where
crime
occurred
last
week
said
deputy
chief
rob
allen
what
we
ve
asked
people
to
do
is
to
focus
more
on
where
we
anticipate
crime
is
going
to
occur
next
week
we
ve
made
it
sort
of
future
oriented
rather
than
assuming
the
same
patterns
will
continue
it
s
had
its
successes
police
say
last
october
two
felons
walked
into
the
dunn
brothers
coffee
shop
in
uptown
pistol
whipped
one
of
the
two
clerks
tied
them
up
in
a
back
room
and
took
a
bag
of
cash
witnesses
called
police
arrived
in
time
to
catch
the
robbers
the
two
now
face
federal
charges
due
to
their
criminal
histories
fifth
precinct
inspector
ed
frizell
said
it
was
no
coincidence
that
officers
arrived
so
quickly
fifth
precinct
officers
were
looking
out
for
storefront
robberies
along
lake
street
as
part
of
the
precinct
s
predictive
analysis
the
officers
of
the
fifth
precinct
have
absolutely
made
this
thing
work
frizell
said
they
have
total
buy
in
frizell
said
he
knows
the
color
coded
maps
issued
by
the
crime
analysis
unit
are
taken
seriously
by
his
patrol
officers
because
he
sees
them
taking
notes
off
of
fresh
maps
hung
in
the
precinct
it
s
easier
than
handing
an
officer
a
stack
of
the
latest
intelligence
said
lt
jeff
rugel
who
runs
the
gang
enforcement
team
out
of
the
department
s
new
strategic
information
center
a
commander
issuing
orders
can
say
see
where
it
s
red
go
be
where
it
s
red
rugel
said
it
makes
it
very
easy
to
see
what
s
going
on
as
opposed
to
charts
and
charts
of
data
it
can
be
tough
to
gauge
the
success
of
predictive
policing
because
analysts
don
t
know
whether
added
police
presence
at
predicted
hot
spots
deters
the
predicted
crime
you
can
t
measure
things
that
don
t
happen
said
capt
amelia
huffman
commander
of
the
criminal
investigations
division
if
a
prediction
helps
police
catch
someone
doing
a
lot
of
crimes
the
effect
on
local
crime
rates
can
be
remarkable
for
example
said
huffman
if
a
prolific
burglar
is
captured
burglary
dots
on
the
weekly
crime
maps
will
melt
away
plain
common
sense
sometimes
predictive
policing
looks
a
lot
more
like
common
sense
than
science
fiction
said
egge
who
gave
the
example
of
how
his
unit
analyzed
years
of
data
on
burglaries
that
occurred
each
year
during
the
week
the
university
of
minnesota
started

laptops
gps
units
ipods
and
other
expensive
items
are
often
left
in

many
are
stolen
this
past
fall
crime
analysts
hughes

susan
mcphee
came
up
with
maps
of
the
dinkytown
area
that
highlighted
the
spots

historically
have
the
most

during

then
crime
prevention
specialists
warned
students
in
that
area
to
use
caution
while
officers
kept
an
eye
on
the
worst
spots
crimes
were
down

police
said
last

chief
dolan
spoke
at

will
grow

it

solving

the
police
in
santa
cruz
california
are
giving
predictive
policing
deploying
officers
in
places
where
crimes
have
been
projected
as
likely
to
occur
in
the
future
a
test
run
full
text
the
arrests
were
routine
two
women
were
taken
into
custody
after
they
were
discovered
peering
into
cars
in
a
downtown
parking
garage
in
santa
cruz
california
one
woman
was
found
to
have
outstanding
warrants
the
other
was
carrying
illegal
drugs
but
the
presence
of
the
police
officers
in
the
garage
that
friday
afternoon
in
july
was
anything
but
ordinary
they
had
been
directed
to
it
by
a
computer
program
that
had
predicted
that
car
burglaries
were
especially
likely
there
that
day
the
program
is
part
of
an
unusual
experiment
by
the
santa
cruz
police
department
in
predictive
policing
deploying
officers
in
places
where
the
computer
projects
crimes
are
likely
to
occur
in
the
future
in
july
santa
cruz
began
testing
the
prediction
method
for
property
crimes
like
car
and
home
burglaries
and
car
thefts
so
far
said
zach
friend
the
police
department
s
crime
analyst
the
program
has
helped
officers
pre
empt
several
crimes
and
has
led
to
five
arrests
the
notion
of
predictive
policing
is
attracting
increasing
attention
from
law
enforcement
agencies
around
the
united
states
as
departments
struggle
to
fight
crime
at
a
time
when
budgets
are
being
slashed
we
re
facing
a
situation
where
we
have
percent
more
calls
for
service
but
percent
less
staff
than
in
the
year
and
that
is
going
to
continue
to
be
our
reality
mr
friend
said
so
we
have
to
deploy
our
resources
in
a
more
effective
way
and
we
thought
this
model
would
help
efforts
to
systematically
anticipate
when
and
where
crimes
will
occur
are
being
tried
out
in
several
cities
the
chicago
police
department
for
example
created
a
predictive
analytics
unit
last
year
but
santa
cruz
s
method
is
more
sophisticated
than
most
based
on
models
for
predicting
aftershocks
from
earthquakes
it
generates
projections
about
which
areas
and
windows
of
time
are
at
highest
risk
for
future
crimes
by
analyzing
and
detecting
patterns
in
years
of
past
crime
data
the
projections
are
recalibrated
daily
as
new
crimes
occur
and
updated
data
is
fed
into
the
program
on
the
day
the
women
were
arrested
for
example
the
program
identified
the
approximately
one
square
block
area
where
the
parking
garage
was
as
one
of
the
highest
risk
locations
for
car
burglaries
in
contrast
compstat
and
other
crime
tracking
systems
in
use
in
many
cities
are
calibrated
less
frequently
rely
more
on
humans
to
recognize
patterns
and
allocate
resources
based
on
past
crimes
rather
than
predicted
future
offenses
the
program
used
in
santa
cruz
was
developed
by
a
group
of
researchers
including
two
mathematicians
george
mohler
and
martin
short
an
anthropologist
p
jeffrey
brantingham
and
a
criminologist
george
e
tita
in
a
project
that
used
data
provided
by
the
los
angeles
police
department
which
is
hoping
to
begin
using
the
program
later
this
year
we
re
watching
closely
what
is
going
on
in
santa
cruz
said
capt
sean
malinowski
of
the
los
angeles
department
s
foothill
patrol
division
who
worked
with
the
researchers
when
he
was
head
of
the
department
s
crime
center
under
the
police
chief
at
the
time
william
j
bratton
captain
malinowski
envisions
a
time
when
the
police
would
issue
crime
forecasts
the
same
way
the
national
weather
service
issues
storm
alerts
it
would
certainly
be
safer
for
everyone
and
more
effective
he
said
postulating
you
re
having
a
rash
of
shootings
and
the
computer
says
it
s
going
to
continue
in
these
places
and
on
these
days
of
the
week
he
added
now
if
we
have
a
problem
we
throw
a
lot
of
cops
at
it
and
unfortunately
with
the
economy
being
the
way
it
is
we
don
t
have
as
many
cops
available
the
compstat
system
captain
malinowski
said
was
a
big
advance
for
policing
but
the
use
of
computer
programs
takes
prediction
to
the
next
level
with
compstat
and
other
similar
approaches
we
look
at
these
maps
and
they
re
as
accurate
as
we
can
get
them
he
said
but
i
m
looking
at
a
map
from
last
week
and
the
whole
assumption
is
that
next
week
is
like
last
week
the
computer
eliminates
the
bias
that
people
have
for
the
santa
cruz
trial
eight
years
of
crime
data
were
fed
into
the
computer
program
which
breaks
santa
cruz
into
squares
of
approximately
feet
by
feet
or
meters
by
meters
new
data
are
added
each
day
officers
are
given
a
list
of
the
highest
probability
hot
spots
of
the
day
at
roll
call
they
check
those
areas
during
times
that
they
are
not
out
on
service
calls
before
the
program
started
they
made
such
pass
through
checks
based
on
hunches
or
experience
of
where
crimes
were
likely
to
occur
mr
friend
said
that
the
reaction
to
the
prediction
method
among
officers
had
been
quite
positive
the
feedback
i
ve
received
is
that
there
is
appreciation
that
it
has
validated
intuition
or
provided
a
new
focus
area
that
wasn
t
known
he
said
how
accurate
the
program
really
is
has
yet
to
be
demonstrated
its
success
will
be
evaluated
after
six
months
the
worst
case
scenario
is
that
it
doesn
t
work
and
we
re
no
worse
off
said
mr
friend
who
had
enlisted
mr
mohler
a
professor
at
santa
clara
university
mr
friend
said
the
early
indications
were
encouraging
burglaries
were
down
percent
in
july
compared
with
july
suggesting
that
the
carefully
directed
policing
may
have
a
deterrent
effect
he
said
in
los
angeles
captain
malinowski
said
the
police
department
hopes
to
expand
the
program
to
include
some
violent
crimes
like
gang
shootings
predicting
crime
with
computer
programs
is
in
some
ways
a
natural
outgrowth
of
the
technology
that
companies
like
wal
mart
now
use
routinely
to
predict
the
buying
habits
of
customers
said
scott
dickson
a
crime
analyst
for
the
police
department
in
killeen
texas
who
discussed
the
santa
cruz
experiment
on
his
blog
law
enforcement
agencies
mr
dickson
noted
have
great
warehouses
of
data
that
can
be
used
to
feed
predictive
programs
and
in
the
end
he
said
it
s
cheaper
to
prevent
a
crime
than
to
solve
a
crime
and
that
s
where
i
think
the
promise
lies

but
what

said
zach

we
re
focused

said
friend
who
was
instrumental
in
bringing

friend
first
read
about

program
being
worked
on
by

george
mohler
in
the
los

times
last
year
and
decided
to
approach
mohler
about
implementing
it
in
santa
cruz
mohler
developed
the
program
with
a
team
of
ucla
researchers
using
an
earthquake
aftershock
model
to
determine
where
future
crimes
will
occur
initially
using
data
from
the
los
angeles
police
department
it
s
similar
to
the
predictability
of
an
aftershock
after
an
earthquake
in
that
the
model
predicts
that
there
will
be
so
called
after
crimes
following
an
initial
crime
friend
and
santa
cruz
police
leaders
met
with
mohler
and
provided
him
with
crime
data
from
with
a
focus
on
property
crimes
the
department
became
the
first
in
the
nation
to
use
the
predictive
program
which
it
implemented
in
july
and
since
then
it
has
already
resulted
in
a
decrease
in
the
targeted
crime
types
which
includes
burglaries
and
motor
vehicle
thefts
in
january
the
police
department
will
work
with
the
researchers
to
do
a
full
analysis
of
the
program
after
the
first
six
months
of
implementation
other
police
departments
are
also
looking
into
implementing
the
program
which
lapd
has
started
testing
in
one
of
its
divisions
friend
and
lt
bernie
escalante
visited
lapd
earlier
this
week
to
speak
to
members
of
the
division
which
is
three
times
the
size
of
the
entire
santa
cruz
police
department
about
using
the
program
and
how
its
worked
in
santa
cruz
the
program
can
also
help
ease
the
pain
of
departments
dealing
with
shrinking
staffing
due
to
budget
cuts
a
matter
of
increasing
importance
given
the

said
the

out

friend
said
if
the

you

then
they

and
updated
data
is
fed
into
the
program
on
the
day
the
women
were
arrested
for
example
the
program
identified
the
approximately
one
square
block
area
where
the
parking
garage
is
situated
as
one
of
the
highest
risk
locations
for
car
burglaries
in
contrast
compstat
and
other
crime
tracking
systems
in
use
in
many
cities
are
calibrated
less
frequently
rely
more
on
humans
to
recognize
patterns
and
allocate
resources
based
on
past
crimes
rather
than
predicted
future
offenses
the
program
was
developed
by
a
group
of
researchers
including
two
mathematicians
george
mohler
and
martin
short
an
anthropologist
jeff
brantingham
and
a
criminologist
george
tita
in
a
project
that
used
data
provided
by
the
los
angeles
police
department
which
is
hoping
to
begin
using
the
program
later
this
year
we
re
watching
closely
what
is
going
on
in
santa
cruz
said
capt
sean
malinowski
of
the
los
angeles
department
s
foothill
patrol
division
who
worked
with
the
researchers
when
he
was
head
of
the
department
s
crime
center
under
the
police
chief
at
the
time
william
j
bratton
captain
malinowski
envisions
a
time
when
the
police
will
issue
crime
forecasts
the
same
way
the
weather
service
issues
storm
alerts
it
would
certainly
be
safer
for
everyone
and
more
effective
he
said
adding
that
the
forecast
might
say
you
re
having
a
rash
of
shootings
and
the
computer
says
it
s
going
to
continue
in
these
places
and
on
these
days
of
the
week
he
added
now
if
we
have
a
problem
we
throw
a
lot
of
cops
at
it
and
unfortunately
with
the
economy
being
the
way
it
is
we
don
t
have
as
many
cops
available
the
compstat
system
captain
malinowski
said
was
a
big
advance
for
policing
but
the
use
of
computer
programs
takes
prediction
to
the
next
level
with
compstat
and
other
similar
approaches
we
look
at
these
maps
and
they
re
as
accurate
as
we
can
get
them
he
said
but
i
m
looking
at
a
map
from
last
week
and
the
whole
assumption
is
that
next
week
is
like
last
week
the
computer
eliminates
the
bias
that
people
have
for
the
santa
cruz
trial
eight
years
of
crime
data
were
fed
into
the
computer
program
which
breaks
santa
cruz
into
squares
of
approximately
feet
by
feet
new
data
is
added
each
day
officers
are
given
a
list
of
the
highest
probability
hot
spots
of
the
day
at
roll
call
they
check
those
areas
during
times
that
they
are
not
out
on
service
calls
before
the
program
started
they
made
such
pass
through
checks
based
on
hunches
or
experience
of
where
crimes
were
likely
to
occur
mr
friend
said
that
the
reaction
to
the
prediction
method
among
officers
had
been
quite
positive
the
feedback
i
ve
received
is
that
there
is
appreciation
that
it
has
validated
intuition
or
provided
a
new
focus
area
that
wasn
t
known
he
said
how
accurate
the
program
really
is
has
yet
to
be
demonstrated
its
success
will
be
evaluated
after
six
months
the
worst
case
scenario
is
that
it
doesn
t
work
and
we
re
no
worse
off
said
mr
friend
who
enlisted
dr
mohler
a
professor
at
santa
clara
university
mr
friend
said
the
early
indications
were
encouraging
burglaries
were
down
percent
in
july
compared
with
july
suggesting
that
the
targeted
policing
may
have
a
deterrent
effect
he
said
in
los
angeles
captain
malinowski
said
the
police
department
hopes
to
expand
the
program
to
include
some
violent
crimes
like
gang
shootings
predicting
crime
with
computer
programs
is
in
some
ways
a
natural
outgrowth
of
the
technology
that
companies
like
wal
mart
now
use
routinely
to
predict
the
buying
habits
of
customers
said
scott
dickson
a
crime
analyst
for
the
police
department
in
killeen
tex
who
discussed
the
santa
cruz
experiment
on
his
blog
law
enforcement
agencies
mr
dickson
noted
have
great
warehouses
of
data
that
can
be
used
to
feed
predictive
programs
and
in
the
end
he
said
it
s
cheaper
to
prevent
a
crime
than
to
solve
a
crime
and
that
s
where
i
think
the
promise
lies

santa
cruz
police
are
poised
to
be
the
first
in
the
nation
to
use
a
new
statistical
model
to
predict
crime
and
try
to
prevent
it
police
recently
submitted
eight
years
of
crime
reports
to
an
applied
mathematics
professor
at
santa
clara
university
and
he
is
mapping
the
time
location
and
recurrence
of
crimes
to
help
police
predict
crime
and
tailor
their
patrols
it
s
an
emerging
national
movement
called
predictive
policing
i
think
the
more
you
put
police
in
areas
where
there
is
more
crime
the
more
efficiently
you
re
policing
the
city
said
george
mohler
the
santa
clara
university
professor
doing
the
research
mohler
said
the
goal
is
not
to
arrest
more
people
but
rather
to
have
an
officer
patrolling
a
neighborhood
so
that
a
car
burglary
for
example
doesn
t
happen
in
the
first
place
zach
friend
a
crime
analyst
for
the
santa
cruz
police
department
said
he
approached
mohler
about
the
project
after
reading
news
reports
about
predictive
policing
in
the
fall
in
november
friend
and
santa
cruz
police
leaders
met
with
mohler
and
gave
him
data
from
to
as
well
as
the
city
s
data
this
week
the
data
focused
on
property
crimes
including
the
time
date
and
location
of
home
burglaries
vehicle
burglaries
and
stolen
vehicles
the
overall
model
is
based
on
the
belief
that
crime
is
not
random
so
with
enough
data
points
you
could
predict
where
and
when
it
will
happen
friend
said
mohler
added
we
don
t
view
criminals
as
deviants
it
s
people
who
see
an
opportunity
and
take
advantage
of
it
if
a
person
sees
a
laptop
computer
in
a
parked
car
for
example
and
a
police
officer
is
driving
by
at
the
same
time
the
thief
backs
off
the
crime
is
prevented
the
person
is
not
arrested
and
the
police
are
more
efficient
on
patrol
mohler
earned
a
doctorate
at
ucla
where
he
crunched
numbers
with
crime
data
from
the
los
angeles
and
long
beach
police
departments
he
expects
to
return
his
results
to
santa
cruz
police
in
the
coming
months
and
police
will
decide
how
to
change
patrol
locations
and
times
within
officers
usual
shifts
the
changes
will
start
in
february
at
the
soonest
police
said
we
re
the
only
police
agency
in
the
country
doing
it
friend
said
santa
cruz
police
now
use
maps
of
reported
crime
crime
statistics
neighborhood
complaints
and
old
fashioned
officer
intuition
to
combat
crime
in
the
new
system
police
anticipate
that
officers
will
receive
instructions
in
their
roll
call
meetings
before
each
shift
to
talk
about
places
and
times
to
perform
extra
checks
friend
said
supervisors
also
might
discuss
predicted
spikes
in
crime
mohler
a
year
old
assistant
professor
said
he
is
doing
the
work
at
no
charge
he
said
he
wants
to
build
his
repertoire
of
published
research
mohler
said
burglars
who
successfully
steal
from
a
home
or
car
often
return
there
because
they
knew
it
worked
no
one
was
at
a
home
when
it
was
broken
into
at
p
m
for
instance
and
burglars
often
use
that
knowledge
to
return
or
break
in
to
another
house
in
the
neighborhood
in
santa
cruz
mohler
has
found
that
repeat
car
and
home
burglaries
tend
to
happen
four
days
after
a
crime
in
los
angeles
and
long
beach
he
said
the
recurrence
takes
seven
to
eight
days
mohler
said
it
s
unclear
why
but
mohler
said
that
kind
of
data
could
help
police
whether
a
person
returns
four
days
later
or
six
days
later
might
not
be
intuitive

has

only
long
enough
to

s
very
promising
in

officers
have

he
adds
before

city
will
be
able

but
more
important
for
now
is
what
mohler

has
to

to
every
school
kid
struggling
with
math
and
wondering
what
possible
use
there
could

this
number
crunching
in
a
valley
of
curious

mohler
shows
just
where
those
minds
can
lead
us
this
all
started
for
him
at
uc
santa
barbara
when
he
was
tinkering
with
computer
programs
that
might
help
those
working
with
plastics
and
other

create
better

it
was
a
heady
mix
of

a
little
math
humor
there
then
onto
ucla
his
stop
before
santa

where
he
joined
a
team
studying
crime
patterns
in
los

mohler
started
noodling
around
with
notions
of
how
to
spot
patterns
in
seemingly
random
events
you
know
like
earthquakes
and
bingo
what
happens
when
a
sizable
earthquake
hits
an
area
aftershocks
and
it
turns
out
that
when
one
house
on
a
street
is
burglarized
it
s
not
unusual
for
nearby
houses
or
even
the
same
house
to
be
hit
later
it
seems
burglars
like
most
of
us
hate
long
commutes
they
prefer
to
strike
near
home
which
is
one
reason
for
follow
on
crime
in
a

neighborhood
mohler
says
you
can
see
it
he
says
of
the
crime
data
he
s
crunched
especially
property
crimes
mohler
began
searching
for
studies
covering
earthquake
prediction
models
which
have
been
around
for
years
google
is
an
invaluable
tool
love
those
algorithms
he
read
and
pondered
and
sought
help
from
fellow

he
determined
that
the

prediction
could
be
tweaked

mohler

couldn
