introduction
police
in
major
metropolitan
areas
now
use
predictive
policing
technologies
to
identify
and
deter
crime
n
based
on
algorithmic
forecasts
from
past
crime
patterns
and
individual
criminal
risk
factors
police
claim
to
be
able
to
identify
places
and
persons
more
likely
to
be
involved
in
criminal
activity
n
this
data
driven
approach
impacts
police
patrols
investigations
and
public
health
like
strategies
to
disrupt
and
monitor
forecasted
criminal
activity
n
the
early
success
of
predictive
policing
has
led
a
few
prosecutors
offices
to
adopt
quasi
predictive
prosecution
strategies
n
predictive
prosecution
involves
identifying
and
targeting
suspects
deemed
more
at
risk
for
future
serious
criminal
activity
and
then
using
that
information
to
shape
bail
requests
charging
decisions
and
sentencing
arguments
n
the
potential
problem
however
is
that
the
data
used
to
inform
predictive
prosecution
strategies
may
be
subject
to
the
same
vulnerabilities
currently
limiting
predictive
policing
n
data
can
be
bad
biased
or
based
on
erroneous
correlations
n
data
driven
justice
challenges
values
of
transparency
accountability
and
autonomy
n
and
while
these
problems
matter
when
it
comes
to
questions
of
where
to
send
a
patrol
car
or
even
whom
to
investigate
they
matter
much
more
when
data
directly
impacts
a
prosecutor
s
decision
about
individual
liberty
fortunately
prosecutors
more
so
than
police
may
have
the
institutional
capacity
and
power
to
ensure
an
equitable
and
accountable
use
of
predictive
technologies
prosecutors
due
to
their
ethic
to
do
justice
n
may
be
in
a
better
position
to
ensure
that
issues
of
accuracy
transparency
validity
error
and
exculpatory
information
are
addressed
before
widespread
adoption
prosecutors
may
be
able
to
capitalize
on
the
innovation
of
predictive
analytics
and
promote
stronger
accountability
mechanisms
that
could
benefit
the
entire
criminal
justice
system
n
this
essay
sets
out
the
preliminary
questions
that
prosecutors
should
ask
before
adopting
any
type
of
quasi
predictive
prosecution
system
part
i
provides
a
brief
overview
of
the
growth
of
predictive
policing
and
its
evolution
into
predictive
prosecution
while
still
an
experimental
concept
certain
predictive
policing
techniques
rely
on
prosecutorial
involvement
and
action
primary
attention
will
focus
on
two
examples
of
predictive
policing
prosecution
in
chicago
illinois
and
manhattan
in
new
york
n
the
chicago
police
department
in
conjunction
with
sociologists
computer
scientists
and
social
workers
has
developed
innovative
strategies
to
identify
individuals
most
likely
to
be
victims
of
gun
violence
or
perpetrators
of
gun
violence
n
once
identified
public
health
like
intervention
strategies
are
used
to
contact
and
monitor
those
targeted
suspects
n
prosecutors
warn
targeted
suspects
of
potential
consequences
of
future
criminal
action
and
then
enforce
those
warnings
through
enhanced
bail
charging
and
sentencing
decisions
n
in
new
york
city
manhattan
district
attorney
cyrus
vance
jr
created
the
crime
strategies
unit
to
link
and
organize
previously
disparate
prosecutorial
databases
into
a
central
nervous
system
n
of
information
about
suspected
criminal
actors
n
under
this
moneyball
prosecution
system
police
and
prosecutors
have
targeted
approximately
nine
thousand
suspects
for
investigation
and
prosecution
n
similar
to
the
chicago
model
prosecutors
shape
bail
charging
and
sentencing
decisions
based
on
the
information
provided
n
part
ii
looks
at
the
promise
and
perils
of
predictive
prosecution
this
part
examines
three
big
questions
about
how
predictive
prosecution
might
impact
prosecutorial
decision
making
prosecutorial
role
and
crime
suppression
priorities
from
one
angle
predictive
prosecution
merely
strengthens
the
type
of
predictions
and
risk
assessments
already
employed
across
the
criminal
justice
system
but
with
more
extensive
information
sharing
capabilities
n
from
another
angle
predictive
prosecution
might
be
seen
as
a
repackaging
of
the
longstanding
focused
deterrence
theories
used
in
some
jurisdictions
n
however
whether
revolutionary
or
merely
evolutionary
a
risk
assessment
public
health
model
of
prosecution
may
have
unintended
consequences
if
sentencing
decisions
are
ratcheted
up
because
a
suspect
was
placed
on
a
target
list
then
prosecutors
better
be
sure
that
the
list
is
an
accurate
and
valid
basis
for
a
sentencing
enhancement
correlation
should
not
replace
causation
when
it
comes
to
actual
liberty
deprivations
further
if
police
officers
link
their
databases
with
prosecutors
offices
then
prosecutors
must
take
ownership
of
the
quality
and
accuracy
of
that
information
this
part
also
looks
at
the
legal
obligations
of
prosecutors
relying
on
predictive
systems
while
generally
consistent
with
ethical
duties
and
within
the
broad
grant
of
prosecutorial
discretion
data
driven
predictions
should
not
be
undertaken
without
internal
accountability
mechanisms
to
ensure
the
accuracy
and
validity
of
the
predictions
in
addition
the
growing
web
of
shared
information
may
create
brady
obligations
for
prosecutors
to
turn
over
collectively
available
exculpatory
information
n
part
iii
concludes
by
suggesting
that
prosecutors
may
be
in
the
best
position
to
create
mechanisms
to
ensure
accountability
transparency
and
validity
consistent
with
due
process
and
the
fair
administration
of
justice
satisfactory
answers
to
the
questions
raised
in
part
ii
will
be
the
first
step
in
evaluating
the
usefulness
of
predictive
prosecution
nationally
this
essay
seeks
to
raise
preliminary
questions
about
predictive
prosecution
saving
for
a
future
day
any
empirical
assessment
of
its
costs
benefits
and
promise
in
practice
i
the
influence
of
predictive
policing
on
predictive
prosecution
predictive
prosecution
is
an
outgrowth
of
the
reported
success
of
predictive
policing
n
predictive
policing
involves
the
use
of
data
collection
and
analysis
to
predict
areas
of
crime
and
individuals
involved
in
crime
n
the
generic
term
predictive
policing
encompasses
a
variety
of
different
techniques
proprietary
products
and
tactical
uses
n
predictive
policing
technologies
are
shaping
police
strategies
in
a
diverse
list
of
places
including
major
cities
like
los
angeles
new
york
city
chicago
philadelphia
miami
seattle
kansas
city
and
memphis
and
smaller
cities
like
reading
pennsylvania
and
alhambra
california
n
the
federal
government
has
funded
pilot
programs
n
and
large
and
small
companies
are
competing
for
city
contracts
n
this
section
briefly
details
the
history
of
predictive
policing
with
a
focus
on
why
the
purported
success
of
the
technology
might
be
appealing
to
prosecutors
in
three
previous
articles
i
have
described
the
full
history
of
predictive
policing
n
this
section
merely
sets
the
stage
for
a
discussion
of
how
predictive
policing
might
impact
predictive
prosecution
a
a
brief
history
of
place
based
predictive
policing
the
national
emergence
of
predictive
policing
can
be
traced
to
chief
william
bratton
s
appointment
as
chief
of
police
of
the
los
angeles
police
department
lapd
n
while
the
idea
had
been
percolating
before
that
moment
n
bratton
promoted
the
idea
in
public
forums
and
national
media
appearances
n
bratton
had
been
a
long
time
believer
in
data
driven
policing
having
restructured
the
new
york
police
department
based
on
data
driven
accountability
metrics
n
he
brought
his
faith
in
data
driven
policing
to
the
west
coast
and
eventually
partnered
with
a
group
of
academics
who
had
developed
algorithms
to
predict
future
crimes
n
the
algorithmic
approach
to
crime
prediction
was
based
on
decades
of
social
science
research
showing
that
certain
property
crimes
encouraged
similar
crimes
in
a
predictable
manner
n
a
burglary
in
one
neighborhood
might
encourage
additional
burglaries
in
that
same
neighborhood
n
an
auto
theft
at
a
particular
time
in
one
area
might
suggest
future
thefts
in
the
same
area
n
the
reasons
for
such
a
near
repeat
phenomenon
n
or
boost
theory
n
have
been
debated
but
the
correlation
of
additional
crime
around
the
same
area
has
been
regularly
demonstrated
n
building
off
this
insight
and
adding
lessons
learned
from
environmental
criminology
n
hotspot
policing
n
and
crime
mapping
n
academic
researchers
developed
place
based
predictive
software
to
predict
certain
property
crimes
n
in
practice
police
officers
might
be
told
to
focus
attention
on
particular
geographic
areas
usually
block
sized
five
hundred
by
five
hundred
foot
areas
and
told
to
patrol
those
designated
areas
during
the
free
times
in
their
shifts
n
the
areas
would
change
daily
depending
on
crime
data
n
the
presence
of
additional
police
in
targeted
areas
was
meant
to
deter
criminal
activity
n
initial
results
showed
a
reduction
in
property
crime
although
longer
term
trends
remain
unclear
n
criticisms
have
also
been
leveled
that
certain
crime
reduction
claims
cannot
be
substantiated
n
these
initial
pilot
projects
eventually
developed
into
a
commercial
business
to
sell
the
predictive
software
the
company
predpol
began
marketing
its
services
to
local
police
forces
n
santa
cruz
california
became
an
early
adopter
and
demonstrated
impressive
initial
results
n
national
press
about
predictive
policing
fueled
interest
from
other
cities
n
and
predpol
soon
boasted
a
national
roster
of
large
and
mid
size
cities
as
customers
n
other
companies
and
technologies
joined
the
quest
to
be
able
to
predict
place
based
property
crime
and
then
violent
crime
n
researchers
at
rutgers
camden
developed
risk
terrain
modeling
rtm
n
which
looks
at
environmental
factors
such
as
bars
liquor
stores
bus
routes
and
other
urban
fixtures
to
map
crime
n
in
a
recent
national
study
rtm
demonstrated
significant
crime
reduction
across
several
jurisdictions
n
hunchlab
combines
the
crime
data
focus
of
predpol
and
the
environmental
focus
of
rtm
and
has
developed
its
own
proprietary
software
for
prediction
based
on
machine
learning
technologies
n
currently
more
than
half
a
dozen
predictive
policing
companies
including
large
corporations
like
ibm
hitachi
and
motorola
are
competing
for
business
n
these
first
predictive
technologies
have
different
names
and
different
theories
but
share
five
commonalities
the
technology
involves
crime
data
time
location
an
algorithm
and
a
theory
about
why
a
particular
area
has
a
heightened
likelihood
of
criminal
activity
n
place
based
algorithms
have
been
used
to
target
property
crimes
and
violent
crimes
n
many
questions
still
remain
about
the
application
effectiveness
and
promise
of
the
technology
but
as
commissioner
bratton
stated
in
predictive
policing
used
to
be
the
future
and
now
it
is
the
present
n
b
the
development
of
person
based
prediction
person
based
approaches
to
crime
arose
independently
of
predictive
policing
at
least
as
defined
by
predpol
rtm
or
hunchlab
and
were
largely
based
on
a
public
health
model
of
targeting
crime
n
for
decades
sociologists
identified
the
reality
that
a
small
subset
of
individuals
in
any
community
committed
the
vast
majority
of
crimes
n
police
recognized
that
targeting
those
individuals
could
result
in
a
disproportionate
reduction
of
crime
rates
n
for
violent
crimes
researchers
studied
shooting
victims
and
by
tracking
their
social
networks
could
identify
likely
future
victims
or
criminal
actors
n
the
theory
behind
this
approach
was
that
most
shootings
involve
a
social
network
of
retaliation
between
rival
groups
such
as
gangs
neighborhood
crews
and
drug
dealers
who
respond
in
relatively
predictable
ways
n
a
shooting
of
a
gang
member
would
lead
to
a
retaliatory
act
that
act
in
turn
would
continue
the
cycle
of
violence
professor
david
kennedy
demonstrated
that
by
targeting
youth
violence
through
a
public
health
model
police
could
dramatically
curtail
shootings
n
andrew
papachristos
anthony
braga
and
david
hureau
investigated
similar
social
network
intervention
strategies
between
rival
gangs
n
other
scholars
have
investigated
this
same
social
network
phenomenon
n
despite
arising
from
a
different
context
the
social
network
model
has
largely
been
subsumed
into
the
greater
predictive
policing
discussion
because
media
stories
described
person
based
predictive
techniques
under
the
larger
rubric
of
predictive
policing
and
because
police
administrators
benefited
from
the
good
will
i
e
good
press
of
predictive
policing
n
this
essay
continues
that
blurring
of
predictive
methodologies
but
it
recognizes
that
person
based
prediction
presents
different
issues
than
place
based
prediction
in
terms
of
liberty
autonomy
and
due
process
the
best
known
person
based
predictive
policing
system
involves
the
chicago
police
department
the
chicago
police
department
developed
a
data
driven
process
to
identify
the
most
likely
offenders
of
violent
crime
n
entitled
the
heat
list
the
concept
is
to
identify
young
people
who
might
engage
in
violence
or
be
victims
of
violence
and
intervene
before
the
violence
occurs
n
this
identification
is
conducted
by
police
officers
called
district
intelligence
officers
who
evaluate
past
criminal
activity
whether
the
target
has
been
identified
as
part
of
a
gang
audit
n
and
whether
the
target
has
been
placed
on
the
strategic
subjects
list
ssl
n
an
official
chicago
police
department
special
order
s
describes
the
ssl
the
strategic
subjects
list
ssl
is
a
rank
order
list
of
potential
victims
and
subjects
with
the
greatest
propensity
for
violence
the
ssl
model
looks
at
individuals
with
criminal
records
who
are
ranked
according
to
their
probability
of
being
involved
in
a
shooting
or
murder
either
as
a
victim
or
an
offender
known
as
a
party
to
violence
ptv
the
software
is
generated
based
on
empirical
data
that
lists
attributes
of
a
person
s
criminal
record
including
the
record
of
violence
among
criminal
associates
the
degree
to
which
his
criminal
activities
are
on
the
rise
and
the
types
of
intensity
of
criminal
history
n
once
identified
and
placed
on
the
heat
list
a
team
of
police
officers
social
workers
and
community
leaders
conduct
a
custom
notification
which
involves
a
face

meeting
and
the
delivery
of
a
custom
notification
letter

this
letter
details
the
individual
s
prior
contacts
with
the
criminal
justice
system
as
well
as
potential
future
consequences
for
any
continued
criminal
activity
n
these
custom
notification
meetings
usually
involve
home
visits
n
essentially
the
young
person
is
offered
a
choice
take
advantage
of
social
services
to
prevent
involvement
in
future
violence
or
face
additional
law
enforcement
surveillance
and
perhaps
punitive
consequences
n
currently
the
chicago
police
department
includes
over
names
on
its
heat
list
n
this
suspect
and
social
network
focused
approach
to
policing
has
under
different
names
and
different
programs
been
adopted
in
kansas
city
boston
new
orleans
los
angeles
and
other
cities
n
juvenile
courts
have
also
begun
to
consider
implementing
similar
identification
processes
for
troubled
youth
n
the
open
question
however
is
how
the
algorithm
scores
the
criminal
record
connections
with
associates
and
intensity
of
criminal
history
among
other
considerations
with
few
exceptions
the
types
of
identification
mechanisms
have
not
been
validated
through
scientific
methods
n
c
early
predictive
prosecution
models
the
efficacy
of
predictive
policing
remains
both
alluring
and
unproven
significant
research
studies
have
yet
to
be
conducted
in
any
systemic
way
n
questions
remain
as
crime
rates
have
fluctuated
in
cities
using
the
technologies
n
yet
despite
the
unknowns
prosecutor
offices
have
embraced
the
insight
that
predictive
analytics
and
information
sharing
can
identify
risk
factors
in
a
community
and
improve
the
prosecutorial
function
n
the
same
broad
tactical
shift
toward
proactive
law
enforcement
has
thus
begun
influencing
proactive
prosecutorial
strategies
as
the
former
head
of
the
manhattan
criminal
strategies
unit
stated
the
change
is
as
much
one
of
philosophy
as
technology
n
the
goal
is
to
focus
on
crime
not
cases
intelligence
driven
prosecutions
seek
to
take
already
existing
information
in
prosecution
offices
organize
it
manage
it
and
deploy
it
to
target
those
most
at
risk
of
driving
crime
in
a
community
n
while
still
in
the
very
early
stages
two
distinct
predictive
prosecution
models
have
been
developed
here
i
describe
them
as
the
enforcer
model
and
the
investigator
model
neither
to
be
clear
involves
pure
algorithmic
or
machine
predictions
just
as
predictive
policing
is
more
of
a
risk
identification
tool
than
a
predictive
guess
so
too
predictive
prosecution
seeks
to
proactively
identify
risk
factors
areas
and
suspects
in
a
community
and
direct
attention
to
those
problems
predictive
prosecution
involves
data
driven
information
sharing
innovations
but
not
pure
algorithmic
judgments
about
places
or
people
as
will
be
discussed
some
blending
of
predictive
policing
techniques
and
predictive
prosecution
techniques
may
occur
in
the
future
but
currently
the
prosecution
side
has
relied
on
more
human
rather
than
algorithmic
predictions
enforcer
model
the
enforcer
model
arises
from
person
based
predictive
policing
strategies
in
this
model
prosecutors
play
a
role
of
enforcing
warnings
made
to
those
predicted
to
be
involved
in
criminal
activity
especially
violence
in
some
cases
this
prosecutorial
enforcement
might
be
indirect
but
in
other
cases
the
prosecutors
might
directly
and
personally
provide
verbal
notice
of
harsher
enforcement
penalties
for
example
the
special
order
detailing
the
process
of
custom
notification
in
chicago
makes
explicit
reference
to
prosecutorial
involvement
n
the
special
order
provides
that
when
someone
identified
on
the
heat
list
is
rearrested
the
police
will
recommend
the
highest
possible
charges
to
prosecutors
encourage
community
advocacy
against
bond
release
and
engage
in
direct
coordination
with
state
prosecutors
offices
n
section
v
d
reads
in
full
when
a
recipient
of
the
custom
notification
engages
in
criminal
activity
for
which
he
or
she
is
arrested
the
district
commander
will
ensure
notification
to
and
coordination
with
the
appropriate
bureau
of
detectives
area
to
ensure
appropriate
charging
occurs
the
highest
possible
charges
will
be
pursued
for
any
individual
in
the
vrs
custom
notification
program
court
advocacy
volunteers
are
notified
of
the
date
time
and
place
of
the
bond
hearing
or
other
court
hearings
and
encourage
attendance
at
the
hearing
to
demonstrate
the
community
s
support
in
decreasing
the
violence
coordination
with
the
cook
county
s
state
s
attorney
community
justice
center
unit
as
appropriate
n
prosecutors
are
thus
directly
influenced
by
a
suspect
s
placement
on
the
heat
list
the
custom
notification
letters
themselves
include
a
description
of
both
federal
and
state
sentencing
options
n
demonstrating
how
prosecutorial
decisions
will
be
impacted
by
this
designation
in
fact
in
the
definitions
section
the
custom
notification
letter
is
defined
as
an
information
tool
to
make
suspects
aware
of
enhanced
prosecution
possibilities
the
custom
notification
letter
will
be
used
to
inform
individuals
of
the
arrest
prosecution
and
sentencing
consequences
they
may
face
if
they
choose
to
or
continue
to
engage
in
public
violence
the
letter
will
be
specific
to
the
identified
individual
and
incorporate
those
factors
known
about
the
individual
inclusive
of
prior
arrests
impact
of
known
associates
and
potential
sentencing
outcomes
for
future
criminal
acts
n
the
procedures
and
policy
behind
custom
notification
thus
encourage
prosecutors
to
follow
through
on
the
charging
bond
and
sentencing
warnings
provided
in
the
custom
notification
letters
prosecutors
play
a
more
direct
enforcer
role
in
other
gang
violence
reduction
strategies
n
one
strategy
that
has
been
adopted
by
law
enforcement
is
called
focused
deterrence
n
focused
deterrence
involves
a
targeted
message
to
a
small
percentage
of
the
population
that
prosecutors
police
and
community
members
know
who
is
engaged
in
violence
and
that
they
are
committed
to
stopping
it
n
for
example
chicago
has
developed
a
broad
gang
violence
reduction
strategy
that
identifies
gang
members
through
gang
audits
and
the
ssl
n
identified
targets
are
then
invited
to
call
in
meetings
with
prosecutors
police
and
community
members
for
example
if
a
young
man
is
identified
through
a
gang
audit
the
ssl
or
some
other
targeting
measure
n
and
asked
to
participate
in
a
community
forum
it
is
not
uncommon
for
a
prosecutor
to
be
present
n
these
call
in
meetings
serve
as
a
scared
straight
warning
for
individuals
placed
on
the
heat
list
n
the
prosecutor
symbolically
and
sometimes
literally
describes
the
consequences
for
failing
to
heed
the
warning
to
stay
away
from
crime
as
described
by
andrew
papachristos
and
david
kirk
a
federal
partner
typically
from
the
u
s
attorney
s
office
explains
how
federal
statutes
might
be
leveraged
against
the
faction
including
continued
criminal
enterprise
and
armed
career
criminal
statutes
the
point
of
this
message
stresses
the
deterrent
aspect
of
the
program
representatives
from
local
police
and
prosecutors
provide
examples
of
recent
cases
and
shootings
to
underscore
the
reach
of
the
current
violence
and
how
they
are
working
in
a
coordinated
fashion
with
others
in
the
room
n
the
message
is
made
clear
by
prosecutors
if
you
violate
the
law
again
you
will
be
punished
harder
because
you
have
been
warned
one
u
s
attorney
referenced
a
fifteen
year
sentence
for
a
single
bullet
for
someone
who
had
not
heeded
the
warnings
n
the
point
was
made
clear
that
those
predicted
to
be
at
higher
risk
for
crime
had
better
turn
their
lives
around
or
face
additional
sanction
by
prosecuting
authorities
n
as
described
above
prosecutors
as
enforcers
for
predictive
policing
techniques
remain
in
a
fairly
typical
prosecutorial
role
with
one
exception
the
enforcement
threats
are
influenced
by
predictive
data
clearly
prosecutors
have
long
held
community
meetings
prosecutors
have
long
held
scared
straight
talks
in
community
forums
n
prosecutors
have
long
stood
arm
in
arm
with
police
to
send
a
message
that
criminality
will
not
be
tolerated
the
difference
here
is
that
the
targets
of
the
community
forum
and
thus
the
subjects
of
harsher
punishment
were
originally
identified
by
predictive
policing
techniques
and
other
data
driven
mechanisms
if
those
algorithmic
or
social
network
correlations
are
in
error
then
the
subsequent
harsher
punishment
may
be
unjustified
evidence
is
very
clear
that
arrest
records
are
filled
with
mistakes
n
similar
problems
exist
with
gang
databases
n
and
offender
registries
n
if
those
heat
lists
are
found
to
be
flawed
then
not
only
police
surveillance
but
prosecutorial
judgment
becomes
distorted
the
chicago
tribune
interviewed
a
young
man
robert
mcdaniel
whose
name
appeared
on
the
heat
list
because
a
friend
of
his
had
been
shot
n
mr
mcdaniel
s
prior
record
consisted
of
a
single
misdemeanor
conviction
and
a
few
minor
arrests
n
but
by
being
placed
on
the
list
mr
mcdaniel
was
now
associated
with
the
worst
of
the
worst
an
enhanced
sentence
predicated
in
part
on
a
connection
to
a
heat
list
that
later
turns
out
to
be
unwarranted
would
be
a
real
unfairness
to
someone
like
mr
mcdaniel
if
the
prosecutor
does
not
take
on
an
independent
duty
to
double
check
the
data
then
the
harm
from
such
a
prediction
could
be
significant
n
prosecutors
who
are
enforcing
predictive
policing
or
social
network
models
depend
on
the
accuracy
of
those
models
for
guidance
as
will
be
discussed
in
part
ii
this
enforcement
role
offers
benefits
and
risks
in
its
real
world
application
investigator
model
the
investigator
model
of
predictive
prosecution
involves
a
more
organic
prosecutor
led
information
sharing
system
such
a
system
like
the
crime
strategies
units
being
developed
in
manhattan
san
francisco
philadelphia
and
baton
rouge
n
is
data
driven
and
targets
identifiable
criminal
actors
n
these
systems
are
not
based
on
algorithmic
judgments
but
on
data
of
actual
crime
patterns
in
a
city
n
using
data
prosecutors
identify
geographic
areas
of
concern
based
on
reported
shootings
thefts
or
particular
types
of
crime
n
suspects
are
identified
as
being
engaged
in
violence
or
gang
activity
based
on
past
criminal
activity
n
these
individuals
are
monitored
through
social
media
and
traditional
law
enforcement
surveillance
n
the
predicted
targets
are
then
prosecuted
using
available
prosecutorial
leverage
to
extract
enhanced
pleas
or
sentences
from
those
identified
n
in
general
this
type
of
intelligence
driven
prosecution
involves
five
modifications
from
the
traditional
police
prosecutor
relationship
first
prosecutors
identify
geographical
areas
of
concern
based
on
reported
crime
patterns
in
a
city
n
the
focus
is
again
on
crime
not
cases
meaning
even
unsolved
crimes
also
capture
the
attention
of
prosecutors
second
prosecutors
identify
individuals
who
are
considered
the
crime
drivers
in
a
community
and
include
them
in
an
arrest
alert
system
n
these
individuals
become
the
primary
targets
of
prosecution
under
the
theory
that
by
removing
these
violent
actors
overall
violence
levels
will
fall
n
as
will
be
discussed
the
arrest
alert
system
triggers
heightened
attention
for
a
prosecutor
to
incapacitate
these
predicted
bad
actors
through
existing
legal
mechanisms
third
less
traditional
data
points
enter
into
the
calculation
of
whom
to
target
social
media
posts
a
past
lack
of
cooperation
with
police
status
as
a
victim
of
violence
and
other
less
formal
bits
of
information
are
included
in
the
risk
assessments
of
whom
to
target
n
fourth
the
information
sharing
between
police
and
prosecutors
is
prioritized
and
strengthened
n
intelligence
driven
prosecution
is
not
just
about
being
smarter
but
developing
actionable
intelligence
about
crime
patterns
in
an
area
finally
all
of
this
information
about
past
criminal
activities
is
memorialized
in
a
searchable
dataset
for
future
action
n
as
one
example
the
crime
strategies
unit
in
manhattan
has
developed
a
new
information
sharing
system
to
proactively
identify
the
most
wanted
of
new
york
s
criminal
actors
n
these
individuals
have
significant
past
criminal
records
but
the
data
focuses
on
future
criminal
risk
the
logic
being
that
past
instigators
of
criminal
activity
are
at
greater
risk
to
be
the
future
drivers
of
crime
this
database
of
approximately
nine
thousand
names
has
become
critical
to
several
major
prosecutions
n
in
essence
prosecutors
have
predicted
that
incapacitating
these
criminal
actors
will
lead
to
an
overall
reduction
in
crime
as
explained
by
david
o
keefe
the
past
head
of
the
manhattan
district
attorney
s
crime
strategies
unit
csu
working
with
our
partners
in
the
precincts
we
also
identified
hot
spots
and
the
names
of
the
people
committing
the
most
crimes
in
each
area
the
question
became
what
can
we
do
to
incapacitate
these
people
n
this
focus
on
incapacitating
primary
targets
has
significant
practical
effects
on
traditional
prosecution
practices
routinely
now
if
someone
listed
in
the
csu
arrest
alert
system
is
arrested
even
for
a
low
level
offense
the
full
power
of
the
prosecutors
office
is
directed
against
them
n
this
means
that
ordinary
arrests
may
result
in
extraordinary
outcomes
where
those
marked
as
predicted
troublemakers
are
punished
to
the
full
extent
of
the
law
n
the
investigator
model
of
predictive
prosecution
thus
influences
several
aspects
of
the
traditional
prosecution
process
first
the
targeting
system
impacts
bail
decisions
as
prosecutors
might
be
instructed
to
ask
for
higher
bail
for
those
identified
in
the
arrest
alert
system
n
before
the
arrest
occurs
csu
drafts
particularized
bail
applications
on
predicted
individuals
advocating
for
strict
bail
positions
n
second
targeted
individuals
could
face
enhanced
criminal
charges
in
order
to
maximize
prosecutorial
leverage
n
this
means
that
prosecutors
would
be
instructed
to
seek
the
maximum
charges
justified
under
law
n
these
initial
charging
decisions
obviously
impact
later
plea
deals
and
impede
plea
negotiations
as
defendants
face
much
harsher
potential
punishments
n
sentencing
decisions
can
also
be
ratcheted
up
as
prosecutors
seek
to
ensure
the
maximum
penalty
possible
n
maximum
sentences
on
minor
crimes
result
in
extended
incarceration
even
after
convictions
and
sentencing
prosecutors
have
been
known
to
weigh
in
on
parole
decisions
and
requirements
of
release
n
beyond
direct
prosecution
csu
also
impacts
how
uncooperative
witnesses
may
be
handled
n
whereas
in
the
ordinary
course
an
uncooperative
witness
might
enter
and
rapidly
leave
the
criminal
justice
system
on
a
minor
charge
now
prosecutors
will
be
alerted
to
the
witnesses
arrest
and
legal
predicament
n
as
one
of
the
chief
prosecutors
in
manhattan
explained
in
a
news
article
on
the
csu
every
morning
i
talk
to
my
five
a
d
a
s
who
are
experts
in
their
areas
we
decide
whom
we
should
try
to
pull
out
for
a
debriefing
we
pull
people
arrested
on
low
level
misdemeanor
charges
maybe
two
or
three
a
week
we
read
them
their
miranda
rights
about
percent
of
them
will
talk
n
these
debriefings
are
not
unusual
or
unethical
but
the
new
alert
system
makes
the
ability
of
prosecutors
to
locate
witnesses
much
easier
the
simple
truth
is
that
additional
leverage
can
make
initially
uncooperative
witnesses
more
cooperative
n
the
crime
strategies
unit
also
provides
additional
information
about
crime
patterns
and
criminal
activities
in
localized
geographic
areas
n
prosecutors
create
intelligence
reports
on
criminal
hotspots
develop
a
violence
timeline
of
crimes
and
identify
the
primary
violent
actors
gangs
and
community
stakeholders
in
each
location
n
police
have
begun
tracking
social
media
posts
of
some
of
the
targeted
individuals
n
this
social
media
focus
has
proven
quite
valuable
in
mapping
out
the
social
networks
of
gang
activity
in
new
york
n
detectives
and
prosecutors
can
now
visualize
the
social
relationships
of
gangs
and
communities
in
ways
that
explain
and
predict
tension
shootings
or
other
violence
n
threats
on
social
media
can
help
forecast
the
next
shooting
prosecutors
in
collaboration
with
the
police
have
begun
using
traditional
surveillance
techniques
such
as
video
cameras
to
augment
their
monitoring
of
predicted
criminals
n
facial
recognition
software
linked
to
social
media
has
led
to
the
identification
of
suspects
and
witnesses
n
targets
are
not
only
mapped
by
their
relationships
but
actually
tracked
as
they
go
through
the
criminal
justice
system
from
arrest
through
post
parole
release
n
prosecutors
not
just
police
have
gained
access
to
traditionally
investigative
as
opposed
to
adjudicatory
tools
n
the
result
is
a
new
type
of
prosecutor
police
relationship
that
blurs
traditional
lines
n
prosecutors
are
focusing
on
future
oriented
intelligence
driven
prosecutions
n
police
are
following
suit
as
reported
by
the
new
york
times
the
csu
prosecutorial
data
system
is
intended
to
augment
joint
police
prosecution
investigations
as
part
of
a
template
for
relations
between
the
two
agencies
the
district
attorney
s
office
will
provide
the
police
with
more
than
million
from
drug
forfeiture
cases
to
pay
for
new
technology
that
money
will
go
for
security
cameras
fiber
optic
information
systems
and
hand
held
tablets
that
will
feed
police
officers
data
about
suspects
mr
bratton
said
the
police
department
in
turn
will
provide
the
district
attorney
s
crime
strategies
unit
access
to
more
of
the
data
it
collects
not
only
on
reported
crimes
but
also
on
suspects
mr
bratton
said
he
called
the
new
approach
extreme
collaboration
and
illustrated
it
by
clasping
his
hands
together
n
this
process
signifies
a
realignment
to
a
more
proactive
method
of
prosecution
n
and
one
that
encourages
what
commissioner
bratton
called
a
seamless
web
of
information
between
prosecutors
and
the
police
n
before
moving
on
to
discuss
the
future
of
predictive
prosecution
it
must
be
made
clear
that
much
of
what
is
being
proposed
is
not
fundamentally
all
that
new
police
and
prosecutors
have
long
kept
detailed
dossiers
on
potential
suspects
n
as
wayne
logan
and
i
have
written
about
our
current
data
driven
criminal
justice
system
has
roots
in
th
century
innovations
n
data
in
the
form
of
arrest
logs
arrest
warrants
offender
registries
biometrics
and
a
host
of
court
and
community
supervision
records
has
long
been
available
to
police
n
further
police
have
recognized
the
need
to
identify
and
target
potential
bad
apples
since
before
there
were
police
forces
n
this
information
has
regularly
been
shared
with
prosecutors
who
have
built
similarly
extensive
investigative
files
on
potential
offenders
n
predictive
prosecution
is
merely
an
innovative
way
to
identify
and
predict
likely
targets
through
the
use
of
better
data
sharing
technologies
nevertheless
the
impact
of
predictive
analytics
and
social
network
technology
on
law
enforcement
and
prosecution
is
real
and
needs
to
be
examined
predictive
policing
has
gained
a
foothold
in
police
administration
predictive
prosecution
is
only
a
few
years
behind
and
so
the
promise
and
perils
need
to
be
addressed
as
the
technology
and
methodologies
develop
the
next
section
looks
at
three
big
questions
facing
predictive
prosecution
ii
preliminary
questions
about
predictive
prosecution
predictive
prosecution
holds
real
promise
for
prosecutors
offices
seeking
to
focus
resources
on
those
individuals
thought
to
present
the
greatest
risk
to
society
by
prioritizing
those
identified
to
be
most
at
risk
prosecutors
at
least
in
theory
can
utilize
existing
discretionary
power
in
a
manner
that
is
more
efficient
proactive
cheaper
and
smarter
as
this
is
a
symposium
devoted
to
implementing
de
incarceration
strategies
policies
and
practices
to
reduce
crime
and
mass
incarceration
such
an
innovation
deserves
a
serious
look
at
the
same
time
hard
questions
must
be
asked
of
this
new
method
of
prosecution
what
are
the
impacts
distortions
or
concerns
this
section
examines
three
big
questions
surrounding
predictive
prosecution
first
how
does
predictive
prosecution
impact
prosecutorial
decision
making
second
how
does
predictive
prosecution
impact
prosecutorial
role
and
third
how
will
predictive
prosecution
impact
crime
suppression
strategies
due
to
the
constraints
of
the
symposium
essay
format
the
ideas
discussed
are
initial
impressions
not
full
explorations
of
complex
and
important
topics
a
predictive
prosecution
and
prosecutorial
decision
making
predictive
prosecution
offers
potential
benefits
in
terms
of
prioritization
efficiency
and
more
informed
judgments
prosecutors
must
make
difficult
decisions
every
day
and
more
information
might
provide
for
better
choices
in
today
s
legal
system
prosecutors
possess
almost
unlimited
discretion
n
prosecutors
decide
whom
to
prosecute
n
prosecutors
decide
how
to
charge
and
how
to
structure
plea
bargains
n
and
prosecutors
decide
recommendations
for
sentences
n
adding
information
from
sources
such
as
the
predictive
policing
heat
list
or
organically
developed
intelligence
does
not
present
any
direct
ethical
or
constitutional
concerns
n
if
used
to
identify
and
proactively
target
actual
crime
drivers
in
a
community
a
predictive
prosecution
system
could
well
provide
an
overall
benefit
to
society
if
resources
could
be
redirected
toward
incapacitating
more
serious
offenders
through
bail
charging
and
sentencing
decisions
while
concomitantly
incapacitating
fewer
less
serious
offenders
such
a
process
could
mean
fewer
overall
people
in
jail
such
a
system
might
also
be
more
efficient
redirecting
scarce
prosecution
resources
of
course
the
current
system
of
mass
incarceration
that
has
developed
over
the
last
several
decades
has
not
lacked
for
efficiencies
in
prosecuting
and
convicting
defendants
n
mandatory
minimums
harsh
drug
sentences
plea
bargains
and
other
processing
efficiencies
have
created
an
overly
efficient
process
for
incarcerating
millions
of
people
n
but
the
web
of
people
caught
up
in
this
system
has
been
overbroad
lacking
a
commitment
to
prioritize
those
most
dangerous
to
society
n
millions
of
nonviolent
offenders
millions
of
misdemeanants
and
millions
of
low
level
figures
in
the
drug
world
are
serving
significant
time
in
jail
n
individually
those
persons
might
not
be
the
chosen
targets
of
our
criminal
justice
resources
but
systemically
prosecutors
have
had
few
mechanisms
to
evaluate
or
rank
relative
danger
or
risk
to
society
n
predictive
prosecution
offers
a
potential
smart
on
crime
counterweight
to
the
tough
on
crime
practices
of
over
incarceration
in
fact
taken
one
step
further
if
prosecutors
only
sought
to
target
those
predicted
to
be
of
high
risk
of
committing
crime
then
a
huge
majority
of
people
would
see
reduced
bail
better
pleas
and
more
lenient
sentencing
such
prioritization
might
significantly
reduce
pretrial
detention
costs
long
term
sentencing
costs
and
overall
criminal
justice
costs
the
danger
of
course
is
that
predictive
prosecution
might
not
reduce
prosecution
levels
but
might
in
fact
bring
more
people
into
the
criminal
justice
system
two
obvious
concerns
arise
within
the
enforcer
model
first
in
the
enforcer
model
individuals
are
being
linked
to
criminal
activity
by
proxies
for
criminal
activity
a
gang
member
who
has
a
friend
who
was
shot
may
be
added
to
the
system
because
statistically
the
associates
of
dead
gang
members
are
more
likely
to
themselves
be
involved
in
gun
violence
n
the
two
degrees
of
separation
analysis
may
both
be
accurate
n
and
yet
overbroad
when
it
comes
to
prosecutorial
decisions
the
particular
individual
might
not
have
done
anything
but
be
a
victim
of
violence
or
might
remain
a
small
time
criminal
actor
further
that
particular
individual
might
be
summoned
to
a
call
in
by
a
prosecutor
and
threatened
that
he
may
face
harsher
detention
charging
and
sentencing
decisions
should
he
get
in
trouble
in
the
future
so
that
individual
is
in
the
first
instance
added
to
a
prosecution
list
without
criminal
activity
of
his
own
and
in
the
second
instance
faced
with
the
potential
for
a
harsher
criminal
justice
outcome
because
of
that
designation
similarly
in
the
investigative
model
individuals
are
being
targeted
because
they
have
been
identified
as
the
primary
targets
for
removal
n
the
key
of
course
is
the
process
by
which
people
are
targeted
if
limited
to
only
those
individuals
with
multiple
convictions
for
violence
this
incapacitation
approach
can
be
defended
using
minor
crimes
to
incapacitate
major
criminal
actors
is
aggressive
but
defensible
however
if
other
factors
such
as
a
lack
of
cooperation
with
police
suspected
but
unproven
violence
or
low
level
non
violent
crimes
become
the
justification
for
being
a
target
then
justification
for
aggressive
incapacitation
weakens
using
minor
crimes
to
incapacitate
minor
criminal
actors
undercuts
the
value
of
targeting
only
the
serious
offenders
put
another
way
because
the
targeting
mechanism
of
identifying
the
primary
targets
rests
with
the
prosecution
in
collaboration
with
police
and
because
there
is
no
system
to
challenge
or
correct
a
targeting
error
a
risk
arises
about
the
data
populating
this
system
prosecutorial
decision
making
runs
a
real
risk
of
being
infected
by
bad
data
in
these
systems
n
personal
bias
could
influence
who
becomes
a
target
political
or
economic
pressure
could
shape
the
types
of
crimes
addressed
even
more

any
data

also
be
overwhelming
with
little
practical
or

checks
on

n
yet
every
day
police
and
prosecutors
collect
more
data
on
individuals
and
systems
are
being
designed
to
become
more
reliant
on
this
data
collection

in

i
have
laid
out
the
concern
of
data

exist

cannot
be
minimized

this

is
used
to
determine
human
liberty
if
prosecutors
discretionary
power
involving
bail
charging
and
sentencing
is
informed
by
erroneous
or
merely
poorly
correlated
data
then
real
injustice
could
occur
the
issue
is
not
that

cannot
rely
on

their
existing
professional
and
ethical
mandate

they

b
predictive
prosecution
and
prosecutorial
role
predictive
prosecution
may
alter
the
prosecutor
s
role
a
predictive
prosecution
focus
redirects
power
away
from
a
reactive
model
of
prosecution
driven
by
police
arrests
to
a
more
proactive
model
of
prosecution
as
csu
chief
david
o
keefe
stated
it
used
to
be
we
only
went
where
the
cases
took
us
now
we
can
build
cases
around
specific
crime
problems
that
communities
are
grappling
with
n
while
many
cities
have
experimented
with
community
policing
strategies
for
years
n
and
certain
grand
jury
investigations
have
been
quite
proactive
traditionally
the
majority
of
state
criminal
cases
come
to
prosecutors
from
police
arrests
and
victim
complaints
n
at
least
in
one
version
of
the
prosecutorial
role
prosecutors
take
the
facts
and
cases
as
they
come
to
them
the
investigator
model
of
predictive
prosecution
potentially
alters
that
reality
by
broadening
the
aperture
of
prosecutorial
responsibility
to
focus
on
predictive
targeting
the
role
of
the
prosecutor
shifts
as
an
example
of
how
traditional
prosecution
practice
might
change
new
york
city
has
a
longstanding
problem
of
drugs
and
violence
in
certain
apartment
complexes
n
for
years
patrol
officers
dutifully
arrested
drug
sellers
and
buyers
and
reactively
responded
to
violent
incidents
n
the
arrests
came
from
police
observations
and
investigation
n
over
the
last
few
decades
thousands
of
individual
criminal
actors
in
those
complexes
have
been
arrested
and
prosecuted
n
in
contrast
the
crime
strategies
unit
decision
to
proactively
target
and
indict
members
of
rival
gangs
all
in
one
sweep
presents
a
change
in
strategy
and
role
n
the
case
was
driven
and
directed
by
the
district
attorney
s
office
n
it
sent
a
message
of
prosecutorial
involvement
in
rooting
out
crime
as
well
a
message
of
prosecutorial
understanding
of
the
structural
nature
of
the
crime
problem
in
local
areas
in
terms
of
the
power
to
control
criminal
suppression
in
a
city
the
predictive
prosecution
model
shifts
the
identification
of
problem
areas
from
the
street
cops
to
the
lawyers
prosecutors
get
to
decide
using
all
of
their
discretion
data
and
other
tools
who
to
investigate
before
an
actual
precipitating
crime
occurs
prosecutors
get
to
decide
to
target
an
individual
for
incapacitation
and
use
the
tools
of
bail
charging
and
sentencing
to
do
it
police
execute
these
decisions
but
the
power
lies
with
the
prosecutors
office
in
the
first
instance
n
while
such
large
scale
prosecutorial
investigations
are
not
unusual
in
federal
court
or
against
large
scale
criminal
enterprises
n
predictive
prosecution
of
street
crime
might
well
shift
the
balance
of
power
away
from
police
to
prosecutors
and
even
to
smaller
units
within
those
prosecution
offices
beyond
street
crimes
a
move
to
proactive
prosecution
might
also
shape
the
types
of
crimes
pursued
by
prosecutors
it
is
not
accidental
that
most
state
criminal
courts
are
filled
with
lower
level
crimes
that
police
can
personally
observe
n
drug
sales
prostitution
theft
disorderly
conduct
and
assault
are
all
far
more
observable
than
domestic
violence
white
collar
fraud
or
sexual
assault
n
as
a
result
prosecution
resources
are
devoted
toward
reactive
policing
not
proactive
policing
n
a
shift
toward
predictive
prosecution
might
change
that
dynamic
with
prosecutors
taking
the
lead
to
prioritize
different
types
of
criminal
wrongdoing
prosecutors
can
choose
to
focus
more
attention
on
violence
rather
than
drug
possession
n
or
to
target
human
trafficking
more
than
drug
trafficking
n
at
the
same
time
this
new
role
threatens
a
longstanding
source
of
legitimacy
prosecutors
have
traditionally
been
expected
to
be
neutral
arbiters
in
the
pursuit
of
justice
n
as
professor
bruce
green
and
fred
zacharias
have
written
this
neutrality
connotes
independence
from
the
police
n
prosecutors
have
remained
independent
from
police
investigations
in
order
to
better
evaluate
the
constitutionality
legality
and
moral
worth
of
the
prosecution
n
much
of
the
judicial
deference
given
to
prosecutorial
discretion
depends
on
this
objective
evaluation
of
whether
the
case
should
go
forward
n
prosecutors
after
all
routinely
refuse
to
go
forward
with
cases
brought
to
them
by
police
n
the
investigator
model
of
predictive
prosecution
blurs
this
neutrality
as
information
sharing
strategy
and
even
execution
of
investigations
becomes
more
prosecutor
driven
while
prosecutors
can
still
be
objective
about
the
evidence
recovered
they
may
be
less
neutral
in
their
role
if
they
planned
and
implemented
the
collection
of
that
evidence
they
might
be
tempted
to
engage
in
the
competitive
enterprise
of
ferreting
out
crime
n
and
thus
lose
a
measure
of
objectivity
prosecutors
might
be
tempted
to
bring
weak
cases
simply
to
incapacitate
an
individual
identified
as
a
primary
target
even
though
in
every
other
situation
that
same
case
would
not
be
prosecuted
charges
might
be
ratcheted
up
from
a
misdemeanor
to
a
felony
not
because
the
facts
warrant
the
increase
but
because
the
individual
has
been
targeted
for
incapacitation
perhaps
just
as
damaging
the
image
of
prosecutor
will
be
tarnished
even
if
there
is
no
actual
difference
in
practice
or
outcome
n
this
is
not
to
say
that
prosecutors
have
not
led
significant
high
profile
prosecutorial
driven
investigations
for
many
years
but
they
would
now
have
a
different
role
for
low
level
street
crime
involving
repeated
thefts
non
homicide
shootings
and
drug
dealing
the
enforcer
model
of
predictive
policing
presents
a
slightly
different
distortion
of
role
as
enforcers
prosecutors
become
more
dependent
on
the
police
data
that
created
the
predictive
targets
if
the
algorithm
that
creates
the
heat
list
or
the
information
that
guides
the
gang
audit
is
wrong
then
the
accompanying
prosecutorial
judgments
about
whether
to
enforce
the
threats
may
also
be
wrong
in
some
ways
this
reduces
the
role
of
prosecutors
in
the
system
at
the
expense
of
the
data
collectors
at
the
police
department
one
can
imagine
that
in
high
volume
jurisdictions
with
aggressive
predictive
policing
models
prosecutors
will
not
be
in
a
position
to
judge
the
accuracy
or
reliability
of
the
person
focused
predictions
in
an
ideal
world
prosecutors
would
want
to
know
who
was
attending
the
call
in
meeting
and
the
appropriateness
of
their
official
threats
to
not
violate
the
law
in
practice
such
knowledge
might
be
improbable
to
expect
prosecutors
already
have
too
many
cases
and
responsibilities
n
and
adding
additional
responsibilities
to
understand
why
certain
people
were
summoned
to
a
call
in
meeting
may
not
be
feasible
as
enforcers
prosecutors
will
likely
simply
defer
to
the
police
driven
prediction
and
hope
that
the
sorting
mechanism
is
accurate
the
blurring
of
lines
also
has
an
impact
on
the
prosecutor
s
responsibility
to
provide
exculpatory
information
to
defendants
the
requirements
of
brady
disclosure
include
information
known
to
the
prosecutor
and
the
police
n
in
ordinary
cases
this
would
include
information
known
to
the
prosecutor
through
the
prosecutor
s
investigation
and
the
relevant
police
documents
or
witnesses
n
but
in
a
world
of
extreme
collaboration
and
within
a
seamless
web
of
shared
databases
those
pieces
of
information
become
far
more
interconnected
n
prosecutors
arguably
are
responsible
for
every
fact
listed
in
the
shared
searchable
database
almost
by
definition
intelligence
driven
policing
generates
more
scattered
bits
of
intelligence
about
the
players
involved
in
criminal
activity
nicknames
gang
affiliations
shared
addresses
and
cooperators
with
interlinked
crimes
suspects
and
witnesses
the
prosecution
s
data
systems
will
likely
have
more
information
that
could
be
exculpatory
to
defendants
for
example
notes
within
the
arrest
alert
system
could
suggest
other
gangs
or
gang
members
who
might
have
a
similar
motive
for
a
violent
act
or
could
include
witness
statements
that
discredit
the
prosecution
s
theory
of
the
case
the
line
prosecutor
may
not
personally
know
any
of
this
information
but
the
information
would
be
available
in
a
searchable
prosecution
controlled
database
is
the
failure
to
reveal
this
searchable
available
information
a
constitutional
violation
the
danger
of
integrated
databases
is
that
all
of
that
information
becomes
collectively
imputable
to
the
prosecutor
s
office
which
in
turn
means
that
the
prosecutor
is
responsible
for
providing
it
to
the
defense
similar
questions
exist
with
shared
surveillance
resources
information
not
directly
under
the
control
of
the
prosecutor
s
office
could
be
plausibly
denied
as
not
in
the
prosecutor
s
constructive
or
actual
possession
a
system
of
extreme
collaboration
undercuts
that
argument
a
prosecutor
who
has
access
to
more
information
because
of
more
efficient
data
sharing
systems
will
be
responsible
for
disclosing
more
because
of
that
collective
knowledge
this
leads
to
an
even
bigger
change
in
role
in
that
prosecutors
may
have
to
become
quasi
intelligence
analysts
in
this
intelligence
driven
system
in
the
traditional
criminal
case
a
prosecutor
is
given
thousands
of
facts
through
witnesses
police
officers
documents
photographs
investigations
and
other
sources
n
the
prosecutor
knows
what
she
is
told
by
police
and
what
the
evidence
shows
but
there
is
no
independent
obligation
or
ability
for
a
prosecutor
to
vet
the
information
n
the
facts
are
usually
collected
after
the
fact
by
police
not
prosecutors
and
with
an
eye
toward
what
can
be
proven
in
court
n
rumors
and
theories
are
useful
as
background
but
prosecutors
are
looking
for
facts
they
can
prove
in
court
a
natural
screening
process
occurs
because
the
rules
of
evidence
burdens
of
proof
and
realities
of
trial
practice
all
create
an
emphasis
on
credible
and
provable
facts
n
with
predictive
prosecution
technologies
the
information
assessment
is
slightly
different
at
the
investigation
stage
as
opposed
to
the
arrest
stage
the
information
is
more
fragmented
facts
that
could
not
be
proven
in
court
are
used
to
establish
the
primary
targets
n
intelligence
tips
are
not
always
provable
in
addition
they
are
not
always
accurate
prosecutors
thus
need
to
establish
systems
akin
to
intelligence
analysts
in
the
intelligence
community
to
vet
the
credibility
and
reliability
of
this
raw
data
in
both
the
national
security
context
and
the
police
context
sources
lie
deceive
err
and
of
course
get
things
right
n
and
only
by
establishing
a
process
to
evaluate
the
data
can
prosecutors
trust
the
data
this
change
may
require
modifications
in
how
prosecutors
offices
process
analyze
vet
and
use
data
which
will
be
discussed
in
part
iii
c
predictive
prosecution
and
crime
suppression
priorities
prosecutors
offices
do
not
just
enforce
criminal
violations
but
also
strategize
about
crime
suppression
n
especially
in
jurisdictions
with
elected
prosecutors
who
must
take
responsibility
for
increased
crime
rates
crime
reduction
is
a
top
priority
n
prosecutorial
control
of
criminal
justice
priorities
strengthens
democratic
accountability
and
connection
n
if
a
community
has
concerns
about
disproportionate
minority
arrests
for
drug
possession
the
normal
and
defensible
traditional
prosecutorial
response
is
that
prosecutors
merely
handle
the
cases
the
police
bring
them
while
they
have
the
power
to
decline
such
prosecutions
they
do
not
have
the
power
to
redirect
police
efforts
to
make
the
arrests
n
predictive
prosecution
changes
that
dynamic
communities
could
well
say
to
prosecutors
that
the
focus
should
not
be
on
drug
crimes
but
instead
gang
crimes
or
homicides
or
whatever
the
community
prioritized
predictive
prosecution
thus
gives
more
power
and
therefore
more
accountability
to
prosecutors
to
align
priorities
with
their
communities
this
reprioritization
can
also
include
a
shift
in
how
to
reduce
crime
while
predictive
prosecution
certainly
maintains
an
emphasis
on
incapacitation
and
threats
of
incarceration
it
is
also
built
upon
a
public
health
approach
to
crime
over
the
last
decade
many
policy
makers
have
been
pushing
a
public
health
approach
to
violence
drug
addiction
and
criminal
activity
n
person
based
predictive
policing
explicitly
adopted
a
public
health
model
of
identifying
risk
factors
in
the
same
way
that
certain
environmental
toxins
increase
the
risk
of
cancer
so
too
do
certain
environmental
factors
increase
the
risk
of
violence
for
youth
n
if
predictive
prosecution
techniques
are
used
to
identify
the
individual
human
risks
as
well
as
the
casualties
of
those
risks
then
certain
public
health
like
interventions
could
be
implemented
these
intervention
strategies
do
not
need
to
involve
police
or
prosecutors
or
the
threat
of
incarceration
in
fact
part
of
the
predictive
policing
model
in
chicago
and
other
cities
expressly
recognizes
that
social
services
and
community
pressure
may
be
more
effective
than
law
enforcement
n
as
just
one
example
the
chicago
vrs
intervention
system
structured
its
call
in
meetings
to
balance
any
law
enforcement
discussion
with
equal
parts
community
involvement
and
social
services
n
the
point
was
to
emphasize
that
the
solutions
to
criminal
activity
could
be
found
through
available
community
and
social
services
resources
n
the
question
of
course
is
whether
this
same
public
health
intervention
strategy
can
work
without
the
stick
of
prosecutorial
enforcement
analytically
the
identification
of
risk
and
the
remediating
of
risk
are
separate
problems
neither
has
to
be
led
by
police
or
prosecutors
but
due
to
practical
political
and
financial
reasons
they
appear
to
be
bound
together
for
the
near
future
predictive
prosecution
because
it
is
a
proactive
approach
can
also
shift
priorities
to
look
at
underlying
environmental
drivers
of
crime
rather
than
simply
responding
to
criminal
activity
predictive
analytics
can
isolate
places
that
attract
criminal
activities
n
environmental
criminologists
have
long
written
about
problematic
hot
spots
n
and
predictive
policing
techniques
are
now
policing
some
of
those
areas
n
but
prosecutors
might
be
able
to
intervene
at
a
more
elevated
political
or
policy
level
prosecutors
might
be
able
to
use
political
capital
to
alter
the
physical
landscape
in
a
community
engage
with
community
stakeholders
or
even
develop
social
services
programs
to
help
individuals
from
the
community
if
for
example
a
particular
area
is
known
for
car
thefts
because
the
environment
of
abandoned
buildings
dark
streets
and
easy
escape
routes
provides
a
tempting
opportunity
for
criminal
activity
then
prosecutors
could
work
with
communities
and
politicians
to
remedy
the
environmental
risks
or
prosecutors
could
as
the
manhattan
district
attorney
s
office
has
done
n
partner
with
community
groups
to
sponsor
youth
sports
and
academic
events
in
troubled
areas
finally
predictive
prosecution
encourages
a
shift
in
looking
at
crime
patterns
from
a
network
perspective
traditional
prosecution
tends
to
focus
on
individuals
we
think
of
crime
as
a
function
of
individual
choice
not
environmental
influences
n
while
many
prosecutors
offices
have
targeted
large
scale
crime
networks
the
majority
of
cases
involve
a
limited
number
of
suspects
targeted
for
particular
completed
crimes
n
predictive
prosecution
has
the
potential
to
shift
the
focus
of
attention
from
individuals
to
networks
and
from
individual
choices
to
social
group
influences
this
shift
is
not
a
wholesale
shift
clearly
predictive
prosecution
seeks
to
identify
specific
individuals
to
be
placed
in
databases
of
targeted
suspects
these
individuals
are
placed
there
because
of
their
choice
to
break
the
law
but
because
of
its
focus
on
gangs
neighborhoods
and
social
media
networks
predictive
prosecution
also
allows
for
broader
understanding
of
criminal
relationships
and
patterns
the
intelligence
of
intelligence
driven
policing
is
to
see
how
the
networks
of
violent
actors
interact
and
then
do
something
to
interrupt
those
cycles
of
violence
as
a
hypothetical
example
prosecutors
may
know
that
one
hundred
young
men
live
in
a
particular
housing
complex
and
ten
of
those
men
are
actively
involved
in
social
media
posts
that
boast
about
violence
criminal
activity
and
lawlessness
seeing
this
group
as
a
network
and
not
ten
individuals
does
several
helpful
things
first
it
allows
for
a
study
of
the
interrelation
between
the
ten
men
some
may
be
instigators
of
violence
some
might
be
followers
and
some
might
be
silent
non
participants
this
might
allow
prosecutors
to
prioritize
within
the
group
about
the
more
dangerous
of
the
group
in
addition
it
allows
prosecutors
to
see
how
the
network
extends
across
neighborhoods
and
generations
prosecutors
can
see
who
else
might
be
connected
to
this
group
and
thus
brought
into
its
ambit
most
criminal
networks
are
bounded
by
geography
and
family
n
so
one
could
almost
predict
who
might
be
the
next
individual
joining
the
group
studying
this
group
to
figure
out
why
certain
individuals
have
not
joined
the
group
might
also
be
valuable
is
it
friendship
finances
some
triggering
event
that
links
the
ten
together
and
doesn
t
include
the
other
ninety
is
there
a
new
group
that
has
arrived
in
an
area
are
there
correlations
that
can
be
drawn
to
explain
why
certain
people
remain
outside
the
network
of
potential
criminality
predictive
prosecution
thus
might
allow
a
study
of
why
certain
networks
form
about
connections
arising
from
neighborhoods
schools
or
environments
while
sociologists
have
been
studying
this
phenomenon
for
a
century
n
and
most
prosecutors
and
police
officers
could
tell
you
about
this
reality
from
experience
a
network
theory
of
criminal
justice
has
not
yet
been
operationalized
in
practice
in
most
prosecutors
offices
iii
principles
for
predictive
prosecution
predictive
technologies
are
not
new
to
the
criminal
justice
system
n
since
the
s
the
lure
of
predictive
insights
has
led
the
criminal
justice
system
to
try
to
forecast
the
future
n
predictors
for
recidivism
n
pretrial
detention
n
sex
offenders
n
juveniles
n
and
a
host
of
actuarial
solutions
have
been
proposed
n
predictive
policing
and
now
predictive
prosecution
fit
that
pattern
for
almost
as
long
as
their
creation
the
critiques
of
these
predictive
technologies
have
identified
the
same
concerns
over
and
over
again
predictive
correlations
become
mistaken
for
causation
n
validation
studies
fail
to
validate
n
analytical
mistakes
infect
the
legitimacy
of
the
conclusions
and
error
small
and
systemic
pervades
all
data
driven
systems
n
the
concept
of
predictive
prosecution
provides
the
same
promise
and
potential
critique
yet
because
of
the
prosecutor
s
special
role
in
the
criminal
justice
system
there
may
be
some
cause
for
optimism
if
designed
carefully
a
predictive
prosecution
system
might
provide
an
accountability
mechanism
to
police
data
error
and
moderate
blind
reliance
on
data
driven
predictions
while
a
full
descriptive
framework
is
beyond
the
scope
of
this
essay
any
predictive
prosecution
system
must
be
built
on
four
related
principles
ownership
accuracy
transparency
and
fairness
these
principles
are
explained
below
with
recognition
that
significant
additional
discussion
and
debate
is
needed
before
the
adoption
of
any
predictive
prosecution
program
first
prosecutors
must
accept
ownership
of
the
data
underlying
predictive
prosecution
systems
if
bail
determinations
charging
decisions
or
sentencing
is
impacted
at
all
by
data
correlations
being
on
the
ssl
list
or
being
identified
as
one
of
the
primary
targets
in
new
york
city
then
that
underlying
data
must
be
trustworthy
enough
to
withstand
scrutiny
of
judges
inquiring
about
the
bases
of
the
lists
or
reasons
for
the
decisions
whether
from
a
predictive
policing
system
or
organically
developed
by
prosecutors
once
used
in
court
prosecutors
must
take
responsibility
for
the
data
n
integrating
police
and
prosecutorial
systems
even
informally
means
that
prosecutors
must
take
on
a
data
management
duty
that
they
previously
did
not
have
to
accept
second
and
relatedly
prosecutors
must
ensure
the
accuracy
of
the
data
in
adopting
theories
of
intelligence
collection
to
augment
traditional
prosecution
roles
prosecutors
should
also
examine
how
intelligence
agencies
test
and
assess
the
data
collected
in
the
national
security
context
thousands
of
intelligence
analysts
work
for
the
united
states
government
because
of
a
healthy
distrust
of
the
raw
intelligence
coming
in
from
sources
n
intricate
internal
systems
exist
to
evaluate
the
reliability
of
data
n
recognizing
that
actionable
data
for
targeting
cannot
be
relied
upon
without
critical
analysis
so
too
with
intelligence
driven
prosecution
prosecutors
must
establish
systems
to
assess
the
value
of
the
data
coming
in
through
community
sources
detectives
social
media
and
other
sources
in
addition
this
push
for
accuracy
means
developing
systems
to
audit
existing
data
collection
systems
including
mechanisms
for
removal
and
alteration
of
bad
or
outdated
data
the
danger
of
a
high
volume
data
collection
enterprise
is
that
it
is
much
easier
to
simply
collect
everything
accurate
or
not
n
going
back
to
correct
errors
involves
time
money
and
technological
sophistication
n
but
without
such
checks
the
data
becomes
unworthy
of
use
in
criminal
courts
direct
connection
to
criminality
not
mere
correlation
should
be
required
when
an
individual
s
liberty
is
being
decided
processes
must
be
created
to
ensure
that
personal
bias
or
corruption
does
not
distort
the
targeting
further
the
data
collection
and
analysis
must
be
scrutinized
for
implicit
or
explicit
bias
n
disproportionate
minority
contacts
high
incarceration
rates
and
harsh
sentencing
have
been
clearly
demonstrated
throughout
the
criminal
justice
system
n
any
data
driven
system
built
on
top
of
that
inequality
will
likely
reify
the
inequality
unless
explicit
steps
are
taken
to
address
the
issue
third
any
data
system
must
be
transparent
n
this
involves
a
two
fold
transparency
both
to
the
prosecutor
using
the
data
and
the
community
legitimizing
the
use
of
the
data
prosecutors
are
lawyers
trained
in
law
not
technology
in
large
offices
the
data
will
be
compiled
by
colleagues
and
assistants
in
systems
of
extreme
collaboration
data
will
also
be
compiled
by
police
so
mechanisms
must
be
created
so
that
prosecutors
can
understand
the
source
of
the
data
prosecutors
need
to
be
able
to
not
only
trust
but
understand
and
defend
the
data
arguments
cannot
be
along
the
lines
of
judge
i
am
asking
for
a
no
bond
bail
determination
because
the
pre
printed
form
told
me
to
ask
for
it
but
because
of
particularized
verifiable
facts
that
can
be
obtained
through
a
data
driven
system
arguments
cannot
be
judge
the
defendant
is
on
the
ssl
so
we
ask
that
he
be
held
but
based
on
the
actual
underlying
facts
that
might
have
led
some
individual
to
be
on
that
list
prosecutorial
transparency
requires
understanding
why
individuals
have
been
chosen
to
be
marked
by
predictive
technologies
this
understanding
may
also
require
knowledge
of
the
provenance
of
the
data
the
currency
of
the
data
and
the
reliability
of
the
data
the
other
aspect
of
transparency
focuses
on
community
acceptance
of
predictive
prosecution
outcomes
the
orwellian
nature
of
government
lists
of
predicted
targets
rightly
causes
suspicion
n
any
predictive
prosecution
system
needs
to
be
able
to
explain
in
a
relatively
open
and
clear
way
how
people
are
placed
on
predictive
lists
and
why
the
criteria
is
legitimate
this
presents
a
challenge
in
that
most
prosecution
or
police
methods
also
need
to
be
relatively
opaque
in
order
to
avoid
undermining
ongoing
investigations
n
this
balance
between
transparency
and
operational
secrecy
presents
real
tensions
but
as
the
creation
of
custom
notification
letters
demonstrate
prosecutors
can
develop
a
process
to
show
and
explain
why
someone
is
targeted
custom
notification
letters
are
customized
and
include
the
target
s
specific
criminal
history
and
risk
factors
n
the
reasons
for
the
targeting
are
thus
particularized
and
individualized
and
open
for
inspection
n
similarly
in
call
ins
prosecutors
can
explain
in
specific
detail
why
the
particular
targets
have
been
contacted
this
process
provides
transparency
and
legitimacy
to
the
process
albeit
after
the
fact
this
type
of
customization
also
needs
to
be
applied
systemically
prosecutors
need
to
be
able
to
explain
why
certain
communities
have
been
targeted
and
how
they
have
attempted
to
avoid
class
or
race
based
impacts
using
crime
mapping
visual
displays
of
historic
criminal
activity
and
other
accessible
media
the
argument
can
be
made
for
why
certain
areas
were
chosen
and
not
others
discriminatory
impacts
need
to
be
monitored
and
studied
communities
may
accept
a
higher
prevalence
of
prosecutorial
interest
in
an
area
but
it
must
be
explained
and
defended
in
a
transparent
manner
finally
predictive
prosecution
systems
must
build
in
mechanisms
to
ensure
fair
process
an
emphasis
on
fairness
must
address
concerns
that
citizens
might
hold
in
being
targeted
by
predictive
techniques
a
process
will
need
to
be
developed
to
challenge
a
target
designation
on
a
police
list
n
a
method
to
account
for
possible
racial
or
class
discrimination
will
need
to
be
created
n
clear
procedures
to
use
and
validate
the
predictive
target
list
needs
to
be
developed
n
and
a
general
emphasis
on
procedural
justice
must
continue
due
to
the
influence
of
some
of
the
academics
who
provided
the
early
inspiration
for
the
chicago
projects
procedural
justice
has
been
a
key
organizing
principle
behind
the
intervention
strategy
but
such
an
emphasis
must
continue
to
be
prioritized
n
an
emphasis
on
fairness
must
include
a
focus
on
other
players
in
the
criminal
justice
system
fairness
includes
procedures
to
address
exculpatory
information
available
in
the
database
and
other
discovery
issues
that
will
necessarily
arise
n
in
an
interconnected
system
owned
and
operated
by
the
prosecutors
offices
brady
material
will
be
stored
in
the
shared
files
disclosure
of
this
shared
information
will
require
a
new
system
because
traditional
case
separations
and
information
barriers
will
no
longer
exist
finally
fairness
includes
the
ability
to
defend
the
data
collection
system
in
a
court
when
challenged
by
defendants
judges
or
internal
accountability
groups
these
fairness
principles
and
concerns
undergird
most
of
the
existing
criminal
justice
system
so
the
demand
should
be
neither
surprising
nor
objectionable
conclusion
predictive
prosecution
exists
in
an
experimental
phase
this
essay
seeks
to
raise
preliminary
questions
about
an
obviously
nascent
experiment
but
the
questions
are
real
and
will
need
to
be
answered
soon
the
hope
of
this
brief
essay
is
to
set
forth
the
possible
impacts
raise
questions
and
plan
for
the

increasing
both
the

the

however
three
significant
obstacles
remain
before
the
criminal
justice
system
can
formally
use
predictive
algorithms
to
help
make
these
determinations
first
we
need
to
ensure
that
neither
the
algorithms
nor
the
data
used
are
based
on
improper
factors
such
as
the
race
of
the
suspect
second
under
fourth
amendment
law
individualized
suspicion
is
an
essential
element
of
reasonable
suspicion
or
probable
cause
this
means
that
either
the
predictive
algorithms
must
be
designed
to
take
individualized
suspicion
into
account
or
the
predictive
algorithms
can
only
be
used
as
one
factor
in
determining
whether
the
legal
standard
has
been
met
forcing
police
and
judges
to
combine
the
algorithms
results
with
individualized
factors
and
finally
the
legal
standards
themselves
must
be
quantified
so
that
police
and
judges
can
use
the
numerical
predictions
of
big
data
in
their
reasonable
suspicion
and
probable
cause
determinations
these
obstacles
are
not
insurmountable
and
if
the
necessary
changes
are
made
the
criminal
justice
system
will
become
far
more
transparent
since
the
factors
the
algorithms
take
into
consideration
will
necessarily
be
reviewable
by
judges
and
the
general
public
alike
furthermore
setting
a
quantified
likelihood
for
reasonable
suspicion
and
probable
cause
will
allow
us
to
engage
in
a
healthy
debate
about
what
those
numbers
ought
to
be
and
it
will

ensure

officers

suspects

criminal

to
grant
a
search
warrant
predict
the
odds
that
contraband
will
be
found
based
on
the
facts
presented
in
a
warrant
application
judges
conducting
bail
hearings
predict
the
chances
that
a
defendant
will
return
to
court
for
trial
and
sentencing
judges
try
to
determine
whether
a
convicted
defendant
is
likely
to
reoffend
if
he
is
given
a
nonincarceration
sentence
since
the
inception
of
our
criminal
justice
system
law
enforcement
officers
and
judges
have
relied
primarily
on
experience
training
intuition
and
common
sense
in
making
their
predictions
n
in
response
courts
have
crafted
broad
standards
to
accommodate
these
subjective
judgments
and
allow
for
flexibility
in
application
for
example
police
officers
may
briefly
detain
an
individual
if
they
reasonably
believe
that
criminal
activity
may
be
afoot
n
while
magistrates
should
issue
a
warrant
if
a
man
of
prudence
and
caution
believes
that
the
offense
has
been
committed
n
the
broad
flexible
nature
of
these
standards
is
no
accident
they
have
been
intentionally
left
imprecise
by
generations
of
courts
one
reason
is
the
nearly
infinite
number
of
different
facts
that
could
arise
in
any
criminal
case
which
make
hard
and
fast
rules
rather
impractical
n
but
the
main
reason
these
rules
have
been
kept
ambiguous
is
that
police
and
courts
have
historically
lacked
the
necessary
tools
to
evaluate
the
accuracy
of
their
predictions
with
any
precision
thus
state
actors
have
been
forced
to
rely
on
their
own
subjective
beliefs
and
anecdotal
evidence
in
making
their
predictions
n
all
of
that
is
now
changing
modern
methods
of
data
collection
and
analysis
commonly
known
as
big
data
are
providing
police
and
judges
with
tools
that
can
predict
future
behavior
with
greater
precision
than
ever
before
n
these
tools
hold
out
the
promise
of
increased
fairness
and
greater
objectivity
at
many
of
the
critical
decision
points
in
our
criminal
justice
system
but
despite
the
potential
of
big
data
tools
three
significant
obstacles
potentially
bar
their
effective
incorporation
into
the
criminal
justice
system
first
we
need
to
ensure
that
the
tools
of
big
data
are
not
hard
wired
to
produce
discriminatory
results
if
the
predictive
algorithms
consider
race
or
religion
as
a
factor
then
using
these
algorithms
to
predict
behavior
is
unacceptable
and
illegal
no
matter
how
much
they
may
increase
accuracy
similarly
if
the
algorithms
themselves
were
developed
based
on
past
discriminatory
practices
we
need
to
develop
new
algorithms
based
on
better
data
second
fourth
amendment
law
mandates
that
decisions
to
stop
or
search
a
suspect
be
based
at
least
in
part
on
individualized
suspicion
because
big
data
involves
processing
large
amounts
of
information
its
algorithms
frequently
generate
predictions
based
on
broad
generalizations
rather
than
specific
conduct
thus
in
their
current
form
these
algorithms
cannot
on
their
own
form
the
basis
for
reasonable
suspicion
or
probable
cause
and
finally
the
current
legal
standards
that
govern
police
officers
and
judges
are
imprecise
and
subjective
courts
have
deliberately
created
them
to
be
imprecise
and
seem
to
have
every
intention
of
keeping
them
that
way
unfortunately
these
nebulous
standards
are
a
poor
fit
for
big
data
s
highly
precise
and
quantitative
tools
these
obstacles
are
not
insurmountable
barriers
big
data
algorithms
can
be
structured
so
that
they
are
truly
race
neutral
and
take
into
account
individualized
conduct
when
making
their
calculations
but
in
order
to
ensure
that
they
meet
these
requirements
the
factors
they
apply
must
be
transparent
to
judges
in
other
words
it
is
not
sufficient
for
reviewing
courts
to
know
that
these
algorithms
are
working
the
courts
must
also
understand
exactly
how
the
methods
work
to
ensure
that
those
methods
meet
the
appropriate
legal
standards
n
and
although
courts
have
historically
been
reluctant
to
attach
specific
numbers
to
the
relevant
legal
standards
there
is
no
doctrinal
barrier
to
doing
so
courts
may
be
more
willing
to
take
this
step
as
they
come
to
realize
that
big
data
offers
highly
precise
and
quantitative
tools
that
can
create
not
only
better
accuracy
but
also
greater
transparency
in
our
criminal
system
this
article
seeks
to
harmonize
the
analytical
world
of
big
data
with
the
legal
world
of
criminal
justice
if
those
who
design
the
big
data
tools
can
ensure
the
transparency
of
their
algorithms
and
databases
not
only
will
these
tools
become
more
palatable
to
the
courts
but
the
transparency
of
these
calculations
will
simultaneously
improve
the
transparency
of
the
criminal
justice
system
moreover
if
courts
embrace
the
use
of
numerically
quantifiable
data
not
only
will
we
achieve
greater
accuracy
in
the
administration
of
justice
but
we
will
also
achieve
greater
clarity
of
the
process

the
challenges

how
these

requiring
heightened
transparency

introducing
quantifiable

n
the
article
concludes
by
positing
that
big
data
tools
if
properly
designed
and
used
can
dramatically
improve
both
the
accuracy
and
transparency
of
our
criminal
justice
system
i
the
promise
of
big
data
increased
accuracy
big
data
is
the
practice
of
accumulating
extraordinarily
large
amounts
of
information
from
a
variety
of
different
sources
and
then
processing
that
information
using
statistical
analysis
n
the
results
of
these
analyses
are
termed
mechanical
predictions
in
contrast
with
subjective
clinical
judgments
which
are
based
on
the
individual
decision
maker
s
past
experience
and
knowledge
n
private
companies
have
been
using
big
data
for
over
a
decade
to
predict
consumer
behavior
retailers
use
it
to
determine
and
change
shopping
habits
n
insurance
companies
rely
on
big
data
to
try
to
identify
the
safest
drivers
and
healthiest
people
in
their
customer
pool
n
banks
and
credit
agencies
use
big
data
to
determine
the
likelihood
that
a
potential
borrower
is
a
credit
risk
n
and
all
sorts
of
companies
buy
and
sell
this
data
to
each
other
seeking
to
mine
it
for
information
about
their
customers
that
they
can
use
for
economic
advantage
n
in
the
criminal
law
context
mechanical
predictions
can
be
used
to
assist
decision
makers
in
making
the
judgment
calls
that
are
integral
to
the
criminal
justice
system
the
extraordinary
promise
of
applying
big
data
to
the
criminal
justice
system
is
based
on
two
aspects
of
these
mechanical
predictions
first
the
underlying
data
is
usually
gathered
from
public
sources
and
therefore
the
use
of
such
data
does
not
constitute
a
search
under
the
fourth
amendment
n
thus
law
enforcement
officers
have
a
significant
amount
of
freedom
in
acquiring
this
information
which
means
that
they
can
obtain
the
predictions
from
big
data
without
needing
to
meet
any
legal
standard
such
as
reasonable
suspicion
or
probable
cause
essentially
big
data
algorithms
can
be
seen
as
a
force
multiplier
allowing
police
to
generate
more
predictive
power
from
the
same
public
information
that
has
always
been
available
to
them
the
second
enticing
aspect
of
big
data
s
mechanical
predictions
is
that
they
are
more
accurate
than
clinical
judgments
studies
have
shown
that
big
data
s
mechanical
predictions
are
on
average
more
accurate
than
clinical
predictions
n
police
officers
and
judges
who
have
adopted
these
methods
have
been
seeing
increased
accuracy
in
many
different
contexts
ranging
from
predicting
where
crime
is
likely
to
occur
to
determining
which
defendants
are
most
likely
to
succeed
if
released
on
parole
n
the
increased
accuracy
offered
by
big
data
will
lead
to
both
greater
efficiency
and
fairness
the
system
will
be
more
efficient
because
police
and
courts
will
be
able
to
focus
their
resources
more
effectively
it
will
be
fairer
because
innocent
people
will
be
less
likely
to
be
stopped
frisked
searched
or
arrested
if
big
data
can
successfully
narrow
the
field
of
legitimate
suspects
big
data
s
predictive
algorithms
could
be
used
in
a
number
of
different
ways
in
the
criminal
justice
system
first
law
enforcement
officers
could
use
these
tools
to
determine
where
crime
is
likely
to
occur
and
to
allocate
their
resources
accordingly
as
we
will
see
in
section
i
a
police
are
already
using
big
data
tools
for
this
purpose
with
notable
success
second
the
results
from
these
predictive
algorithms
could
informally
influence
police
officers
when
they
make
their
clinical
judgments
about
whether
reasonable
suspicion
or
probable
cause
exists
as
i
argue
in
section
i
b
this
is
probably
already
occurring
third
police
could
formally
cite
the
results
from
predictive
algorithms
in
court
when
justifying
their
stops
or
searches
or
when
applying
for
a
search
warrant
as
we
see
in
section
i
c
there
is
as
yet
no
evidence
that
law
enforcement
has
done
this
although
this
is
likely
to
happen
soon
finally
the
results
from
big
data
s
predictive
algorithms
could
be
outcome
determinative
meaning
that
a
police
officer
or
a
judge
would
only
consider
the
algorithm
s
output
and
ignore
all
other
evidence
we
are
a
long
way
from
this
point
in
the
context
of
reasonable
suspicion
or
probable
cause
but
section
i
d
notes
that
some
courts
are
coming
close
to
allowing
mechanical
predictions
to
be
outcome
determinative
for
bail
sentencing
and
parole
decisions
n
a
predictive
algorithms
and
policing
police
have
a
long
history
of
using
massive
amounts
of
data
to
help
decide
where
to
deploy
resources
n
in
the
s
law
enforcement
use
of
data
compilation
gained
national
attention
with
the
new
york
police
department
s
compstat
program
n
crime
mapping
algorithms
quickly
spread
to
other
cities
and
became
a
staple
of
big
city
policing
n
today
more
advanced
software
has
made
crime
predicting
software
available
in
smaller
jurisdictions
and
the
national
institute
of
justice
is
funding
research
into
the
efficacy
of
such
programs
n
these
crime
prediction
software
systems
vary
considerably
in
their
sophistication
one
program
known
as
predpol
short
for
predictive
policing
only
looks
at
past
reports
of
criminal
activity
and
then
highlights
areas
of
the
precinct
in
which
crime
has
been
most
prevalent
during
specific
time
periods
n
the
police
department
then
assigns
more
officers
to
the
high
crime
areas
in
order
to
detect
or
deter
crime
more
effectively
police
officers
using
the
software
in
a
suburb
of
los
angeles
saw
their
crime
rate
decrease
by
over
the
course
of
four
months
while
it
rose
by
in
surrounding
areas
n
a
more
sophisticated
program
called
hunchlab
also
uses
reports
of
past
criminal
activity
but
adds
in
additional
factors
n
some
of
these
extra
factors
such
as
the
proximity
to
subway
stations
or
bars
or
the
current
weather
conditions
have
an
obvious
correlation
to
particular
types
of
criminal
activity
other
factors
seem
unrelated
such
as
the
decrease
in
aggravated
assaults
on
windy
days
or
the
increase
in
car
thefts
near
schools
n
the
fresno
police
department
uses
crime
prediction
software
in
a
somewhat
different
way
employing
a
software
system
called
beware
to
warn
police
officers
of
the
threat
level
for
the
location
of
a
call
n
as
law
enforcement
officers
are
on
their
way
to
the
location
workers
in
police
headquarters
plug
the
address
into
the
beware
program
which
quickly
analyzes
countless
pieces
of
data
including
arrest
reports
commercial
databases
deep
web
searches
and
social
media
postings
that
are
associated
with
that
address
n
the
program
then
offers
a
rating
for
the
location
green
for
safe
yellow
for
caution
and
red
for
dangerous
n
police
officers
who
arrive
at
the
scene
can
take
appropriate
precautions
based
on
that
rating
chicago
takes
this
process
one
step
further
using
predictive
software
to
determine
which
individuals
are
most
likely
to
be
involved
in
a
crime
n
using
a
special
algorithm
designed
by
an
engineer
at
the
illinois
institute
of
technology
the
chicago
police
department
created
a
heat
list
of
people
who
are
most
likely
to
be
involved
in
a
shooting
or
homicide
n
police
will
then
deploy
resources
to
monitor
these
individuals
more
closely
than
other
individuals
n
in
an
attempt
to
deter
their
criminal
behavior
by
letting
them
know
they
are
under
increased
surveillance
or
to
swiftly
apprehend
them
if
they
do
commit
crimes
n
using
predictive
software
to
determine
how
to
allocate
scarce
law
enforcement
resources
is
not
limited
to
investigations
of
street
crime
the
internal
revenue
service
irs
uses
a
secret
algorithm
to
determine
which
of
the
over
one
hundred
million
tax
returns
should
be
audited
each
year
the
irs
algorithm
scans
through
every
tax
return
looking
for
outlying
levels
of
deductions
or
other
factors
that
indicate
a
higher
chance
of
fraud
and
then
it
assigns
a
risk
level
to
each
return
n
those
returns
with
high
risk
factors
are
then
personally
reviewed
by
irs
agents
to
see
if
an
audit
is
appropriate
n
some
critics
of
adapting
big
data
to
our
criminal
justice
system
argue
that
it
does
not
in
fact
make
more
accurate
decisions
professor
bernard
harcourt
has
argued
that
predictive
policing
may
actually
reduce
the
efficiency
of
stops
and
searches
because
when
police
focus
their
resources
on
certain
portions
of
the
population
they
necessarily
withdraw
resources
from
other
portions
of
the
population
n
according
to
his
model
crime
will
decrease
among
those
who
are
targeted
but
it
will
increase
among
those
who
are
not
targeted
thus
whether
the
overall
crime
rate
decreases
actually
depends
on
the
comparative
elasticity
of
the
crime
rate
in
each
of
the
two
groups
n
this
critique
is
persuasive
if
the
police
are
using
a
very
basic
predictive
policing
model
that
focuses
on
one
specific
neighborhood
or
as
in
harcourt
s
example
one
specific
race
but
the
critique
becomes
weaker
if
the
police
are
using
a
multi
factor
algorithm
to
direct
resources
and
it
becomes
weaker
still
if
it
is
merely
used
to
determine
whether
reasonable
suspicion
or
probable
cause
exist
however
harcourt
s
objection
does
highlight
the
need
to
ensure
that
the
data
used
by
the
predictive
algorithm
remains
current
that
is
if
there
is
a
feedback
effect
that
makes
certain
factors
less
likely
to
indicate
criminal
activity
the
algorithm
should
be
adjusted
to
ensure
that
those
factors
are
given
less
weight
or
eliminated
entirely
it
also
highlights
a
legitimate
concern
about
relying
on
data
which
itself
may
be
tainted
by
past
discrimination
or
inaccurate
decisions
a
topic
we
will
address
in

iii

below

predictive
algorithms

data
predpol
hunchlab
beware
chicago
s
heat
list
and
the
irs
algorithm
represent
what
we
could
call
the
first
stage
of
crime
prediction
algorithms
algorithms
used
to
help
police
decide
where
and
how
to
deploy
their
resources
but
not
used
at
least
formally
to
make
any
specific
legal
determination
n
but
as
the
amount
of
data
about
individuals
grows
and
becomes
more
accessible
police
will
use
big
data
at
later
stages
of
the
criminal
justice
system
it
is
likely
that
police
already
informally
use
these
tools
as
background
information
in
making
their
determination
as
to
whether
reasonable
suspicion
or
probable
cause
exists
assume
a
police
officer
observes
marginally
suspicious
activity
say
a
suspect
walking
slowly
down
the
street
at
night
peering
into
windows
and
constantly
looking
over
his
shoulder
if
the
officer
is
using
crime
prediction
software
and
the
software
informs
her
that
she
is
currently
in
a
low
crime
neighborhood
with
few
burglaries
she
may
simply
assume
that
the
suspect
is
engaged
in
innocent
conduct
and
merely
observe
the
suspect
for
a
few
minutes
until
he
leaves
the
area
but
if
the
software
informs
her
that
there
are
many
burglaries
that
occur
in
this
neighborhood
at
this
time
of
night
that
extra
factor
could
be
enough
to
change
her
response
and
lead
her
to
conduct
a
terry
stop
of
the
suspect
or
consider
a
police
officer
who
uses
risk
assessment
software
and
shows
up
at
a
home
in
response
to
a
call
to
find
two
individuals
engaged
in
a
heated
argument
one
with
a
bruise
on
his
cheek
the
injured
individual
refuses
to
tell
the
police
officer
whether
he
has
been
assaulted
if
the
risk
assessment
software
flashes
a
peaceful
green
the
responding
officer
might
simply
give
a
warning
to
the
two
individuals
or
ask
one
of
them
to
take
a
walk
to
cool
down
but
if
the
software
presented
a
red
light
indicating
the
presence
of
a
violent
individual
at
the
location
the
officer
might
decide
that
she
has
probable
cause
to
arrest
the
uninjured
individual
and
charge
him
with
assault
the
same
calculus
would
occur
consciously
or
unconsciously
when
an
officer
is
investigating
a
potential
crime
and
a
member
of
a
heat
list
is
a
suspect
or
when
an
irs
agent
is
reviewing
a
return
that
has
already
been
flagged
by
the
software
other
police
officers
have
mobile
applications
that
can
display
the
location
of
individuals
suspected
of
gang
activity
registered
sex
offenders
or
those
who
have
outstanding
warrants
thus
allowing
a
police
officer
to
quickly
generate
reasonable
suspicion
or
probable
cause
n
indeed
presence
in
a
high
crime
area
is
a
factor
that
is
frequently
cited
by
police
officers
who
are
explaining
why
they
believed
that
reasonable
suspicion
existed
n
and
the
fact
that
a
suspect
is
a
known
violent
felon
could
also
be
used
by
an
officer
in
deciding
whether
to
make
an
arrest
n
many
law
enforcement
agents
and
many
lay
people
would
say
that
it
would
be
foolish
to
ignore
these
signals
when
deciding
on
the
appropriate
course
of
action
although
police
probably
use
these
results
as
background
information
in
making
their
determination
so
far
no
law
enforcement
agent
or
prosecutor
has
formally
used
the
results
of
crime
prediction
software
in
court
as
a
factor
to
support
reasonable
suspicion
or
probable
cause
n
instead
courts
rely
on
the
testimony
of
the
law
enforcement
officers
to
establish
the
necessary
factors
even
in
situations
where
big
data
could
provide
more
accurate
information
n
c
predictive
algorithms
as
formal
factors
the
increasing
pervasiveness
of
predictive
algorithms
in
policing
means
that
police
officers
will
soon
be
using
these
predictions
as
part
of
their
arguments
justifying
reasonable
suspicion
or
probable
cause
moreover
as
police
officers
use
these
factors
more
often
judges
will
begin
to
expect
this
kind
of
hard
data
and
may
begin
to
reject
the
current
subjective
experiential
or
anecdotal
evidence
that
officers
currently
rely
upon
n
this
will
almost
certainly
result
in
more
accurate
determinations
overall
to
see
why
we
need
to
take
a
closer
look
at
the
current
system
that
is
used
to
determine
reasonable
suspicion
or
probable
cause
for
example
consider
the
high
crime
area
determination
that
is
frequently
cited
by
police
officers
as
a
factor
supporting
reasonable
suspicion
or
probable
cause
the
opinion
of
a
police
officer
about
how
much
crime
occurs
in
a
certain
area
is
likely
to
be
based
on
a
small
sample
of
cases
it
may
be
based
on
an
outdated
reputation
of
a
neighborhood
and
it
is
possibly
tainted
by
many
different
kinds
of
bias
n
even
if
accurate
it
is
inappropriately
comparative
if
the
neighborhood
in
question
has
three
times
the
number
of
drug
arrests
per
week
than
all
of
the
surrounding
neighborhoods
that
fact
in
itself
is
irrelevant
to
a
reasonable
suspicion
argument
n
instead
the
police
officer
and
the
judge
should
consider
the
absolute
number
of
criminal
activity
does
the
neighborhood
in
question
have
two
drug
arrests
per
week
or
ten
drug
arrests
per
week
or
fifty
drug
arrests
per
week
n
take
another
example
an
officer
is
only
allowed
to
frisk
a
suspect
during
a
terry
stop
if
the
officer
has
a
reason
to
believe
the
suspect
is
armed
up
until
now
that
reason
to
believe
like
the
reasonable
suspicion
underlying
the
stop
itself
has
been
based
on
the
opinion
and
past
experience
of
the
police
officer
and
evaluated
based
on
the
intuition
of
the
reviewing
court
police
officers
routinely
testify
for
example
that
individuals
suspected
of
engaging
in
narcotics
transactions
are
more
likely
to
have
weapons
on
their
person
in
practice
judges
have
credited
this
testimony
regularly
approving
terry
frisks
when
the
police
officer
had
reasonable
grounds
to
believe
a
suspect
was
engaged
in
narcotics
trafficking
n
but
what
is
the
actual
link
between
selling
narcotics
and
weapons
possession
if
the
former
actually
does
make
the
latter
more
likely
what
is
the
degree
of
increase
in
probability
is
it
the
same
for
every
city
and
every
neighborhood
of
every
city
and
every
type
of
narcotic
clinical
judgments
can
answer
none
of
these
questions
nor
can
they
answer
these
questions
for
any
other
factor
relied
upon
by
police
when
justifying
a
terry
frisk
thus
the
reason
to
believe
standard
has
become
a
legal
term
of
art
defined
not
by
actual
probability
but
by
years
of
precedents
in
which
certain
fact
patterns
have
been
approved
by
courts
based
solely
on
the
experience
and
expertise
of
police
officers
in
fact
the
bureau
of
justice
review
of
over
criminals
who
were
convicted
in
state
court
shows
that
only
of
those
who
were
convicted
of
drug
dealing
carried
a
firearm
at
the
time
of
the
offense
and
only
of
those
convicted
of
drug
possession
carried
a
firearm
at
the
time
of
the
offense
n
does
an
chance
give
officers
a
reason
to
believe
judges
have
never
answered
this
question
preferring
instead
to
rely
on
the
self
reported
intuition
and
experience
of
the
very
police
officers
who
are
trying
to
justify
their
own
actions
other
used
factors
for
clinical
judgments
also
may
comport
with
the
intuition
of
police
officers
and
with
the
intuition
of
the
judges
who
review
the
police
officers
actions
but
may
be
empirically
false
for
example
flight
from
police
has
long
been
held
to
be
a
significant
factor
in
determining
reasonable
suspicion
n
but
studies
have
shown
that
in
high
crime
urban
communities
where
the
population
is
disproportionately
minority
there
is
a
very
weak
link
between
flight
from
police
and
criminal
activity
n
courts
have
long
been
criticized
for
deferring
to
the
various
factors
police
officers
use
in
determining
that
they
have
the
authority
to
make
a
terry

united

sokolow

as
one

of
commentators
noted
apparently
almost
any
human
trait
can
be
a
basis
for
suspicion
and
nearly
everybody
exhibits
several
potentially
suspicious
factors
at
any
given
time
n
in
the
recent
case
of
floyd
v
city
of
new
york
n
a
class
action
suit
challenging
the
stop
and
frisk
policies
of
the
new
york
police
department
the
trial
judge
criticized
the
often
used
police
factors
such
as
furtive
movements
high
crime
area
and
suspicious
bulge
as
overly
vague
n
during
testimony
in
the
case
two
police
officers
testified
as
to
what
they
understood
furtive
movements
to
mean
one
officer
explained
that
furtive
movement
is
a
very
broad
concept
and
could
include
a
person
changing
direction
walking
in
a
certain
way
a
cting
a
little
suspicious
making
a
movement
that
is
not
regular
being
very
fidgety
going
in
and
out
of
his
pocket
going
in
and
out
of
a
location
looking
back
and
forth
constantly
looking
over
their
shoulder
adjusting
their
hip
or
their
belt
moving
in
and
out
of
a
car
too
quickly
t
urning
a
part
of
their
body
away
from
you
g
rabbing
at
a
certain
pocket
or
something
at
their
waist
getting
a
little
nervous
maybe
shaking
and
stutter
ing
another
officer
explained
that
usually
a
furtive
movement
is
someone
hanging
out
in
front
of
a
building
sitting
on
the
benches
or
something
like
that
and
then
making
a
quick
movement
such
as
bending
down
and
quickly
standing
back
up
going
inside
the
lobby
and
then
quickly
coming
back
out
or
all
of
a
sudden
becom
ing
very
nervous
very
aware
n
in
the
statistics
from
the
floyd
case
police
officers
cited
furtive
movements
as
a
factor
in
of
their
stops
n
not
only
are
many
of
the
clinical
judgment
factors
overly
vague
their
supposed
link
to
criminal
activity
is
based
on
a
very
limited
data
set
factors
offered
by
law
enforcement
officers
are
frequently
supported
only
by
the
officer
s
own
prior
experience
and
in
approving
or
disapproving
n
of
these
factors
as
probative
of
criminal
activity
courts
either
cite
the
expertise
of
the
officers
or
use
their
own
intuition
to
evaluate
the
probability
that
a
crime
will
occur
unsurprisingly
the
result
of
these
vague
standards
and
limited
data
sets
is
a
troublingly
low
hit
rate
for
police
officers
conducting
stop
and
frisks
the
recent
expansion
of
terry
stops
in
new
york
city
resulted
in
a
regime
in
which
only
of
all
terry
stops
in
new
york
city
resulted
in
an
arrest
or
a
summons
n
during
that
same
period
only
of
the
terry
frisks
produced
evidence
of
a
weapon
n
thus
for
that
time
period
the
police
officers
standard
for
reasonable
suspicion
was
in
fact
a
likelihood
that
criminal
activity
was
occurring
while
their
standard
for
a
reason
to
believe
that
a
suspect
was
armed
thus
justifying
a
frisk
was
although
courts
have
been
unwilling
to
explicitly
quantify
the
percentage
chance
for
reasonable
suspicion
it
is
probably
more
than
and
certainly
more
than
n
indeed
the
district
court
in
the
floyd
case
concluded
that
many
of
the
stops
by
the
police
officers
during
this
time
period
were
not
supported
by
reasonable
suspicion
n
this
implies
that
the
success
rate
over
that
time
period
was
insufficient
to
support
reasonable
suspicion
since
it
was
the
result
of
overly
aggressive
police
tactics
and
the
use
of
improper
factors
similarly
a
review
of
police
tactics
in
philadelphia
concluded
that
only
of
the
stops
resulted
in
recovery
of
contraband
the
review
also
concluded
that
reasonable
suspicion
was
lacking
for
somewhere
between
and
of
these
stops
n
thus
there
is
a
growing
dissonance
between
the
objective
data
driven
tools
used
by
police
officers
to
guide
their
conduct
and
the
intuitive
arguments
and
subjective
experience
used
by
police
officers
to
justify
that
conduct
in
court
given
the
success
of
the
data
driven
tools
in
everyday
police
work
it
seems
inevitable
that
they
will
soon
be
formally
used
by
police
officers
in
assessing
whether
reasonable
suspicion
or
probable
cause
exists
although
these
predictive
algorithms
have
not
yet
been
used
in
the
context
of
reasonable
suspicion
or
probable
cause
they
are
not
completely
foreign
to
the
criminal
justice
system
as
we
will
see
in
the
next
section
courts
have
been
using
these
predictive
algorithms
in
other
contexts
such
as
bail
hearings
and
parole
hearings
d
predictive
algorithms
elsewhere
in
the
criminal
justice
system
the
final
step
in
the
use
of
predictive
algorithms
is
for
the
police
officers
and
judges
to
make
their
decisions
based
solely
on
the
outputs
of
the
algorithms
without
exercising
any
of
their
own
independent
judgment
we
may
never
get
to
this
stage
for
reasonable
suspicion
and
probable
cause
determinations
and
we
may
not
want
to
as
discussed
below
n
but
we
have
come
close
to
such
a
world
in
other
contexts
such
as
bail
determinations
sentencing
decisions
and
parole
judgments
for
decades
judges
used
generalizations
based
on
risk
factors
in
making
these
decisions
but
in
recent
years
just
as
in
the
policing
context
big
data
has
slowly
been
infiltrating
these
procedures
using
vast
quantities
of
data
to
empirically
test
traditional
factors
and
experiment
with
new
factors
n
one
example
of
this
shift
in
the
bail
context
is
the
public
safety
assessment
psa
designed
by
the
arnold
foundation
which
has
been
adopted
by
about
two
dozen
jurisdictions
over
the
past
few
years
n
the
psa
which
is
based
on
an
analysis
of
one
and
a
half
million
criminal
cases
uses
up
to
ten
different
objective
factors
to
determine
whether
a
defendant
is
a
flight
risk
or
likely
to
commit
a
crime
during
pretrial
release
n
the
results
of
the
psa
have
been
nearly
uniformly
positive
after
pilot
projects
the
city
of
charlotte
lowered
its
pretrial
detention
by
with
no
increase
in
crime
or
bench
warrants
while
the
state
of
kentucky
has
saved
significant
money
and
increased
accuracy
of
its
pretrial
decisions
n
the
sentencing
process
is
also
undergoing
a
quiet
revolution
in
the
methods
that
judges
use
to
assess
risk
of
reoffending
some
states
now
use
formal
risk
assessment
instruments
to
determine
the
appropriate
sentence
after
conviction
n
these
risk
assessment
instruments
are
designed
using
an
algorithm
that
takes
into
account
decades
of
prior
cases
n
they
typically
use
around
ten
different
inputs
such
as
age
and
history
of
alcohol
abuse
and
then
assign
defendants
a
number
on
a
scale
which
translates
to
a
percentage
chance
that
the
defendant
will
reoffend
within
a
certain
period
of
time
n
for
example
virginia
developed
a
nine
factor
risk
assessment
instrument
based
on
past
evidence
and
uses
the
instrument
to
help
determine
whether
to
divert
a
defendant
away
from
a
prison
sentence
n
as
of
now
judges
use
these
risk
assessment
instruments
as
tools
to
help
them
make
their
decision
and
judges
still
maintain
the
discretion
to
depart
from
the
recommendations
made
by
the
instrument
n
but
the
influence
of
these
instruments
on
the
actual
sentencing
decision
is
growing
predictive
algorithms
have
also
gained
popularity
in
assessing
the
appropriateness
of
parole
mechanical
predictions
were
used
as
far
back
as
the
s
long
before
computers
and
large
databases
became
available
n
the
goal
of
these
early
predictions
was
to
assess
an
inmate
s
risk
of
recidivism
due
to
the
vast
number
of
individuals
who
were
paroled
even
in
the
early
years
there
was
a
large
pool
of
subjects
for
a
natural
experiment
sociologists
and
psychologists
utilized
this
pool
to
examine
the
characteristics
of
those
who
did
and
did
not
succeed
on
parole
n
by
over
of
states
that
maintained
an
active
parole
system
employed
some
form
of
mechanical
predictive
instrument
in
determining
whether
parole
was
appropriate
n
one
common
tool
the
level
of
services
inventory
revised
lsi
r
takes
into
account
fifty
four
separate
factors
ranging
from
criminal
history
and
education
level
to
alcohol
abuse
and
attitude
towards
sentencing
n
courts
correctional
facilities
and
parole
boards
routinely
use
these
instruments
in
determining
what
level
of
supervision
an
inmate
needs
in
prison
whether
he
should
be
paroled
and
what
conditions
are
necessary
if
parole
is
granted
n
like
police
officers
judges
who
make
clinical
judgments
about
bail
sentencing
or
parole
may
subconsciously
or
explicitly
use
stereotypes
or
intuitions
that
are
incorrect
n
in
creating
the
psa
the
arnold
foundation
determined
that
many
traditional
factors
used
in
bail
hearings
such
as
defendant
s
employment
status
community
ties
or
drug
and
alcohol
abuse
were
poor
predictors
of
flight
risk
n
they
also
concluded
that
a
face
to
face
interview
traditionally
a
staple
of
prearraignment
assessment
was
not
a
useful
tool
n
in
the
sentencing
context
many
judges
had
long
believed
that
mental
illness
was
a
strong
indicator
of
recidivism
actual
studies
of
mentally
ill
criminals
have
shown
that
not
to
be
the
case
n
there
are
two
obvious
differences
between
the
predictive
algorithms
used
by
police
during
their
investigations
and
those
used
by
courts
in
making
decisions
about
bail
sentencing
or
parole
the
first
seems
significant
but
in
fact
is
relatively
trivial
the
police
officers
are
making
predictions
about
past
or
current
behavior
i
e
whether
the
person
they
are
about
to
stop
is
currently
engaged
in
criminal
activity
or
whether
the
house
they
would
like
to
search
currently
contains
drugs
while
courts
are
making
predictions
about
future
behavior
i
e
whether
the
defendant
will
return
to
court
if
released
or
whether
the
defendant
will
commit
more
crimes
if
released
on
parole
in
truth
however
there
is
no
material
difference
between
these
two
types
of
predictions
both
involve
a
decision
maker
in
the
criminal
justice
system
trying
to
use
known
facts
to
determine
the
odds
that
an
unknown
fact
is
true
as
noted
by
professor
barbara
underwood
in
one
of
the
first
articles
regarding
prediction
and
the
law
some
past
or
present
facts
are
as
elusive
as
any
prediction
and
some
predictions
can
be
made
with
as
much
confidence
as
most
determinations
of
past
fact
n
the
second
more
significant
distinction
is
in
the
amount
of
time
available
to
conduct
the
prediction
police
officers
deciding
whether
to
stop
or
arrest
an
individual
on
the
street
are
reacting
to
an
ongoing
and
sometimes
rapidly
changing
situation
and
therefore
may
not
have
the
time
to
do
anything
but
rely
on
their
clinical
judgments
even
if
an
accurate
fast
processing
algorithm
is
available
to
the
police
they
may
not
have
time
to
make
the
necessary
observations
that
are
required
for
the
algorithm
to
deliver
an
accurate
prediction
judges
who
are
reviewing
these
judgments
at
a
later
suppression
hearing
as
well
as
judges
who
are
making
decisions
about

or

have
the
time
to
gather
more
data
about
the
defendant
and
his
circumstances
and
then
make
use
of
a
predictive
algorithm
in
making
their
decision
in
other
words
predictive
software
may
be
less
accurate
when
used
by
law
enforcement
officers
than
when
used
by
judges
nevertheless
the
success
of
these
mechanical
predictions
in
the
context
of
bail
and
parole
hearings
shows
that
courts
may
be
receptive
to
applying
these
tools
on
the
front
end
of
the
criminal
justice
system
to
justify
stops
arrests
and
searches
data
driven
predictive
algorithms
represent
an
opportunity
to
dramatically
increase
the
accuracy
of
these
decisions
thus
ensuring
that
fewer
innocent
citizens
are
detained
or
searched
and
increasing
the
efficiency
of
our
law
enforcement
resources
n
however
a
number
of
obstacles
remain
both
in
the
design
of
the
algorithms
and
in
the
legal
standards
used
by
courts
we
will
discuss
these
obstacles
in
the
next
part
ii
challenges
to
using
predictive
algorithms
as
noted
in
part
i
crime
prediction
software
could
soon
be
used
by
police
officers
on
the
street
and
by
judges
in
criminal
courts
to
prove
reasonable
suspicion
or
probable
cause
this
development
could
potentially
result
in
more
accurate
and
consistent
determinations
of
whether
these
standards
have
indeed
been
met
but
only
if
certain
obstacles
can
be
overcome
first
there
is
a
concern
that
predictive
algorithms
would
use
factors
that
are
illegal
for
courts
to
consider
such
as
the
race
of
the
subject
n
similarly
the
underlying
data
that
the
algorithms
use
may
be
in
itself
biased
thus
using
these
algorithms
would
not
actually
increase
accuracy
but
merely
reinforce
decades
of
discriminatory
policing
also
the
law
requires
police
officers
and
judges
to
act
on
facts
that
are
specific
to
the
case
at
hand
the
general
probability
factors
used
by
big
data
may
not
be
able
to
provide
this
specificity
and
finally
the
hyper
quantified
world
of
big
data
is
currently
an
uncomfortable
fit
with
the
flexible
standards
used
by
courts
all
of
these
obstacles
are
surmountable
but
only
if
the
algorithms
and
databases
used
by
the
big
data
analyses
are
made
more
transparent
so
that
courts
can
evaluate
the
underlying
processes
and
the
standards
being
used
and
only
if
courts
are
willing
to
accept
the
quantified
world
of
predictive
software
a
detecting
the
racial
biases
in
the
predictive
algorithms
to
the
extent
that
human
beings
have
a
hand
in
creating
the
algorithms
and
compiling
the
data
that
the
algorithms
use
human
biases
will
infect
the
results
although
it
is
impossible
to
eliminate
these
biases
altogether
there
are
ways
to
minimize
the
problems
they
create
direct
and
indirect
use
of
forbidden
factors
mechanical
predictions
are
not
necessarily
color
blind
if
an
individual
s
race
is
a
significant
factor
in
determining
whether
a
certain
outcome
is
likely
to
occur
then
the
individuals
who
are
designing
and
using
the
algorithm
may
be
tempted
to
use
race
as
one
of
the
inputs
in
order
to
achieve
more
accurate
results
in
some
cases
outside
the
context
of
criminal
procedure
this
may
be
relatively
harmless
for
example
when
companies
use
big
data
to
decide
where
to
market
certain
products
or
when
political
campaigns
use
big
data
to
decide
which
voters
to
contact
with
a
certain
kind
of
outreach
in
other
cases
race
based
factors
can
be
quite
harmful
and
illegal
for
example
in
deciding
which
customers
are
a
good
credit
risk
for
a
home
loan
n
or
which
job
applicants
should
be
hired
n
in
the
context
of
criminal
procedure
race
based
factors
are
especially
problematic
both
legally
and
morally
for
the
purposes
of
this
discussion
let
s
assume
that
a
private
company
has
developed
an
algorithm
that
can
predict
with
great
accuracy
whether
drugs
will
be
found
inside
a
certain
house
the
algorithm
requires
the
user
to
enter
six
different
inputs
such
as
the
neighborhood
where
the
house
is
located
the
prior
criminal
convictions
of
the
house
s
owner
and
observations
made
by
police
officers
about
activity
outside
the
house
one
of
these
inputs
is
the
race
of
the
owner
of
the
home
assume
further
that
without
using
the
race
factor
the
algorithm
can
predict
the
presence
of
drugs
with
accuracy
but
with
the
race
factor
the
algorithm
can
predict
the
presence
of
drugs
with
accuracy
assume
the
police
have
purchased
this
algorithm
and
are
using
it
in
their
warrant
application
should
they
input
the
race
factor
in
order
to
enhance
the
algorithm
s
accuracy
in
other
words
would
it
be
illegal
for
the
state
to
use
race
as
a
factor
in
determining
probable
cause
or
reasonable
suspicion
if
it
could
be
definitively
proven
that
using
race
made
the
prediction
more
accurate
surprisingly
fourth
amendment
jurisprudence
has
little
to
say
about
whether
race
can
be
used
as
a
factor
in
determining
reasonable
suspicion
or
probable
cause
courts
are
unanimous
in
holding
that
race
alone
can
never
be
the
basis
for
a
stop
or
a
search
for
the
obvious
reason
that
a
person
s
race
alone
can
never
create
probable
cause
or
even
reasonable
suspicion
that
criminal
activity
is
occurring
n
however
some
courts
have
approved
cases
in
which
race
was
one
of
many
factors
in
deciding
whether
reasonable
suspicion
or
probable
cause
existed
for
example
when
searching
for
illegal
immigrants
near
the
mexican
border
n
other
courts
have
disagreed
arguing
that
a
person
s
race
is
of
such
little
probative
value
in
the
reasonable
suspicion
analysis
that
it
may
not
be
considered
as
a
relevant
factor
n
as
these
cases
make
clear
the
only
problem
with
using
race
under
fourth
amendment
jurisprudence
is
that
in
the
vast
majority
of
cases
the
race
of
a
subject
is
not
a
relevant
indicator
as
to
whether
the
suspect
is
more
or
less
likely
to
engage
in
criminal
activity
n
therefore
any
law
enforcement
official
who
does
consider
race
is
almost
certainly
doing
so
because
of
an
irrational
bias
against
that
particular
race
but
this
objection
is
not
entirely
valid
in
every
circumstance
as
noted
above
if
the
law
enforcement
officer
is
looking
for
illegal
immigrants
near
the
mexican
border
for
example
the
suspect
s
race
could
conceivably
be
one
factor
in
trying
to
predict
whether
the
suspect
was
illegally
in
the
country
likewise
if
a
person
seems
out
of
place
due
to
her
race
for
example
a
white
person
in
a
predominantly
black
neighborhood
her
race
could
be
one
factor
that
would
lead
to
reasonable
suspicion
that
she
was
engaging
in
criminal
activity
n
given
this
jurisprudence
there
is
no
valid
fourth
amendment
objection
to
using
race
as
a
factor
in
a
mechanical
prediction
algorithm
for
reasonable
suspicion
or
probable
cause
assuming
we
have
a
properly
designed
algorithm
n
race
would
only
be
used
as
a
factor
if
it
actually
was
a
useful
predictor
of
individualized
suspicion
in
other
words
there
would
be
empirical
statistical
proof
that
in
the
given
context
race
did
help
determine
whether
or
not
an
individual
was
guilty
of
a
crime
n
in
our
hypothetical
case
in
which
the
use
of
race
increased
the
accuracy
of
the
prediction
from
to
using
the
race
based
factor
would
not
be
prohibited
under
the
fourth
amendment
the
equal
protection
clause
is
another
matter
however
under
the
equal
protection
clause
race
can
only
be
used
as
a
factor
in
state
actions
if
the
use
of
race
is
necessary
and
if
it
is
narrowly
tailored
to
achieve
a
compelling
state
interest
n
this
is
a
difficult
if
not
impossible
burden
for
law
enforcement
to
meet
in
the
stop
and
search
context
some
courts
have
held
that
the
use
of
race
as
a
factor
does
not
require
exclusion
as
long
as
there
were
sufficient
other
factors
to
justify
the
stop
or
search
n
while
others
have
noted
that
law
enforcement
officers
violate
the
equal
protection
clause
if
they
incorporate
race
routinely
as
a
factor
in
their
drug
courier
profile
n
neither
of
these
principles
bodes
well
for
using
race
as
a
factor
in
mechanical
prediction
algorithms
regardless
of
how
accurate
it
might
be
as
further
evidence
that
racial
factors
are
forbidden
by
the
equal
protection
clause
nearly
all
the
civil
suits
alleging
racial
profiling
result
in
consent
decrees
that
forbid
the
use
of
race
as
a
factor
n
outside
the
fourth
amendment
context
the
seminal
case
on
racial
bias
in
the
criminal
justice
system
is
mccleskey
v
kemp
in
which
a
black
defendant
argued
that
the
state
of
georgia
engaged
in
racial
discrimination
when
administering
the
death
penalty
n
the
defendant
relied
on
a
study
that
showed
that
defendants
who
killed
white
victims
were
far
more
likely
to
be
sentenced
to
death
than
those
who
killed
black
victims
n
the
study
also
showed
that
black
defendants
were
more
likely
to
get
the
death
penalty
than
white
defendants
n
the
supreme
court
rejected
the
defendant
s
arguments
holding
that
in
order
to
prevail
on
an
equal
protection
claim
the
defendant
had
to
demonstrate
that
the
decision
makers
in
the
process
acted
with
a
discriminatory
purpose
n
the
justices
were
concerned
with
interfering
with
the
discretion
that
is
given
to
prosecutors
judges
and
juries
and
thus
said
it
required
exceptionally
clear
proof
before
the
court
would
infer
that
the
discretion
has
been
abused
n
based
on
this
jurisprudence
it
is
hard
to
see
our
hypothetical
algorithm
passing
constitutional
muster
even
assuming
that
the
interdiction
of
drugs
is
a
compelling
state
interest
law
enforcement
would
be
hard
pressed
to
argue
that
using
the
race
based
factor
was
necessary
and
narrowly
tailored
to
accomplish
that
purpose
the
use
of
the
algorithm
would
probably
be
seen
as
nothing
more
than
a
sophisticated
method
of
racial
profiling
an
institutionalization
of
using
race
as
a
factor
in
determining
probable
cause
the
only
plausible
defense
for
the
state
would
be
to
argue
that
although
race
is
clearly
a
factor
in
the
decision
made
by
the
algorithm
the
decision
is
not
made
with
a
discriminatory
purpose
as
forbidden
by
mccleskey
in
other
words
those
who
design
and
use
the
algorithm
are
arguably
not
acting
with
racial
animus
or
out
of
any
intent
to
treat
the
members
of
one
race
differently
than
another
this
narrower
definition
of
discriminatory
purpose
is
consistent
with
mccleskey
s
language
which
held
that
d
iscriminatory
purpose
implies
more
than
intent
as
volition
or
intent
as
awareness
of
consequences
it
implies
that
the
decisionmaker
selected
or
reaffirmed
a
particular
course
of
action
at
least
in
part
because
of
not
merely
in
spite
of
its
adverse
effects
upon
an
identifiable
group
n
this
does
not
really
fit
the
state
s
motivation
in
using
the
algorithm
the
police
are
not
choosing
to
use
the
algorithm
or
more
specifically
the
race
factor
because
of
its
adverse
effects
on
a
particular
race
they
are
using
it
to
increase
the
accuracy
of
their
predictions
however
the
narrow
definition
of
discriminatory
purpose
is
not
borne
out
in
other
areas
of
criminal
procedure
for
example
in
the
context
of
jury
selection
the
court
held
that
if
a
defendant
established
a
pattern
of
racial
discrimination
in
peremptory
jury
challenges
the
prosecutor
could
only
prevail
if
she
could
provide
a
racially
neutral
reason
for
making
those
challenges
n
the
court
further
noted
that
the
prosecutor
may
not
rebut
the
defendant
s
prima
facie
case
of
discrimination
by
stating
merely
that
he
challenged
jurors
of
the
defendant
s
race
on
the
assumption
or
his
intuitive
judgment
that
they
would
be
partial
to
the
defendant
because
of
their
shared
race
n
this
would
be
analogous
to
a
prosecutor
arguing
that
explicit
discrimination
should
be
allowed
in
the
probable
cause
algorithm
because
it
increases
the
accuracy
of
the
prediction
thus
our
hypothetical
algorithm
could
not
legally
use
race
as
a
factor
however
much
that
factor
could
be
proven
to
increase
accuracy
this
legal
conclusion
is
consistent
with
most
individuals
intuitive
moral
sense
and
relatedly
to
the
political
feasibility
of
using
predictive
algorithms
in
the
past
the
media
has
harshly
criticized
racial
profiling
n
and
it
is
unlikely
that
the
public
would
support
a
system
that
regularly
and
explicitly
used
race
as
a
significant
factor
to
determine
whether
to
stop
a
person
or
search
his
home
but
explicit
use
of
race
is
not
the
only
potential
problem
in
the
context
of
predictive
algorithms
and
this
is
where
the
need
for
transparency
becomes
significant
it
would
be
relatively
easy
for
courts
to
enforce
a
rule
that
prohibits
the
police
from
using
the
defendant
s
race
directly
as
a
factor
in
predictive
algorithms
but
this
may
not
prevent
the
algorithm
from
relying
on
factors
that
are
strongly
correlated
to
race
assume
we
change
our
hypothetical
algorithm
and
remove
the
race
factor
altogether
but
still
use
the
location
of
the
house
as
one
of
the
factors
as
has
been
established
by
decades
of
redlining
neighborhoods
n
location
can
be
an
effective
proxy
for
race
in
the
context
of
providing
insurance
banking
services
health
care
or
many
other
types
of
services
n
as
we
saw
earlier
current
software
used
by
police
to
predict
crime
patterns
is
highly
location
specific
and
it
is
certainly
possible
to
imagine
a
scenario
in
which
higher
crime
areas
track
the
racial
makeup
of
specific
neighborhoods
n
we
can
call
this
indirect
discrimination
as
opposed
to
the
unconstitutional
direct
discrimination
that
occurs
when
race
is
officially
used
as
a
factor
n
nearly
every
predictive
program
that
is
currently
in
use
has
given
rise
to
concerns
about
indirect
discrimination
n
thus
before
law
enforcement
agents
and
judges
officially
use
these
programs
to
formally
help
them
make
their
decisions
we
need
to
determine
whether
it
is
legally
or
ethically
permissible
to
use
these
nonracial
elements
that
are
correlated
to
race
one
way
of
answering
this
question
is
to
note
that
proxies
for
race
are
already
used
in
determinations
of
reasonable
suspicion
or
probable
cause
police
officers
routinely
testify
that
they
made
their
observations
in
a
high
crime
area
as
a
factor
that
led
to
their
reasonable
suspicion
or
probable
cause
n
no
doubt
in
many
instances
higher
crime
neighborhoods
will
tend
to
be
inner
city
neighborhoods
with
higher
proportions
of
certain
minority
groups
n
or
at
least
this
will
be
the
perspective
of
many
police
officers
and
judges
n
and
this
formal
use
of
proxies
for
race
under
the
current
system
is
likely
only
the
tip
of
the
iceberg
the
unconscious
or
conscious
racial
biases
of
police
officers
and
magistrates
permeate
every
aspect
of
the
front
end
of
the
criminal
justice
system
n
under
the
current
system
police
officers
disproportionately
stop
and
frisk
black
and
latino
suspects
and
they
are
more
likely
to
engage
in
violent
and
even
lethal
conduct
when
interacting
with
these
suspects
n
the
findings
from
the
class
action
lawsuit
challenging
the
expanded
police
stop
and
frisks
in
new
york
city
n
found
that
over
an
eight
and
a
half
year
period
of
all
the
citizens
subjected
to
terry
stops
were
black
even
though
black
citizens
made
up
only
of
the
population
n
studies
have
shown
similar
numbers
in
philadelphia
n
los
angeles
n
boston
n
and
on
the
new
jersey
turnpike
n
unlike
the
formal
factors
which
can
at
least
in
theory
be
proven
to
be
proxies
for
race
the
use
and
effect
of
these
informal
decisions
are
difficult
to
detect
and
even
more
difficult
to
prove
in
court
these
implicit
biases
on
the
part
of
police
officers
are
also
difficult
to
cure
even
in
the
long
run
since
they
exist
in
almost
every
individual
even
those
who
harbor
no
conscious
prejudices
n
in
other
words
the
current
system
relies
on
personal
subjective
clinical
judgments
that
are
based
on
some
known
factors
which
are
explicitly
described
by
the
police
officer
or
magistrate
when
requesting
a
warrant
or
justifying
their
decision
and
some
unknown
factors
such
as
unconscious
biases
even
for
the
explicitly
listed
known
factors
the
decision
makers
do
not
and
likely
could
not
quantify
the
degree
to
which
they
relied
on
each
individual
factor
for
example
assume
a
police
officer
is
driving
through
a
neighborhood
and
notices
a
young
black
man
standing
on
the
street
corner
the
young
man
is
dressed
in
a
way
that
is
common
to
the
neighborhood
but
that
the
police
officer
identifies
as
consistent
with
gang
affiliation
the
man
then
looks
over
at
the
officer
immediately
places
something
in
his
pocket
and
then
walks
briskly
away
from
the
officer
assume
at
this
point
the
officer
honestly
believes
that
there
is
a
reasonable
suspicion
that
the
man
is
engaging
in
criminal
activity
that
is
the
officer
is
not
out
to
hassle
the
young
man
and
is
not
simply
stopping
people
indiscriminately
in
the
hope
of
finding
contraband
the
officer
then
gets
out
of
her
car
and
orders
the
man
to
stop
later
on
the
officer
is
required
to
justify
her
stop
by
explaining
why
she
believed
she
had
reasonable
suspicion
to
believe
criminal
activity
was
afoot
she
lists
the
following
factors
the
action
took
place
in
a
high
crime
neighborhood
the
suspect
hid
an
item
after
noticing
a
police
officer
the
suspect
attempted
to
leave
the
scene
after
noticing
a
police
officer
the
police
officer
does
not
list
and
may
not
even
be
consciously
aware
of
other
factors
that
led
her
to
believe
the
suspect
may
have
been
engaged
in
criminal
activity
the
suspect
s
race
the
officer
subconsciously
believes
that
black
men
are
more
likely
to
possess
guns
or
drugs
than
white
men
the
suspect
s
age
the
officer
believes
that
men
in
their
twenties
are
more
likely
to
be
engaged
in
criminal
activity
than
children
or
men
over
forty
the
suspect
s
gender
the
officer
believes
that
men
are
more
likely
to
be
carrying
drugs
or
weapons
than
women
the
suspect
s
clothing
which
is
actually
common
to
the
neighborhood
but
which
the
police
officer
subconsciously
associates
with
criminals
the
way
the
suspect
looked
at
the
police
officer
which
the
officer
couldn
t
describe
in
testimony
but
which
she
associated
with
hostility
to
authority
and
to
police
specifically
racial
bias
played
a
role
in
the
officer
s
determination
that
the
defendant
was
likely
engaged
in
criminal
activity
but
it
is
impossible
to
know
to
what
degree
of
the
formal
elements
the
fact
that
the
encounter
took
place
in
a
high
crime
neighborhood
is
likely
correlated
to
race
but
neither
the
officer
nor
the
magistrate
reviewing
her
conduct
are
able
to
explain
exactly
how
important
that
factor
was
out
of
the
three
that
were
listed
and
the
fact
that
the
suspect
s
race
led
the
officer
to
focus
on
this
particular
individual
as
opposed
to
the
young
white
man
she
observed
standing
on
a
different
street
corner
two
minutes
before
this
interaction
may
have
played
a
significant
role
in
her
decision
or
a
very
minor
role
likewise
the
suspect
s
clothing
likely
another
proxy
for
race
may
have
been
a
strong
motivator
for
her
to
act
or
it
may
have
been
relatively
insignificant
there
is
simply
no
way
to
measure
much
less
prove
the
degree
to
which
race
or
proxies
for
race
influenced
her
decision
to
detain
the
suspect
over
the
course
of
many
years
and
tens
of
thousands
of
stops
a
clear
pattern
will
probably
emerge
that
shows
that
this
police
department
disproportionately
stops
people
of
color
but
effective
remedies
at
that
point
are
hard
to
come
by
it
is
against
this
backdrop
that
we
must
evaluate
any
potential
future
use
of
predictive
software
in
contrast
to
the
use
of
clinical
judgments
predictive
software
will
only
base
its
results
on
the
formal
factors
that
are
coded
into
its
system
thus
there
will
be
no
unconscious
or
hidden
human
biases
that
affect
its
decision
furthermore
we
can
precisely
quantify
the
degree
to
which
each
of
the
formal
factors
affects
the
result
so
a
judge
or
a
policymaker
can
make
an
informed
judgment
as
to
whether
certain
factors
that
are
proxies
for
race
are
dominating
the
calculation
in
other
words
under
the
current
system
of
clinical
judgments
the
only
way
to
infer
indirect
discrimination
is
by
reviewing
the
aggregate
results
after
many
months
or
years
have
passed
under
a
system
of
mechanical
predictions
the
level
of
indirect
discrimination
can
be
assessed
even
before
a
stop
or
a
search
occurs
by
examining
the
algorithm
the
police
intend
to
use
thus
the
mechanical
predictive
algorithms
can
be
designed
to
ignore
or
at
least
minimize
improper
factors
such
as
race
something
that
may
be
impossible
to
do
if
we
leave
these
determinations
to
the
subjective
determinations
of
police
officers
n
all
of
this
however
depends
on
a
high
level
of
transparency
in
the
algorithm
itself
so
that
judges
and
other
policymakers
including
the
police
department
that
is
considering
adoption
of
the
algorithm
can
review
the
factors
their
correlation
if
any
to
race
and
the
strength
of
any
specific
factor
in
reaching
the
result
we
will
examine
the
challenges
of
achieving
this
level
of
transparency
in
part
iii
preexisting
biases
in
the
underlying
data
a
related
concern
about
using
mechanical
predictions
involves
the
underlying
data
that
is
used
by
the
predictive
algorithms
put
simply
if
the
underlying
data
is
discriminatory
then
the
results
that
are
based
on
that
data
will
be
discriminatory
and
the
supposedly
color
blind
algorithms
will
be
doing
nothing
more
than
reinforcing
the
existing
racial
bias
in
the
criminal
justice
system
in
the
civil
context
commentators
are
beginning
to
pay
close
attention
to
these
potential
problems
noting
that
i
f
a
sample
includes
a
disproportionate
representation
of
a
particular
class
the
results
of
an
analysis
of
that
sample
may
skew
in
favor
of
or
against
the
overor
underrepresented
class
n
as
an
example
assume
that
for
the
past
twenty
years
a
metropolitan
police
department
has
been
disproportionately
stopping
searching
and
arresting
black
and
latino
citizens
this
disproportionate
treatment
does
not
stem
from
the
fact
that
citizens
from
these
groups
are
more
likely
to
commit
crimes
but
from
inherent
racial
biases
in
the
criminal
justice
system
such
as
the
tendency
of
police
to
engage
with
minorities
more
than
with
whites
and
the
increased
level
of
policing
in
minority
neighborhoods
n
assume
also
that
these
stops
searches
and
arrests
result
in
conviction
at
a
higher
rate
than
stops
searches
and
arrests
of
white
citizens
again
not
because
the
police
are
better
at
predicting
crime
for
the
minority
citizens
but
because
of
downstream
biases
in
the
criminal
justice
system
because
black
and
latino
defendants
tend
to
be
poorer
n
they
are
less
likely
to
be
able
to
afford
private
lawyers
and
less
likely
to
be
able
to
afford
bail
and
because
of
conscious
or
subconscious
prejudice
on
the
part
of
prosecutors
and
judges
black
and
latino
defendants
are
more
likely
to
be
overcharged
n
leading
to
higher
rates
of
plea
bargaining
and
more
likely
to
be
convicted
by
a
jury
if
the
case
goes
to
trial
n
these
discriminatory
stops
searches
arrests
and
convictions
will
become
the
underlying
data
for
the
city
s
predictive
algorithms
and
they
create
two
distinct
problems
for
mechanical
predictions
the
first
is
related
to
the
disproportionately
high
rate
of
encounters
between
the
police
and
members
of
the
minority
community
the
so
called
hassle
rate
n
this
will
create
large
amounts
of
data
about
certain
individuals
or
areas
of
a
city
and
disproportionately
small
amounts
of
data
about
other
individuals
or
areas
thus
when
an
algorithm
determines
whether
a
neighborhood
is
a
high
crime
area
it
will
have
a
skewed
interpretation
of
the
frequency
of
crimes
in
different
areas
this
in
turn
will
lead
to
more
frequent
searches
of
individuals
in
the
high
crime
areas
which
will
create
a
self
fulfilling
prophecy
as
more
individuals
are
stopped
searched
arrested
and
thus
convicted
in
those
areas
likewise
if
an
individual
is
determined
to
be
at
high
risk
for
committing
a
crime
it
could
merely
be
reflecting
the
prejudices
of
police
officers
who
have
had
previous
encounters
with
the
individual
n
professor
bernard
harcourt
refers
to
this
as
the
ratchet
effect
if
certain
factors
are
already
perceived
as
leading
to
higher
levels
of
criminal
activity
a
predictive
algorithm
will
lead
police
and
judges
to
conduct
and
authorize
more
searches
on
suspects
who
meet
these
factors
leading
to
more
arrests
that
are
linked
to
those
factors
n
the
second
problem
relates
to
the
disproportionately
high
ratio
of
convictions
to
arrests
for
minority
populations
what
is
usually
referred
to
as
the
hit
rate
n
the
primary
way
to
know
whether
a
stop
search
or
arrest
is
successful
is
a
hit
is
by
examining
conviction
rates
thus
even
if
in
fact
the
police
do
find
contraband
at
the
same
rate
for
every
ethnic
group
that
is
searched
if
certain
minority
groups
are
convicted
at
a
higher
rate
after
the
contraband
is
discovered
the
statistics
will
indicate
a
higher
hit
rate
for
those
minority
groups
than
for
others
in
other
words
because
these
citizens
are
unfairly
convicted
at
a
higher
rate
the
stops
and
searches
that
are
conducted
against
them
will
appear
to
be
more
effective
n
as
with
the
decision
making
process
itself
this
problem
is
not
new
to
mechanical
predictions
the
data
that
are
used
by
police
officers
and
judges
today
their
own
personal
experiences
is
similarly
flawed
n
the
danger
in
moving
towards
a
big
data
analysis
in
this
context
is
not
that
a
new
problem
will
be
created
but
that
despite
big
data
s
promise
of
being
color
blind
and
objective
the
old
problems
will
persist
even
worse
these
old
problems
will
become
institutionalized
and
thus
be
even
harder
to
successfully
challenge
and
expose
because
they
are
presented
as
part
of
the
hard
science
of
big
data
these
problems
with
underlying
data
are
not
insoluble
the
issue
is
common
to
many
uses
of
big
data
and
it
arises
when
statistics
that
are
kept
for
one
purpose
are
used
for
another
n
stop
and
frisk
statistics
and
criminal
conviction
numbers
are
not
recorded
for
the
purposes
of
sophisticated
statistical
study
thus
those
who
collect
them
generally
make
no
effort
to
correct
for
any
biases
inherent
in
the
process
n
part
of
the
solution
thus
involves
correcting
the
data
that
is
estimating
the
rate
of
over
representation
of
minorities
in
the
hassle
rates
and
hit
rates
and
then
adjusting
the
numbers
accordingly
n
another
solution
would
be
to
use
data
from
different
sources
not
just
from
information
that
results
from
police
citizen
encounters
for
example
algorithms
could
draw
their
underlying
data
from
the
bureau
of
justice
statistics
national
crime
victimization
survey
n
which
tracks
crimes
based
on
victim
reports
as
opposed
to
the
more
traditional
method
of
tracking
crime
through
police
reports
n
once
again
these
solutions
require
real
transparency
as
to
the
data
being
used
courts
and
policymakers
need
to
demand
to
see
the
source
of
the
data
used
by
the
predictive
algorithms
and
need
to
be
given
the
tools
to
evaluate
whether
the
data
is
representative
of
reality
or
the
product
of
discriminatory
decisions
or
unfair
processes
from
the
past
b
ensuring
the
computer
looks
for
individualized
suspicion
individualized
suspicion
is
a
bedrock
requirement
of
almost
any
police
action
that
implicates
the
fourth
amendment
n
if
police
officers
knew
that
statistically
speaking
of
everyone
living
in
a
certain
building
were
guilty
of
possessing
drugs
they
would
not
be
allowed
to
arrest
everyone
in
the
building
even
though
they
would
almost
certainly
have
probable
cause
to
believe
that
each
person
is
guilty
n
the
fourth
amendment
demands
a
certain
level
of
particularity
that
is
not
merely
a
statistical
likelihood
that
a
suspect
is
guilty
based
on
his
membership
in
a
certain
group
but
a
reference
to
particular
characteristics
or
actions
by
the
suspect
that
shows
that
he
specifically
is
likely
to
be
guilty
n
one
objection
to
using
mechanical
predictions
is
that
they
will
dilute
or
even
eliminate
the
individualization
requirement
by
focusing
on
broad
categories
instead
of
the
individual
s
particularized
conduct
n
even
if
big
data
s
mechanical
predictions
could
lead
to
more
accurate
results
it
would
be
legally
and
morally
wrong
to
punish
a
person
based
on
membership
in
a
specific
group
such
as
economic
class
or
age
instead
of
focusing
on
the
person
s
individual
actions
n
in
order
to
address
this
concern
we
first
have
to
define
what
we
mean
when
we
say
that
suspicion
must
be
individualized
n
in
general
we
mean
that
police
officers
must
look
at
the
specific
characteristics
and
actions
of
the
suspect
himself
and
not
determine
reasonable
suspicion
or
probable
cause
merely
because
the
suspect
is
a
member
of
a
certain
group
however
individualized
suspicion
does
not
preclude
inferring
facts
about
an
individual
based
on
his
membership
in
a
certain
group
it
simply
requires
the
presence
of
additional
factors
that
are
specific
to
the
suspect
even
in
the
analog
world
of
clinical
judgments
police
officers
and
judges
routinely
rely
on
assumptions
about
an
individual
based
in
part
on
the
characteristics
of
their
group
for
example
police
officers
will
give
some
weight
to
a
suspect
s
known
gang
affiliation
while
magistrates
making
bail
determinations
will
consider
whether
a
defendant
is
unemployed
or
has
a
criminal
record
however
it
would
be
inappropriate
to
stop
search
or
arrest
an
individual
solely
based
on
his
membership
in
a
specific
group
n
this
would
essentially
be
saying
that
the
group
characteristics
of
the
individual
are
so
suspicious
that
at
any
given
moment
there
is
reason
to
believe
that
he
is
likely
to
be
engaging
in
criminal
activity
in
order
to
avoid
this
problem
courts
have
held
that
the
police
officer
must
observe
conduct
that
gives
her
some
reason
to
believe
that
the
suspect
is
currently
engaging
in
criminal
activity
n
these
actions
may
be
legal
but
suspicious
conduct
such
as
running
from
the
police
exiting
a
location
where
drugs
are
known
to
be
sold
while
sticking
something
in
a
pocket
or
wearing
a
heavy
coat
on
a
summer
day
or
they
may
be
legal
and
innocuous
conduct
such
as
purchasing
a
one
way
ticket
or
traveling
with
no
luggage
but
the
reasonable
suspicion
or
probable
cause
cannot
be
based
only
on
who
the
person
is
it
must
also
be
based
on
what
the
person
does
n
the
supreme
court
has
repeatedly
reminded
us
of
the
need
to
consider
the
specific
actions
of
the
individual
being
searched
in
ybarra
v
illinois
law
enforcement
officers
with
a
warrant
to
search
a
tavern
decided
to
stop
and
frisk
every
individual
inside
the
tavern
under
the
theory
that
mere
presence
in
a
tavern
where
drugs
were
being
sold
generated
reasonable
suspicion
that
a
person
possessed
drugs
n
the
supreme
court
rejected
this
argument
explaining
that
the
terry
exception
does
not
permit
a
frisk
for
weapons
on
less
than
reasonable
belief
or
suspicion
directed
at
the
person
to
be
frisked
n
a
mechanical
prediction
that
is
used
to
demonstrate
reasonable
suspicion
or
probable
cause
must
meet
these
same
criteria
n
law
school
hypotheticals
aside
it
is
hard
to
imagine
a
situation
in
the
real
world
where
group
characteristics
alone
rise
to
the
level
of
reasonable
suspicion
but
it
is
theoretically
possible
that
a
mechanical
prediction
would
arrive
at
such
a
result
thus
any
predictive
software
used
to
calculate
whether
reasonable
suspicion
or
probable
cause
exists
must
require
the
observing
officer
to
input
the
specific
actions
of
the
suspect
as
well
as
his
general
characteristics
the
software
would
thus
use
these
specific
actions
as
part
of
its
analysis
and
it
would
be
designed
in
such
a
way
that
it
could
not
find
reasonable
suspicion
or
probable
cause
regardless
of
the
percentage
chance
of
criminal
activity
occurring
unless
the
specific
actions
were
a
significant
factor
in
the
determination
n
c
changing
the
legal
standards
so
far
in
evaluating
the
obstacles
to
adapting
big
data
to
criminal
law
we
have
looked
at
the
potential
problems
with
the
underlying
data
or
the
methods
used
to
process
that
data
in
other
words
we
have
been
concerned
with
shaping
the
way
that
mechanical
predictions
are
made
in
order
to
ensure
that
they
are
consistent
with
the
requirements
of
our
criminal
procedure
jurisprudence
but
even
if
these
problems
are
solved
we
face
a
potentially
even
greater
obstacle
reshaping
the
criminal
procedure
jurisprudence
so
that
it
can
use
the
information
provided
by
big
data
simply
stated
the
quantitative
results
from
mechanical
predictions
are
incompatible
with
the
broad
flexible
standards
used
by
police
and
judges
in
the
world
of
criminal
procedure
n
reasonable
suspicion
and
probable
cause
are
standards
that
have
been
intentionally
kept
vague
by
the
courts
the
supreme
court
has
long
resisted
setting
specific
probabilities
for
the
flexible
concepts
of
reasonable
suspicion
or
probable
cause
n
explaining
that
it
is
a
practical
nontechnical
conception
which
is
incapable
of
precise
definition
or
quantification
into
percentages
n
the
court
explains
to
us
that
the
concepts
are
not
readily
or
even
usefully
reduced
to
a
neat
set
of
legal
rules
n
and
then
follows
through
on
this
promise
by
providing
a
multitude
of
messy
rules
for
police
and
lower
courts
to
follow
probable
cause
is
defined
as
evidence
that
would
warrant
a
man
of
prudence
and
caution
in
believing
that
the
offense
has
been
committed
or
as
a
reasonable
ground
to
believe
that
the
accused
is
guilty
n
reasonable
suspicion
is
defined
as
obviously
less
demanding
than
probable
cause
n
requiring
merely
some
minimal
level
of
objective
justification
n
these
definitions
are
rather
unhelpful
in
providing
guidance
or
clarity
as
to
when
a
stop
or
a
search
is
appropriate
no
lay
person
would
possibly
know
what
these
terms
mean
in
the
real
world
police
officers
and
law
students
must
study
dozens
of
fact
patterns
from
case
law
to
get
a
sense
of
what
kinds
of
factors
will
create
reasonable
suspicion
or
probable
cause
forty
five
years
ago
one
law
professor
surveyed
federal
judges
to
ask
them
to
quantify
the
concept
of
probable
cause
and
the
results
ranged
from
ten
percent
to
ninety
percent
n
the
same
group
of
judges
was
asked
to
quantify
the
concept
of
reasonable
suspicion
and
most
judges
gave
responses
between
ten
percent
and
sixty
percent
n
this
imprecision
has
its
costs
it
creates
inconsistency
from
jurisdiction
to
jurisdiction
and
even
from
judge
to
judge
and
it
makes
it
harder
for
police
to
know
whether
their
actions
are
legal
at
the
time
they
take
those
actions
n
it
also
forces
magistrates
and
judges
to
rely
on
the
subjective
descriptions
and
personal
judgments
of
the
police
officers
since
these
vague
standards
breed
vague
descriptions
to
meet
those
standards
such
as
high
crime
neighborhood
acting
nervous
and
suspicious
hand
movements
police
officers
who
testify
to
these
factors
are
usually
not
acting
in
bad
faith
they
are
merely
trying
to
find
ways
to
satisfy
an
ambiguous
legal
standard
perhaps
worst
of
all
the
imprecise
standards
make
it
difficult
to
evaluate
the
constitutionality
of
law
enforcement
actions
on
a
larger
scale
assume
that
a
study
of
all
probable
cause
based
automobile
searches
in
a
jurisdiction
demonstrated
that
of
the
time
the
police
found
contraband
does
this
mean
that
the
police
in
this
jurisdiction
are
following
the
law
or
that
they
are
violating
people
s
rights
without
any
quantification
of
the
standard
it
is
impossible
to
tell
to
some
extent
the
imprecision
of
these
terms
was
a
necessary
evil
if
the
supreme
court
had
instructed
police
that
they
needed
to
be
at
least
certain
of
an
individual
s
guilt
before
conducting
a
terry
stop
the
precise
quantification
would
not
have
helped
individual
officers
in
making
their
on
the
spot
decisions
it
makes
more
sense
for
officers
to
be
given
some
broad
guidelines
e
g
more
than
a
mere
hunch
or
some
level
of
objective
justification
required
and
then
teach
them
through
training
and
trial
and
error
what
courts
will
approve
and
what
they
will
not
e
g
observing
a
suspect
leave
a
known
crack
house
and
then
run
from
a
uniformed
police
officer
constitutes
reasonable
suspicion
observing
a
suspect
leave
a
known
crack
house
with
no
other
suspicious
behavior
does
not
similarly
telling
a
magistrate
that
she
should
only
issue
the
warrant
if
there
is
a
chance
of
finding
contraband
would
be
unlikely
to
help
her
make
the
decision
in
a
world
of
clinical
judgments
the
magistrate
must
consider
the
myriad
of
subjective
factors
from
the
police
officer
s
affidavit
the
credibility
of
an
informant
the
reports
of
unusual
but
not
blatantly
illegal
activity
and
so
on
given
the
messiness
of
the
evidence
confronted
by
police
and
judges
a
messy
standard
makes
the
most
sense
such
a
standard
allows
the
decision
makers
to
follow
their
intuition
and
make
a
subjective
judgment
about
whether
something
seems
not
right
about
this
situation
reasonable
suspicion
or
i
believe
there
is
a
good
chance
that
a
crime
has
been
committed
probable
cause
n
indeed
many
judges
who
were
polled
about
percentages
for
probable
cause
and
reasonable
suspicion
in
the
survey
refused
to
answer
the
questions
arguing
that
using
percentages
would
be
misleading
because
burdens
of
proof
deal
with
qualitative
judgments
rather
than
quantitative
judgments
n
numerous
scholars
have
also
objected
to
creating
specific
quantifiable
standards
for
example
professor
orin
kerr
argues
that
quantification
of
probable
cause
would
lead
to
less
accurate
probable
cause
determinations
because
warrant
applications
only
provide
a
limited
amount
of
information
and
under
the
current
system
judges
are
able
to
use
their
intuition
to
account
for
the
missing
facts
n
professor
kerr
argues
that
when
a
judge
gets
a
warrant
application
she
only
sees
the
selective
facts
that
the
police
want
her
to
see
investigative
techniques
that
successfully
found
evidence
to
build
towards
probable
cause
n
but
the
application
will
not
describe
any
investigative
techniques
that
were
used
that
failed
to
find
evidence
nor
will
it
describe
any
possible
investigative
techniques
that
could
have
been
used
that
were
not
used
n
in
the
current
non
quantified
world
professor
kerr
argues
judges
can
use
their
intuition
about
what
might
be
missing
from
the
warrant
application
and
judges
will
instinctively
and
perhaps
subconsciously
factor
that
into
their
decision
n
if
the
probable
cause
standard
became
quantified
at
say
judges
would
merely
calculate
the
odds
incorrectly
based
on
the
selective
facts
in
the
affidavit
and
would
suppress
their
natural
intuition
to
be
suspicious
about
the
facts
that
might
not
have
been
included
although
professor
kerr
claims
his
argument
is
based
on
the
value
of
judicial
intuition
it
is
really
about
the
need
for
particularized
suspicion
he
uses
an
example
of
law
enforcement
who
have
a
well
documented
study
that
of
all
harvard
dorm
rooms
contain
illegal
drugs
and
he
posits
that
police
officers
attempt
to
use
that
study
to
get
a
warrant
to
search
a
specific
dorm
room
n
a
judge
would
rightfully
be
suspicious
of
this
request
he
argues
because
the
judge
s
intuition
would
make
her
wonder
why
the
police
have
chosen
this
room
in
particular
thus
leading
to
the
conclusion
that
she
is
not
getting
the
full
story
from
the
police
n
but
this
is
merely
a
restatement
of
the
requirement
that
suspicion
be
particularized
that
the
affidavit
must
contain
some
information
that
links
this
specific
suspect
to
the
illicit
activity
and
as
noted
above
n
this
is
an
important
consideration
in
designing
big
data
s
algorithms
for
criminal
law
application
we
need
to
either
ensure
that
the
inputs
contained
some
reference
to
the
individual
actions
or
behavior
of
the
suspect
himself
or
allow
for
police
and
judges
to
add
in
their
own
observations
of
individual
activity
n
a
more
troubling
critique
of
using
predictive
algorithms
is
the
supreme
court
s
requirement
that
the
decision
maker
use
a
totality
of
the
circumstances
test
in
determining
whether
reasonable
suspicion
or
probable
cause
exist
n
professor
michael
rich
argues
that
a
predictive
algorithm
can
never
determine
probable
cause
on
its
own
because
the
algorithm
is
by
definition
limited
in
the
factors
that
it
considers
in
making
its
determination
n
a
predictive
algorithm
might
be
programmed
to
consider
only
a
handful
of
factors
or
it
might
be
programmed
to
consider
hundreds
of
factors
but
it
can
never
consider
every
factor
that
could
possibly
be
relevant
to
a
probable
cause
analysis
n
a
human
being
at
least
has
the
potential
to
incorporate
new
observations
but
a
predictive
algorithm
is
limited
by
its
previous
programming
n
one
response
to
this
critique
is
that
it
somewhat
misrepresents
what
the
court
means
by
totality
of
the
circumstances
this
requirement
does
not
mean
that
the
decision
maker
must
consider
every
possible
factor
that
would
be
impossible
for
a
human
being
or
a
computer
indeed
courts
have
noted
that
once
a
police
officer
has
established
that
probable
cause
exists
the
officer
is
under
no
further
duty
to
investigate
or
gather
exculpatory
data
n
instead
totality
of
the
circumstances
means
two
things
first
courts
should
reject
a
formalistic
checklist
of
factors
such
as
the
pre
gates
two
pronged
test
n
and
be
willing
to
consider
many
different
factors
in
deciding
whether
probable
cause
exists
n
certainly
a
predictive
algorithm
can
be
designed
to
consider
hundreds
of
different
factors
far
more
than
the
average
police
officer
observing
the
scene
and
far
more
than
are
typically
included
in
an
affidavit
in
a
warrant
application
n
it
is
true
that
no
predictive
algorithm
will
ever
be
able
to
consider
every
relevant
factor
whether
inculpatory
or
exculpatory
but
of
course
this
is
also
true
for
police
officers
and
judges
in
fact
predictive
algorithms
could
conceivably
process
thousands
of
different
factors
many
more
than
a
human
being
could
it
is
easy
to
come
up
with
examples
of
cases
in
which
a
police
officer
makes
an
observation
that
is
not
programmed
into
the
predictive
algorithm
and
which
dramatically
increases
or
decreases
the
level
of
suspicion
in
a
situation
but
it
is
equally
easy
if
not
easier
to
think
of
examples
in
which
a
predictive
algorithm
considers
relevant
factors
that
an
average
police
officer
would
never
consider
many
of
the
factors
that
human
police
officers
consider
to
be
relevant
may
in
fact
be
irrelevant
or
may
be
given
insufficient
weight
or
too
much
weight
and
as
many
commentators
have
pointed
out
some
of
the
intuitions
of
police
officers
and
even
judges
are
grounded
in
implicit
racial
bias
making
their
conclusions
not
just
inaccurate
but
also
discriminatory
n
second
the
police
and
courts
must
also
consider
potential
exculpatory
evidence
as
part
of
the
totality
of
the
circumstances
since
certain
observations
or
background
facts
may
lower
the
level
of
suspicion
n
predictive
algorithms
can
and
should
be
programmed
to
consider
possible
exculpatory
evidence
as
well
and
to
weigh
that
evidence
in
reaching
their
conclusions
in
short
quantifying
these
standards
will
allow
police
and
judges
to
use
predictive
algorithms
bringing
a
number
of
benefits
the
opportunity
to
reduce
discriminatory
bias
in
the
system
greater
accountability
for
police
actions
and
a
higher
level
of
accuracy
that
is
fewer
searches
of
those
who
are
innocent
and
more
searches
of
those
who
are
in
fact
engaged
in
criminal
activity
there
is
nothing
inherent
about
these
tests
that
would
forbid
courts
from
adopting
quantitative
standards
but
courts
have
been
extremely
reluctant
to
do
so
n
in
the
next
part
we
will
talk
about
the
feasibility
of
such
a
shift
iii
making
big
data
work
in
the
criminal
justice
system
under
current
law
a
police
officer
seeking
a
search
warrant
states
that
she
believes
there
is
probable
cause
to
believe
that
contraband
will
be
found
in
the
suspect
s
house
and
a
judge
appraises
that
assertion
by
reviewing
and
evaluating
the
facts
that
the
police
officer
places
in
her
affidavit
including
the
credibility
of
any
informants
and
of
the
police
officer
herself
the
judge
then
reaches
her
own
conclusion
about
whether
a
person
of
reasonable
caution
would
believe
that
contraband
is
present
at
the
location
in
a
world
of
predictive
algorithms
the
police
officer
will
instead
present
the
magistrate
with
the
output
of
a
computer
program
which
states
that
there
is
a
chance
that
contraband
will
be
found
in
the
suspect
s
house
the
judge
will
then
examine
the
algorithm
that
was
used
to
ensure
that
it
meets
the
appropriate
legal
standards
and
will
then
make
a
ruling
as
to
whether
the
prediction
is
sufficient
to
establish
probable
cause
depending
on
the
circumstances
the
judge
may
make
a
decision
based
solely
on
the
output
of
the
algorithm
the
outcome
determinative
model
or
she
may
consider
the
output
of
the
algorithm
as
one
factor
to
combine
with
other
relevant
facts
the
formal
factor
model
as
we
have
seen
in
the
previous
parts
in
order
to
reach
this
world
we
must
overcome
a
number
of
obstacles
first
the
judge
needs
to
know
that
the
computer
is
not
using
discriminatory
factors
or
data
that
merely
reinforces
past
discrimination
second
the
judge
will
need
to
confirm
that
at
least
some
of
the
factors
used
by
the
computer
are
specific
to
this
particular
suspect
and
that
the
figure
is
not
merely
derived
from
aggregate
group
probability
figures
if
the
algorithm
has
no
factors
that
are
based
on
individualized
suspicion
a
judge
needs
to
combine
the
result
with
specific
facts
about
this
particular
suspect
in
order
to
arrive
at
her
own
prediction
and
finally
we
need
to
know
whether
the
chance
of
finding
contraband
or
whatever
number
the
judge
settles
on
after
factoring
in
other
information
is
sufficient
to
convince
a
judge
that
a
person
of
reasonable
caution
would
believe
that
contraband
is
present
in
order
to
overcome
this
final
problem
courts
must
overcome
their
hostility
to
quantifying
the
legal
standards
that
make
up
the
backbone
of
criminal
procedure
thus
in
order
to
create
a
system
where
police
officers
and
judges
use
data
centric
mechanical
predictions
in
making
their
decisions
two
major
changes
must
occur
first
the
predictive
algorithms
must
be
sufficiently
transparent
to
allow
judges
to
ensure
that
the
algorithm
is
not
relying
upon
unconstitutional
factors
either
directly
or
indirectly
in
reaching
its
conclusions
transparency
is
also
required
so
that
judges
can
ensure
that
at
least
some
of
the
factors
leading
to
this
number
are
specific
to
this
particular
suspect
and
as
we
will
see
transparency
is
also
necessary
so
that
judges
can
add
additional
factors
to
these
algorithms
in
order
to
adjust
their
results
to
the
facts
of
a
specific
case
second
courts
must
overcome
their
resistance
to
quantifying
these
legal
standards
so
that
the
numerical
results
from
mechanical
predictions
can
be
applied
to
these
legal
determinations
as
part
of
overcoming
that
reluctance
in
some
cases
judges
must
also
become
comfortable
with
manipulating
these
probabilities
and
combining
them
with
other
factors
in
order
to
reach
their
own
independent
conclusions
a
transparent
algorithms
and
data
sets
the
first
step
is
to
convince
companies
who
make
these
algorithms
to
share
the
details
of
their
operation
if
not
the
source
code
at
least
the
factors
that
their
predictive
models
consider
and
the
weight
that
the
models
assign
to
each
factor
the
transparency
requirement
is
necessary
not
only
for
the
algorithm
itself
but
also
for
the
underlying
data
sets
in
order
to
avoid
the
ratchet
effect
discussed
earlier
n
courts
need
to
be
able
to
examine
the
underlying
evidence
being
used
by
the
algorithm
to
ensure
that
they
are
not
already
tainted
by
race
or
by
proxies
for
race
and
if
they
are
the
data
sets
need
to
be
adjusted
in
order
to
remove
the
taint
greater
transparency
for
the
data
sets
will
also
help
with
another
growing
problem
with
our
increasing
reliance
on
big
data
erroneous
information
in
the
government
and
private
databases
upon
which
these
algorithms
rely
n
as
we
have
seen
earlier
police
are
already
relying
on
these
predictive
algorithms
to
direct
resources
and
place
certain
people
under
suspicion
so
cleansing
the
algorithms
of
discriminatory
factors
and
purging
inaccurate
information
is
already
long
overdue
another
reason
to
mandate
transparency
is
to
ensure
that
the
individualized
suspicion
requirement
is
met
as
noted
above
n
some
predictive
algorithms
may
base
their
conclusions
solely
on
group
membership
and
external
factors
thus
violating
the
legal
requirement
that
reasonable
suspicion
or
probable
cause
be
based
on
individualized
suspicion
if
the
inputs
used
by
the
algorithm
are
open
for
the
judge
to
examine
then
she
can
ensure
that
the
conclusion
is
based
on
the
appropriate
level
of
individual
activity
and
if
there
are
no
inputs
based
on
individualized
suspicion
the
judge
must
demand
additional
facts
from
the
law
enforcement
officer
in
order
to
establish
individualized
suspicion
that
is
she
will
be
forced
to
switch
from
an
outcome
determinative
use
of
predictive
algorithms
to
a
formal
factor
model
unfortunately
up
until
now
companies
have
been
extremely
secretive
about
the
details
of
their
predictive
algorithms
presumably
because
they
consider
these
details
to
be
valuable
proprietary
information
n
the
company
that
provides
the
beware
software
to
police
departments
does
not
even
allow
the
police
departments
to
know
the
details
of
the
algorithm
n
recently
the
american
civil
liberties
union
aclu
had
to
make
a
public
records
request
to
the
fresno
police
seeking
information
about
the
factors
used
by
its
predictive
software
the
results
still
did
not
provide
anything
like
the
kind
of
transparency
necessary
to
evaluate
the
constitutionality
of
the
program
n
this
secrecy
is
not
limited
to
private
corporations
even
private
individuals
who
design
these
algorithms
refuse
to
disclose
exactly
how
they
work
n
thus
far
this
secrecy
has
not
posed
significant
legal
problems
since
predictive
algorithms
are
only
being
used
to
direct
police
resources
but
this
is
likely
to
change
in
the
near
future
regardless
of
whether
police
and
courts
begin
to
use
predictive
algorithms
to
establish
legal
cause
to
stop
or
search
there
is
growing
concern
that
the
use
of
mechanical
predictions
is
merely
a
sophisticated
form
of
racial
profiling
n
and
if
police
want
to
continue
to
use
algorithms
in
any
capacity
they
will
need
to
reveal
or
require
their
client
companies
to
reveal
the
details
of
these
algorithms
this
greater
transparency
will
not
only
reassure
the
public
and
the
courts
that
the
determinative
factors
used
by
the
algorithm
are
not
related
to
race
but
it
will
also
lay
the
groundwork
for
adopting
these
algorithms
more
formally
into
the
legal
system
and
not
incidentally
it
may
reveal
that
some
algorithms
are
relying
on
forbidden
factors
in
reaching
their
conclusions
which
of
course
would
require
the
algorithm
to
be
redesigned
with
the
offending
factors
removed
the
aclu
s
recent
public
records
request
for
example
revealed
that
one
of
the
fresno
police
department
s
predictive
software
algorithms
used
the
social
media
hashtag
blacklivesmatter
as
a
risk
factor
for
police
hate
crimes
n
but
requiring
the
software
engineers
and
statisticians
who
design
mechanical
predictions
to
reveal
the
factors
being
used
and
the
weights
assigned
to
each
factor
is
only
the
first
step
modern
day
predictive
software
is
not
static
the
more
sophisticated
algorithms
will
adjust
the
factors
as
they
go
learning
from
past
experience
as
the
algorithm
makes
thousands
or
millions
of
predictions
it
will
be
told
which
of
those
predictions
ended
up
being
accurate
and
it
will
change
the
weight
assigned
to
each
of
its
factors
accordingly
to
improve
its
accuracy
this
process
known
as
machine
learning
n
ensures
that
the
algorithm
s
mechanical
predictions
improve
with
time
but
it
makes
it
even
more
difficult
for
the
courts
to
evaluate
the
degree
to
which
each
factor
is
relevant
to
the
machine
s
conclusions
n
as
one
scholar
has
noted
f
orecasting
becomes
a
distinct
activity
that
differs
from
explanation
what
matters
most
is
forecasting
accuracy
combining
explanation
with
forecasting
can
compromise
both
n
in
other
words
the
most
accurate
algorithms
those
that
use
machine
learning
to
sift
through
millions
of
different
data
points
may
be
the
least
transparent
n
however
as
we
have
seen
in
other
contexts
in
the
criminal
justice
system
it
is
possible
to
overcome
these
obstacles
a
judge
does
not
really
need
an
intricate
understanding
of
the
underlying
code
of
the
algorithm
she
only
needs
to
know
the
factors
that
the
algorithm
used
and
the
historical
accuracy
of
algorithm
s
results
n
although
the
experts
who
design
the
algorithm
need
to
consider
hundreds
or
thousands
of
data
points
in
order
to
determine
which
ones
are
the
most
predictive
for
practical
reasons
the
actual
algorithm
will
probably
only
use
eight
or
nine
factors
just
like
the
sentencing
risk
assessment
tools
n
thus
the
first
piece
of
information
should
be
easy
for
law
enforcement
to
provide
since
presumably
it
is
law
enforcement
officers
who
input
the
data
and
the
accuracy
of
the
results
should
easily
be
available
since
an
integral
part
of
developing
big
data
s
algorithms
is
to
calculate
and
then
improve
on
the
accuracy
of
the
predictions
that
are
being
made
once
the
judge
obtains
this
information
she
would
then
need
to
evaluate
whether
the
specific
inputs
are
proxies
for
a
forbidden
factor
such
as
race
n
and
whether
they
contain
sufficient
particularity
to
justify
the
stop
search
or
arrest
n
in
other
words
the
judge
does
not
need
to
know
exactly
how
the
algorithm
arrived
at
its
results
only
which
factors
it
considered
in
doing
so
the
judge
would
also
have
to
determine
whether
the
accuracy
of
the
algorithm
is
sufficient
to
meet
the
reasonable
suspicion
or
probable
cause
standard
a
question
we
turn
to
in
the
next
section
and
if
a
judge
did
want
to
understand
the
way
the
algorithm
processed
the
inputs
she
would
not
have
to
personally
decipher
the
meaning
of
the
underlying
source
code
much
less
understand
the
evolution
of
the
data
in
a
machine
learning
environment
just
as
judges
hear
from
experts
in
a
daubert
hearing
when
they
are
called
upon
to
determine
the
reliability
of
a
new
and
complex
scientific
process
a
judge
who
is
called
upon
to
evaluate
the
methodology
and
reliability
of
a
predictive
algorithm
could
also
listen
to
experts
testifying
from
both
sides
n
this
transparency
requirement
should
be
seen
not
as
a
weakness
of
adopting
mechanical
predictions
but
as
one
of
its
strengths
courts
currently
rely
on
a
combination
of
their
own
intuition
an
internal
subjective
algorithm
and
experience
an
internal
limited
database
when
reviewing
the
decisions
of
a
police
officer
decisions
that
are
made
based
on
a
combination
of
the
police
officer
s
intuition
and
experience
it
has
already
been
conclusively
demonstrated
that
these
intuitions
are
subject
to
significant
levels
of
racial
bias
n
but
it
is
difficult
for
a
magistrate
to
know
if
or
to
what
degree
her
own
intuition
may
be
suffering
from
this
problem
likewise
the
magistrate
s
personal
experiences
are
likely
based
in
part
on
problematic
data
these
hidden
biases
are
very
difficult
to
remove
from
a
person
s
decision
making
process
n
with
the
proper
transparency
requirements
however
these
biases
can
be
easily
detected
in
algorithms
and
data
sets
of
mechanical
predictions
b
quantifying
the
legal
standards
lack
of
transparency
is
not
only
a
problem
for
those
who
collect
and
process
the
data
but
also
for
those
who
use
the
data
that
is
the
judges
who
apply
the
legal
standards
if
the
quantified
results
from
the
world
of
big
data
are
going
to
be
used
effectively
in
the
courts
judges
will
need
to
update
the
legal
standards
that
they
use
setting
a
number
perhaps
the
most
challenging
aspect
of
adopting
predictive
algorithms
is
determining
the
quantified
percentage
to
match
up
with
reasonable
suspicion
or
probable
cause
n
the
vagueness
of
the
current
rules
obscures
any
attempt
to
determine
how
much
suspicion
is
actually
necessary
to
reach
these
standards
and
courts
have
routinely
stated
that
these
standards
should
not
or
even
cannot
be
reduced
to
mere
numerical
probabilities
n
but
if
the
criminal
justice
system
is
going
to
benefit
from
the
increased
accuracy
and
potential
reduction
of
unfair
bias
that
is
offered
by
predictive
algorithms
courts
will
need
to
overcome
their
hostility
to
quantification
quantifying
these
standards
may
lead
to
other
benefits
as
well
one
positive
side
effect
of
greater
quantification
is
the
possibility
of
creating
precise
standards
for
different
situations
what
professor
christopher
slobogin
refers
to
as
the
proportionality
principle
n
courts
or
legislatures
could
craft
specific
standards
for
the
most
intrusive
searches
such
as
wiretaps
or
bodily
intrusions
and
lower
standards
on
a
sliding
scale
as
searches
become
less
invasive
searches
of
homes
searches
of
cars
searches
of
offices
frisks
flyovers
surveilling
public
spaces
n
of
course
courts
and
legislatures
already
have
created
these
different
standards
to
some
degree
n
but
the
lack
of
quantification
has
made
this
process
confusing
and
limited
the
number
of
tiers
that
can
realistically
be
created
other
commentators
have
argued
that
quantifying
the
probable
cause
standard
would
enable
courts
to
adopt
a
sliding
scale
based
on
the
severity
of
the
crime
being
investigated
n
courts
have
so
far
been
reluctant
to
entertain
this
idea
generally
holding
that
one
standard
should
apply
across
the
board
to
every
criminal
investigation
n
but
as
professor
craig
lerner
has
pointed
out
courts
have
dropped
some
hints
that
the
probable
cause
standard
should
be
lower
for
police
investigating
a
mass
shooting
or
a
kidnapped
child
than
they
would
be
for
a
low
level
drug
possession
case
n
judge
richard
posner
for
example
writing
an
en
banc
decision
for
the
seventh
circuit
held
that
probable
cause
should
be
a
function
of
the
gravity
of
the
crime
in
the
context
of
exigent
circumstances
n
this
type
of
sliding
scale
would
be
all
but
impossible
to
administer
with
the
current
broad
standards
only
with
greater
precision
can
courts
make
meaningful
distinctions
in
different
contexts
professor
erica
goldberg
also
points
out
that
the
imprecise
nature
of
the
current
standards
for
probable
cause
tends
to
create
a
very
low
bar
in
practice
because
of
the
good
faith
exception
to
the
exclusionary
rule
n
under
this
exception
even
if
a
reviewing
court
finds
that
a
warrant
lacked
probable
cause
the
illegally
obtained
evidence
will
still
be
admissible
as
long
as
the
officer
acted
in
good
faith
that
is
as
long
as
the
warrant
was
not
so
lacking
in
probable
cause
as
to
render
official
belief
in
its
existence
entirely
unreasonable
n
a
vague
probable
cause
standard
means
that
many
warrants
that
fall
short
of
the
probable
cause
standard
will
in
practice
result
in
evidence
that
can
be
used
in
trial
as
long
as
the
lack
of
probable
cause
was
not
obvious
to
the
officer
n
if
the
probable
cause
standard
were
quantified
it
could
also
be
enforced
with
more
regularity
against
police
officers
who
would
be
much
less
able
to
claim
the
good
faith
exception
when
a
warrant
did
not
in
fact
meet
the
proper
standard
there
is
a
possibility
that
if
we
use
actual
data
to
run
these
analyses
we
will
learn
that
our
standards
for
stops
arrests
and
warrants
are
embarrassingly
low
for
example
we
may
learn
that
the
standard
hit
rate
for
terry
stops
is
and
the
average
hit
rate
for
search
warrants
is
that
is
that
police
officers
conduct
terry
stops
on
individuals
with
only
a
one
in
fifty
chance
that
the
suspect
is
engaged
in
criminal
activity
and
judges
are
issuing
search
warrants
even
though
there
is
only
a
one
in
ten
chance
of
finding
contraband
at
the
named
location
we
may
also
learn
that
these
rates
vary
wildly
depending
on
the
jurisdiction
n
the
suspected
crime
and
as
we
have
already
seen
the
race
of
the
suspect
n
this
information
will
be
yet
another
fringe
benefit
of
shifting
to
a
quantitative
model
if
courts
learn
that
they
are
in
fact
using
a
rate
for
reasonable
suspicion
we
can
have
a
real
debate
about
whether
this
number
is
too
low
and
if
so
what
the
number
ought
to
be
such
a
debate
is
nearly
impossible
to
have
now
because
the
current
standards
are
shrouded
in
intentionally
ambiguous
legalese
once
we
agree
on
a
number
that
number
can
be
imposed
consistently
throughout
the
country
no
longer
will
individuals
in
the
city
be
subjected
to
one
standard
while
individuals
in
the
suburb
receive
a
more
deferential
standard
similar
standards
will
apply
to
those
suspected
of
tax
fraud
as
to
those
suspected
of
possessing
heroin
this
type
of
equality
is
simply
not
feasible
under
our
current
system
yet
another
benefit
to
quantification
will
be
greater
transparency
in
the
factors
that
police
and
courts
use
to
make
these
decisions
n
for
example
consider
the
case
law
surrounding
terry
frisks
which
shows
courts
struggling
to
determine
when
there
is
reasonable
suspicion
to
believe
a
suspect
is
armed
one
commonly
cited
factor
is
the
type
of
crime
the
person
is
suspected
of
having
committed
courts
have
consistently
held
that
some
crimes
such
as
robbery
n
narcotics
trafficking
n
growing
large
amounts
of
marijuana
n
rape
n
or
burglary
n
all
involve
a
high
risk
of
the
suspect
carrying
a
weapon
and
are
thus
a
legitimate
factor
in
determining
whether
the
suspect
is
armed
n
but
is
the
nature
of
the
crime
enough
on
its
own
to
create
reasonable
suspicion
is
it
enough
when
combined
with
one
other
observation
by
the
police
officer
such
as
a
furtive
move
or
a
suspicious
bulge
generally
courts
will
find
that
if
the
officer
reasonably
believes
that
the
suspect
is
guilty
of
one
of
these
weapons
likely
crimes
then
that
belief
is
sufficient
to
create
reasonable
suspicion
that
a
suspect
is
armed
n
but
surely
the
risk
of
a
suspect
carrying
a
weapon
is
not
identical
for
all
five
of
those
crimes
so
in
theory
courts
should
require
some
corroboration
in
the
case
of
certain
suspected
crimes
and
less
or
none
in
the
case
of
others
this
is
not
what
happens
courts
merely
state
that
the
suspected
crime
is
likely
to
involve
the
use
of
weapons
n
and
then
generally
find
that
the
frisk
was
justified
meanwhile
other
suspected
crimes
such
as
passing
counterfeit
money
n
or
possession
of
illegal
drugs
n
are
held
to
not
be
a
legitimate
factor
that
is
an
individual
suspected
of
these
crimes
has
absolutely
no
greater
likelihood
than
anyone
else
to
be
carrying
a
weapon
in
reaching
these
conclusions
courts
generally
rely
on
their
intuition
rather
than
any
actual
evidence
that
indicates
the
prevalence
or
dearth
of
weapons
on
suspects
who
commit
these
crimes
and
in
the
absence
of
empirical
evidence
courts
create
a
false
binary
categorization
suspicion
of
certain
crimes
generates
reasonable
suspicion
on
its
own
while
suspicion
of
other
crimes
does
not
add
to
the
probability
of
a
weapon
being
present
occasionally
courts
do
venture
into
the
realm
of
data
when
deciding
whether
reasonable
suspicion
or
probable
cause
exist
with
decidedly
mixed
results
in
a
recent
case
the
ninth
circuit
attempted
to
determine
if
suspicion
of
domestic
violence
was
a
legitimate
factor
in
determining
whether
the
individual
was
armed
n
the
majority
held
that
suspicion
of
domestic
violence
did
not
increase
the
likelihood
of
the
suspect
possessing
a
weapon
to
support
its
conclusion
the
court
cited
studies
that
concluded
that
domestic
violence
calls
for
service
account
for
a
relatively
small
proportion
of
the
overall
rate
of
police
officers
murders
and
that
of
domestic
violence
victims
had
at
some
point
in
their
lives
been
threatened
or
harmed
by
a
weapon
during
a
domestic
violence
incident
n
the
dissent
cited
fbi
studies
demonstrating
that
of
assaults
on
police
officers
in
a
recent
year
were
committed
while
police
were
responding
to
disturbance
calls
which
is
a
category
which
includes
domestic
violence
calls
and
that
over
a
ten
year
period
three
times
more
police
officers
were
killed
responding
to
domestic
violence
calls
than
those
responding
to
burglary
calls
n
none
of
these
studies
establish
any
quantitative
probability
that
perpetrators
of
domestic
violence
use
or
carry
weapons
they
merely
establish
the
undeniable
fact
that
perpetrators
of
domestic
violence
sometimes
carry
weapons
and
sometimes
pose
a
risk
to
police
officers
n
the
court
did
cite
one
seemingly
useful
study
a
bureau
of
justice
report
covering
seven
years
which
concluded
that
of
domestic
violence
attacks
involved
a
weapon
n
but
this
statistic
is
almost
certainly
too
crude
to
be
useful
like
burglary
or
narcotics
trafficking
the
crime
of
domestic
violence
encompasses
many
different
kinds
of
behavior
some
of
them
probably
linked
to
a
high
likelihood
of
weapons
possession
and
some
linked
to
a
relatively
low
likelihood
n
in
order
to
effectively
use
statistics
courts
will
need
more
sophisticated
and
detailed
data
which
can
be
applied
to
the
facts
of
the
specific
case
did
the
alleged
domestic
violence
occur
at
home
or
in
a
public
place
what
percentage
of
individuals
living
in
the
neighborhood
possess
firearms
are
the
police
responding
at
night
or
during
the
daytime
this
type
of
detailed
data
needs
to
be
developed
so
that
it
can
be
used
by
the
courts
without
it
courts
may
identify
these
factors
as
relevant
but
then
apply
their
own
flawed
intuition
as
to
how
each
factor
affects
the
ultimate
question
of
reasonable
suspicion
of
course
even
if
better
data
were
available
the
data
would
be
insufficient
without
a
quantitative
standard
to
judge
it
against
assume
that
the
court
had
access
to
a
database
that
stated
that
of
all
the
domestic
violence
calls
in
this
neighborhood
during
this
time
of
day
in
the
past
five
years
of
the
suspects
were
armed
when
the
police
arrived
would
that
constitute
reasonable
suspicion
if
not
how
close
is
it
close
enough
that
a
suspicious
movement
by
the
suspect
is
enough
to
put
the
risk
across
the
line
n
without
a
quantified
definition
of
reasonable
suspicion
judges
are
unable
to
answer
these
questions
and
so
instead
they
create
an
inaccurate
binary
distinction
among
different
types
of
crimes
thus
we
need
to
set
a
quantified
percentage
chance
for
reasonable
suspicion
or
probable
cause
as
we
saw
earlier
judges
appear
to
have
widely
divergent
views
as
to
this
question
with
survey
results
varying
widely
but
averaging
at
for
reasonable
suspicion
and
for
probable
cause
n
the
supreme
court
has
implied
n
and
lower
courts
have
stated
n
that
the
probable
cause
standard
does
not
mean
more
probable
than
not
which
places
the
probable
cause
standard
at
less
than
most
commentators
also
agree
that
probable
cause
is
something
close
to
but
just
less
than
n
while
scattered
evidence
from
prosecutors
and
law
enforcement
point
to
numbers
between
and
n
one
way
to
derive
a
specific
number
for
these
standards
is
to
reverse
engineer
the
stops
and
searches
that
have
been
approved
under
the
current
law
in
other
words
we
can
measure
the
hit
rates
for
stops
and
searches
that
courts
have
approved
using
the
traditional
standards
this
should
provide
us
with
a
number
that
is
at
least
above
the
minimum
level
of
suspicion
that
is
required
for
example
if
across
the
country
courts
approve
of
probable
cause
searches
and
police
find
contraband
in
of
those
searches
we
can
know
that
generally
a
prediction
which
is
accurate
is
at
least
high
enough
to
satisfy
the
probable
cause
standard
unfortunately
there
are
not
many
statistics
available
but
we
do
have
some
actual
data
from
the
real
world
that
can
be
used
as
a
starting
point
for
example
the
district
court
in
the
floyd
case
held
that
the
terry
stops
in
new
york
city
in
the
early
s
were
often
conducted
without
reasonable
suspicion
these
stops
had
a
hit
rate
thus
the
floyd
judge
apparently
considers
a
rate
to
be
too
low
n
in
contrast
we
know
that
before
the
new
york
police
department
began
its
aggressive
stop
and
frisk
policy
its
hit
rate
for
terry
stops
was
a
more
respectable
n
reviewing
probable
cause
searches
of
automobiles
provides
some
real
world
data
as
to
the
percentage
chance
necessary
to
establish
probable
cause
an
independent
review
of
the
san
antonio
police
showed
that
their
probable
cause
automobile
searches
resulted
in
a
hit
rate
of
n
as
part
of
a
settlement
of
a
federal
civil
rights
action
in
maryland
state
troopers
were
required
to
report
every
stop
and
search
of
a
car
on
their
highways
n
which
showed
a
hit
rate
for
probable
cause
searches
n
and
a
review
of
the
florida
state
police
showed
a
success
rate
for
such
searches
n
another
way
to
estimate
the
number
is
to
look
at
cases
involving
alerts
by
drug
sniffing
dogs
which
can
constitute
probable
cause
as
long
as
the
dog
s
reliability
has
been
established
n
thus
when
a
court
needs
to
determine
whether
a
positive
alert
by
a
drug
dog
is
sufficient
to
establish
probable
cause
the
supreme
court
has
instructed
the
reviewing
judge
to
consider
the
training
and
past
performance
of
the
drug
dog
in
controlled
testing
environments
n
lower
courts
have
already
albeit
grudgingly
approved
specific
numerical
success
rates
for
drug
dogs
as
sufficient
to
establish
that
the
dog
s
positive
alert
creates
probable
cause
holding
that
accuracy
rates
of
n
n
n
and
n
were
all
sufficient
to
satisfy
the
probable
cause
standard
n
on
the
other
hand
professor
max
minzner
points
out
that
the
success
rate
for
search
warrants
which
allegedly
use
the
same
probable
cause
standard
are
much
higher
somewhere
between
and
n
although
this
dramatic
disparity
between
different
applications
of
the
probable
cause
standard
makes
it
more
challenging
to
determine
the
proper
number
through
reverse
engineering
it
provides
yet
another
compelling
reason
to
quantify
the
standard
are
courts
being
too
lenient
in
reviewing
probable
cause
for
warrantless
searches
or
are
they
requiring
too
high
a
showing
for
warrant
applications
or
perhaps
we
want
two
different
standards
one
for
the
on
the
spot
decisions
made
by
police
officers
and
one
for
the
greater
legitimacy
and
presumed
legality
of
search
warrants
none
of
these
questions
can
be
truly
addressed
until
the
probable
cause
standard
is
quantified
from
this
brief
review
of
the
available
data
we
can
see
that
hit
rates
for
stops
and
searches
vary
depending
on
the
jurisdiction
and
even
on
the
context
in
which
the
standard
is
applied
thus
if
we
want
to
reverse
engineer
percentages
for
reasonable
suspicion
and
probable
cause
from
the
existing
standards
we
will
need
data
from
a
much
broader
set
of
studies
however
even
the
small
amount
of
data
that
we
have
so
far
confirms
the
estimates
of
commentators
and
courts
that
the
number
for
probable
cause
is
somewhere
between
and
n
there
is
very
little
data
on
the
success
rate
for
stop
and
frisks
that
have
been
approved
by
courts
but
the
floyd
case
implies
that
is
too
low
n
and
we
know
that
the
number
has
to
be
significantly
less
than
the
to
range
for
probable
cause
in
one
sense
the
use
of
predictive
algorithms
to
establish
reasonable
suspicion
or
probable
cause
is
not
so
revolutionary
the
supreme
court
has
not
been
averse
to
using
statistical
data
in
other
fourth
amendment
contexts
for
example
when
the
court
was
determining
whether
a
drunk
driving
checkpoint
was
reasonable
under
the
special
needs
doctrine
it
noted
that
the
checkpoint
resulted
in
a
hit
rate
for
drunk
drivers
n
and
also
that
similar
checkpoints
around
the
country
had
a
hit
rate
n
and
as
noted
above
lower
courts
already
routinely
evaluate
the
reliability
of
certain
tools
such
as
drug
dogs
that
are
used
to
demonstrate
probable
cause
n
the
need
for
courts
to
use
success
rates
to
evaluate
probable
cause
will
only
increase
as
sophisticated
investigative
technologies
such
as
facial
recognition
software
or
gun
detectors
become
more
widely
used
in
a
sense
predictive
algorithms
will
be
doctrinally
no
different
from
these
other
tools
that
are
already
being
used
to
establish
probable
cause
using
the
number
once
a
number
is
set
for
reasonable
suspicion
and
probable
cause
the
next
step
is
to
decide
whether
the
results
from
the
predictive
algorithms
will
be
determinative
of
the
outcome
or
whether
they
will
merely
be
one
of
a
number
of
factors
used
by
officers
and
judges
as
an
example
take
professor
andrew
ferguson
s
modern
day
recreation
of
detective
mcfadden
observing
john
terry
on
the
streets
of
cleveland
mcfadden
observes
john
terry
and
using
facial
recognition
technology
identifies
him
and
begins
to
investigate
using
big
data
detective
mcfadden
learns
through
a
database
search
that
terry
has
a
prior
criminal
record
including
a
couple
of
convictions
and
a
number
of
arrests
mcfadden
learns
through
pattern
matching
links
that
terry
is
an
associate
a
hanger
on
of
a
notorious
violent
local
gangster
billy
cox
who
had
been
charged
with
several
murders
mcfadden
also
learns
that
terry
has
a
substance
abuse
problem
and
is
addicted
to
drugs
n
now
let
us
take
the
next
step
and
assume
that
the
detective
plugs
all
of
john
terry
s
background
information
into
a
predictive
algorithm
which
tells
him
that
john
terry
has
a
chance
of
being
involved
in
criminal
activity
at
any
given
time
during
the
day
this
result
would
certainly
not
be
sufficient
to
create
reasonable
suspicion
then
our
modern
detective
mcfadden
could
do
some
more
quick
research
through
the
police
database
and
add
in
some
other
factors
for
example
that
terry
has
multiple
prior
convictions
for
armed
robbery
of
commercial
establishments
and
license
plate
data
connects
terry
to
prior
commercial
robberies
in
this
area
n
this
combined
with
the
earlier
information
about
terry
tells
the
detective
that
terry
has
a
chance
of
being
armed
with
an
illegal
weapon
at
any
given
time
we
still
do
not
have
anything
like
reasonable
suspicion
indeed
it
is
unlikely
that
mere
background
information
on
a
suspect
could
ever
rise
to
the
level
of
reasonable
suspicion
this
is
akin
to
saying
there
are
certain
people
who
are
so
suspicious
that
there
is
always
reasonable
grounds
to
believe
they
are
engaging
in
criminal
activity
anytime
they
are
seen
in
public
n
regardless
of
how
high
the
prediction
is
based
on
the
background
information
alone
detective
mcfadden
cannot
legally
have
reasonable
suspicion
at
this
point
because
he
has
not
yet
considered
any
individualized
conduct
on
the
part
of
terry
so
detective
mcfadden
must
incorporate
terry
s
individualized
conduct
into
the
calculus
as
it
turns
out
the
detective
sees
terry
pacing
back
and
forth
outside
a
commercial
establishment
multiple
times
looking
in
the
window
and
then
conferring
with
another
individual
n
however
the
modern
day
detective
mcfadden
has
two
options
he
can
take
the
chance
that
terry
is
carrying
an
illegal
weapon
and
then
incorporate
that
into
his
own
subjective
calculation
combining
that
factor
with
his
own
observations
of
terry
pacing
looking
and
conferring
n
or
he
can
simply
input
these
observations
into
the
algorithm
which
would
then
automatically
combine
these
observations
along
with
other
data
in
order
to
give
a
percentage
chance
that
the
suspect
was
in
fact
involved
in
criminal
activity
the
first
is
an
example
of
using
the
predictive
algorithm
as
a
factor
the
second
is
an
example
of
the
outcome
determinative
model
from
this
basic
example
we
can
see
that
the
outcome
determinative
option
has
a
number
of
advantages
first
it
will
be
simpler
for
officers
and
judges
to
apply
since
it
will
not
require
individual
officers
and
judges
to
process
numerical
probabilities
the
algorithm
will
literally
do
all
the
processing
itself
and
give
the
decision
maker
an
exact
number
the
predictive
algorithm
will
presumably
use
statistics
from
thousands
of
previous
cases
in
order
to
establish
whether
the
relevant
facts
create
the
level
of
suspicion
necessary
to
reach
reasonable
suspicion
or
probable
cause
these
results
and
thus
the
algorithm
itself
can
be
periodically
tested
every
few
months
to
ensure
they
are
still
reliable
and
as
part
of
that
testing
the
algorithm
can
be
adjusted
to
give
different
weights
to
different
types
of
data
or
even
to
add
or
remove
certain
types
of
data
altogether
second
the
outcome
determinative
model
will
minimize
the
potentially
biased
factors
that
human
decision
makers
apply
in
making
these
determinations
both
reasonable
suspicion
and
probable
cause
require
the
officer
to
show
specific
objective
facts
to
support
their
conclusion
n
and
forcing
police
officers
to
input
these
specific
facts
into
the
algorithm
will
make
it
harder
for
them
to
consciously
or
subconsciously
use
factors
based
on
race
the
purely
determinative
model
could
even
work
in
cases
where
the
police
officers
and
judges
need
to
evaluate
an
informant
s
reliability
to
make
a
probable
cause
determination
for
example
assume
that
a
reliable
algorithm
is
created
to
predict
the
chance
that
drugs
will
be
found
at
a
certain
location
it
requires
five
different
variables
in
order
to
produce
a
result
and
three
of
these
data
points
are
particularized
with
respect
to
the
suspect
s
observed
behavior
none
of
these
data
points
are
related
either
directly
or
indirectly
to
race
religion
or
any
other
protected
class
assume
that
a
police
officer
has
personal
knowledge
of
all
of
these
factors
and
inputs
them
into
the
software
which
predicts
a
chance
that
drugs
will
be
found
at
the
location
given
these
facts
a
court
will
almost
certainly
find
that
probable
cause
exists
and
a
search
warrant
should
be
issued
how
would
the
model
work
if
the
police
officer
does
not
have
any
personal
knowledge
about
the
case
and
instead
her
affidavit
quotes
an
informant
who
provides
the
information
about
all
five
variables
once
again
all
five
variables
are
entered
into
the
software
and
the
algorithm
predicts
a
chance
that
drugs
will
be
found
at
the
location
assuming
that
the
information
is
correct
how
can
the
algorithm
and
thus
the
judge
take
into
account
the
inevitable
reliability
questions
that
accompany
the
use
of
informants
in
order
to
preserve
the
purely
determinative
model
the
software
must
be
designed
so
that
the
credibility
of
the
informant
can
be
taken
into
account
as
part
of
the
algorithm
in
many
cases
this
would
be
feasible
generally
search
warrant
applications
only
have
a
few
different
categories
of
informants
known
informants
who
have
provided
accurate
information
in
the
past
known
informants
who
have
never
provided
information
before
anonymous
informants
etc
thus
these
specific
categories
could
be
inputs
into
the
software
so
that
after
each
relevant
factor
is
entered
the
algorithm
would
ask
about
the
source
of
the
fact
did
it
come
from
personal
observation
by
the
affiant
police
officer
or
from
an
informant
and
if
from
an
informant
how
much
is
known
about
the
informant
and
his
prior
track
record
n
these
categories
would
be
at
least
as
specific
as
the
descriptions
currently
used
by
police
officers
in
search
warrant
affidavits
any
outcome
determinative
model
in
this
context
will
require
a
far
more
sophisticated
algorithm
with
many
more
potential
inputs
for
the
different
behaviors
that
might
be
observed
and
in
designing
these
algorithms
the
programmers
will
need
to
stay
away
from
the
vague
factors
that
currently
cause
so
much
unreliability
and
are
open
to
abuse
such
as
furtive
movements
or
acting
suspiciously
n
other
inputs
such
as
suspicious
bulge
or
nervous
behavior
which
could
conceivably
refer
to
specific
facts
that
indicate
the
presence
of
criminal
activity
may
need
to
be
defined
with
more
specific
language
and
the
inputs
need
to
include
potentially
exculpatory
information
as
well
in
order
to
ensure
that
the
algorithm
complies
with
the
totality
of
the
circumstances
requirement
of
the
probable
cause
determination
n
given
these
practical
problems
it
is
unlikely
that
any
predictive
algorithm
could
ever
be
designed
that
contains
every
possible
type
of
specific
behavior
that
a
police
officer
might
use
in
making
a
reasonable
suspicion
or
probable
cause
determination
some
predictive
algorithms
could
be
designed
in
certain
basic
often
repeated
scenarios
observations
made
of
individuals
exiting
buildings
where
drugs
are
being
sold
observations
made
during
routine
traffic
stops
etc
n
but
the
potential
range
of
observed
activity
is
simply
too
broad
to
conceive
of
a
world
in
which
every
possible
relevant
factor
is
accounted
for
in
the
computer
programming
and
in
some
cases
the
police
officer
or
judge
may
have
her
own
opinion
about
the
reliability
of
an
informant
that
is
not
accurately
captured
by
the
five
or
six
traditional
categories
that
are
part
of
the
algorithm
s
inputs
furthermore
it
may
be
politically
unacceptable
to
take
human
beings
completely
out
of
the
loop
since
this
would
require
police
officers
and
judges
to
ignore
information
whether
inculpatory
or
exculpatory
that
is
highly
probative
to
the
reasonable
suspicion
probable
cause
determination
thus
there
will
be
some
situations
in
which
the
predictive
algorithm
is
merely
one
of
the
factors
that
the
judge
considers
in
these
cases
the
judge
will
need
to
incorporate
the
conclusions
of
the
predictive
algorithm
alongside
other
factors
we
will
call
these
independent
factors
to
indicate
that
they
are
above
and
beyond
the
factors
used
by
the
algorithm
for
example
assume
that
the
algorithm
uses
five
different
inputs
and
predicts
a
likelihood
that
drugs
will
be
found
at
a
given
location
the
judge
also
knows
about
three
independent
factors
that
on
their
own
do
not
quite
rise
to
the
level
of
probable
cause
the
judge
will
be
provided
with
the
prediction
by
the
software
if
the
predictive
algorithm
is
meant
to
be
one
of
the
many
factors
that
she
considers
she
would
then
need
to
combine
the
from
the
algorithm
and
the
unquantified
almost
but
not
quite
factors
from
her
own
judgment
how
does
she
balance
the
specific
number
from
the
algorithm
with
her
own
intuitive
conclusion
does
she
have
to
quantify
her
almost
but
not
quite
conclusion
assume
she
can
do
this
and
presumably
judges
would
get
better
at
this
task
with
practice
and
she
quantifies
her
subjective
conclusion
at
a
likelihood
how
much
weight
does
she
give
to
her
compared
to
the
from
the
algorithm
in
order
to
accurately
combine
the
results
from
the
predictive
algorithm
with
other
factors
we
need
to
take
two
steps
first
in
order
to
avoid
double
counting
we
need
to
separate
the
factors
that
have
already
been
considered
by
the
algorithm
from
the
factors
that
have
not
n
the
transparency
that
we
already
require
from
these
algorithms
should
make
this
task
easier
the
decision
maker
will
be
able
to
review
the
factors
that
have
already
been
considered
by
the
algorithm
and
then
remove
those
from
her
own
independent
analysis
second
the
decision
maker
must
use
the
predictive
algorithm
as
the
starting
point
and
then
adjust
the
percentage
chance
up
or
down
as
she
adds
in
the
independent
factors
one
method
of
doing
this
is
to
apply
bayes
theorem
which
is
a
process
of
combining
known
probabilities
with
new
evidence
in
order
to
create
a
new
updated
probability
n
the
predictive
algorithm
would
provide
the
decision
maker
with
a
base
rate
or
prior
probability
that
criminal
activity
is
present
and
then
the
decision
maker
would
apply
the
probability
of
criminal
activity
based
on
the
relevant
evidence
that
was
not
considered
by
the
predictive
algorithm
known
as
the
current
probability
n
this
extra
evidence
could
include
personal
observations
on
the
part
of
the
police
officer
assuming
those
observations
were
not
taken
into
account
by
the
algorithm
already
or
extra
information
about
the
reliability
of
the
informant
that
was
not
accounted
for
by
the
algorithm
as
an
example
let
s
return
to
the
modern
day
version
of
detective
mcfadden
and
john
terry
n
we
know
from
our
algorithm
based
only
on
background
information
about
john
terry
that
there
is
a
chance
that
terry
is
carrying
an
illegal
weapon
at
any
given
time
detective
mcfadden
then
observes
him
pacing
looking
and
conferring
and
realizes
this
is
exactly
the
kind
of
behavior
that
he
would
expect
a
potential
robber
to
engage
in
before
committing
the
crime
n
thus
detective
mcfadden
estimates
that
a
person
who
is
planning
a
robbery
is
likely
to
engage
in
the
kind
of
behavior
that
terry
is
currently
engaging
in
and
although
the
detective
realizes
that
there
are
some
innocent
explanations
for
this
kind
of
behavior
perhaps
terry
is
window
shopping
and
then
conferring
with
his
friend
about
what
to
buy
the
fact
that
terry
has
repeated
this
behavior
multiple
times
means
that
the
odds
of
him
not
planning
a
robbery
are
only
about
given
these
estimates
the
detective
can
complete
a
bayesian
calculation
or
more
likely
input
these
estimates
into
a
simple
calculator
that
will
then
conduct
the
bayesian
calculation
and
determine
that
the
chances
that
terry
is
engaged
in
criminal
activity
are
n
assuming
that
courts
set
the
standard
for
reasonable
suspicion
at
around
to
this
would
be
sufficient
to
establish
reasonable
suspicion
in
contrast
assume
that
our
modern
detective
mcfadden
like
the
real
life
detective
mcfadden
did
not
have
any
information
about
john
terry
s
background
instead
he
merely
observed
terry
s
suspicious
behavior
under
bayes
theorem
our
base
rate
would
be
much
lower
perhaps
we
recognize
that
this
is
a
high
crime
neighborhood
so
we
know
that
of
the
population
is
carrying
an
illegal
weapon
at
any
given
time
if
detective
mcfadden
makes
the
same
observations
as
before
and
he
calculates
the
same
odds
of
criminal
activity
based
on
those
observations
the
chances
that
terry
is
engaged
in
criminal
activity
drops
to
only
n
in
other
words
the
lower
base
rate
from
the
lack
of
big
data
makes
the
detective
s
prediction
of
criminal
activity
much
less
accurate
thus
even
if
predictive
algorithms
are
not
outcome
determinative
using
a
more
statistical
approach
to
determine
reasonable
suspicion
or
probable
cause
will
allow
police
officers
and
judges
to
incorporate
more
reliable
base
rates
into
their
calculations
predictive
algorithms
will
also
help
these
decision
makers
avoid
a
common
problem
when
making
predictions
ignoring
or
undervaluing
the
base
rate
as
can
be
seen
from
our
above
example
a
very
low
base
rate
or
prior
probability
for
potential
criminal
activity
means
that
even
very
suspicious
independent
factors
might
not
result
in
a
very
high
resulting
probability
studies
have
shown
that
individuals
who
make
predictions
frequently
undervalue
or
even
ignore
base
rates
and
give
too
much
weight
to
the
independent
factors
that
they
are
presented
with
n
forcing
police
officers
and
judges
to
incorporate
the
base
rate
in
making
their
calculations
would
be
another
benefit
of
using
a
quantified
system
of
criminal
procedure
of
course
the
more
we
allow
the
decision
makers
to
use
independent
factors
the
more
we
lose
the
benefits
of
predictive
algorithms
such
as
the
increased
accuracy
and
the
mitigation
of
subjective
and
potentially
biased
human
input
for
example
when
detective
mcfadden
enters
in
his
own
probability
estimates
into
the
bayesian
calculation
he
may
underestimate
the
chance
that
terry
has
an
innocent
explanation
for
his
conduct
because
terry
is
african
american
and
the
detective
has
an
irrational
implicit
bias
against
african
americans
this
would
result
in
a
higher
prediction
of
criminal
activity
for
terry
than
it
would
for
a
white
person
with
the
same
background
engaging
in
the
same
activity
thus
we
should
design
our
algorithms
to
avoid
the
need
for
independent
factors
as
much
as
possible
since
the
biases
in
the
algorithms
can
be
detected
and
minimized
conclusion
big
data
s
predictive
algorithms
have
the
potential
to
revolutionize
the
way
police
investigate
crime
and
the
way
the
courts
regulate
the
police
for
centuries
courts
have
been
crafting
legal
standards
for
police
officers
who
were
making
clinical
judgments
based
on
experience
and
intuition
the
imprecision
and
subjectivity
of
these
legal
standards
were
a
necessary
evil
they
were
required
given
the
subjective
factors
that
were
used
by
the
police
but
their
accuracy
could
not
be
tested
they
made
the
system
less
transparent
and
they
opened
the
door
to
vastly
inconsistent
and
frequently
discriminatory
results
with
the
rise
of
big
data
s
predictive
algorithms
we
have
an
opportunity
to
increase
the
accuracy
and
the
transparency
of
the
way
we
apply
the
standards
and
of
the
standards
themselves
making
the
system
more
efficient
more
fair
and
more
open
in
order
to
reap
these
benefits
we
need
to
ensure
that
the
predictive
algorithms
are
race
neutral
and
that
they
take
into
account
individual
suspicion
this
may
require
new
types
of
algorithms
that
are
specifically
designed
for
determining
reasonable
suspicion
and
probable
cause
it
will
certainly
require
that
the
algorithms
be
transparent
so
that
reviewing
courts
can
understand
what
factors
the
algorithm
is
using
more
controversially
we
need
to
update
the
definition
of
reasonable
suspicion
and
probable
cause
to
include
quantifiable
standards
although
courts
have
shown
a
strong
aversion
quantifying
standards
in
the
past
the
benefits
to
such
a
change
far
outweigh
the
costs
we
have
seen
that
some
courts
recognizing
this
fact
have
already
started
to
experiment
with
using
quantified
standards
when
evaluating
some
of
the
factors
put
forward
by
law
enforcement
officers
or
when
evaluating
the
tools
that
these
officers
use
in
determining
probable
cause
to
be
sure
a
system
of
mechanical
predictive
algorithms
and
quantified
legal
standards
will
not
be
perfect
it
will
probably
be
impossible
to
scrub
all
residue
of
racial
discrimination
from
the
existing
databases
and
police
officers
and
judges
will
almost
certainly
make
mistakes
when
trying
to
use
the
predictive
algorithms
as
base
rates
and
then
adding
their
own
independent
observations
and
the
predictive
algorithms
themselves
will
still
make
mistakes
and
thus
will
not
always
be
as
accurate
as
we
would
like
but
the
current
system
includes
the
implicit
and
sometimes
explicit
biases
of
police
officers
and
judges
vague
standards
that
can
be
manipulated
by
police
officers
which
are
more
or
less
incomprehensible
to
lay
people
and
accuracy
rates
when
they
can
be
measured
that
vary
wildly
from
jurisdiction
to
jurisdiction
the
time
has
come
for
courts
to
embrace
the
enhanced
precision
and
transparency
that
big
data
has
to
offer
footnotes
n
see
bernard
e
harcourt
against
prediction
profiling
policing
and
punishing
in
an
actuarial
age
the
truth
is
most
criminal
justice
determinations
rest
on
probabilistic
reasoning
the
jury
s
verdict
at
trial
for
instance
is
nothing
more
than
a

the

warns

that
harsh
penalties
will
be
imposed
for
even
petty
slights

not
compatible
with
all
of
these
definitions
for
example
it
downplays
or
eliminates
the
use
of
human
intuition
and
will
frequently
start
with
an
analysis
of
a
suspect
rather
than
with
a
crime
but
these
algorithms
will
be
particularly
useful
if
one
adopts
professor
bambauer

concept
of
hassle
rates
since
they
focus

specific
hit

that

needs
to

a
link
between

s
suspicious
background
information
and
his
current
actions
courts
analyzing
big

should
thus
be
careful
to
require
a
direct
link
between
the
past
data
about
a
suspect
and
the
observed

otherwise
professor
ferguson
argues
that
the
background
information
is
irrelevant
to
the
reasonable
suspicion
analysis
id
it
is
not
clear
how
direct
the
link
would
have
to
be
however
many
different
types
of
criminal
activity
may
be
linked
together
in
an
officer
s
mind
such
as
prior
convictions
of
illegal
weapons
possession
combined
with
a
current
observation
indicating
possible
drug
dealing
id
the
linkage
could
be
even
more
indirect
and
yet
statistically
significant
when
big
data
is
used
for
example
assume
that
a
statistical
analysis
of
thousands
of
burglars
shows
that
individuals
who
have
prior
convictions
for
child
abuse
are
more
likely
to
commit
burglary
than
those
without
such
a
conviction
even
though
there
is
no
logical
link
between
the
two
crimes
this
fact
could
be
considered
as
one
factor
among
many
others
by
an
algorithm

whether

introduction
in
july
dallas
police
chief
david
brown
decided
to
end
a
violent
standoff
n
with
micah
johnson
n
who
had
fatally
shot
five
officers
and
wounded
several
more
in
an
unusual
way
n
as
a
makeshift
solution
the
police
attached
a
pound
of
the
plastic
explosive
c
to
a
remotec
f
n
a
robot
designed
for
bomb
disposal
n
the
intentional
detonation
of
the
explosive
killed
johnson
and
was
the
first
deliberate
use
by
american
police
of
a
robot
armed
with
deadly
force
n
keep
in
mind
that
this
improvised
solution
was
a
remotely
controlled
robot
the
robot
was
not
designed
to
harm
people
and
it
lacked
any
ability
to
make
independent
decisions
n
nevertheless
the
use
of
the
robot
in
dallas
comes
at
a
time
when
many
people
are
predicting
that
sophisticated
police
robots
will
one
day
become
useful
cheap
and
ubiquitous
n
hundreds
of
robots
most
of
them
made
for
bomb
disposal
are
already
in
the
possession
of
local
police
departments
n
many
such
robots
will
soon
employ
artificial
intelligence
and
will
be
expected
to
operate
with
a
degree
of
independence
n
the
near
certain
use
of
these
robots
by
the
police
n
raises
questions
about
what
sorts
of
limits
and
regulations
should
be
imposed
on
their
use
n
consider
a
future
in
which
robots
could
supplement
or
replace
some
basic
police
functions
an
autonomous
police
vehicle
patrols
a
neighborhood
and
briefly
detains
a
person
deemed
suspicious
so
that
an
officer
miles
away
can
subject
him
to
questioning
n
during
the
detention
the
vehicle
dispatches
a
micro
drone
to
obtain
a
dna
identification
sample
n
or
consider
the
possibility
of
thousands
of
autonomous
police
drones
the
size
of
insects
flying
through
a
city
without
detection
to
conduct
surveillance
and
carrying
nano
chemicals
to
disable
dangerous
suspects
n
or
imagine
social
patrol
robots
that
dispense
advice
to
the
lost
record
surveillance
data
and
call
in
other
robots
to
assist
in
unexpectedly
hostile
situations
rapid
changes
in
technology
have
significantly
shifted
how
police
perform
their
jobs
the
squad
car
and
the
two
way
radio
provided
the
police
with
a
geographic
range
and
communication
ability
far
superior
to

the

will
have
profound
impacts
on

to
be
sure
advances
in
technology
have
always
given
police
new
powers
robots
however
may
be
different
in
kind
like
the
internet
robots
raise
new
issues
and
challenges
to
the
regulation
of
policing
n
police
robots
raise
special
questions
because
of
the
powers
we
entrust
to
the
police
if
the
development
of
military
robots
provides
any
guidance
then
we
can
expect
some
police
robots
to
be
artificially
intelligent
machines
capable
of
using
legitimate
coercive
force
against
human
beings
n
military
robots
will
also
possess
these
powers
with
an
important
difference
we
will
not
expect
police
robots
to
exercise
deadly
force
against
a
hostile
enemy
more
importantly
constitutional
law
and
democratic
norms
constrain
the
police
how
we
design
regulate
or
even
prohibit
some
uses
of
police
robots
requires
a
regulatory
agenda
now
to
address
foreseeable
problems
of
the
future
sophisticated
and
inexpensive
robotics
will
be
attractive
to
the
police
just
as
they
have
been
to
the
military
n
the
federal
government
is
already
spending
significant
amounts
of
money
and
attention
on
robotics
research
n
those
robotic
applications
will
make
their
way
to
policing
and
federal
monies
for
robotics
will
become
available
to
local
law
enforcement
agencies
just
as
they
have
in
the
case
of
recent
technologies
like
body
cameras
biometrics
and
big
data
analysis
n
what
is
more
police
departments
will
likely
raise
the
argument
that
they
must
be
prepared
for
a
robotics
arms
race
such
as
against
criminals
and
terrorists
who
could
d
print
an
army
of

n
this
article
considers
the
law
and
policy
implications
of
a
future
where
police
robots
are
sophisticated
cheap
and
widespread
in
particular
i
focus
on
questions
raised
by
the
use
of
robots
able
to
use
coercive
force
as
opposed
to
robots
with
surveillance
or
other
support
functions
drawing
upon
the
rapidly
developing
body
of
robotics
law
scholarship
as
well
as
upon
technological
advances
in
military
robotics
from
which
policing
will
surely
borrow
we
can
anticipate
the
kinds
of
regulatory
challenges
we
will
face
with
the
future
of
police
robots
i
putting
police
robots
in
context
a
what
is
a
robot
the
definition
of
a
police
robot
depends
on
the
definition
of
the
term
robot
itself
popular
depictions
of
robots
going
back
to
the
s
suggest
robots
are
machines
in
humanoid
form
think
of
the
maschinemensch
in
fritz
lang
s
film
metropolis
n
or
rosie
the
maid
robot
in
the
jetsons
n
yet
robots
neither
have
to
look
like
people
nor
behave
in
any
specific
way
robots
can
look
like
humans
animals
or
insects
they
can
provide
information
fire
upon
an
enemy
or
engage
in
financial
trades
indeed
there
is
no
single
definition
of
a
robot
n
an
emerging
consensus
has
suggested
however
that
a
robot
be
defined
as
any
machine
that
can
collect
information
process
it
and
use
it
to
act
upon
the
world
n
these
qualities
vary
widely
from
one
robot
to
another
this
sense
think
act
model
might
describe
anything
from
a
bot
that
makes
independent
online
purchases
n
to
an
eldercare
robot
that
provides
emotional
comfort
or
assists
with
lifting
objects
n
in
appearance
robots
could
take
any
form
some
military
robots
for
instance
may
assume
the
shape
of
four
legged
centaurs
to
enhance
stability
n
thus
if
a
robot
processes
information
it
senses
and
acts
upon
it
a
police
robot
does
so
in
order
to
perform
a
task
traditionally
assumed
by
human
police
officers
that
robots
might
look
alive
and
act
in
unpredictable
ways
also
distinguishes
them
from
other
technologies
those
special
attributes
of
robots
might
counsel
robot
specific
policies
robotics
law
scholar
ryan
calo
has
identified
these
qualities
as
embodiment
emergence
and
social
valence
n
first
the
physicality
of
robots
enables
them
to
translate
their
data
analysis
into
action
robots
act
upon
the
world
they
can
lift
objects
transport
people
create
art
and
engage
in
commerce
and
unlike
other
robots
that
may
cause
real
world
harm
through
accident
n
police
robots
at
least
some
of
them
will
be
designed
with
the
capacity
to
exercise
deliberate
coercive
force
that
physicality
creates
new
operational
possibilities
for
the
police
but
it
also
raises
new
types
of
concerns
when
autonomous
machines
may
be
able
to
harm
people
by
design
second
robots
with
artificial
intelligence
will
behave
in
ways
that
are
not
necessarily
predictable
to
their
human
creators
n
some
robots
may
just
replace
human
labor
in
jobs
that
are
repetitive
and
dull
but
others
will
be
capable
of
adapting
to
their
environment
learning
from
mistakes
and
become
increasingly
skilled
in
their
assigned
tasks
at
one
end
of
the
spectrum
a
robot
may
be
a
glorified
vacuum
cleaner
designed
to
address
the
drudgery
of
housecleaning
at
the
other
end
a
robot
s
artificial
intelligence
may
be
designed
not
only
to
act
upon
processed
information
but
also
to
improve
its
performance
over
time
by
learning
from
past
mistakes
n
not
all
of
this
learning
will
be
welcome
microsoft
quickly
disabled
its
social
chatbot
tay
after
it
incorporated
online
responses
and
began
spouting
racist
speech
and
called
for
genocide
online
n
since
artificial
intelligence
would
drive
the
behavior
of
robots
robots
may
behave
in
ways
that
we
cannot
predict
or
even
explain
afterwards
n
artificial
intelligence
by
itself
is
not
unique
to
robotics
we
can
already
feel
the
impact
of
big
data
applying
complex
computer
algorithms
to
massive
sets
of
digitized
data
in
fields
like
finance
healthcare
and
even
policing
a
number
of
police
departments
already
use
artificial
intelligence
in
software
that
tries
to
identify
future
geographic
locations
where
crime
will
occur
to
predict
which
individuals
may
be
at
highest
risk
for
violent
crime
commission
or
victimization
and
to
identify
which
among
the
billions
of
daily
internet
posts
amount
to
suspicious
behavior
n
the
police
employ
these
big
data
tools
however
as
guidance
for
human
decisionmaking
robots
with
artificial
intelligence
are
distinct
because
they
would
be
able
to
translate
their
analysis
of
data
into
physical
action
third
robots
are
different
from
other
technologies
because
they
are
in
appearance
somewhere
between
inanimate
objects
and
humans
n
no
robot
today
will
fool
a
person
into
believing
that
it
is
alive
but
many
robots
do
not
seem
completely
inert
either
research
suggests
that
we
tend
to
approach
robots
as
if
they
had
human
characteristics
n
exploiting
the
human
like
nature
of
some
robots
could
be
useful
we
could
deliberately
design
caretaking
robots
to
be
physically
cute
such
as
rounded
shapes
humanoid
faces
to
maximize
their
benefits
whether
for
children
or
the
elderly
the
ambivalence
we
feel
toward
robots
might
also
counsel
new
legal
characterizations
particular
to
them
we
may
think
that
a
person
smashing
his
lawn
mower
merely
has
an
ill
temper
but
that
a
person
abusing
a
social
robot
is
cruel
n
if
robots
are
designed
to
serve
as
pets
caregivers
or
friends
could
robots
be
the
victims
of
criminal
assault
abuse
or
even
rape
and
murder
n
in
this
way
the
law
may
need
to
extend
some
legal
protections
to
robots
for
some
of
the
same
reasons
we
criminalize
animal
cruelty
n
we
prohibit
the
infliction
of
needless
violence
against
some
animals
because
such
behavior
reflects
something
depraved
about
the
perpetrator
though
we
may
not
mistake
robots
for
humans
yet
we
may
soon
reach
a
point
where
machines
endowed
with
artificial
intelligence
may
need
protection
from
human
abuse
b
military
robots
the
future
of
robotic
policing
can
now
be
found
in
developments
within
the
military
n
the
military
has
used
remote
controlled
robots
for
more
than
a
decade
n
the
department
of
defense
is
preparing
for
a
future
in
which
nearly
autonomous
robots
will
play
a
central
role
in
warfare
n
consequently
the
military
is
spending
the
most
money
and
attention
on
robotics
n
peter
w
singer
has
chronicled
these
changes
in
great
detail
and
argues
that
military
robots
will
change
not
just
the
tools
we
use
to
fight
wars
but
the
very
nature
of

itself

in
use
in

the
unique
characteristics
of
robots

shape

military
tactics
one
application
of
robotics
imagines
swarms
of
small
robots
that
move
in
the

way
birds
and
insects
do
in

though
without
a
defined
leader

individual
bees

birds
do
not
rely
on
high
degrees
of
intelligence
to
avoid
crashing
into
each
other
rather
each
member
follows
simple
rules
robotic
swarms
can
work
this
way
without
sophisticated
programming
in
a
swarm
robots
could
assemble
together
rapidly
as
a
unit
and
then
just
as
quickly
disperse
to
continue
with
surveillance
missions
what
develops
first
in
the
military
often
finds
its
way
to
domestic
policing
there
has
long
been
a
close
relationship
between
both
the
culture
and
institutions
of
the
military
and
law
enforcement
the
bureaucratic
hierarchy
in
policing
adopting
titles
like
sergeant
lieutenant
and
captain
reflects
the
military
s
influence
n
not
only
are
many
rank
and
file
officers
former
members
of
the
military
many
police
departments
actively
recruit
from
their
ranks
as
well
n
we
even
use
war
metaphors
to
describe
our
domestic
policing
strategies
n
this
military
influence
extends
to
specific
tactics
and
technologies
used
by
the
police
while
the
federal
posse
comitatus
law
n
forbids
the
use
of
the
military
for
civilian
policing
military
equipment
and
training
has
trickled
down
to
police
departments
through
other
means
for
instance
the
so
called
program
part
of
the
national
defense
authorization
security
act
of
n
is
the
federal
initiative
that
has
transferred
surplus
military
equipment
such
as
mraps
mine
resistant
ambush
protected
vehicles
grenade
launchers
and
amphibious
tanks
to
local
police
departments
n
vvhile
the
public
may
have
been
shocked
at
images
of
police
officers
wearing
combat
fatigues
and
carrying
m
s
during
protests
in
ferguson
missouri
in
n
these
police
officers
were
little
different
from
the
hundreds
of
other
police
departments
who
had
been
recipients
of
military
equipment
transfers
under
the
program
n
similarly
police
swat
teams
now
common
in
police
departments
around
the
country
were
created
as
specialized
paramilitary
groups
former
lapd
chief
daryl
gates
credited
with
establishing
the
first
swat
teams
brought
in
ex
marines
to
help
train
these
small
groups
of
officers
to
act
and
dress
like
soldiers
in
volatile
situations
n
ii
the
challenges
posed
by
police
robots
imagine
police
robots
that
could
surround
a
suspicious
person
or
even
halt
a
speeding
car
n
this
might
take
the
form
of
a
swarm
of
small
robots
each
less
than
a
pound
designed
to
incapacitate
a
person
by
surrounding
him
and
by
using
nonlethal
force
consider
further
that
such
a
swarm
would
be
capable
of
using
some
form
of
coercive
force
to
prevent
an
unwillingly
detained
person
from
flight
a
multi
robot
pursuit
system
that
guides
packs
of
robots
to
search
for
and
detect
a
non
cooperative
human
part
of
a
pentagon
request
for
contractors
would
surely
be
useful
to
the
police
n
even
if
this
use
of
robots
is
still
just
a
concept
we
can
anticipate
the
kinds
of
legal
and
policy
challenges
that
might
arise
first
how
much
should
humans
remain
in
the
loop
maintain
some
degree
of
involvement
in
other
words
in
the
use
of
robot
police
n
second
how
much
coercive
force
should
we
permit
police
robots
to
exercise
third
how
might
the
use
of
police
robots
affect
legal
determinations
like
reasonable
force
fourth
will
police
robot
use
further
reinforce
the
social
inequities
in
policing
finally
how
can
we
develop
a
uniform
approach
to
policing
police
robots
a
how
much
control
should
humans
have
over
police
robots
how
much
should
police
delegate
decisions
about
force
and
coercion
to
their
own
robots
n
take
a
look
at
the
robotics
currently
on
the
market
the
idea
that
we
might
lose
control
over
them
seems
almost
laughable
no
consumer
today
fears
their
housekeeping
roomba
and
even
the
most
advanced
private
security
robot
available
now
could
be
disabled
by
a
swift
kick
but
technology
changes
fast
n
the
pentagon
s
autonomous
research
pilot
initiative
funds
research
for
algorithms
that
will
increase
a
system
s
level
of
autonomy
n
artificial
intelligence
experts
hint
that
we
might
see
humanlike
artificial
intelligence
within
a
few
decades
not
a
century
n
within
our
lifetime
robots
might
not
only
seem
human
in
their
basic
intelligence
but
emotional
perhaps
even
superhuman
n
not
every
robot
will
display
such
capabilities
today
some
machines
the
military
deems
robots
like
the
widely
used
talon
are
controlled
completely
by
remote
human
operators
n
other
robots
use
artificial
intelligence
to
operate
independently
for
limited
tasks
the
remote
operator
of
a
global
hawk
for
instance
just
clicks
a
computer
mouse
to
tell
the
robot
to
taxi
and
take
off
n
a
fully
autonomous
robot
would
need
no
human
input
at
all
once
someone
has
defined
the
robot
s
mission
n
greater
degrees
of
autonomy
in
military
robotics
seem
inevitable
one
of
the
efficiencies
gained
by
military
robots
is
that
large
numbers
of
them
will
be
capable
of
independent
action
with
one
human
actor
s
oversight
imagine
a
phalanx
of
military
robots
controlled
by
one
human
operator
perhaps
thousands
of
miles
away
as
a
result
fewer
human
lives
are
placed
at
risk
such
robots
would
not
increase
efficiency
if
each
required
an
independent
human
operator
n
on
the
battlefield
some
decisions
must
be
made
within
fractions
of
a
second
waiting
for
human
approval
or
veto
may
be
critical
time
wasted
particularly
if
a
robot
must
calculate
how
and
whether
to
launch
a
counterattack
n
not
only
might
there
be
insufficient
time
to
oversee
a
single
robotic
decision
but
there
may
be
little
opportunity
for
a
human
operator
to
closely
supervise
the
split
second
decisions
of
the
dozens
of
robots
over
which
he
has
control
human
involvement
in
such
a
case
might
take
the
form
of
a
veto
power
if
at
all
current
military
research
already
supports
the
development
of
robots
with
greater
degrees
of
autonomy
one
research
goal
of
the
pentagon
is
to
establish
linked
autonomous
systems
so
that
robots
can
communicate
to
one
another
in
a
rapidly
changing
environment
in
the
military
autonomous
drones
could
scan
a
combat
area
and
communicate
with
ground
robots
to
find
suspicious
places
or
people
n
the
possibility
that
some
robots
capable
of
hurting
or
killing
people
will
be
capable
of
complex
independent
action
raises
concerns
however
in
the
near
future
robots
could
make
decisions
in
ways
that
we
cannot
easily
control
or
understand
the
question
of
human
involvement
is
itself
complicated
because
artificial
intelligence
itself
is
becoming
more
complicated
assume
we
require
that
a
human
must
assess
a
robot
s
determination
to
use
coercive
force
deciding
whether
a
machine
with
artificial
intelligence
has
made
a
good
decision
may
not
be
easy
since
the
algorithm
s
processes
may
not
be
totally
intelligible
to
a
human
operator
even
if
we
have
access
to
an
algorithm
s
source
code
we
still
might
not
know
how
or
why
it
reached
its
decision
n
engineers
at
google
for
instance
recently
conceded
that
they
do
not
fully
understand
how
google
s
successful
rank
brain
ai
works
only
that
it
works
well
n
requiring
a
human
in
the
loop
may
mean
little
if
how
the
robot
came
to
its
conclusion
remains
opaque
to
the
human
being
in
charge
armed
robots
with
some
degree
of
autonomy
are
also
likely
to
be
vulnerable
to
criminal
interference
hacking
as
well
as
malfunction
our
current
experience
with
the
security
of
electronic
devices
provides
little
assurance
otherwise
security
researchers
have
discovered
vulnerabilities
that
make
possible
the
hacking
of
smart
cars
insulin
monitors
thermometers
refrigerators
and
locks
n
for
now
armed
and
independent
military
robots
are
not
a
reality
in
the
military
but
they
are
a
concern
current
military
policy
requires
human
involvement
in
any
potentially
lethal
action
as
deputy
defense
secretary
robert
o
work
commented
in
march
the
military
will
not
delegate
lethal
authority
to
a
machine
to
make
a
decision
n
retaining
some
human
involvement
in
armed
military
robots
remains
a
line
in
the
sand
n
but
this
is
a
policy
restraint
not
a
technological
one
that
restraint
may
give
way
easily
if
another
hostile
nation
or
terrorist
group
decides
to
use
lethal
autonomous
robots
against
american
soldiers
n
translating
these
developments
in
military
robotics
to
domestic
policing
requires
little
effort
the
companies
developing
and
producing
robots
can
and
do
adapt
them
for
military
or
law
enforcement
uses
robots
used
for
surveillance
investigation
and
coercive
force
in
iraq
and
afghanistan
could
easily
be
adapted
to
new
york
chicago
and
los
angeles
should
a
taser
or
firearm
enabled
police
robot
require
human
input
before
using
force
against
a
suspect
while
a
vice
president
at
irobot
which
partnered
with
taser
once
stated
there
is
no
way
we
are
giving
the
robot
the
capability
to
use
force
on
its
own
n
that
decision
like
the
pentagon
s
is
dictated
by
policy
not
technology
instead
we
should
ask
whether
a
robot
capable
of
assessing
a
dangerous
situation
and
enabled
to
use
a
taser
or
other
weapon
should
be
able
to
decide
to
do
so
without
human
input
as
with
the
military
a
ban
on
such
police
robots
makes
sense
until
policies
are
developed
to
address
matters
of
control
security
and
accountability
b
how
much
force
should
be
used
by
police
robots
not
only
do
we
need
to
decide
how
much
human
beings
should
be
involved
in
police
robot
decisionmaking
we
also
need
to
decide
how
heavily
robots
should
be
armed
from
their
beginnings
in
the
nineteenth
century
american
police
have
acquired
ever
more
sophisticated
tools
first
truncheons
then
firearms
and
now
stun
guns
pepper
balls
tear
gas
and
long
range
acoustic
device
lrad
sound
cannons
n
police
injure
and
sometimes
kill
people
during
their
stops
arrests
and
pursuits
when
the
circumstances
warrant
it
these
are
legally
justifiable
uses
of
force
if
police
authority
rests
in
part
on
the
authority
to
use
coercive
force
how
much
should
coercive
even
lethal
force
should
a
police
robot
possess
should
a
robot
be
able
to
exercise
the
same
deadly
force
as
a
police
officer
does
now
in
irobot
announced
a
strategic
alliance
with
taser
international
to
develop
a
taser
equipped
version
of
its
popular
packbot
n
electric
stun
guns
capable
of
transmitting
a
shock
of
up
to
volts
can
temporarily
disable
suspects
deemed
dangerous
and
noncompliant
n
tasers
are
considered
less
than
lethal
substitutes
for
guns
indeed
police
departments
often
view
taser
adoption
as
a
measure
of
reform
n
if
police
robots
can
carry
tasers
can
they
also
carry
firearms
or
other
lethal
weapons
any
proposal
to
adopt
the
regular
use
of
lethally
armed
robots
whether
semiautonomous
or
remotely
controlled
is
likely
to
meet
initial
public
resistance
there
is
already
a
public
campaign
against
killer
robots
in
the
military
n
and
the
discomfort
many
people
feel
about
lethal
robotic
soldiers
will
probably
be
more
pronounced
in
local
policing
uncertainty
about
partially
or
fully
autonomous
lethal
robots
will
likely
be
more
pronounced
if
that
possibility
is
introduced
for
police
within
the
united
states
there
are
at
least
two
reasons
to
be
skeptical
that
a
prohibition
against
lethal
police
robots
would
persist
first
the
line
between
lethal
and
nonlethal
arms
is
not
always
clear
even
a
taser
enabled
robot
is
one
capable
of
lethal
force
while
relatively
uncommon
people
have
died
in
incidents
in
which
police
use
tasers
at
least
forty
eight
people
in
n
some
cases
involve
improper
taser
use
others
involve
unknown
physical
vulnerabilities
of
the
victims
once
we
authorize
police
robots
to
use
some
degree
of
coercive
force
we
implicitly
acknowledge
some
uses
of
even
less
than
lethal
force
will
be
lethal
in
practice
a
second
reason
to
be
skeptical
about
any
prohibition
on
the
regular
use
of
lethally
armed
police
robots
is
the
future
role
of
robots
more
generally
in
the
future
we
will
be
surrounded
by
robots
of
all
kinds
at
work
as
coworkers
at
home
as
caregivers
and
in
leisure
as
social
or
sexual
companions
that
world
will
also
include
robots
involved
in
crime
just
as
robots
in
the
military
reduce
the
need
for
soldiers
to
put
themselves
at
risk
robots
can
provide
the
same
safety
and
anonymity
for
someone
interested
in
committing
crime
an
armed
robot
drug
dealer
could
act
as
an
autonomous
vending
machine
able
to
defend
itself
against
attack
and
destroy
evidence
in
the
event
of
discovery
n
once
the
first
crimes
are
committed
by
robots
armed
with
lethal
force
police
in
the
united
states
will
almost
certainly
balk
at
any
prohibitions
on
lethally
armed
police
robots
n
such
prohibitions
may
find
police
support
in
countries
like
new
zealand
and
britain
where
most
police
are
unarmed
as
are
most
civilians
n
in
the
united
states
however
lethally
armed
robots
may
become
just
another
point
in
the
development
of
weapons
that
the
police
will
want
to
use
c
what
is
robotic
reasonable
force
the
kinds
of
weapons
police
robots
might
adopt
are
matters
of
technology
and
policy
but
the
circumstances
in
which
robots
could
use
force
against
human
suspects
are
legal
ones
imagine
that
a
suspect
temporarily
detained
by
a
police
robot
decides
to
start
shooting
at
the
robot
if
the
robot
shoots
back
and
injures
or
kills
the
suspect
would
that
be
legally
defensible
n
the
answer
will
depend
in
part
on
how
we
classify
robots
under
the
law
human
police
may
legally
resort
to
force
even
deadly
force
in
the
appropriate
circumstances
claims
of
excessive
force
against
the
police
whether
in
the
context
of
an
arrest
stop
or
other
detention
are
judged
by
a
standard
of
objective
reasonableness
under
the
fourth
amendment
n
deadly
force
may
be
used
in
situations
where
a
suspect
poses
a
threat
of
serious
physical
harm
either
to
the
officer
or
to
others
n
distinguishing
between
legally
permissible
and
impermissible
uses
of
force
by
the
police
is
not
always
easy
the
u
s
supreme
court
has
avoided
requiring
any
exclusive
list
of
factors
in
assessing
reasonableness
rather
the
court
has
emphasized
that
the
use
of
force
analysis
requires
courts
to
slosh
through
the
factbound
morass
of
reasonableness
n
moreover
considerable
deference
is
accorded
to
the
police
as
the
calculus
of
reasonableness
must
embody
allowance
for
the
fact
that
police
officers
are
often
forced
to
make
split
second
judgments
in
circumstances
that
are
tense
uncertain
and
rapidly
evolving
n
that
reasonableness
must
be
judged
from
the
perspective
of
a
reasonable
officer
on
the
scene
rather
than
with
the
vision
of
hindsight
n
finally
that
assessment
asks
whether
the
officers
actions
are
objectively
reasonable
in
light
of
the
facts
and
circumstances
confronting
them
without
regard
to
their
underlying
intent
or
motivation
n
the
result
is
a
notoriously
opaque
and
fact
dependent
doctrine
that
has
become
difficult
for
courts
to
articulate
and
police
to
incorporate
into
their
training
n
even
if
the
fourth
amendment
s
use
of
force
doctrine
were
clearer
it
still
would
not
translate
easily
to
the
world
of
robotics
first
the
high
degree
of
deference
given
to
police
in
the
use
of
force
context
takes
into
account
the
fallible
nature
of
human
judgment
in
volatile
situations
with
high
degrees
of
stress
and
emotion
as
a
result
police
decisions
to
use
force
even
deadly
force
do
not
have
to
be
correct
only
objectively
reasonable
artificially
intelligent
machines
capable
of
coercive
force
do
not
feel
fear
disgust
anger
or
take
offense
in
this
respect
robots
might
be
more
reliable
than
human
beings
in
making
split
second
decisions
about
whether
to
draw
a
weapon
or
use
a
stun
gun
does
that
mean
we
should
expect
a
narrower
set
of
circumstances
for
robotic
reasonableness
than
we
do
for
humans
second
and
perhaps
more
importantly
the
usual
legal
standards
governing
the
use
of
force
by
the
police
assume
the
perspective
of
officers
who
fear
for
their
lives
or
safety
too
little
deference
to
the
police
may
inhibit
their
decisions
and
result
in
more
injuries
to
the
police
too
much
deference
and
the
police
may
injure
or
kill
people
when
such
deaths
could
be
avoided
n
in
practice
courts
have
given
considerable
deference
to
officers
stated
beliefs
that
they
felt
their
lives
were
in
danger
even
if
those
fears
turn
out
to
be
mistaken
after
deadly
force
has
been
used
n
what
do
these
legal
standards
mean
when
a
police
robot
confronts
a
person
who
appears
to
intend
it
harm
the
law
values
life
over
property
yet
robots
might
occupy
a
legal
category
that
is
neither
purely
property
nor
human
how
we
think
of
robots
in
these
situations
may
depend
on
whatever
analogies
courts
will
adopt
to
characterize
them
are
robots
like
wild
animals
slaves
n
children
or
something
else
if
robots
are
treated
merely
as
property
then
police
robots
should
not
be
permitted
to
defend
themselves
against
human
attack
even
when
acting
in
a
policing
role
n
but
that
conclusion
is
not
obvious
an
animated
debate
already
exists
as
to
whether
cruelty
to
robots
might
be
criminalized
in
the
same
way
we
criminalize
cruelty
to
animals
n
the
dismemberment
of
the
hitchhiking
hitchbot
in
prompted
new
concerns
about
a
future
of
unchecked
robot
abuse
n
while
we
might
have
many
reasons
to
criminalize
animal
abuse
one
reason
may
be
to
promote
social
values
and
to
deter
antisocial
violence
we
disavow
deliberate
unjustified
violence
to
animals
in
part
because
to
do
otherwise
would
condone
the
human
infliction
of
pain
and
suffering
against
other
beings
but
permitting
a
robot
to
launch
a
counterpunch
against
an
armed
human
poses
its
own
tricky
questions
perhaps
a
robot
could
exert
proportional
nonlethal
force
to
defend
itself
from
destruction
let
us
further
assume
that
a
human
must
authorize
such
a
use
of
force
in
an
optimal
case
the
suspect
posing
a
threat
might
be
temporarily
disabled
by
nonlethal
force
until
in
handcuffs
or
their
future
equivalent
consider
too
that
one
day
police
robots
might
be
sent
to
confront
criminal
robots
what
amount
of
force
is
permissible
then
can
a
police
robot
kill
another
robot
because
the
robot
s
actions
would
be
attributable
to
the
government
the
permanent
disabling
of
a
threatening
civilian
robot
would
be
a
fourth
amendment
seizure
but
what
would
a
reasonable
robotic
seizure
of
another
robot
look
like
to
be
sure
police
robots
might
remove
some
of
the
problems
raised
in
confrontations
between
the
police
and
the
public
the
use
of
robots
in
these
situations
may
reduce
the
risk
of
harm
to
the
police
if
they
can
safely
subdue
a
dangerous
suspect
at
a
distance
and
if
police
lives
are
not
at
immediate
risk
it
may
be
that
detentions
and
arrests
could
be
conducted
with
less
risk
to
individuals
robots
have
the
potential
to
make
policing
safer
that
possibility
however
must
be
balanced
against
the
mistakes
hacks
and
malfunctions
that
will
inevitably
occur
who
will
bear
the
responsibility
for
these
mistakes
either
because
the
threat
was
misjudged
or
the
force
disproportionate
should
we
blame
the
robot
the
manufacturer
the
software
engineer
or
the
human
operator
assuming
there
is
one
d
will
robotic
police
reinforce
social
inequality
whether
or
not
police
robots
use
coercive
force
and
do
so
with
some
degree
of
autonomy
the
manner
of
their
deployment
raises
a
separate
policy
question
robots
may
decrease
dangers
for
the
police
and
those
detained
by
the
police
but
will
they
increase
perceptions
of
policing
unfairness
if
arming
robots
is
already
becoming
an
active
topic
of
debate
an
equally
important
but
less
visible
one
is
whether
police
robots
will
worsen
ties
to
communities
where
relationships
with
the
police
are
already
strained
we
can
see
these
questions
of
technology
and
policing
already
being
put
to
the
test
with
predictive
policing
software
defined
broadly
predictive
policing
applies
artificial
intelligence
to
data
in
order
to
detect
patterns
of
crime
n
using
the
vast
amount
of
digitized
information
today
predictive
policing
programs
try
to
predict
criminal
risks
in
individuals
or
in
geographic
locations
in
the
case
of
locational
prediction
predictive
policing
programs
using
historical
crime
data
and
other
factors
identify
geographic
locations
where
crime
is
more
likely
to
occur
in
the
future
n
police
departments
can
use
that
information
to
redistribute
patrol
resources
cities
including
los
angeles
new
york
and
seattle
have
purchased
predictive
software
programs
of
this
type
n
in
the
future
predictive
policing
programs
may
further
guide
the
allocation
of
police
resources
and
hiring
these
predictive
policing
programs
may
appear
neutral
but
in
fact
hide
biases
consider
the
data
used
by
predictive
policing
algorithms
if
arrests
are
a
significant
factor
then
we
cannot
discount
the
fact
that
many
arrests
are
the
product
of
highly
discretionary
decisions
by
police
officers
n
if
high
arrest
rates
influence
the
algorithm
to
direct
the
geographic
focus
of
police
then
we
should
not
be
surprised
if
more
arrests
occur
in
those
places
as
a
result
similarly
if
reported
crimes
constitute
another
factor
taken
into
account
by
a
predictive
policing
algorithm
then
crimes
not
usually
reported
or
not
always
reported
will
be
omitted
from
the
decision
about
where
to
direct
police
attention
n
robbery
will
make
the
cut
but
domestic
violence
and
financial
crime
may
not
n
these
hidden
sources
of
bias
have
prompted
concerns
that
predictive
policing
programs
will
justify
a
heavy
police
presence
in
poor
minority
communities
that
have
historically
been
targets
of
over
policing
n
predictive
policing
programs
only
provide
guidance
not
action
what
would
happen
though
if
patrol
robots
use
this
predictive
analysis
if
predictive
policing
programs
fail
to
address
issues
of
human
bias
some
communities
would
be
flooded
with
police
robots
while
others
would
not
be
imagine
further
that
police
robots
would
be
afforded
less
enforcement
discretion
than
human
officers
we
worry
about
human
police
discretion
because
it
is
difficult
if
not
impossible
to
know
if
impermissible
factors
influence
enforcement
but
would
we
live
in
a
better
world
if
police
patrol
robots
enforced
minor
offenses
much
more
frequently
than
human
officers
would
in
neighborhoods
accustomed
to
aggressive
policing
because
they
were
directed
to
do
so
by
their
own
artificial
intelligence
the
future
may
be
one
in
which
robots
of
all
kinds
are
so
ubiquitous
that
even
the
heavy
presence
of
police
robots
in
some
places
would
be
unnoticeable
that
seems
unlikely
instead
it
seems
plausible
that
the
introduction
of
an
all
seeing
interconnected
and
tireless
army
of
police
robots
into
a
neighborhood
could
feel
like
an
occupation
or
virtual
imprisonment
e
who
will
decide
these
questions
the
regulation
of
police
robots
will
prove
to
be
especially
difficult
because
robots
will
likely
be
adopted
and
regulated
much
like
other
recent
police
technologies
in
an
ad
hoc
and
decentralized
manner
most
of
this
can
be
attributed
to
the
structure
of
policing
in
the
united
states
which
is
largely
a
matter
for
state
and
local
agencies
consider
the
immense
interest
in
body
camera
adoption
after
a
string
of
highly
publicized
and
controversial
deaths
of
african
americans
in
police
custody
beginning
with
the
fatal
shooting
of
michael
brown
in
ferguson
before
body
cameras
had
been
adopted
by
a
handful
of
police
departments
today
it
seems
all
but
inevitable
that
body
cameras
will
become
a
standard
patrol
tool
the
federal
government
has
encouraged
that
adoption
in
its
discussion
of
new
police
technologies
the
president
s
task
force
on
st
century
policing
acknowledged
in
its
report
that
body
cameras
could
build
community
trust
and
legitimacy
with
appropriate
regulations
n
that
same
year
the
department
of
justice
made
more
than
million
available
to
local
police
departments
to
purchase
body
cameras
n
eager
to
present
them
as
tools
of
accountability
police
departments
around
the
country
have
embraced
the
adoption
of
body
cameras
yet
many
police
departments
have
adopted
body
cameras
without
detailed
policies
on
their
use
public
access
and
data
storage
those
body
camera
policies
that
do
exist
can
vary
considerably
n
seattle
posted
all
of
its
pilot
project
body
camera
footage
on
youtube
n
while
other
departments
have
declined
to
release
footage
unless
required
by
court
order
n
the
story
of
police
body
camera
adoption
thus
far
has
been
use
first
regulate
later
without
planning
the
use
of
police
robots
will
develop
in
the
same
way
with
more
serious
consequences
should
the
arming
of
police
robots
for
example
be
left
to
local
departments
should
the
type
of
artificial
intelligence
used
by
police
robots
depend
on
the
access
of
private
vendors
to
police
departments
machines
that
may
be
equipped
with
artificial
intelligence
and
capable
of
coercive
force
are
poor
candidates
for
highly
variable
local
control
instead
uniform
national
policies
should
dictate
the
regulation
of
robotic
policing
even
if
robots
of
the
sort
described
here
have
yet
to
arrive
we
can
anticipate
the
sorts
of
questions
that
robotics
will
bring
to
policing
the
degree
of
human
involvement
in
robotic
decisionmaking
whether
and
how
to
arm
police
robots
and
how
to
evaluate
the
legal
responsibility
of
a
police
robot
these
are
all
normative
judgments
about
law
and
policy
in
the
absence
of
uniform
policies
we
are
likely
to
address
these
questions
in
a
piecemeal
fashion
a
mix
of
unenforceable
internal
policies
hesitant
state
legislatures
possibly
conflicting
federal
agency
decisions
and
court
cases
in
which
judges
cannot
agree
as
to
the
appropriate
characterization
of
robots
n
we
could
begin
with
a
national
body
to
develop
robotics
expertise
that
could
advise
federal
state
and
local
lawmakers
a
federal
robotics
commission
for
instance
could
identify
important
legal
and
policy
questions
raised
by
robotics
in
a
variety
of
areas
including
policing
with
specific
substantive
recommendations
n
more
concretely
the
federal
government
can
wield
its
considerable
resources
to
influence
how
local
police
departments
use
robots
while
the
federal
government
cannot
force
state
and
local
police
to
adopt
particular
policies
n
the
department
of
justice
can
and
has
influenced
the
adoption
of
new
strategies
and
technologies
through
the
use
of
federal
funding
for
example
the
widespread
interest
in
and
adoption
of
body
worn
cameras
by
local
police
departments
in
has
been
prompted
in
part
by
the
availability
of
federal
funding
for
body
camera
purchases
likewise
the
department
of
justice
offers
funding
to
local
police
departments
in
order
to
purchase
predictive
policing
systems
n
the
federal
government
could
condition
the
receipt
of
federal
funds
upon
the
adoption
of
regulations
by
grantees
n
police
departments
could
receive
funding
for
robots
so
long
as
they
for
instance
did
not
enable
the
robots
to
use
deadly
force
without
specific
guidelines
already
in
place
no
police
department
would
be
forced
to
accept
a
robot
under
these
conditions
but
every
department
that
sought
federal
funding
would
be
obliged
to
follow
these
conditions
a
top
down
form
of
strong
encouragement
by
the
federal
government
could
be
effective
in
setting
uniform
policies
for
police
robots
conclusion
the
future
introduction
of
artificially
intelligent
robots
capable
of
conducting
human
like
tasks
is
likely
to
change
policing
in
the
same
way
it
will
change
other
fields
assuming
even
some
of
the
traditional
tasks
of
policing
by
robots
however
will
pose
special
problems
we
will
have
to
address
how
much
coercive
force
police
robots
should
possess
and
to
what
degree
they
should
be
permitted
to
operate
independently
in
some
cases
the
use
of
police
robots
may
increase
the
safety
of
policing
for
both
officers
and
the
public
in
other
cases
however
the
use
of
police
robots
to
detain
or
subdue
a
suspect
may
raise
challenges
to
the
conventional
ways
in
which
we
have
regulated
the
police
while
we
cannot
anticipate
every
issue
that
this
technology
raises
we
can
address
many
of
them
now

have
undergone
lengthy
and
complex
reforms
designed

eliminate

neither

on

vanita

head
of
the
department
of

special

announced
an
agreement
between
the
doj
and
the
city
of
cleveland
ohio
seven
months
earlier
tamir
rice
an
unarmed
twelve
year
old
black
boy
was
shot
and
killed
by
the
cleveland
division
of
police
cdp
in
an
incident
that
quickly
came
to
symbolize
the
tension
between
the
cdp
and
its
community
n
the
settlement
was
not
designed
to
address
the
actions
taken
by
officers
involved
in
the
rice
killing
but
to
address
the
wider
problem
of
excessive
force
within
the
cdp
n
gupta
assured
the
people
of
cleveland
that
the
agreement
would
transform
this
police
agency
into
a
model
of
community
oriented
policing
that
will
make
both
police
officers
and
the
people
they
serve
safer
n
the
investigation
of
the
cdp
occurred
pursuant
to
of
the
violent
crime
control
and
law
enforcement
act
of
which
vests
the
doj
with
authority
to
initiate
legal
action
against
law
enforcement
agencies
found
in
systematic
violation
of
constitutional
or
statutory
law
n
this
provision
has
been
instrumental
in
identifying
unlawful
behavior
in
many
of
the
country
s
most
prominent
police
departments
and
has
generated
settlement
agreements
that
articulate
deep
reforms
to
the
offending
department
s
organizational
model
and
accountability
systems
the
initiative
continues
to
serve
as
the
primary
means
of
addressing
systemic
police
misconduct
in
the
united
states
in
fact
in
the
last
eighteen
months
the
doj
has
used
its
pattern
or
practice
authority
to
investigate
allegations
of
systemic
misconduct
in
several
cities
experiencing
recent
police
involved
violence
including
ferguson
missouri
n
baltimore
maryland
n
and
chicago
illinois
n
among
others
though
perhaps
this
recent
wave
of
litigation
is
unprecedented
in
its
speed
and
aggression
the
use
of
federal
power
to
address
police
misconduct
is
nothing
new
since
the
doj
has
investigated
allegations
in
some
sixty
eight
jurisdictions
taking
formal
legal
action
against
thirty
eight
departments
found
to
have
engaged
in
a
pattern
or
practice
of
misconduct
n
rather
than
litigate
these
claims
most
jurisdictions
opt
for
settlement
n
the
resultant
agreements
which
are
enforceable
in
federal
court
typically
require
the
affected
department
to
update
relevant
policy
revamp
training
requirements
and
develop
an
infrastructure
designed
to
promote
internal
and
external
officer
accountability
n
in
many
cases
including
those
reviewed
here
an
independent
monitor
is
hired
to
oversee
implementation
and
establish
the
terms
of
compliance
these
agreements
remain
in
place
until
the
police
are
determined
to
have
been
in
substantial
compliance
with
the
terms
of
the
agreement
typically
defined
as
percent
compliant
for
at
least
two
full
years
n
the
emerging
department
is
stamped
with
the
imprimatur
of
lawfulness
and
designated
as
a
model
for
other
departments
in
terms
of
lawfulness
accountability
and
transparency
n
the
pattern
or
practice
initiative
as
it
has
become
known
has
been
a
useful
tool
for
police
chiefs
and
elected
officials
seeking
change
n
as
well
as
reform
minded
community
members
n
anecdotal
evidence
suggests
that
many
affected
department
leaders
have
found
the
process
worthwhile
as
well
n
the
response
has
not
all
been
positive
however
some
have
claimed
that
the
doj
s
enforcement
of
is
overly
political
n
with
decisions
on
which
jurisdictions
to
investigate
made
for
partisan
rather
than
policy
reasons
n
others
have
argued
that
the
process
is
anti
democratic
and
unnecessarily
exclusive
of
perspectives
brought
to
bear
by
citizen
groups
and
labor
organizations
n
some
have
also
questioned
whether
this
process
which
often
lasts
for
several
years
and
costs
cities
tens
of
millions
of
dollars
n
is
capable
of
producing
meaningful
durable
organizational
change
n
the
record
of
police
department
efforts
to
achieve
and
sustain
organizational
reform
is
at
best
mixed
n
many
of
policing
s
most
promising
innovations
including
high
profile
efforts
like
community
policing
and
problem
oriented
policing
have
not
lived
up
to
their
initial
promise
n
despite
this
pattern
those
who
study
the
police
have
largely
overlooked
the
issue
in
general
scholars
know
relatively
little
about
the
bureaucratic
response
to
reform
and
thus
remain
somewhat
ignorant
about
how
and
why
innovations
in
policing
continue
to
erode
n
this
is
not
entirely
surprising
given
the
complexity
of
the
issue
comprehensive
reform
efforts
resist
the
kinds
of
clear
simple
terms
that
facilitate
ex
post
evaluation
the
process
is
defined
by
multiple
goals
varying
perspectives
and
competing
political
administrative
and
legal
motivations
all
conspiring
to
form
a
confusing
and
contradictory
picture
of
change
n
the
complexity
of
the
process
is
only
magnified
by
the
intensity
of
the
current
political
and
social
context
and
the
contentiousness
with
which
police
officers
confront
changes
to
the
organizational
status
quo
n
opposition
among
front
line
officers
to
pattern
or
practice
reform
is
one
of
several
reasons
to
study
the
process
the
significance
of
the
initiative
the
issue
that
precipitates
it
and
the
vehemence
of
arguments
on
both
sides
is
belied
by
how
little
we
actually
know
about
the
effectiveness
and
sustainability
of
these
reforms
despite
its
relevance
to
legal
administrative
and
policy
scholarship
to
date
there
has
been
relatively
little
social
science
research
on
the
reform
process
with
a
particularly
glaring
lack
of
empirical
analysis
this
paper
is
a
step
toward
filling
in
this
gap
part

a
the
sustainability
of

mandated
organizational

the
need
for
closer
attention
to
this
issue
is
highlighted
by
the
impermanent
nature
of
reforms
brought
about
in
other
policy
contexts
through
similar
means
much
like
pattern
or
practice
settlements
judicially
enforced
remedial
orders
attempt
to
structure
detailed
reform
of
public
bureaucracies
found
in
systematic
violation
of
the
law
n
this
process
has
been
used
to
facilitate
the
desegregation
of
school
districts
n
remedy
unconstitutionally
abusive
prison
systems
n
and
assert
the
rights
of
patients
held
unlawfully
by
state
run
mental
hospitals
n
among
others
again
as
with
pattern
or
practice
reform
formal
oversight
is
terminated
upon
a
determination
typically
made
by
the
presiding
judge
that
the
underlying
constitutional
violation
has
been
redressed
as
a
result
many
see
the
process
as
inherently
fragile
at
the
heart
of
these
arguments
is
the
contention
that
the
sustainability
of
reform
is
undermined
by
the
use
of
a
transitory
policy
solution
external
oversight
to
remedy
what
in
many
cases
is
a
chronic
organizational
problem
n
in
the
absence
of
persistent
external
oversight
and
accountability
the
argument
goes
the
affected
bureaucracy
can
and
perhaps
must
revert
to
ex
ante
operating
procedures
two
examples
illustrate
the
point
despite
the
significant
gains
made
following
the
brown
decision
n
over
the
last
twenty
years
or
so
scholars
have
documented
the
increased
segregation
of
primary
and
secondary
school
children
along
racial
economic
and
linguistic
lines
n
some
contend
that
resegregation
has
occurred
as
a
direct
result
of
limitations
placed
on
the
ability
of
federal
district
court
judges
to
continue
to
manage
local
school
districts
n
rights
based
reforms
achieved
through
litigation
against
state
prison
systems
have
eroded
under
similar
circumstances
a
recent
examination
of
the
arizona
department
of
juvenile
corrections
which
operated
under
federal
control
between
and
documented
post
termination
slippage
in
two
areas
critical
to
the
initial
reform
effort
suicide
prevention
and
inmate
education
n
in
each
case
the
absence
of
external
pressure
to
adhere
to
new
operational
protocols
corresponded
with
a
reversion
to
pre
intervention
practices
b
evaluating
organizational
reform
the
term
institutionalization
is
used
to
define
the
process
of
converting
a
reform
effort
into
an
established
part
of
the
organization
s
normal
functioning
n
and
a
way
of
regularly
conducting
business
n
according
to
oliver
n
once
organizational
activities
are
institutionalized
they
are
assumed
to
become
relatively
stable
enduring
reproducible
and
sustainable
over
long
periods
of
time
without
continuing
justification
in
this
sense
institutionalized
reforms
are
synonymous
with
sustainable
enduring
and
lasting
changes
n
identifying
the
point
in
time
when
a
reform
implementation
effort
ends
and
institutionalization
begins
is
a
complex
task
this
determination
is
particularly
difficult
in
part
as
a
result
of
the
fact
that
the
complex
and
perpetual
nature
of
many
implementation
efforts
makes
a
fixed
end
point
difficult
to
identify
it
is
similarly
difficult
to
identify
the
point
at
which
assessment
of
a
program
s
sustainability
should
begin
here
too
the
nature
of
the
analysis
resists
a
definitive
dichotomous
answer
and
what
little
research
does
exist
provides
conflicting
guidance
some
scholars
believe
that
analysis
should
begin
after
one
year
n
others
say
institutionalization
takes
somewhere
between
five
and
ten
years
to
manifest
n
previous
scholarship
has
employed
various
approaches
to
examine
the
institutionalization
of
organizational
reform
beginning
with
an
assessment
of
staff
response
this
can
be
accomplished
by
measuring
both
the
extent
to
which
organizational
actors
are
aware
of
and
understand
changes
to
policy
and
agency
priorities
brought
on
by
the
reform
n
as
well
as
the
degree
to
which
intervention
behaviors
are
actually
performed
n
staff
willingness
to
adopt
new
operational
protocols
is
often
couched
in
terms
of
organizational
culture
policing
scholars
have
consistently
found
cultural
change
measured
in
terms
of
individual
officer
preferences
norms
and
values
predictive
of
institutionalized
reform
n
the
sustainability
of
pattern
or
practice
reform
is
at
least
in
part
likely
to
be
a
function
of
the
degree
to
which
street
and
mid
level
officers
as
well
as
department
leadership
have
come
to
view
both
the
letter
and
the
spirit
of
the
settlement
as
central
to
the
department
s
mission
and
reflective
of
the
department
s
broader
approach
to
policing
yet
organizational
reform
is
rarely
pursued
for
these
ends
cultural
and
or
behavioral
change
is
typically
instrumental
sought
as
a
means
to
improving
certain
measurable
outcomes
n
since
the
early
s
public
management
scholars
have
advocated
the
use
of
outcomes
to
measure
the
performance
of
public
agencies
and
individual
bureaucrats
rather
than
intangibles
like
attitudes
or
culture
n
the
notion
of
measuring
what
matters
is
a
strong
current
in
policing
research
as
well
n
police
practitioners
are
also
heavily
dependent
on
these
data
arrest
rates
use
of
force
statistics
demographic
and
geographic
data
etc
to
drive
officer
behavior
and
evaluate
policy
change
the
compstat
movement
is
one
such
example
predictive
policing
and
crime
mapping
are
others
part
of
the
challenge
in
evaluating
the
durability
of
organizational
reform
is
identifying
performance
measures
that
accurately
identify
sustainable
change
two
types
of
outcome
measures
are
relevant
beginning
with
systematic
metrics
that
establish
broad
agency
wide
performance
first
in
terms
of
pattern
or
practice
reform
several
such
indicators
are
relevant
including
frequency
of
officer
use
of
force
incidents
citizen
complaints
and
civil
suits
filed
against
the
department
in
fact
nearly
every
key
stakeholder
interviewed
as
a
part
of
this
research
stated
that
trend
data
is
the
most
useful
way
to
gauge
the
effectiveness
of
a
reform
effort
and
a
department
s
progress
toward
institutionalization
second
an
organization
s
ability
to
sustain
change
can
also
be
evaluated
in
terms
of
its
ability
to
avoid
large
scale
performance
crises
these
events
can
take
the
form
of
isolated
high
profile
incidents
like
a
police
shooting
or
a
particularly
vicious
use
of
force
caught
on
tape
think
rodney
king
even
one
such
episode
can
shake
the
public
s
confidence
in
the
agency
negatively
affect
employee
morale
and
weaken
organizational
support
for
departmental
leadership
to
illustrate
the
magnitude
of
such
a
crisis
oliver
argues
that
the
space
shuttle
challenger
disaster
undercut
the
agency
s
reputation
and
provoked
serious
doubts
within
the
organization
about
a
range
of
long
standing
practices
and
procedures
n
along
the
same
lines
cincinnati
city
manager
milt
dohoney
acknowledged
t
he
only
thing
that
could
undo
the
good
that
s
been
done
is
for
the
cincinnati
police
department
to
have
a
number
of
questionable
situations
at
the
street
level
where
a
citizen
gets
either
seriously
injured
or
is
the
recipient
of
a
use
of
deadly
force
t

can
bring
all
of
that
past
baggage
back
up
you
can
have
one
incident
that
really
gets
the
community
on

n
the
perception
of
systematic
and
protracted
corruption

for
instance
would
no
doubt
have
a
similar
destabilizing
effect

scholars
have
examined
the
sustainability
of
organizational
reform

four
interrelated
metrics

insights
from
several
stakeholders
including
independent
monitors
police
department
leadership
and
relevant
political
and
community
leaders
were
gathered
from
several
in
depth
interviews
and
are
used
to
supplement

iv
findings
before
presenting
the
results
of
this
analysis
it
should
be
noted
that
in
most
cases
neither
the
effects
of
reform
nor
institutionalization
should
be
measured
dichotomously
n
organizational
change
is
something
that
proceeds
incrementally
and
thus
is
most
effectively
measured
in
degrees
with
that
in
mind
the
analysis
proceeds
chronologically
beginning
with
pittsburgh
a
pittsburgh
pennsylvania
in
april
the
city
of
pittsburgh
agreed
to
settle
doj
claims
that
the
bureau
of
police
pbp
had
engaged
in
a
pattern
or
practice
of
unlawful
activity
including
the
use
of
excessive
force
and
a
failure
to
discipline
officers
adequately
n
the
consent
decree
was
in
place
until
september
n
shortly
after
the
decree
was
lifted
the
vera
institute
of
justice
attempted
to
gauge
the
degree
to
which
local
officials
can
maintain
consent
decree
reforms
after
the
federal
government
and
its
monitor
withdraw
n
drawing
on
survey
data
and
interviews
with
pbp
officers
and
leaders
from
key
civil
society
groups
gathered
between
march
and
march
vera
evaluated
the
sustainability
of
changes
to
police
behavior
officer
morale
and
public
opinion
brought
on
by
federal
oversight
n
three
themes
emerge
from
this
research
first
pbp
officers
seemed
to
understand
and
respect
the
goals
of
the
reform
but
were
strongly
resentful
of
the
process
n
in
fact
only
a
tiny
percentage
of
those
surveyed
felt
the
reforms
had
improved
performance
or
produced
more
professional
encounters
with
citizens
n
second
despite
this
opposition
the
first
year
or
so
after
federal
oversight
was
lifted
pbp
maintained
operation
of
various
reform
initiatives
including
their
early
intervention
system
new
officer
training
protocols
and
regular
oversight
inspections
n
third
a
majority
of
community
leaders
and
members
of
the
public
saw
the
pbp
as
effective
in
stopping
crime
helping
victims
of
crime
and
working
together
with
city
residents
to
solve
local
problems
n
based
on
these
findings
the
authors
conclude
that
the
implementation
of
the
consent
decree
requirements
in
pittsburgh
dramatically
changed
the
culture
of
the
bureau
of
police
and
that
key
departmental
changes
survive
d
the
life
of
the
decree
intact
n
much
has
happened
in
pittsburgh
since
the
study
was
published
including
three
mayoral
transitions
the
installation
of
four
new
police
chiefs
and
a
protracted
budget
crisis
recent
data
suggest
that
advances
in
officer
accountability
and
community
trust

since

suggests
a
curious
and
potentially
troubling
finding
there
are
several
possible
explanations
the
rise
in
use
of

incidence
could
be
a
reflection
of
a
department
wide
emphasis
on
more
accurate
reporting
with
officers
mandated
to
document
all
use
of
force
regardless
of
its
nature
or
perceived
insignificance
the
decline
in
use
of
force
related
citizen
complaints
is
in
line
with
the
idea
that
documentation
not
actual
use
of
force
has
increased
it
is
possible
too
that
the
reduction
in
disciplinary
actions
is
consistent
with
this
narrative
it
is
also
quite
possible
that
the
combination
of
these
trends
is
evidence
of
a
department
whose
officers
have
become
more
violent
and
less
accountable
though
certainly
not
definitive
the
broader
context
including
a
recent
history
of
political
and
departmental
corruption
and
several
high
profile
incidents
of
police
use
of
force
lends
some
credibility
to
the
latter
interpretation
robert
mcneilly
was
hired
in
april
and
served
as
chief
in
pittsburgh
until
january
mcneilly
remains
an
outspoken
proponent
of
doj
led
reform
and
believes
that
the
consent
decree
process
helped
to
transform
the
pbp
n
despite
his
reputation
as
a
micromanager
and
a
disciplinarian
many
believe
the
pbp
was
more
accountable
more
lawful
and
more
community
friendly
during
mcneilly
s
tenure
than
it
was
before
his
hiring
n
the
same
is
not
said
of
the
pbp
today
n
and
a
concerted
effort
to
move
away
from
mcneilly
s
leadership
may
be
partly
to
blame
according
to
mcneilly
his
longtime
political
battles

a

about

an
icy
dismissal
mcneilly
offered
to
share
what
he
d
done
to

it
s
a
matter
of
public
record
what
was
done

programs

n
whether
or
not
changes
in

can
be
causally
connected
to
recent
backsliding
it
is
hard
to
ignore
the
fact
that
many
of
pbp
s
biggest
problems
have
occurred
since
mcneilly
s
firing
to
wit
between
and
pbp
officers
averaged
use
of

incidents

year

and
that
number
jumped
to
an
increase
of
percent
similarly
the
average
number
of
assaults
committed
against
pbp
officers
in
the
years
after
mcneilly
was
fired
was
some
percent
higher
than
the
average

were
having
the

even
if

account
for

in

required
by

the

the

with
several
community
groups
and
the
local
chapter
of
the
fraternal
order
of
police
as
a

of
this
unique
arrangement
the
cpd
was
not
only
required
to
reform
its
approach
to
police
use
of
force
and
officer
accountability
but
also
to
develop
and
implement
new

instead
pointing
to

a

the
way
i
read

is
we

doing
a
better

we
re
holding

more
accountable

we
re
being
more

n
magaw

sentiment
is
belied
by

corruption
involving

in
march
several
prince
george

county
police
officers
were
videotaped
beating
a

of
maryland
student
during
a
wild
celebration
of
a
victory
by
the
school
s
basketball
team
according
to
the
washington

pgpd
officers
falsely
accused
the
victims
of
aggressive
behavior
in
an
attempt
to
justify
the
use
of
force
police
charging
documents
initially
alleged
that
two
students
jointly
assaulted
police
officers
and
their
horses
the
video
contradicted
that
and
the
charges
against
the
students
were
dropped
n
the
incident
which
cost
county
taxpayers
a
total
of
million
in
legal
fees
n
led
the
washington
post
editorial
board
to
conclude
that
if
no
video
had
surfaced
of
mr
mckenna
s
beating
that
too
would
have
been
swept
under
the
rug
of

impunity

official
indifference
this
cannot
be
allowed
to
stand
it
sends
a
terrible
message
to
the
prince
george

who
now
know
that
consequences
for
their

if
any
will
be
slight

the

scandal

implicated
approximately
cadets

at

one
instructor
was
not

highly
embarrassing
for
the

threatened
several

that

to
review
all

alleged

assembled
a

in

were
on

the

did
not
need
to
be
removed
from

there
were
no
substantive
issues
with
their
training
n
despite
this
pattern
of
unlawful
and
corrupt
behavior
among
pgpd
officers
and
a
continued
absence
of
respect
for
the
rule
of
law
among
certain
county
officials
it
is
hard
to
draw
any
definitive
conclusions
about
the
effectiveness
or
long
term
viability
of
the
reform
effort
there
is
simply
not
enough
known
about
the
department
to
make
a
legitimate
assessment
of
efforts
to
change
the
department
s
approach
to
the
use
of
force
and
external
accountability
further
the
lack
of
available
information
on
the
pgpd
reform
effort
seems
to
support
the
notion
that
the
prince
george
s
county
government
is
either
unwilling
or
unable
to
make
police
accountability
and
department
transparency
a
priority
despite
claims
to
the
contrary
n
the
widespread
unwillingness
among
stakeholders
to
speak
with
me
either
on
or
off
the
record
about
the
process
adds
weight
to
this
conclusion
these
impressions
become
stronger
still
after
even
the
most
cursory
examination
of
incidents
involving
the
county
and
its
police
department
since
the
first
full
year
after
the
moa
was
terminated
taken
together
the
existing
quantitative
and
qualitative
information
seems
to
suggest
a
wide
gulf
between
where
prince
george
s
county
appears
to
be
and
where
the
justice
department
would
have
wanted
them
to
be

the

that
they
can
reasonably
be
attributed
to
a
particularly
severe
incident
or
series
of
incidents
like
the
may
confrontation
between
immigration
protestors
and
lapd
officers
in

n
uses
of
force
incidents
such
as
these
are
unavoidable
in
a
city
as
large
and
as
diverse
as
los
angeles
that
two
such
high
profile
and
significant
events
occurred
in
a
three
year
period
is
most
likely
an
indication
of
this
inevitability
though
something
that
should
be
monitored
fairly
closely
tellingly
the
cd
process
has
been
credited
with
minimizing
the
effects
of
these
types
of
violent
incidents
los
angeles
has
had
its
fair
share
of
officer
involved
shootings
recently
and
they
still
generate
protests
but
things
haven
t
really
gotten
out
of
hand
police
reform
groups
and
many
lapd
officials
say
this
is
a
testament
to
all
the
work
that
s
been
done
to
repair
relations
with
communities
over
the
year
n
the
harvard
report
concludes
with
a
note
about
the
sustainability
of
the
changes
found
it
is
not
that
policing
in
los
angeles
is
all
that
it
can
ever
be
but
the
balance
of
local
leadership
and
local
oversight
is
healthy
enough
to
carry
the
process
of
continuous
improvement
forward
in
the
absence
of
doj
oversight
n
the
strongest
argument
to
be
made
along
these
lines
will
surely
include
discussion
of
the
relatively
strong
external
accountability
mechanisms
in
los
angeles
pre
existing
institutions
like
the
police
commission
and
the
city
s
inspector
general
s
office
were
empowered
by
the
consent
decree
and
appear
as
of
this
writing
to
remain
active
in
their
oversight
of
the
lapd
n
moreover
the
city
has
a
strong
network
of
civil
rights
organizations
to
buttress
these
formal
institutions
as
well
as
an
active
local
media
one
manifestation
of
this
external
oversight
is
the
extent
to
which
the
department
has
committed
to
sharing
performance
data
and
other
information
with
the
public
according
to
a
recent
analysis
of
police
department
websites
the
lapd
ranked
third
in
terms
of
web
based
transparency
n
to
some
including
author
and
attorney
tom
hayden
the
current
regulatory
infrastructure
is
insufficient
w
ithout
the
oversight
of
a
federal
judge
and
a
consent
decree
road
map
the
system
of
police
reform
in
los
angeles
will
remain
ad
hoc
ineffective
and
even
broken
beneath
the
layers
of
reform
added
to
the
department
over
three
decades
it
remains
the
fact
that
the
police
predominate
in
policing
the
police
n
this
skepticism
is
surely
a
function
of
the
department
s
long
history
of
violence
racial
injustice
and
impunity
the
view
of
earl
ofari
hutchinson
president
of
the
los
angeles
urban
policy
roundtable
is
instructive
there
are
still
some
of
the
old
troubling
signs
officers
that
overuse
deadly
force
or
commit
acts
of
misconduct
must
be
punished
without
it
it
reinforces
the
notion
that
officers
can
administer
street
corner
justice

is
the
practice
that
got
the

into
so
much
hot
water
in

past

outcomes
that
remained

during

and

high

that
prompted
pittsburgh
mayor
bill
peduto
to
declare
the
department
on
the
verge
of
another
consent
decree
n
by
contrast
the
process
seems
to
have
had
a
sustained
positive
effect
in
both
cincinnati
and
washington
d
c
numbers
of
post
reform
citizen
complaints
against
cpd
officers
continue
to
decline
as
does
use
of
force
incidence
and
the
number
of
injuries
sustained
by
cpd
officers
such
progress
has
contributed
to
strengthening
the
relationship
between
the
department
and
minority
community
members
n
and
a
sterling
national
reputation
n
in
washington
d
c
declines
in
both
deadly
force
incidence
and
force
based
civil
litigation
suggest
that
the
consent
decree
brought
with
it
significant
improvements
in
department
use
of
force
policy
training
and
oversight
inconsistencies
in
citizen
complaint
volume
complicate
the
picture
somewhat
as
does
the
startling
number
of
officers
that
have
faced
criminal
charges
in
the
post
reform
years
though
on
balance
the
department
appears
to
have
made
and
sustained
considerable
progress
similar
positive
trends
are
evident
in
los
angeles
though
there
has
been
less
time
to
evaluate
post
reform
progress
there
objective
evaluation
of
prince
george
s
county
is
rather
difficult
given
the
limited
amount
of
data
made
available
but
it
seems
apparent
that
the
department
continues
to
struggle
with
officer
misconduct
and
has
quite
a
ways
to
go
to
reach
the
kind
of
accountability
infrastructure
developed
in
other
jurisdictions
even
in
light
of
certain
methodological
limitations
these
findings
highlight
the
challenge
jurisdictions
face
in
working
to
institutionalize
pattern
or
practice
reform
they
also
demonstrate
how
little
we
actually
know
about
the
effectiveness
and
sustainability
of
pattern
or
practice
reform
b
the
need
for
more
consistent
data
owing
largely
to
the
absence
of
consistent
outcome
data
and
a
lack
of
cooperation
among
potential
subject
jurisdictions
it
is
rather
difficult
to
generalize
beyond
the
included
cities
further
without
the
data
needed
to
properly
establish
benchmarks
formal
consideration
of
causal
hypotheses
was
all
but
impossible
in
the
absence
of
a
deeper
quantitative
analysis
there
remains
the
possibility
that
some
of
the
trends
discussed
occurred
as
a
result
of
factors
other
than
reform
implementation
or
termination
the
need
to
evaluate
the
effectiveness
and
long
term
sustainability
of
these
initiatives
is
clear
yet
we
lack
the
basic
data
needed
to
do
so
this
need
not
be
the
case
in
some
jurisdictions
including
los
angeles
the
doj
has
insisted
on
the
capture
and
publication
of
relevant
outcome
measures
n
mandating
the
dissemination
of
use
of
force
statistics
officer
disciplinary
decisions
and
civil
litigation
results
would
be
a
solid
step
toward
facilitating
evaluation
of
future
settlement
agreements
as
would
requiring
independent
monitors
to
set
and
report
on
outcome
related
goals
rather
than
continuing
to
perform
what
amounts
to
an
exclusively
process
driven
assessment
c
the
need
for
more
thorough
nuanced
analysis
the
field
would
also
benefit
from
future
research
that
moves
beyond
the
use
of
outcome
data
to
evaluate
sustainability
beginning
with
an
assessment
of
officer
attitudes
and
organizational
culture
more
broadly
in
addition
to
contributing
to
more
thorough
descriptive
knowledge
examining
the
relationship
between
outcomes
officer
behavior
and
department
culture
would
help
to
broaden
understanding
of
those
factors
that
explain
institutionalization
success
and
failure
to
what
extent
do
these
elements
show
a
consistent
picture
of
agency
efforts
to
pursue
and
institutionalize
reform
can
a
department
achieve
and
sustain
desirable
levels
of
key
outcomes
for
example
in
spite
of
a
culture
that
may
not
reflect
core
reform
values
a
closer
look
at
the
inner
workings
of
affected
departments
would
allow
for
a
much
more
nuanced
assessment
of
change
by
necessity
the
current
research
framed
pattern
or
practice
reform
as
a
monolithic
initiative
rather
than
as
a
series
of
individual
components
in
fact
development
and
implementation
of
each
component
from
new
policies
and
training
to
community
outreach
efforts
are
unique
distinguishable
efforts
each
worthy
of
a
separate
evaluation
as
it
stands
today
it
is
all
but
impossible
to
tease
out
the
value
of
specific
components
either
in
terms
of
their
effectiveness
or
sustainability
does
a
department
s
use
of
an
early
intervention
system
actually
lead
to
fewer
incidents
of
misconduct
and
lower
civil
litigation
costs
to
what
extent
does
the
system
s
effectiveness
change
over
time
is
there
an
interaction
between
system
usage
and
officer
training
in
terms
of
both
short
and
long
term
outcomes
answers
to
these
and
other
similar
questions
would
improve
the
efficiency
of
future
settlement
agreements
and
aid
departments
in
institutionalizing
change
finally
future
research
should
continue
to
monitor
these
and
other
pattern
or
practice
jurisdictions
paying
particular
attention
to
identifying
those
factors
that
distinguish
reforms
that
endure
from
those
that
erode
explaining
the
success
in
cincinnati
would
be
a
useful
point
of
departure
to
what
extent
did
support
for
reform
among
city
leaders
and
community
residents
contribute
to
the
durability
of
that
department
s
turn
around
the
strength
of
officer
accountability
mechanisms
both
internal
to
the
cpd
and
in
agencies
like
the
citizen
complaint
authority
strategic
efforts
to
coopt
potentially
hostile
groups
like
the
officers
union
was
support
from
middle
management
as
critical
in
cincinnati
as
it
was
to
sustaining
problem
oriented
policing
strategies
in
charlotte
north
carolina
n
perhaps
sustainability
is
a
function
of
robust
efforts
to
educate
officers
to
nature
goals
and
benefits
of
such
reforms
as
some
contend
n
vi
conclusion
the
best
evidence
on
the
doj
s
pattern
or
practice
initiative
suggests
that
after
implementing
mandated
reforms
affected
departments
will
likely
possess
a
stronger
more
capable
accountability
infrastructure
more
robust
training
and
a
set
of
policies
that
reflect
national
best
practices
n
these
changes
occur
as
a
result
of
the
agreements
substantive
requirements
and
the
close
external
oversight
that
tends
to
accompany
their
implementation
but
as
the
current
research
shows
the
reform
process
is
more
complex
than
the
pursuit
of
substantial
compliance
with
settlement
terms
the
resultant
organizational
changes
are
not
self
sustaining
implementation
does
not
in
and
of
itself
guarantee
meaningful
institutionalized
change
in
fact
the
assumption
that
it
does
may
undermine
efforts
to
promote
lasting
reform
the
typical
settlement
agreement
binds
affected
departments
to
a
five
year
period
of
federal
oversight
upon
a
declaration
of
substantial
compliance
which
usually
occurs
on
or
around
the
end
of
the
contractual
term
the
doj
announces
that
department
has
been
reformed
promptly
terminates
the
agreement
and
moves
on
to
other
initiatives
n
this
abrupt
stoppage
signals
to
the
department
that
sufficient
change
has
been
made
and
that
no
further
attention
to
the
reform
is
necessary
given
how
tenuous
these
reforms
appear
to
be
and
how
unpopular
they
remain
among
the
rank
and
file
the
goals
of
the
initiative
would
likely
be
better
served
by
ongoing
external
oversight
of
the
affected
department
periodic
external
check
ups
designed
to
promote
independent
post
termination
oversight
whether
conducted
by
doj
attorneys
or
a
public
agency
similar
to
the
one
created
by
the
state
of
new
jersey
n
would
be
a
worthwhile
investment
the
absence
of
sufficient
monitoring
and
oversight
can
be
tragic
the
city
of
cleveland
knows
this
well
in
august
the
doj
opened
a
pattern
or
practice
investigation
into
claims
of
excessive
force
by
cleveland
division
of
police
cdp
officers
n
in
july
the
year
tamir
rice
was
born
and
twelve
years
before
his
fatal
encounter
with
the
cleveland
police
department
doj
attorneys
recommended
that
the
cdp
clarify
its
use
of
deadly
force
policy
n
while
raising
questions
about
the
competency
thoroughness
and
impartiality
of
cdp
use
of
force
investigations
n
nearly
identical
to
language
drawn
from
the
investigative
findings
letter
sent
to
cleveland
mayor
frank
jackson
in
december
n
though
the
case
of
police
reform
in
cleveland
is
certainly
unique
the
overarching
point
remains
organizational
change
is
a
long
and
fragile
process
effectiveness
is
not
guaranteed
and
early
gains
do
not
necessarily
equate
to
institutionalized
change
this
lesson
is
a
critical
one
for
doj
staff
and
stakeholders
in
jurisdictions
currently
under
federal
oversight
for
police
leaders
and
other
public
actors
contemplating
reform
and
for
policing
scholars
and
other
students
of
the
administrative
process
the
sooner
it
takes
hold
the
more
likely
it
is
that
changes
brought
about
through
the
pattern
or
practice
initiative
will
not
suffer
the
fate
of
other
recent
reform
efforts

we

that

cdp

the
air
support
division
of
the
los
angeles
police
department
operates
out
of
a
labyrinthine
building
on
ramirez
street
in
the
city
s
downtown
near
the
los
angeles
river
a
looming
mass
of
utilitarian
architecture
tucked
beside
the
freeway
the
complex
appears
to
have
no
real
public
face
here
the
view
from
the
street
matters
little
instead
like
much
of
the
city
around
it
the
air
support
division
makes
more
sense
when
seen
from
above
on
the
first
of
several
flights
i
would
take
with
the
division
over
the
course
of
the
last
three
years
our
helicopter
lifted
off
into
the
haze
of
a
july
afternoon
the
true
bulk
of
the
structure
below
us
finally
revealed
itself
the
building
s
landing
deck
alone
seemed
nearly
the
size
of
an
aircraft
carrier
s
and
from
this
new
elevated
perspective
the
headquarters
indeed
resembled
a
landlocked
warship
in
the
heart
of
the
city
a
half
dozen
other
helicopters
were
waiting
there
on
the
tarmac
the
division
began
with
a
single
helicopter
in
and
it
now
has
in
all
augmented
by
a
king
air
fixed
wing
plane
the
aircrews
operate
in
a
state
of
constant
readiness
with
at
least
two
helicopters
in
flight
at
any
given
time
for
hours
of
every
day
a
ground
crew
is
suited
up
and
on
call
for
the
remaining
three
between
a
m
and
a
m
on
weekends
considered
peak
hours
the
number
of
airborne
helicopters
goes
up
to
three
although
in
a
crisis
the
division
might
send
as
many
as
four
or
five
ships
up
at
once
the
police
had
allowed
me
to
fly
with
them
so
that
i
could
see
the
world
from
their
perspective
through
its
aerial
patrols
the
division
has
uniquely
unfettered
access
to
a
fundamentally
different
experience
of
los
angeles
one
in
which
the
city
must
constantly
be
reinterpreted
from
above
in
real
time
with
the
intention
of
locating
tracking
and
interrupting
criminal
activity
this
also
means
that
the
police
are
not
only
thinking
about
los
angeles
as
it
currently
exists
their
job
is
to
anticipate
things
that
have
yet
to
occur
not
just
where
criminals
are
but
where
and
when
they
might
arrive
next
they
patrol
time
as
well
as
space
in
this
sense
although
it
has
been
in
continual
operation
for
the
past
years
the
division
has
much
to
tell
us
about
policing
the
cities
of
the
future
soon
after
we
were
airborne
a
call
came
in
for
helicopter
support
and
we
diverted
north
flying
nearly
to
the
mountains
that
separate
los
angeles
from
the
deserts
beyond
a
woman
had
reportedly
barricaded
herself
inside
a
house
with
a
loaded
millimeter
handgun
why
she
had
done
this
was
not
at
all
clear
and
it
would
remain
unexplained
to
us
but
the
police
needed
to
set
up
a
perimeter
they
needed
someone
looking
down
from
above
a
standard
two
person
helicopter
crew
consists
of
a
pilot
and
a
tactical
flight
officer
or
t
f
o
the
pilot
steers
but
the
course
is
set
by
the
t
f
o
who
monitors
as
many
as
six
simultaneous
radio
frequencies
including
emergency
calls
from
the
ground
as
well
as
chatter
from
other
police
helicopters
and
even
passenger
aircraft
landing
at
los
angeles
international
airport
the
constant
buzz
of
layered
voices
police
codes
and
call
signs
was
indecipherable
to
me
but
the
t
f
o
can
decide
in
an
instant
if
a
given
call
is
worth
responding
to
the
pilot
can
change
speed
and
direction
significantly
accelerating
up
to
miles
an
hour
turning
so
sharply
that
the
crew
will
sometimes
arrive
above
a
crime
scene
flying
sideways
their
bodies
parallel
to
the
ground
if
none
of
the
calls
are
worth
answering
however
the
crew
might
wander
some
t
f
o
s
have
a
working
knowledge
of
los
angeles
arcana
to
match
that
of
the
most
veteran
hollywood
tour
guide
from
the
address
of
charlie
chaplin
s
old
mansion
to
the
location
of
the
house
used
for
exterior
shots
in
the
brady
bunch
my
t
f
o
that
day
was
ren
e
muro
now
a
year
veteran
of
the
air
support
division
who
had
a
got
altitude
sticker
on
the
back
of
her
flight
helmet
as
we
circled
the
location
she
set
about
identifying
assessing
and
describing
the
streets
including
a
quick
scan
of
nearby
properties
where
if
the
barricaded
woman
were
to
flee
she
would
most
likely
end
up
for
minutes
muro
suggested
placements
for
officers
such
that
they
could
prevent
any
possible
escape
route
naming
specific
corners
and
clarifying
locations
even
occasionally
directing
police
officers
to
neighbors
who
were
milling
about
so
they
could
warn
them
to
head
back
inside
this
seemed
like
a
particularly
difficult
case
however
because
the
street
grid
here
was
out
of
sync
muro
explained
with
the
rest
of
the
city
the
normally
orderly
numbering
system
didn
t
apply
perhaps
because
the
neighborhood
was
punctuated
by
strange
l
shaped
streets
and
cul
de
sacs
this
presented
a
unique
narrative
challenge
for
her
in
relaying
which
bend
in
a
particular
street
she
wanted
a
patrol
car
to
head
toward
muro
persevered
flying
in
an
endless
gyre
over
parking
lots
freeway
on
ramps
and
a
confused
tangle
of
empty
streets
and
i
watched
as
a
growing
armada
of
patrol
cars
circled
below
she
patiently
arranged
them
like
chess
pieces
forming
a
tactical
geometry
that
locked
down
the
entire
neighborhood
it
was
real
time
urban
planning
as
implemented
by
the
police
before
we
could
learn
the
fate
of
the
barricaded
woman
however
we
had
moved
on
with
the
title
of
a
book
published
years
ago
thomas

coined
a
term
we
still
use
today
for
describing
the
ideal

more

political

arguments

atop

foundation
of

panoramic
survey
of
governance
public
safety
and
crime
with
its
vigilant
top
down
views
of
a
megacity
divided
into
districts
with
clearly
defined
canals
streets
and
squares
reads
at
times
like
a
literary
helicopter
shot
as
if
we
are
passing
over
the
roofs
of
an
idyllic
metropolis
we
see
forests
and
rivers
busy
markets
and
residential
neighborhoods
a
well
ordered
geography
that
more
imagined
would
be
governed
by
a
nearly
omnipotent
political
will

in
the
name

held
a
unique
judicial
position
with
broad
responsibilities
for
governmental
administration
and
municipal
law
enforcement
he
was
undersheriff
of
the
city
of
london
for
the
last
half
millennium
when
we
refer
to
the
ideal
city
we
have
been
invoking
an
urban
blueprint
as
imagined
by
a
cop
crime
shapes
cities
even
paris
the
city
of
light
takes
its
nickname
according
to
one
story
from
streetlights
first
instituted
as
part
of
a
th
century
police
operation
but
the
reverse
is
also
true
cities
get
the
types
of
crime
their
design
calls
for
this
logic
extends
even
down
to
their
bedrock
tunnel
jobs
are
almost
unimaginable
in
granite
based
manhattan
for
example
but
the
soft
sedimentary
rocks
of
los
angeles
a
former
seabed
make
it
more
susceptible
to
subterranean
crime
infrastructure
also
plays
a
major
role
in
permitting
or
preventing
entire
classes
of
criminal
activity
the
construction
of
the
city
s
freeway
system
in
the
s
helped
to
instigate
a
later
spike
in
bank
crime
activity
by
offering
easy
getaways
from
financial
institutions
constructed
at
the
confluence
of
on
ramps
and
offramps
this
is
a
convenient
location
for
busy
commuters
but
also
for
prospective
bandits
who
can
pull
off
the
freeway
rob
a
bank
and
get
back
on
the
freeway
practically
before
the
police
have
been
alerted
the
maneuver
became
so
common
in
the
s
that
the
los
angeles
police
have
a
name
for
it
a
stop
and
rob
the
built
environment
may
inadvertently
catalyze
new
forms
of
illegal
activity
but
this
also
means
that
the
los
angeles
police
department
is
constantly
responding
to
criminal
innovation
with
new
forms
of
police
work
often
before
the
rest
of
the
world
even
knows
they
might
be
necessary
with
its
campaign
of
ubiquitous
aerial
surveillance
los
angeles
is
a
kind
of
real
time
r
d
site
for
the
world
s
sprawling
megacities
as
they
too
try
to
manage
the
extralegal
consequences
of
their
newfound
expansion
after
my
first
flight
cole
burdette
the
chief
tactical
flight
officer
who
supervises
the
training
of
all
the
other
t
f
o
s
walked
me
through
a
quick
tour
of
the
headquarters
a
dense
warren
of
small
corridors
and
stairways
our
final
destination
was
a
classroomlike
space
lined
with
whiteboards
where
we
sat
down
to
talk
about
crime
and
the
city
with
his
olive
green
flight
suit
and
a
military
style
haircut
burdette
could
have
passed
for
an
air
force
officer
he
was
observant
and
detailed
oriented
he
would
frequently
restart
entire
paragraphs
of
explanation
until
he
arrived
at
the
correct
narrative
sequence
and
only
then
would
he
move
on
to
his
next
point
or
answer
those
answers
were
also
astonishingly
precise
in
their
geographic
reference
points
he
would
bring
up
exact
intersections
and
even
business
addresses
somewhere
out
there
in
the
greater
maze
of
los
angeles
never
once
relying
on
a
map
each
location
would
then
serve
a
specific
role
in
burdette
s
ensuing
narrative
sometimes
even
five
or
minutes
later
as
he
tried
to
make
clear
why
a
certain
crime
or
event
had
unfolded
in
one
way
and
not
another
los
angeles
is
a
fundamentally
different
kind
of
place
from
new
york
or
chicago
he
explained
with
their
skyscrapers
and
deep
canyonlike
streets
those
dense
clusters
of
high
rises
and
towers
make
thorough
aerial
patrols
nearly
impossible
not
to
mention
potentially
dangerous
in
l
a
by
contrast
you
simply
cannot
see
the
whole
city
if
you
rely
solely
on
ground
patrols
limiting
yourself
to
roads
is
not
going
to
work
the
aerial
perspective
is
crucial
you
have
to
think
in
a
distinctly
volumetric
way
about
how
neighborhoods
are
actually
linked
and
what
the
most
efficient
routes
might
be
between
them
after
all
this
is
how
criminals
think
burdette
said
and
this
is
how
they
pioneer
new
ways
to
escape
from
you
even
the
region
s
flight
paths
have
come
to
influence
how
criminals
use
the
city
the
heavily
restricted
airspace
around
los
angeles
international
airport
burdette
pointed
out
has
transformed
the
surrounding
area
into
a
well
known
hiding
spot
for
criminals
trying
to
flee
by
car
los
angeles
police
helicopters
cannot
always
approach
the
airport
because
of
air
traffic
control
safety
concerns
indeed
all
those
planes
with
their
otherwise
invisible
approach
patterns
across
the
southern
california
sky
have
come
to
exert
a
kind
of
sculptural
effect
on
local
crimes
across
the
city
their
lines
of
flight
limit
the
effectiveness
of
police
helicopter
patrols
and
thus
alter
the
preferred
getaway
routes
burdette
s
own
spatial
understanding
of
los
angeles
easily
rivals
that
of
any
urban
historian
city
planner
or
local
architect
his
knowledge
of
the
terrain
is
the
product
of
thousands
of
hours
of
flight
time
during
which
he
has
had
to
constantly
reconcile
the
moving
map
of
the
city
displayed
on
his
helicopter
s
monitor
with
the
actual
streets
below
but
of
course
burdette
has
also
had
the
help
of
advanced
technology
over
several
more
flights
each
with
a
different
combination
of
pilot
and
tactical
flight
officer
i
was
able
to
see
this
array
of
technical
devices
firsthand
each
helicopter
for
example
contains
a
unit
that
picks
up
signals
from
lojack
tracking
systems
which
are
used
commercially
as
a
tool
for
recovering
stolen
vehicles
during
a
slow
spell
one
night
we
drifted
above
a
stretch
of
the
freeway
linking
the
streets
of
hollywood
with
the
san
fernando
valley
looking
for
stolen
cars
in
transit
the
t
f
o
intently
watched
the
craft
s
dashboard
display
fishing
for
signals
in
the
darkness
to
his
apparent
disappointment
we
found
none
later
we
tracked
a
possible
stolen
sedan
one
not
equipped
with
lojack
using
the
next
best
technological
assist
the
helicopter
s
spotlight
a
blinding
million
candlepower
inferno
justifiably
known
as
the
nightsun
it
has
the
effect
of
a
colossal
stage
lighting
rig
implying
high
drama
with
its
focused
glow
he
s
going
into
the
buildings
the
t
f
o
exclaimed
this
meant
the
car
was
heading
downtown
where
the
city
s
dense
core
of
skyscrapers
would
prevent
us
from
following
it
the
driver
wasn
t
nearly
as
savvy
as
the
pilot
and
t
f
o
thought
however
he
soon
exited
the
freeway
to
drive
straight
home
we
saw
followed
by
two
squad
cars
and
six
motorcycle
units
that
we
had
been
directing
all
along
the
driver
was
arrested
in
the
street
after
we
flew
away
we
learned
from
radio
chatter
that
it
was
simply
a
d
u
i
on
another
flight
i
was
shown
the
flir
or
forward
looking
infrared
camera
to
demonstrate
how
it
operated
my
t
f
o
that
night
instructed
his
pilot
to
head
for
the
beaches
of
santa
monica
almost
at
once
the
flir
monitor
mounted
in
the
cockpit
lit
up
with
the
strangely
beautiful
thermal
flare
of
human
life
white
glowing
forms
walking
along
the
beach
or
lying
on
dark
blankets
next
to
one
another
we
flew
quite
low
to
the
water
now
as
the
t
f
o
explained
some
basics
of
infrared
visualization
and
i
watched
as
apparently
sleeping
forms
white
hot
came
into
sharp
focus
curled
up
beneath
lifeguard
structures
there
was
nowhere
to
hide
i
saw
you
could
be
concealed
behind
the
trunk
of
a
tree
yet
an
eerie
aura
would
still
surround
you
shining
like
a
halo
looking
out
the
helicopter
window
i
saw
nothing
but
blackness
silky
and
absolute
up
and
down
the
beach
in
both
directions
but
when
i
peered
back
at
the
monitor
lights
were
moving
everywhere
like
fireflies
those
who
want
to
stay
hidden
from
flirs
are
developing
countermeasures
of
course
back
on
the
ground
i
asked
burdette
about
some
of
their
preferred
techniques
people
are
definitely
catching
on
he
said
they
ll
rub
mud
all
over

i
was
expecting
him
to
laugh
along
with
me
but
after
a
slight
hesitation
he
said
it
does
work
except
a
little
bit
of
light
starts
to
shine
out
of
each
end
once
they
ve
been

a
little
that
s
how
we
find
them
in
city
of
quartz
his
apocalyptic
portrait
of
los
angeles
circa
mike
davis
described
the
air
support
division
as
an
invasive
space
police
a
darkly
futuristic
force
of
winged
overlords
scanning
the
metropolis
from
above
and
buzz
bombing
whole
neighborhoods
at
a
time
one
of
the
most
memorable
moments
in
his
book
is
when
he
describes
how
police
pilots
navigate
the
city
to
facilitate
ground
air
synchronization
he
writes
thousands
of
residential
rooftops
have
been
painted
with
identifying
street
numbers
transforming
the
aerial
view
of
the
city
into
a
huge
police
grid
with
this
incredible
image
davis
implies
that
the
police
have
stealthily
redesigned
urban
space
to
suit
their
own
needs
even
painting
our
addresses
onto
our
roofs
without
us
noticing
all
so
that
we
can
be
more
easily
corralled
for
davis
the
city
itself
is
a
police
tool
an
instrument
of
authority
we
can
no
longer
fully
see
and
thus
cannot
effectively
critique
or
oppose
davis
is
right
of
course
that
aerial
command
is
an
instrument
of
control
and
a
potentially
sinister
one
at
that
but
he
was
wrong
about
the
degree
to
which
the
los
angeles
police
have
been
able
to
mold
the
landscape
in
reality
those
police
branded
rooftop
numbers
are
all
but
nonexistent
at
least
for
now
when
i
asked
burdette
what
he
would
change
if
he
could
redesign
the
city
from
the
perspective
of
a
tactical
flight
officer
he
mentioned
exactly
that
idea
painting
large
identifying
numbers
on
the
roofs
of
building
complexes
like
schools
and
hospitals
if
those
sorts
of
facilities
could
be
numbered
in
a
clockwise
direction
starting
with
the
entry
building
he
explained
directing
officers
to
a
structure
deep
within
the
sprawl
would
be
far
easier
thus
far
however
such
an
ambitious
project
has
been
beyond
the
police
department
s
institutional
reach
throughout
the
history
of
aerial
surveillance
in
los
angeles
the
urban
landscape
has
largely
been
an
inheritance
beyond
the
control
of
any
single
authority
the
air
support
division
s
real
ingenuity
has
been
in
how
it
responds
to
a
world
that
it
did
not
in
fact
design
precisely
as
a
way
of
making
up
for
the
absence
of
rooftop
numbering
for
instance
the
air
support
division
has
deployed
something
burdette
called
the
rules
of
four
as
guidelines
they
fall
somewhere
between
a
rule
of
thumb
and
an
algorithm
and
they
allow
for
nearly
instantaneous
yet
accurate
aerial
navigation
the
way
the
parcels
work
in
the
city
of
los
angeles
he
began
is
that
main
street
and
first
street
are
the
hub
of
the
city
the
street
numbers
radiate
outward
by
quadrant
east
west
north
south
with
blocks
advancing
by
hundreds
the
block
below
th
street
and
building
numbers
advancing
by
fours
etc
the
rest
is
arithmetic
if
it
s
the
fourth
house
south
of
the
corner
on
the
west
side
of
the
street
burdette
explained
then
the
address
is
going
to
be
an
odd
number
the
rules
of
four
mean
that
i
can
do
four
times
four
it
s
the
fourth
house
times
four
which
is
but
because
the
numbers
on
that
side
of
the
street
are
odd
we
know
we
re
going
to
be
looking
at
either
or
so
if
the
address
is
south
of
th
street
and
it
s
the
fourth
house
on
the
west
side
of
the
street
then
it
s
going
to
be
or
it
is
going
to
be
that
address
with
the
rules
of
four
an
otherwise
intimidating
and
uncontrollable
knot
of
streets
takes
on
newfound
clarity
it
is
no
coincidence
that
the
los
angeles
police
department
built
its
main
headquarters
at
the
center
of
it
all
at
the
intersection
of
first
and
main
it
placed
the
department
at
the
numerological
heart
of
the
metropolis
the
zero
point
from
which
everything
else
emanates
as
thomas
more
proposed
a
well
ordered
metropolis
is
a
fundamental
prerequisite
for
any
visionary
act
of
urban
governance
the
air
support
division
has
simply
extended
that
observation
into
its
understanding
of
the
existing
order
in
this
case
of
the
city
s
numbered
houses
and
streets
but
if
the
promise
of
aerial
policing
is
to
make
the
city
more
legible
to
help
officers
read
events
more
clearly
the
obvious
temptation
is
to
somehow
turn
the
page
to
anticipate
future
events
as
well
and
here
we
confront
a
final
dimension
time
and
another
police
technique
called
predictive
policing
pioneered
by
the
u
c
l
a
anthropologist
jeffrey
brantingham
predictive
policing
relies
upon
an
interpretive
combination
of
machine
learning
algorithms
and
deep
pools
of
police
data
to
estimate
where
certain
types
of
crime
like
car
thefts
or
burglaries
are
most
likely
to
happen
next
brantingham
has
compared
the
technique
to
a
netflix
recommendation
algorithm
in
that
it
makes
suggestions
about
the
future
based
on
what
has
occurred
in
the
recent
past
predictive
policing
does
not
try
to
predict
specific
events
but
it
can
help
the
police
identify
surprisingly
precise
areas
of
high
crime
and
then
direct
officers
to
those
areas
casting
what
they
hope
will
be
a
pre
emptive
shadow
with
predictive
policing
cops
will
no
longer
be
describing
and
reacting
to
the
landscape
but
writing
it
in
real
time
and
with
a
far
greater
impact
on
individual
neighborhoods
than
the
simple
arrangement
of
police
cars
on
a
stakeout
or
even
numbers
on
a
roof
in
their
quest
to
establish
an
all
seeing
utopian
gaze
looking
down
upon
the
rooftops
of
an
unsuspecting
metropolis
the
police
may
have
stumbled
upon
their
most
powerful
and
perhaps
most
worrying
means
of
reshaping
the
city

to
a

it
wasn

that
brought
the

officer
to
this
spot
but
a
whirring
computer
crunching
years
of
crime
data
to
arrive
at
a
prediction
an
auto
theft
or
burglary
would
probably
occur
near
here
on
this
particular

hoping
to
head
it
off
coleman
inspected

prognostication
system
known

predictive
policing
represents
a
paradigm
shift
that
is
sweeping
police
departments
across
the
country
law
enforcement
agencies
are
increasingly
trying
to
forecast
where
and
when
crime
will
occur
or
who
might
be
a
perpetrator
or
a
victim
using
software
that
relies

math

uses

the
hope
is
the
holy

of

preventing
crime
before
it
happens
said
andrew
g
ferguson
a
university
of
the
district
of
columbia
law
professor
preparing
a
book
on
big
data
and
policing
now
used
by
of
the
nation
s

forces
by
one
count
the
technologies
are
at
the
center
of
an
increasingly
heated
debate
about
their
effectiveness
potential
impact
on
poor
and
minority
communities
and
implications
for
civil
liberties
some
police
departments
have
hailed
predpol
and
other
systems
as
instrumental
in
reducing
crime
focusing
scarce
resources
on
trouble
spots
and
individuals
and
replacing
officers
hunches
and
potential
biases
with
hard
data
but
privacy
and
racial
justice
groups
say
there
is
little
evidence
the
technologies
work
and
note
the
formulas
powering
the
systems
are
largely
a
secret
they
are
concerned
the
practice
could
unfairly
concentrate
enforcement
in
communities
of
color
by
relying
on
racially
skewed
policing
data
and
they
worry
that
officers
who
expect
a
theft
or
burglary
is
about
to
happen
may
be
more
likely
to
treat
the
people
they
encounter
as
potential
criminals
the
experiments
are
one
of
the
most
consequential
tests
of
algorithms
that
are
increasingly
powerful
forces
in
our
lives
determining
credit
scores
measuring
job
performance
and
flagging
children
who
might
be
abused
the
white
house
has
been
studying
how
to
balance
the
benefits
and
risks
they
pose
the
technical
capabilities
of
big
data
have
reached
a
level
of
sophistication
and
pervasiveness
that
demands
consideration
of
how
best
to
balance
the
opportunities
afforded
by
big
data
against
the
social
and
ethical
questions
these
technologies
raise
the
white
house
wrote
in
a
recent
report
a
seismic
shift
in
policing
it
was
a
m
on
a
monday
but
the
sheet
of
paper
coleman
held
in
his
hands
offered
a
glimpse
of
how
oct
might
go
an
auto
theft
near
van
nuys
and
glenoaks
a
burglary
at
laurel
canyon
and
roscoe
and
so
on
the
crime
forecast
is
produced
by
predpol
at
the
beginning
of
each
shift
red
boxes
spread
across
google
maps
of
the
san
fernando
valley
highlighting
by
square
foot
locations
where
predpol
concluded
property
crimes
were
likely
the
forecast
is
cutting
edge
but
it
is
used
in
the
service
of
an
old
fashioned
policing
philosophy
deterrence
between
calls
that
day
coleman
and
other
officers
were
expected
to
spend
time
and
engage
with
people
in
the
roughly
boxes
predpol
identified
around
the
foothill
division
coleman
sat
behind
the
wheel
of
his
suv
plotting
which
boxes
to
hit
the
way
someone
consulting
a
weather
map
might
weigh
whether
to
bring
an
umbrella
it
s
not
always
that
we
are
going
to
catch
someone
in
the
box
but
by
being
there
we
prevent
crime
said
capt
elaine
morales
who
oversees
the
foothill
division
foothill
is
far
from
the
glitz
of
hollywood
on
the
northern
edge
of
l
a
but
it
has
been
at
the
center
of
the
transformation
going
on
in
policing
the
division
was
one
of
the
first
in
the
nation
to
adopt
predictive
policing
five
years
ago
and
has
helped
refine
predpol
the
technology
has
spread
to
other
lapd
divisions
and
more
than
other
departments
across
the
country
making
it
the
nation
s
most
popular
predictive
policing
system
predpol
often
draws
comparisons
to
the
movie
minority
report
in
which
a
government
unit
rounds
up
future
criminals
who
have
not
yet
committed
crimes
but
one
of
the
software
s
developers
said
it
is
not
a
crystal
ball
jeff
brantingham
a
professor
at
ucla
said
crime
often
seems
random
but
it
follows
patterns
the
question
becomes
can
we
build
mathematical
structures
to
understand
these
patterns
the
answer
is
yes
absolutely
brantingham
said
the
best
way
to
capture
the
way
we
think
about
crime
patterns
is
to
think
about
earthquakes
that
s
not
just
an
analogy
brantingham
said
a
breakthrough
moment
in
predpol
s
development
came
when
one
of
his
partners
realized
an
algorithm
that
described
seismic
activity
could
be
used
to
predict
crime
just
as
earthquakes
happen
along
fault
lines
brantingham
explained
research
has
shown
crime
is
often
generated
by
structures
in
the
environment
like
a
high
school
mall
parking
lot
or
bar
additional
crimes
tend
to
follow
the
initial
event
near
in
time
and
space
like
an
aftershock
predpol
uses
years
of
crime
data
to
establish
these
patterns
and
then
the
algorithm
uses
near
real
time
crime
data
to
predict
the
next
property
crime
other
systems
use
even
more
esoteric
data
from
the
weather
to
phases
of
the
moon
to
arrive
at
their
crime
forecasts
but
does
it
work
coleman

up

s

was

circulating
that
morning
in
the
foothill
a
square
mile
area
that
has
a
population
of
more
than
it
s
easy
to
see
why
any
system
that
could
accurately
pinpoint
crime
would
be
a
major
boon
to
the
lapd
for
decades
police
departments
have
mapped
crimes
using
pushpins
on
paper
maps
and
more
recently
blotchy
hot
spot
maps
on
computers
the
maps
always
lagged
behind
crime
on
the
street
and
could
offer
only
general
areas
to
focus
patrols
coleman
a
strapping
and
gregarious
year
veteran
of
the
lapd
said
he
and
other
officers
were
initially
skeptical
that
predpol
could
anticipate
a
crime
better
than
a
seasoned
officer
and
do
it
in
a
box
the
size
of
a
city
block
but
he
quickly
became
a
believer
if
you
spend
three
hours
in
that
box
the
week
after
you
had
crimes
the
next
week
you
are
going
to

predicted

escaped
but
the

found
him
again
in

in
another
box
where
predpol
forecast
a

but
the

on
the

presents
a

but
crime
has
crept
back
up
in
the
past
couple
years
as
it
has
in
the
rest
of
los

a
study
by
brantingham
and
other
researchers
found
the
system
was
roughly
twice
as
good
at
predicting
where

will
occur

are
just
one
critique
in
an
increasingly
heated
debate
over

systems

they

predictive
policing
has
become
a
flash
point
in
the
discussion
over
race
and
policing
that
has
roiled
the
nation
in
recent
years
malinowski
and
police
officials
elsewhere
see
predpol
and
similar
systems
as
a
way
to
combat
bias
among
officers
by
using
data
to
guide
patrols
through
the
use
of
data
it
s
less
subjective
malinowski
said
it
s
objective
but
the
aclu
and
other
groups
issued
a
statement
in
august
outlining
a
variety
of
concerns
about
predictive
policing
saying
such
systems
give
a
technological
sheen
to
old
patterns
of
policing
david
robinson
a
founder
of
the
upturn
think
tank
wrote
in
a
report
that
accompanies
the
statement
that
predictive
policing
could
increase
police
presence
in
poor
and
minority
communities
by
creating
a
ratchet
effect
the
basic
problem
is
those
forecasts
are
only
as
good
as
the
data
they
are
based
on
robinson
said
people
in
heavily
policed
communities
have
a
tendency
to
get
in
trouble
these
systems
are
apt
to
continue
those
patterns
by
relying
on
that
biased
data
brantingham
said
it
is
a
valid
concern
but
predpol
uses
only
data
from
crimes
reported
to
the
police
and
that
have
been
verified
he
said
drug
arrests
and
other
offenses
that
rely
on
the
discretion
of
officers
are
not
used
because
they
are
often
more
heavily
enforced
in
poor
and
minority
communities
robinson
also
pointed
out
that
the
public
and
even
the
police
who
use
the
software
often
do
not
know
exactly
how
the
systems
are
flagging
particular
locations
or
individuals
he
said
that
makes
accountability
impossible
ferguson
the
udc
law
professor
said
predictive
policing
raises
a
host
of
fundamental
concerns
and
questions
he
questioned
how
police
will
ensure
the
accuracy
of
the
vast
reams
of
data
the
systems
rely
on
an
error
could
unfairly
cast
suspicion
on
a
location
or
individual
ferguson
also
wonders
how
predictive
systems
will
affect
officers
he
anticipates
forecasts
will
be
used
as
a
factor
in
officers
decisions
to
reach
the
reasonable
suspicion
threshold
to
stop
people
on
the
street
and
could
color
the
way
officers
approach
stops
when
you
are
told
to
be
on
the
lookout
for
a
particular
crime
in
a
particular
place
that
has
to
affect
what
you
are
going
to
do
ferguson
said
coleman

introduction
in
a
crime
analytics
bureau
a
police
officer
logs
in
to
see
what
alerts
have
been
posted
by
social
media
software
designed
to
spot
potential
threats
within
the
billions
of
daily
online
tweets
pins
likes
and
posts
on
the
street
a
police
officer
uses
his
body
worn
camera
to
scan
a
crowd
the
feed
is
sent
in
real
time
back
to
the
department
where
facial
recognition
and
movement
analysis
software
alerts
the
patrol
officer
as
to
whether
furtive
movements
or
people
on
watch
lists
have
been
identified
police
follow
up
on
these
alerts
to
identify
people
who
should
be
immediately
investigated
other
people
are
dismissed
as
not
posing
an
immediate
threat
but
are
logged
on
watch
lists
for
future
reference
no
police
department
has
all
of
this
technological
ability
today
but
some
will
one
day
soon
n
there
is
no
question
that
this
version
of
big
data
policing
is
on
the
cusp
of
wider
adoption
n
and
it
raises
key
questions
about
fundamental
issues
of
police
discretion
and
accountability
whether
the
police
identify
a
person
and
choose
to
investigate
him
for
suspected
criminal
activity
is
a
decision
largely
left
up
to
the
police
the
decisional
freedom
n
to
focus
police
attention
on
a
particular
person
or
persons
rather
than
others
what
i
ll
call
surveillance
discretion
n
is
a
widely
accepted
means
of
investigation
law
enforcement
would
be
unimaginable
without
it
this
task
of
filtering
identifying
suspects
from
the
general
population
exemplifies
traditional
police
work
police
officers
usually
generate
leads
by
focusing
their
attention
on
particular
suspects
through
observation
questioning
and
information
conveyed
by
witnesses
victims
or
other
third
parties
new
technologies
have
altered
surveillance
discretion
by
lowering
its
costs
and
increasing
the
capabilities
of
the
police
to
identify
suspicious
persons
furthermore
soon
it
will
be
feasible
and
affordable
for
the
government
to
record
store
and
analyze
nearly
everything
people
do
n
the
police
will
rely
on
alerts
generated
by
computer
programs
that
sift
through
the
massive
quantities
of
available
information
for
patterns
of
suspicious
activity
the
selection
of
investigative
targets
that
emerge
from
big
data
rather
than
from
traditional
human
investigation
represents
an
important
expansion
in
the
powers
of
the
police
that
expansion
in
turn
calls
out
for
new
tools
of
police
accountability
these
big
data
tools
produce
dramatically
different
ways
of
identifying
suspects
by
applying
computer
analytics
to
very
large
collections
of
digitized
data
n
law
enforcement
agencies
can
identify
suspicious
persons
and
activities
on
a
massive
scale
n
while
these
tools
are
useful
in
tracking
down
evidence
of
past
crimes
big
data
also
provides
the
police
with
new
capabilities
to
identify
ongoing
and
future
threats
the
department
of
homeland
security
uses
computer
analytics
to
identify
suspicious
twitter
feeds
that
include
words
such
as
bomb
or
listeria
n
police
departments
in
santa
cruz
ca
seattle
and
new
york
city
are
experimenting
with
predictive
policing
software
to
identify
geographic
places
where
crime
is
likely
to
take
place
n
one
day
the
police
nationwide
may
use
location
based
tweets
to
inform
those
same
predictions
n
the
chicago
police
department
already
uses
big
data
tools
to
identify
high
risk
persons
based
on
the
strength
of
a
person
s
social
networks
a
technique
borrowed
from
the
military
s
analysis
of
insurgent
groups
n
these
are
not
investigations
about
already
identified
suspects
or
crimes
n
but
rather
the
identification
of
potentially
suspicious
persons
places
and
events
the
exercise
of
surveillance
discretion
in
traditional
policing
attracts
little
attention
from
judges
or
legal
scholars
why
the
answer
is
likely
because
we
assume
that
the
police
should
possess
such
powers
and
even
if
theoretically
worrisome
surveillance
discretion
is
a
power
greatly
limited
in
practice
after
all
police
investigations
typically
only
focus
on
a
limited
number
of
persons
because
of
practical
limitations
imposed
by
resources
and
technology
but
those
assumptions
will
become
outdated
when
the
police
possess
the
tools
to
exercise
automated
surveillance
discretion
on
a
massive
scale
while
the
details
leaked
by
edward
snowden
about
the
mass
surveillance
programs
of
the
nsa
are
widely
known
less
familiar
are
the
growing
technological
capabilities
of
local
police
departments
yet
these
emerging
technologies
raise
important
questions
about
the
expanded
surveillance
discretion
of
the
more
than
state
and
local
police
departments
that
assume
primary
responsibility
for
law
enforcement
in
the
united
states
n
this
expansion
of
surveillance
discretion
raises
important
legal
and
policy
questions
with
regard
to
police
oversight
in
the
traditional
model
of
police
investigation
the
police
may
decide
after
some
initial
investigation
to
target
a
specific
person
or
persons
for
further
scrutiny
the
supreme
court
s
decisions
make
clear
that
the
fourth
amendment
has
little
regulatory
power
over
this
discretionary
process
n
unlike
arrests
or
wiretaps
the
decision
to
focus
police
attention
on
a
particular
person
without
more
is
unlikely
to
be
considered
a
fourth
amendment
event
thus
the
police
are
not
required
to
demonstrate
probable
cause
or
reasonable
suspicion
the
usual
standards
of
individualized
suspicion
to
decide
whether
to
conduct
surveillance
on
an
individual
n
surprisingly
there
is
little
discussion
of
these
decisions
that
the
police
make
about
individuals
before
any
search
detention
or
arrest
takes
place
n
rather
current
unresolved
issues
of
police
technology
have
focused
on
whether
a
particular
use
is
a
fourth
amendment
search
requiring
a
warrant
and
probable
cause
whether
such
constitutional
requirements
apply
to
the
collection
of
historical
cell
site
data
is
one
such
example
n
courts
around
the
country
have
disagreed
about
whether
these
situations
implicate
fourth
amendment
protections
and
it
may
take
years
for
the
united
states
supreme
court
to
resolve
these
disputes
and
while
the
enforcement
discretion
of
police
and
prosecutors
whether
to
enforce
the
law
against
a
particular
defendant
or
not
is
a
familiar
topic
in
legal
scholarship
n
surveillance
discretion
when
how
and
whether
the
police
may
target
a
person
or
persons
in
the
initial
phases
of
governmental
investigation
does
not
attract
the
same
attention
little
scholarship
has
addressed
when
and
how
people
should
be
considered
targets
for
police
surveillance
in
the
first
place
even
if
the
police
do
nothing
but
watch
closely
some
attention
has
already
been
paid
to
the
use
of
big
data
by
the
police
such
as
with
predictive
policing
software
but
it
addresses
an
important
but
familiar
line
drawing
problem
whether
decisions
made
by
software
can
help
justify
conventional
fourth
amendment
activities
like
stop
and
frisks
n
surveillance
discretion
addresses
the
power
of
the
police
at
an
earlier
stage
when
the
police
focus
on
persons
suspected
of
ongoing
or
future
criminal
activity
but
before
any
intervention
takes
place
n
this
preliminary
investigative
power
is
essential
since
police
need
to
possess
some
legal
means
to
develop
the
required
fourth
amendment
standard
of
individualized
suspicion
for
a
later
search
or
seizure
n
this
preliminary
stage
of
police
investigation
usually
receives
little
attention
because
it
is
not
typically
considered
activity
reached
by
the
fourth
amendment
at
all
n
yet
this
new
expansion
of
surveillance
discretion
by
big
data
presents
an
underappreciated
challenge
to
our
usual
thinking
about
police
regulation
n
how
the
police
will
use
big
data
tools
particularly
in
future
oriented
ways
is
as
pressing
an
issue
of
police
accountability
as
individual
officer
bias
excessive
force
and
other
pressing
issues
currently
the
topic
of
public
debate
unlike
a
police
brutality
case
captured
on
a
cellphone
video
however
expanded
police
power
by
means
of
big
data
is
difficult
for
most
of
the
public
to
see
and
understand
such
secrecy
and
opacity
calls
for
new
tools
of
accountability
ii
how
big
data
expands
surveillance
discretion
big
data
will
revolutionize
the
surveillance
discretion
of
the
police
n
by
allowing
the
identification
of
large
numbers
of
suspicious
activities
and
people
by
sifting
through
large
quantities
of
digitized
data
big
data
expands
the
surveillance
discretion
of
the
police
of
course
the
use
of
big
data
is
not
the
first
time
the
police
have
focused
on
numbers
information
or
record
keeping
accurate
documentation
of
crime
and
criminals
has
been
a
concern
that
reaches
back
to
the
nineteenth
century
and
the
invention
of
the
bertillonage
system
n
as
they
became
more
professional
and
bureaucratic
police
of
the
twentieth
century
have
sometimes
been
described
as
knowledge
workers
for
whom
information
processing
rather
than
crime
control
is
a
primary
focus
n
even
in
their
crime
control
capacities
large
urban
police
departments
in
the
s
had
already
turned
toward
data
driven
or
intelligence
based
policing
styles
of
which
the
most
famous
is
the
n
y
p
d
s
compstat
system
n
the
use
of
big
data
then
accelerates
and
magnifies
trends
that
until
now
had
been
slowly
moving
toward
a
heavier
reliance
on
information
and
computers
with
a
specific
emphasis
on
data
analytics
understanding
how
expanded
surveillance
discretion
should
be
regulated
requires
both
an
understanding
of
the
big
data
phenomenon
and
how
it
has
begun
to
influence
policing
a
what
is
big
data
the
amount
of
data
in
big
data
almost
defies
comprehension
nearly
all
of
the
world
s
stored
information
today
is
digital
n
and
we
are
surpassing
existing
mathematical
terms
to
quantify
it
n
the
types
of
information
that
are
now
digitized
include
ones
that
once
existed
in
analog
format
books
phone
call
logs
retail
purchases
as
well
as
new
kinds
of
information
made
possible
by
today
s
technologies
internet
searches
social
media
posts
data
from
the
internet
of
things
n
the
library
of
congress
which
has
archived
every
twitter
tweet
since
receives
about
half
a
billion
per
day
n
every
day
some
of
facebook
s
billion
users
upload
more
than
million
photos
to
its
website
n
and
digitization
alters
the
nature
of
the
information
itself
information
that
can
be
digitized
can
also
be
collected
searched
quantified
compared
assessed
and
endlessly
repurposed
n
most
people
know
this
is
true
from
the
automated
suggestions
they
have
encountered
on
services
like
facebook
netflix
and
amazon
n
apart
from
its
quantity
big
data
provides
a
very
different
way
of
understanding
and
probing
the
world
of
information
n
consider
how
big
data
has
altered
conventional
research
if
traditional
scientific
research
begins
with
a
question
and
then
uses
that
hypothesis
to
identify
and
collect
the
appropriate
data
big
data
upends
that
practice
n
because
data
is
being
generated
all
of
the
time
researchers
working
with
big
data
do
not
have
to
shape
or
limit
their
data
collection
nor
do
they
need
to
begin
with
a
question
indeed
the
question
can
arise
from
the
data
itself
this
is
why
for
example
the
constant
stream
of
posted
tweets
on
twitter
can
generate
data
and
insights
for
meteorologists
advertisers
and
epidemiologists
n
that
insight
has
implications
for
the
surveillance
discretion
of
the
police
as
well
just
as
questions
may
emerge
from
the
data
for
the
purposes
of
research
suspects
can
emerge
from
the
data
for
purposes
of
investigation
these
suspicious
persons
and
activities
can
appear
even
if
police
do
not
seek
a
particular
person
for
a
particular
crime
nor
do
they
need
to
begin
the
collection
of
data
if
data
is
already
being
collected
all
of
the
time
moreover
the
search
for
causality
a
primary
objective
in
scientific
research
is
rendered
unnecessary
by
big
data
since
correlations
found
on
a
mass
scale
can
be
just
as
if
not
more
useful
than
attempts
to
find
causes
n
that
is
why
for
example
google
s
identification
of
the
forty
five
search
terms
most
strongly
correlated
with
historical
flu
data
held
the
promise
of
predicting
future
outbreaks
even
if
they
provided
correlations
rather
than
causes
n
in
the
big
data
world
knowing
what
is
often
good
enough
rather
than
why
n
in
criminal
investigations
it
may
not
be
necessary
to
know
why
certain
patterns
of
driving
purchasing
or
movement
are
associated
with
crime
if
the
police
can
claim
a
high
correlation
between
the
two
a
high
degree
of
correlation
itself
might
provide
justification
for
heightened
police
attention
b
how
big
data
expands
surveillance
discretion
like
marketers
health
care
professionals
and
traffic
controllers
police
departments
have
begun
to
test
and
adopt
the
tools
of
big
data
these
approaches
hold
the
potential
to
change
many
aspects
of
traditional
policing
including
surveillance
discretion
three
examples
illustrate
the
range
of
big
data
tools
already
in
preliminary
use
or
under
consideration
by
police
departments
the
first
is
the
use
of
automatic
license
plate
readers
sometimes
also
referred
to
as
alpr
or
anpr
by
the
police
while
the
police
have
used
cameras
to
take
pictures
of
car
license
plates
since
the
s
n
alpr
technology
is
especially
notable
today
because
it
has
become
inexpensive
sophisticated
and
increasingly
pervasive
n
alpr
systems
use
cameras
mounted
on
patrol
cars
or
at
fixed
locations

in

taken
directly
by

operated
by

private

these

can
function
as
time
machines
to
investigate
already
completed
crimes
for
instance
vigilant
solutions
demonstrates
in
a
youtube
video
how
the
police
in
a
hypothetical
homicide
investigation
can
identify
alpr
scans
with
a
specified
set
of
spatial
and
temporal
parameters
to
see
which
cars
and
registered

have
passed

similarly
alpr
data
can
be
used
to
track
an
individual
person
through
time
and
space
to
determine
his
whereabouts
to
check
an
alibi

alpr
data
can
expand
surveillance
discretion
further
to
identify
as
yet
unknown
patterns
of
suspicious
activity
geo
fencing

specific
geographical
area

can
be
circumscribed

an
alpr
virtual
fence
that
identifies
every

consider
for
example
a
program
that
would
identify
suspicious
patterns
of
activity
such
as
repeated
visits
by
individual
drivers
to
a
location
associated
with
drug
trafficking
a
second
use
of
big
data
is
the
collection
and
analysis
of
social
media
data
while
many
police
departments
polled
state
they
monitor
social
media
these
uses
usually
take
the
form
of
individual
officers
personally
searching
or
using
social
media
sites
n
the
los
angeles
police
department
for
instance
reportedly
directs
forty
officers
for
this
purpose
n
human
monitoring
of
social
media
can
include
discrete
searches
for
threatening
words
suspects
and
gangs
in
other
cases
the
police
might
find
information
through
social
media
by
friending
suspected
criminals
and
learning
information
through
online
posts
n
but
such
uses
of
social
media
are
limited
individual
officers
cannot
search
for
every
conceivable
variation
of
suspicious
language
and
social
connections
with
suspects
online
require
identifying
them
in
the
first
place
instead
of
relying
on
human
beings
a
big
data
approach
looks
through
all
or
nearly
all
of
the
available
data
and
uses
computer
algorithms
to
identify
suspicious
patterns
of
activity
or
to
reveal
previously
unknown
links
among
criminal
suspects
that
is
the
premise
of
a
number
of
commercial
software
products
now
marketed
to
police
departments
n
social
media
monitor
is
a
cloud
based
service
that
will
watch

for
suspicious
activities

another
software

itself
as
a
tool
to
help
first
responders
understand
the
nature
of
the
environment
they
may
encounter
during
the
window
of
a
event
n
beware
does
so
by
assigning
a
threat
rating
to
a
person
based
on
an
analysis
of
billions
of
commercial
and
public
records
n
the
beware
algorithm
sorts
through
both
information
already
familiar
to
the
police
like
registered
cars
and
rap
sheets
and
novel
like
residents
online
comments
social
media
and
recent
purchases
for
warning
signs
n
a
third
example
of
expanded
surveillance
discretion
is
the
use
of
social
network
analysis
by
police
to
identify
suspicious
or
vulnerable
individuals
n
social
networks
refer
to
a
set
of
personal
connections
among
a
group
of
people
the
basic
unit
of
analysis
in
social
network
analysis
consists
of
the
link
between
two
people
n
the
ties

between
nodes

take
many
forms

calls
or
physical
contacts
between

and
offenders
based
on
mathematical
modeling

importantly
the
approach
identifies
the
relative
importance
or
centrality
of
nodes

importance
to
the
criminal
system

of
activity
control
over
the
flow
of
information
and
relationships

social
network
algorithms
developed
for
law
enforcement
purposes
by
private
companies
promise
to
identify
non
obvious
relationships
in
known
criminal
associations
while
the
police
might
know
the
leadership
of
a
criminal
gang
they
may
not
know
others
who
ha
ve
the
most
influence
in
a
gang
or
who
transmit
the
most
information
in
the
fastest
amount
of
time
n
this
information
can
then
be
used
by
the
police
to
focus
their
attentions
on
particular
individuals
that
may
have
escaped
police
attention
through
conventional
surveillance
the
aggressive
use
of
social
network
analysis
by
the
chicago
police
department
is
illustrative
n
beginning
in
the
chicago
police
have
relied
upon
the
use
of
network
analysis
to
direct
preventive
policing
measures
n
beginning
with
the
identification
of
the
sixty
known
gangs
and
factions
within
the
city
the
chicago
police
then
map
out
these
relationships
to
identify
both
positive
and
negative
connections
among
groups
and
individual
members
n
the
name
of
a
shooting
victim
for
instance
might
trigger
a
computer
warning
to
the
police
that
four
individuals
should
be
treated
with
suspicion
not
because
of
anything
they
did
but
because
they
are
known
gang
members
feuding
with
the
victim
s
gang
n
in
addition
another
notification
might
alert
the
police
of
eight
potential
members
of
the
victim
s
own
gang
who
might
be
at
risk
of
turning
to
violence
in
retaliation
n
no
traditional
physical
evidence
links
these
persons
to
the
actual
shooting
but
social
network
analysis
predicts
future
violence
associated
with
them
and
thus
directs
police
resources
and
attention
the
chicago
police
department
uses
a
heat
list
to
focus
its
preventive
policing
efforts
this
heat
list
is
based
upon
research
that
found
that
those
with
close
social
ties
to
a
homicide
victim
were
times
more
likely
to
be
involved
as
a
future
victim
or
perpetrator
of
violence
in
response
the
chicago
police
piloted
a
program
in
to
identify
these
persons
at
high
risk
for
future
violence
n
a
computer
analysis
weighs
risk
factors
some
that
are
not
especially
surprising
such
as
a
person
s
rap
sheet
his
warrant
or
parole
status
weapons
or
drug
arrests
but
also
some
that
are
including
a
person
s
acquaintances
and
the
arrest
records
and
possible
violent
victimization
of
those
socially
connected
to
the
person

the
approximately
people
who
emerge
from
the
analysis
with
the
highest
scores
constitute
the
heat
list
a
group
targeted
for
the
chicago
police
department
s
custom
notifications
program
n
being
on
the
heat
list
results
in
a
personal
home
visit
from
a
chicago
police
officer
who
warns
the
person
of
the
legal
consequences
that
will
result
if
he
engages
in
criminal
activity
n
those
on
the
list
are
also
told
that
they
are
also
at
a
high
risk
for
becoming
victims
not
just
perpetrators
of
future
violence
n
those
who
receive
these
custom
notifications
are
not
always
obvious
perpetrators
of
violence
they
might
be
people
who
have
otherwise
escaped
police
notice
because
of
an
absence
of
serious
convictions
or
a
long
rap
sheet
n
moreover
it
may
be
a
social
connection
with
a
homicide
victim
that
increases
their
risk
rating
n
license

network
software
and
social

are
not
the
only
way
the
police

data
in

to
predict
suspicious
activity

to
focus

attention

some
of
these

is
different

isn

new

with
big

the
police
have
greatly
expanded
powers
this

what
is

about
the

as
well
as
its
potential
benefits
and
concerns

big

to
sift
through
vast
amounts
of
data
that
have
no
obvious
connections
to
crime
but
through
computer
assisted
analysis
may
suggest
criminally
suspicious
activity
this
is
similar
to
traditional
surveillance
discretion
courts
have
permitted
police
to
conduct
stops
based
on
facts
that
would
not
seem
suspicious
to
us
at
all

it
is
different
vastly

mining
social

whether
social
connections
can
be
plotted
on
a
map
through
online

or
through
social
network
analysis
big
data
tools
allow
law
enforcement
agencies
to
collect
aggregate
and
analyze
social
connections
using
tailored
algorithms
rather
than
a
specialized
human
skill
n
mining
social
connections
might
one
day
be
an
ordinary
aspect
of
local
police
departments
from
active
investigations
to
passive
alerts
the
traditional
methods
the
police
use
to
identify
or
predict
ongoing
or
future
crimes
require
time
and
effort
the
process
is
by
necessity
inefficient
by
deciding
to
focus
on
some
individuals
the
police
miss
other
opportunities
more
generally
decisions
to
focus
human
resources
on
some
kinds
of
suspicious
activity
rather
than
others
reflect
enforcement
priority
decisions
that
all
law
enforcement
agencies
must
make
automating
the
suspicion
analysis
in
whole
or
in
part
could
dramatically
change
policing
some
information
that
previously
would
not
have
been
known
to
individual
officers
either
because
it
was
unknown
or
because
it
would
have
been
too
cumbersome
to
retrieve
quickly
becomes
part
of
the
investigations
process
big
data
might
also
bring
new
and
unexpected
insights
about
criminal
behavior
n
the
scale
of
automation
also
widens
the
scope
of
surveillance
over
many
more
potentially
suspicious
persons
potential
benefits
diminishing
troubling
uses
of
discretion
big
data
tools
at
least
in
theory
promise
to
introduce
more
fairness
into
surveillance
discretion
traditional
policing
relies
upon
an
officer
s
ability
to
identify
suspicious
behavior
but
because
nothing
is
inherently
suspicious
n
conventional
police
decisions
are
normative
judgments
that
are
highly
dependent
on
subjective
considerations
and
sometimes
improper
ones
n
how
police
identify
suspicious
people
thus
sometimes
reflects
stereotypes
about
race
and
class
particularly
about
young
african
american
men
in
economically
depressed
neighborhoods
after
all
the
police
like
the
rest
of
us
are
cognitive
misers
who
rely
upon
shortcuts
to
process
the
world
around
most
efficiently
n
discretion
also
plays
a
role
in
departmental
as
well
as
individual
decisions
departments
set
priorities
on
whether
to
focus
on
prostitution
and
drugs
sales
on
the
streets
for
instance
rather
than
within
private
spaces
n
big
data
tools
could
curb
police
discretion
in
two
ways
first
algorithms
that
search
for
suspicious
activity
could
greatly
reduce
or
eliminate
race
or
class
based
biases
for
which
the
police
are
often
criticized
although
this
too
may
hide
hidden
problems
n
second
certain
crimes
that
may
be
especially
amenable
to
big
data
policing
particularly
white
collar
financial
fraud
may
lead
to
more
equitable
distribution
of
law
enforcement
resources
n
alternatives
to
flawed
investigative
tools
increasing
reliance
on
big
data
tools
might
one
day
eclipse
the
use
of
traditional
surveillance
and
investigation
methods
that
have
received
significant
criticism
consider
police
reliance
on
informants
n
when
police
rely
on
one
or
a
few
people
to
identify
suspects
the
results
are
necessarily
skewed
informants
only
identify
people
they
know
from
the
neighborhoods
they
know
informant
culture
then
plays
a
key
role
in
reproducing
racial
disparities
within
the
criminal
justice
system
n
rather
than
rely
on
the
usual
suspects
or
the
usual
neighborhoods
big
data
programs
search
through
all
available
information
for
future
or
ongoing
crimes
n
big
data
tools
might
also
supplant
some
needs
for
covert
policing
in
the
physical
world
undercover
operations
are
justified
as
a
dirty
but
necessary
business
because
without
them
many
types
of
crimes
could
not
otherwise
be
investigated
n
big
data
tools
may
provide
an
alternative
white
collar
crime
for
instance
is
now
difficult
to
identify
without
undercover
investigations
and
informants
however
with
a
computer
program
that
can
scan
the
enormous
quantities
of
securities
trading
data
for
patterns
of
potential
insider
trading
n
law
enforcement
officials
may
be
able
to
rely
less
on
covert
operations
often
criticized
for
their
secrecy
and
implementation
alternatively
though
the
police
may
simply
use
big
data
tools
in
addition
to
covert
tactics
they
adopt
online
n
production
of
data
big
data
policing
will
produce
information
capable
of
audits
and
third
party
examination
a
stark
contrast
from
conventional
surveillance
fourth
amendment
law
requires
police
to
provide
specific
articulable
facts
to
justify
stops
and
arrests
n
these
reasons
are
usually
a
mix
of
experience
and
observation
to
make
matters
more
difficult
the
police
feel
pressure
to
conform
their
justifications
to
requirements
about
legally
sufficient
reasons
that
will
hold
up
in
court
if
challenged
yet
the
complete
explanation
for
what
motivates
a
stop
is
likely
unknowable
even
to
the
officer
himself
what
stands
out
in
an
officer
s
mind
as
suspicious
is
the
product
of
an
idiosyncratic
unaccountable
unknowable
personal
algorithm
n
moreover
in
its
fourth
amendment
decisions
the
supreme
court
has
shown
little
interest
in
subjecting
the
internal
decision
making
processes
of
police
officers
to
any
real
scrutiny
n
potential
concerns
old
problems
in
new
packages
how
whether
and
when
the
police
use
their
legal
authority
to
make
choices
poses
a
basic
challenge
for
democratic
policing
law
enforcement
is
impossible
without
giving
the
police
choices
yet
delegating
the
police
discretion
raises
questions
about
fair
minded
law
enforcement
in
a
democratic
society
n
compounding
our
discomfort
with
police
discretion
is
the
fact
that
police
are
notoriously
secretive
not
just
about
their
discretion
but
about
nearly
everything
n
in
theory
the
increasing
use
of
computers
and
numbers
might
force
policing
practices
to
be
more
transparent
and
accountable
yet
powerful

operate
secretly
and
without
public
awareness

applying
data
analytics
to
digitized
information
big
data
tools
appear
to
provide
an
objective
analysis
of
information
but
discretionary
human
decisions
can
play
an
important
role
in
big
data
in
ways
that
may
not
be
obvious
first
very
basic
decisions
about
big

tools
involve
discretion
which
mathematical
model
to
adopt
what
data
to
use
and
how
to
display
that
data
among
other
considerations
n
second
police
departments
will
make
choices
about
how
and
where
to
apply
big
data
tools
these
are
discretionary
decisions
similar
to
how
departments
deploy
human
resources
predictive
policing
software
already
in
use
by
some
police
departments
focuses
heavily
on
property
crimes
because
its
predictions
about
other
crimes
are
not
as
accurate
n
the
information
used
by
big
data
tools
may
also
be
products
of
hidden
police
discretion
n
arrest
information
at
least
for
minor
offenses
reflects
highly
discretionary

today
the
sheer
amount
of
information
that
the

must
confront

assess
is
overwhelming
n
errors

are
inevitable
the
consequences
of

errors
and
distortions
in

can
be
severe
when
marketers
make

based
on

faulty
algorithm
the
results
may
be
embarrassing
or
annoying
but
the
stakes
are
comparatively
low
n
the

cannot
be
said
of
policing
the
wrong
person
may
be
eventually
detained
perhaps
at

or
she
may
face
unwarranted
humiliation
because
of
police
attention

be
noticed
by

for
instance
algorithms
can
rely
upon
data
that
is
itself
incomplete
or
erroneous
for
example
on
the
evening
of
march
san
francisco
police
officers
conducted
a
high
risk
traffic
stop
of
denise
greene
a
forty
seven

old
african
american
woman
with
no

the
result
however
was
a
false
hit
the
camera
misidentified
greene
s
car
because
the
scan
was
blurry
n
the
police
discovered
their
mistake
but
not
until
after
greene
was
forced
to
kneel
outside
of
her
car
at
gunpoint
and
to
undergo
a
physical
pat
down
and
a
search
of
her
car
n
the
surveillance
tax
even
short
of
an
investigative
detention
or

surveillance
can
be
intrusive
knowledge
of
surveillance
alone
can
inhibit
our
ability
to
engage
in
free
expression
movement
and
unconventional
behavior
judges
and
lawmakers
have
also
occasionally
acknowledged
the
stigmatizing
effect
of
investigation
itself
even
if
the
police
take
no
physically
intrusive
actions
as
a
congressional
report
noted
in
t
he
stigma
which
results
from
involvement
in
any
investigation
is
substantial
n
in
neighborhoods
with
a
fraught
relationship
between
the
community
and
the
police
a
preventive
visit
may
be
misinterpreted
as
the
targeted
person
s
conversion
to
an
informant
a
misinterpretation
with
potentially
fatal
consequences
n
even
in
small
doses
expansive
uses
of
surveillance
discretion
can
be
worrisome
expanded
considerably
it
is
even
more
troubling
especially
as
big
data
tools
have
eroded
the
natural
limits
placed
on
surveillance
discretion
increased
use
of
tools
with
a
wider
surveillance
scope
further
increases
the
costs
of
hassle
increased
police
attention
or
intervention
that
later
turns
out
to
be
unwarranted
n
these
burdens
of
time
humiliation
and
insecurity
in
law
enforcement
are
inevitable
n
but
increasing
these
surveillance
burdens
requires
accountability
tools
to
accompany
them
eliminating
good
discretion
if
technology
could
eliminate
some
bad
uses
of
police
discretion
such
as
racial
bias
it
has
the
potential
to
dampen
the
power
of
good
police
discretion
as
well
good
discretion
means
many
things
including
giving
an
otherwise
technically
eligible
person
a
break
on
behavior
which
would
otherwise
warrant
a
summons
a
citation
or
an
arrest
good
discretion
also
includes
what
police
might
know
about
a
neighborhood
and
its
community
local
knowledge
that
might
not
be
amenable
to
data
capture
personal
relationships
and
neighborhood
knowledge
can
help
police
distinguish
real
dangers
from
false
ones
an
initial
determination
about
suspicion
once
perceived
in
context
may
lead
to
a
conclusion
that
nothing
is
amiss
at
all
in
other
words
traditional
surveillance
discretion
is
an
aspect
of
local
contextualized
police
knowledge
iii
accountability
for
expanded
surveillance
discretion
when
the
police
can
watch
many
more
people
and
activities
with
increasing
sophistication
and
at
lower
cost
we
need
new
transparency
and
accountability
mechanisms
this
section
considers
what
issues
will
be
raised
by
the
development
of
new
accountability
mechanisms
as
well
as
some
suggestions
for
what
form
those
mechanisms
might
take
a
why
the
fourth
amendment
does
not
apply
traditionally
surveillance
discretion
is
a
power
enjoyed
by
the
police
with
few
legal
constraints
when
the
police
investigate
a
crime
they
might
decide
to
focus
their
attention
on
one
particular
person
or
group
of
people
to
confirm
or
dispel
suspicions
that
arise
after
their
preliminary
investigation
the
police
may
watch
or
follow
the
suspect
on
the
street
talk
to
his
associates
or
comb
through
publicly
available
information
n
so
long
as
the
police
confine
the
targets
of
their
investigation
to
areas
that
are
not
private
even
if
their
methods
are
secretive
or
covert
the
police
are
not
required
to
have
any
particular
individualized
suspicion
about
the
suspect
to
focus
their
attention
on
him
n
how
long
the
police
watch
a
person
why
the
police
decide
to
investigate
one
person
rather
than
another
and
why
they
decide
to
investigate
a
crime
at
all
are
matters
for
police
discretion
largely
because
the
fourth
amendment
does
not
usually
apply
to
these
activities
n
that
the
fourth
amendment
does
not
regulate
these
early
stages
of
investigation
draws
on
well
established
supreme
court
case
law
ever
since
the
supreme
court
formulated
the
reasonable
expectation
of
privacy
test
nearly
fifty
years
ago
in
katz
v
united
states
n
it
is
generally
understood
that
the
police
are
free
to
investigate
public
places
speak
with
people
consensually
n
and
access
information
that
has
already
been
given
to
third
parties
n
none
of
these
areas
are
searches
for
fourth
amendment
purposes
all
of
these
areas
are
those
in
which
people
knowingly
expose
information
to
the
public
and
thus
also
to
the
police
n
fourth
amendment
requirements
apply
then
after
the
police
have
decided
to
use
any
information
they
have
collected
as
a
basis
to
interfere
with
a
person
s
legally
recognized
interests
if
the
police
subject
a
person
to
a
temporary
investigative
detention
they
are
required
to
have
reasonable
suspicion
before
doing
so
n
an
arrest
or
full
search
requires
probable
cause
and
in
some
cases
prior
judicial
approval
in
the
form
of
a
warrant
n
before
that
point
of
intervention
however
the
police
can
select
a
person
or
group
of
persons
for
particular
attention
without
having
to
provide
a
justification
for
doing
so
the
police
are
not
restricted
by
being
required
to
have
a
reasonable
suspicion
to
observe
or
investigate
persons
in
public
and
public
data
to
detect
those
persons
who
commit
crime
n
in
other
words
surveillance
that
does
not
intrude
upon
recognized
fourth
amendment
interests
requires
no
prior
justification
by
the
police
n
the
who
how
and
why
of
police
decisions
to
single
out
persons
for
attention
is
a
matter
of
police
discretion
and
because
the
fourth
amendment
does
not
regulate
surveillance
discretion
courts
have
had
little
to
say
about
it
in
response
to
claims
that
police
surveillance
is
overly
intrusive
or
controlling
courts
have
been
generally
unsympathetic
lawful
surveillance
in
the
form
of
officers
walking
their
beat
or
riding
in
prowl
cars
has
been
described
as
proper
police
function
even
if
the
surveillance
might
influence
the
targeted
person
s
actions
in
public
n
as
the
eighth
circuit
observed
in
one
case
judicial
review
of
investigative
decisions
like
oversight
of
prosecutions
tends
to
chill
law
enforcement
by
subjecting
the
investigator
s
motives
and
decisionmaking
to
outside
inquiry
n
in
rejecting
claims
regarding
surveillance
discretion
some
courts
have
simply
stated
that
there
is
no
constitutional
right
to
be
free
of
investigation
n
the
only
caveat
that
courts
raise
is
that
surveillance
discretion
cannot
be
exercised
in
a
discriminatory
fashion
n
the
view
that
no
individual
has
a
right
to
be
free
of
investigation
has
also
been
the
premise
of
a
related
legal
question
whether
the
police
must
have
at
least
reasonable
suspicion
before
beginning
an
undercover
operation
targeting
a
particular
person
the
answer
from
courts
has
been
a
resounding
no
n
consider
the
abscam
scandal
of
the
s
which
began
with
an
fbi
undercover
operation
that
focused
first
on
the
trafficking
of
stolen
property
but
eventually
turned
to
political
corruption
evidence
from
abscam
eventually
led
to
the
convictions
of
several
government
officials
including
a
u
s
senator
and
six
members
of
the
house
of
representatives
once
abscam
was
brought
to
public
attention
n
members
of
congress
considered
whether
individualized
suspicion
requirements
should
apply
at
this
earlier
investigative
stage
but
proposed
legislation
imposing
a
warrant
requirement
for
undercover
investigations
never
came
to
pass
n
in
some
rare
instances
police
surveillance
by
itself
can
give
rise
to
constitutional
claims
otherwise
lawful
surveillance
by
the
police
can
be
the
basis
of
a
civil
rights
claim
if
the
surveillance
interferes
with
other
constitutional
rights
n
for
example
in
october
the
third
circuit
reinstated
a
federal
civil
rights
lawsuit
alleging
that
the
nypd
violated
first
amendment
and
equal
protection
rights
by
engaging
in
a
surveillance
program
of
newark
s
muslim
community
n
the
supreme
court
s
decision
in
laird
v
tatum
n
however
makes
it
difficult
for
plaintiffs
to
win
cases
simply
because
they
are
concerned
about
the
effects
of
lawfully
collected
surveillance
in
laird
the
plaintiffs
claimed
that
army
surveillance
of
civilian
political
activity
infringed
upon
their
first
amendment
rights
n
the
supreme
court
held
however
that
the
laird
plaintiffs
lacked
standing
to
bring
their
claims
because
they
lacked
any
justiciable
injury
absent
a
specific
present
objective
harm
due
to
the
surveillance
or
threat
of
a
specific
future
harm
the
mere
existence
without
more
of
a
governmental
investigative
and
data
gathering
activity
could
not
form
the
basis
of
a
federal
lawsuit
n
as
a
result
of
this
standard
lawsuits
complaining
only
about
intrusive
but
otherwise
lawful
surveillance
often
fail
n
because
so
few
cases
state
much
about
surveillance
discretion
other
than
to
acknowledge
the
wide
latitude
given
to
police
to
exercise
their
powers
we
might
look
to
other
analogous
areas
of
the
law
where
courts
have
considered
challenges
to
the
preliminary
exercises
of
governmental
power
for
instance
many
defendants
have
challenged
the
discretion
of
police
and
prosecutors
for
singling
them
out
for
arrest
or
prosecution
many
cases
have
considered
defendants
claims
that
the
police
or
prosecutors
have
unfairly
or
arbitrarily
focused
on
them
but
here
too
courts
have
yielded
considerable
discretion
to
law
enforcement
officials
in
deciding
how
whether
and
when
to
exercise
their
powers
n
claims
of
discriminatory
enforcement
in
violation
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
are
available
in
theory
but
in
practice
most
fail
because
of
the
difficulty
of
proving
the
necessary
elements
n
moreover
the
supreme
court
s
decisions
in
whren
v
united
states
n
and
atwater
v
city
of
lago
vista
n
foreclose
the
ability
of
defendants
to
complain
of
arbitrary
or
pretextual
enforcement
in
fourth
amendment
claims
n
what
serves
as
a
check
on
traditional
surveillance
discretion
of
the
police
then
if
not
fourth
amendment
law
the
answer
lies
in
practical
rather
than
legal
restraints
first
surveillance
has
been
naturally
limited
by
the
expense
and
limits
of
available
technology
while
the
police
have
adopted
many
new
technological
advances
over
time
in
the
first
years
of
policing
local
police
departments
were
simply
not
capable
of
constant
and
pervasive
surveillance
employing
armies
of
officers
to
watch
any
particular
person
or
persons
all
of
the
time
is
impracticable
for
ordinary
police
departments
n
and
the
use
of
high
tech
surveillance
methods
until
recently
has
been
limited
what
means
existed
have
been
prohibitively
expensive
for
most
local
police
departments
thus
as
a
practical
matter
investigative
agencies
will
rarely
expend
their
limited
manpower
and
resources
on
a
mere
whim
n
second
the
mere
visibility
of
most
traditional
police
practices
provides
a
check
on
police
behavior
because
an
objecting
public
can
monitor
and
sometimes
call
for
change
n
most
routine
street
policing
is
visible
indeed
as
recent
national
attention
to
several
cases
of
people
who
have
died
in
encounters
with
the
police
has
shown
bystander
videos
have
led
to
protests
and
calls
for
action
with
regard
to
excessive
force
n
thus
the
fourth
amendment
is
unlikely
to
be
a
useful
choice
to
curb
surveillance
discretion
to
be
sure
judges
and
law
professors
have
raised
concerns
that
the
supreme
court
s
fourth
amendment
cases
decided
in
the
s
give
insufficient
protections
to
those
whose
movements
and
actions
in
public
have
been
monitored
by
the
police
particularly
since
that
information
in
the
aggregate
can
provide
highly
revealing
information
about
one
s
religious
beliefs
health
conditions
political
affiliations
and
vices
n
thus
some
have
argued
that
police
collection
of
large
amounts
of
a
person
s
public
data
should
constitute
a
fourth
amendment
search
even
if
the
collection
of
each
data
point
in
isolation
would
not
likely
be
considered
a
search
this
mosaic
theory
of
the
fourth
amendment
may
be
helpful
to
defendants
when
the
police
single
them
out
for
particularized
data
collection
n
as
to
whether
big
data
analysis
might
provide
a
basis
for
individualized
suspicion
some
commentators
have
already
raised
doubts
as
to
whether
the
fourth
amendment
alone
should
regulate
these
determinations
n
but
the
fourth
amendment
s
focus
on
individualized
suspicion
and
its
conceptualization
of
rights
that
better
describe
a
physical
rather
than
a
digital
world
is
likely
a
poor
fit
for
expanded
surveillance
discretion
certainly
those
at
the
receiving
end
of
the
increased
scrutiny
made
possible
by
big
data
may
complain
that
the
police
have
insufficient
justification
yet
when
the
police
are
sifting
through
the
data
of
hundreds
thousands
or
millions
of
people
at
the
same
time
we
cannot
expect
the
police
to
provide
individualized
suspicion
before
looking
at
a
lone
online
post
if
big
data
is
changing
the
structure
of
police
discretion
then
commensurate
tools
of
accountability
should
focus
on
reining
in
these
practices
as
a
whole
because
all
big
data
tools
pose
similar
concerns
accountability
measures
should
focus
on
policy
outcomes
rather
than
technology
specific
measures
n
b
the
secrecy
problem
secrecy
often
accompanies
the
new
surveillance
discretion
some
of
this
secrecy
can
be
attributed
to
the
private
companies
providing
the
police
with
the
software
or
data
they
use
moreover
the
police
themselves
tend
to
be
secretive
and
insular
in
ways
that
inhibit
external
oversight
for
these
reasons
we
often
know
little
about
the
adoption
or
development
of
surveillance
discretion
first
big
data
tools
are
often
private
market
products
police
departments
are
just
another
group
of
customers
in
a
number
of
recent
instances
private
companies
providing
surveillance
technology
have
required
agreements
from
police
departments
that
prevent
disclosure
of
information
about
the
technology
itself
for
example
civil
liberties
organizations
and
journalists
have
discovered
the
police
use
of
cell
site
simulators
a
surveillance
technology
that
tricks
nearby
cell
phones
into
providing
data
by
behaving
as
a
fake
mobile
cell
tower
n
detailed
information
about
the
use
of
these
devices
sometimes
referred
to
as
stingrays
or
imsi
catchers
is
difficult
to
find
however
because
the
dominant
manufacturer
of
these
devices
the
harris
corporation
has
required
participating
law
enforcement
agencies
to
sign
nondisclosure
agreements
n
nondisclosure
agreements
bar
police
departments
adopting
the
technology
from
disclosing
any
information
n
relating
to
the
surveillance
equipment
to
any
third
parties
private
and
public
n
some
prosecutors
have
even
chosen
to
withdraw
evidence
in
cases
rather
than
be
forced
to
disclose
details
about
any
possible
use
of
this
cellphone
surveillance
technology
n
after
several
investigative
reports
on
stingray
use
the
department
of
justice
announced
in
september
new
rules
that
would
apply
to
the
use
of
cellphone
surveillance
technology
by
the
department
of
justice
including
a
warrant
requirement
n
similarly
vigilant
one
of
the
country
s
largest
alpr
companies
includes
in
its
terms
and
conditions
a
requirement
of
its
licensees
i
e
police
departments
that
they
agree
not
to
voluntarily
provide
any
information
including
interviews
related

n
little
prevents
other

from
imposing

even
without

nondisclosure
agreements
big
data
tools
can
remain
secret
because
they
contain
proprietary
information
that
companies
may
be
unwilling
to
release
nor
are
private
companies
producing
these
tools
subject
to
public
records
laws
that
would
require
them
to
divulge
relevant
and
useful
information
second
police
departments
have
varied
widely
in
their
willingness
to
provide
public
access
to
their
big
data
tools
the
variation
in
alpr
policies
is
illustrative
as
we
saw
with
the
police
department
of
oakland
california
the
police
agreed
to
provide
journalists
with
their
alpr
data
other
police
departments
however
have
resisted
public
records
requests
for
alpr
data
on
the
ground
that
all
collected
scans
may
be
useful
for
investigations
n
c
big

accountability
transparency
and
accountability
measures
should
be
a
first
step
to
address
some
of
the
concerns
raised
by
expanded
surveillance
discretion
this
includes
not
only
independent
oversight
measures
familiar
in
traditional
policing
but
also
forms
of
algorithmic
accountability
n
what
should
such
accountability
measures
address
does
it
exist
sometimes
the
most
important
question
is
whether
the
police
have
adopted
a
new
surveillance
technology
at
all
local
governments
could
require
police
departments
to
seek
approval
before
the
purchase
of
new
technologies
that
expand
surveillance
capabilities
for
instance
a
surveillance
notification
ordinance
passed
in
seattle
washington
n
requires
city
council
approval
before
any
city
department
acquires
surveillance
equipment
n
the
ordinance
requires
not
only
notification
about
a
planned
purchase
of
any
surveillance
equipment
but
also
a
mitigation
plan
describing
how
the
department
s
use
of
the
equipment
will
be
regulated
to
protect
privacy
anonymity
and
limit
the
risk
of
potential
abuse
n
public
approval
for
new
surveillance
technology
purchases
could
also
include
approval
for
third
parties
with
whom
police
departments
might
contract
for
such
services
n
without
such
required
disclosures
local
governmental
bodies
may
find
out
about
technologies
that
significantly
expand
surveillance
discretion
only
by
accident
or
happenstance
in
the
city
council
of
bellingham
washington
held
a
formal
public
hearing
expressing
alarm
after
news
that
its
police
department
planned
to
purchase
intrado
s
beware
social
media
analysis
software
with
a
federal
grant
n
the
council
urged
its
police
department
not
to
purchase
beware
n
the
police
department
withdrew
its
grant
request
after
the
city
council
voted
to
ask
the
department
to
do
so
n
how
is
it
being
used
securing
public
approval
is
only
a
first
step
local
governments
can
take
additional
measures
to
ensure
continuing
public
oversight
of
big
data
technologies
that
expand
surveillance
discretion
for
example
local
governments
can
require
police
departments
to
adopt
surveillance
use
policies
that
specify
how
and
when
surveillance
technologies
might
be
used
n
logging
requirements
can
enable
accountability
by
ensuring
third
parties
can
access
and
review
how
big
data
policing
tools
work
local
governments
can
provide
independent
third
parties
with
responsibilities
and
powers
to
review
how
such
programs
work
n
auditors
should
be
given
access
to
both
the
technology
and
the
data
produced
by
it
e
g
access
controls
and
audit
logs
n
how
accurate
is
it
with
that
knowledge
we
can
assess
the
nature
of
the
raw
information
used
by
these
computer
algorithms
as
we
have
seen
some
kinds
of
information
reflect
highly
discretionary
decisions
arrests
are
often
the
outcome
of
decision
making
about
enforcement
priorities
law
enforcement
resources
and
other
contingencies
that
a
person
is
a
known
gang
member
is
a
contestable
designation
yet
these
factors
may
be
used
to
justify
further
law
enforcement
attention
if
not
eventual
detention
or
arrest
how
effective
is
it
when
we
know
whether
and
how
the
police
have
adopted
a
big
data
tool
to
expand
their
surveillance
discretion
we
can
assess
whether
such
technologies
are
worth
their
financial
institutional
and
social
costs
for
example
alpr
surveillance
is
touted
as
a
quick
efficient
and
cost
effective
policing
technology
but
we
often
know
little
about
how
well
the
technology
reduces
crime
the
available
evidence
suggests
that
comparatively
few
crimes
are
identified
through
mass
plate
collection
in
oakland
california
journalists
reported
that
the
hit
rate
of
its
alpr
use
when
compared
to
the
number
of
license
plate
scans
captured
was
a
mere
n
iv
conclusion
the
police
have
always
possessed
surveillance
discretion
big
data
promises
to
expand
and
accelerate
their
ability
to
discover
crime
and
identify
suspects
one
day
the
ability
to
sort
score
and
predict
social
activity
will
be
an
ordinary
aspect
of
policing
in
the
same
way
we
now
experience
entertainment
dating
and
shopping
yet
the
use
of
big
data
in
policing
will
be
different
because
of
its
consequences
to
be
sure
big
data
policing
may
remedy
some
entrenched
policing
inequities
and
it
may
heighten
expectations
about
accountability
but
enhancing
the
scope
and
power
of
the
police
to
designate
people
as
suspects
will
also
further
complicate
longstanding
concerns
about
discretion
secrecy
about
these
processes
moreover
can
further
alienate
the
public
from
the
police
because
policing
is
a
democratic
institution
and
not
just
a
technological
enterprise

the

of
using
cameras
as
a
method
to
record
a
vehicle
passing
through
a
specific
location
and
then
identifying
the
owner
operator
has
been
in
development
since
the
s
early
technology
could
capture
a
picture
of
a
license
plate
and
vehicle
with
the
date
and
time
upon
retrieving
the
plate
number
after
searching
hours
of
captured
images
the
plate
number
could
then
be
manually
searched
against
a
database
this
technology
was
time
consuming
expensive
and
limited
by
lighting
and

highlight
advocates

techniques

eliminate

but
an
algorithm
is
only
as
good
as
the

it

is
frequently
imperfect
in
ways
that
allow
these

can
discover
surprisingly
useful
regularities
that
are
really
just
preexisting
patterns
of
exclusion
and
inequality
unthinking
reliance
on
data
mining
can
deny
historically
disadvantaged
and
vulnerable
groups
full
participation
in
society
worse
still
because
the
resulting
discrimination
is
almost
always
an
unintentional
emergent
property
of
the
algorithm
s
use
rather
than
a
conscious
choice
by
its
programmers
it
can
be
unusually
hard
to
identify
the
source
of
the
problem
or
to
explain
it
to
a
court
this
essay
examines
these
concerns
through
the
lens
of
american
antidiscrimination
law
more
particularly
through
vii
s
prohibition
of
discrimination
in
employment
in
the
absence
of
a
demonstrable
intent
to
discriminate
the
best

though
hold
that
a
practice
can
be
justified
as
a
business
necessity
when
its
outcomes
are
predictive
of
future
employment
outcomes
and
data
mining
is
specifically
designed
to
find
such
statistical
correlations
unless
there
is
a
reasonably
practical
way
to
demonstrate
that
these
discoveries
are
spurious
title
vii
would
appear
to
bless
its
use
even
though
the
correlations
it
discovers
will
often
reflect
historic
patterns
of
prejudice
others
discrimination
against
members
of
protected
groups
or
flaws
in
the
underlying
data
addressing
the
sources
of
this
unintentional
discrimination
and
remedying
the
corresponding
deficiencies
in
the
law
will
be
difficult
technically
difficult
legally
and
difficult
politically
there
are
a
number
of
practical
limits
to
what
can
be
accomplished
computationally
for
example
when
discrimination
occurs
because
the
data
being
mined
is
itself
a
result
of
past
intentional
discrimination
there
is
frequently
no
obvious
method
to
adjust
historical
data
to
rid
it
of
this
taint
corrective
measures
that
alter
the
results
of
the
data
mining
after
it
is
complete
would
tread
on
legally
and
politically
disputed
terrain
these
challenges
for
reform
throw
into
stark
relief
the
tension
between
the
two
major
theories
underlying
antidiscrimination
law
anticlassification
and
antisubordination
finding
a
solution
to
big
data
s
disparate
impact
will
require
more
than
best
efforts
to
stamp
out
prejudice
and

it
will
require

wholesale
reexamination
of
the
meanings
of
discrimination

fairness
text
introduction
big
data
is
the
buzzword
of
the
decade
n
advertisers
want
data
to
reach
profitable
consumers
n
medical
professionals
to
find
side
effects
of
prescription
drugs
n
supply
chain
operators
to
optimize
their
delivery
routes
n
police
to
determine
where
to
focus
resources
n
and
social
scientists
to
study
human
interactions
n
though
useful
however
data
is
not
a
panacea
where
data
is
used
predictively
to
assist
decision
making
it
can
affect
the
fortunes
of
whole
classes
of
people
in
consistently
unfavorable
ways
sorting
and
selecting
for
the
best
or
most
profitable
candidates
means
generating
a
model
with
winners
and
losers
if
data
miners
are
not
careful
the
process
can
result
in
disproportionately
adverse
outcomes
concentrated
within
historically
disadvantaged
groups
in
ways
that
look
a
lot
like
discrimination
although
we
live
in
the
post
civil
rights
era
discrimination
persists
in
american
society
and
is
stubbornly
pervasive
in
employment
housing
credit
and
consumer
markets
n
while
discrimination
certainly
endures
in
part
due
to
decision
makers
prejudices
a
great
deal
of
modern
day
inequality
can
be
attributed
to
what
sociologists
call
institutional
discrimination
n
unconscious
implicit
biases
and
inertia
within
society
s
institutions
rather
than
intentional
choices
account
for
a
large
part
of
the
disparate
effects
observed
n
approached
without
care
data
mining
can
reproduce
existing
patterns
of
discrimination
inherit
the
prejudice
of
prior
decision
makers
or
simply
reflect
the
widespread
biases
that
persist
in
society
it
can
even
have
the
perverse
result
of
exacerbating
existing
inequalities
by
suggesting
that
historically
disadvantaged
groups
actually
deserve
less
favorable
treatment
algorithms
n
could
exhibit
these
tendencies
even
if
they
have
not
been
manually
programmed
to
do
so
whether
on
purpose
or
by
accident
discrimination
may
be
an
artifact
of
the
data
mining
process
itself
rather
than
a
result
of
programmers
assigning
certain
factors
inappropriate
weight
such
a
possibility
has
gone
unrecognized
by
most
scholars
and
policy
makers
who
tend
to
fear
concealed
nefarious
intentions
or
the
overlooked
effects
of
human
bias
or
error
in
hand
coding
algorithms
n
because
the
discrimination
at
issue
is
unintentional
even
honest
attempts
to
certify
the
absence
of
prejudice
on
the
part
of
those
involved
in
the
data
mining
process
may
wrongly
confer
the
imprimatur
of
impartiality
on
the
resulting
decisions
furthermore
because
the
mechanism
through
which
data
mining
may
disadvantage
protected
classes
is
less
obvious
in
cases
of
unintentional
discrimination
the
injustice
may
be
harder
to
identify
and
address
in
may
the
white
house
released
a
report
titled
big
data
seizing
opportunities

values
podesta
report
which
hinted
at
the
discriminatory
potential
of
big
data
n
the
report
finds
that
big
data
analytics
have
the
potential
to

longstanding
civil
rights
protections
in
how
personal
information

employment
health
education
and
the
marketplace
n
it
suggests
that
there
may
be
unintended
discriminatory
effects
from

mining
but
does
not
detail
how
they
might
come
about

because
the
origin
of
the
discriminatory

remains
unexplored
the
report
s
approach
does
not
address
the
full
scope
of
the
problem
the
podesta
report
as
one
might
expect
from
the
executive
branch
seeks
to
address
these
effects
primarily
by
finding
new
ways
to
enforce
existing
law
regarding
discrimination
the
report
primarily
recommends
that
enforcement
agencies
such
as
the
department
of

federal
trade
commission
consumer
financial

bureau
and
equal

opportunity
commission

increase
their

for
investigating
and
resolving

in

cases
n
as
this
essay
demonstrates
however
existing
law
largely
fails
to
address
the
discrimination
that
can
result
from
data
mining
the
argument
is
grounded
in
title
vii
because
of
all
american
antidiscrimination
jurisprudence
title

has
a
particularly
well
developed
set
of

there
exists

n
for
which
title
vii
will
be
the
primary
vehicle
for
regulation
under
title
vii
it
turns
out
that
some
if
not
most
instances
of
discriminatory
data
mining
will
not
generate
liability
while
the
essay
does
not
show
this
to
be
true
outside
of
title
vii
itself
the
problem
is
likely
not
particular
to

rather
it
is
a
feature
of
our
current
approach
to
antidiscrimination
jurisprudence
with
its
focus
on
procedural
fairness
the
analysis
will
likely
apply
to
other
traditional
areas
of

or
disability
discrimination
similar
tendencies
to

the
disadvantaged
will
likely
arise
in

that

and

this
essay
proceeds
in
three
parts
part
i
introduces
the
computer
science
literature
and
proceeds
through
the
various
steps
of
solving
a
problem
with
data
mining
defining
the
target
variable
labeling
and
collecting
the
training
data
using
feature
selection
and
making
decisions
on
the
basis
of
the
resulting
model
each
of
these
steps
creates
possibilities
for
a
final
result
that
has
a
disproportionately
adverse
impact
on
protected
classes
whether
by
specifying
the
problem
to
be
solved
in
ways
that
affect
classes
differently
failing
to
recognize
or
address
statistical
biases
reproducing
past
prejudice
or
considering
an
insufficiently
rich
set
of
factors
even
in
situations
where
data
miners
are
extremely
careful
they
can
still
effect
discriminatory
results
with
models
that
quite
unintentionally
pick
out
proxy
variables
for
protected
classes
finally
part
i
notes
that
data
mining
poses
the
additional
problem
of
giving
data
miners
the
ability
to
disguise
intentional
discrimination
as
accidental
in
part
ii
the
essay
reviews
title
vii
jurisprudence
as
it
applies
to
data
mining
part
ii
discusses
both
disparate
treatment
and
disparate
impact
examining
which
of
the
various
data
mining
mechanisms
identified
in
part
i
will
trigger
liability
under
either
title
vii
theory
at
first
blush
either
theory
is
viable
disparate
treatment
is
viable
because
data
mining
systems
treat
everyone
differently
that
is
their
purpose
disparate
impact
is
also
viable
because
data
mining
can
have
various
discriminatory
effects
even
without
intent
but
as
part
ii
demonstrates
data
mining
combines
some
well
known
problems
in
discrimination
doctrines
with
new
challenges
particular
to
data
mining
systems
such
that
liability
for
discriminatory
data
mining
will
be
hard
to
find
part
ii
concludes
with
a
discussion
of
the
new
problems
of
proof
that
arise
for
intentional
discrimination
in
this
context
finally
part
iii
addresses
the
difficulties
reformers
would
face
in
addressing
the
deficiencies
found
in
part
ii
these
difficulties
take
two
forms
complications
internal
to
the
logic
of
data
mining
and
political
and
constitutional
difficulties
external
to
the
problem
internally
the
different
steps
in
a
data
mining
problem
require
constant
subjective
and
fact
bound
judgments
which
do
not
lend
themselves
to
general
legislative
resolution
worse
many
of
these
are
normative
judgments
in
disguise
about
which
there
is
not
likely
to
be
consensus
externally
data
mining
will
force
society
to
explicitly
rebalance
the
two
justifications
for
antidiscrimination
law
rooting
out
intentional
discrimination
and
equalizing
the
status
of
historically
disadvantaged
communities
this
is
because
methods
of
proof
and
corrective
measures
will
often
require
an
explicit
commitment
to
substantive
remediation
rather
than
merely
procedural
remedies
in
certain
cases
data
mining
will
make
it
simply
impossible
to
rectify
discriminatory
results
without
engaging
with
the
question
of
what
level
of
substantive
inequality
is
proper
or
acceptable
in
a
given
context
given
current
political
realities
and
trends
in
constitutional
doctrines
legislation
enacting
a
remedy
that
results
from
these
discussions
faces
an
uphill
battle
to
be
sure
data
mining
also
has
the
potential
to
help
reduce
discrimination
by
forcing
decisions
onto
a
more
reliable
empirical
foundation
and
by
formalizing
decision
making
processes
thus
limiting
the
opportunity
for
individual
bias
to
affect
important
assessments
n
in
many
situations
the
introduction
of
data
mining
will
be
a
boon
to
civil
rights
even
where
it
fails
to
root
out
discrimination
altogether
and
such
efforts
should
be
encouraged
yet
understanding
when
and
why
discrimination
persists
in
cases
of
data
driven
decision
making
reveals
important
and
sometimes
troubling
limits
to
the
promise
of
big
data
for
which
there
are
no
ready
solutions
i
how
data
mining
discriminates
although
commentators
have
ascribed
myriad
forms
of
discrimination
to
data
mining
n
there
remains
significant
confusion
over
the
precise
mechanisms
that
render
data
mining
discriminatory
this
part
develops
a
taxonomy
that
isolates
and
explicates
the
specific
technical
issues
that
can
give
rise
to
models
whose
use
in
decision
making
may
have
a
disproportionately
adverse
impact
on
protected
classes
by
definition
data
mining
is
always
a
form
of
statistical
and
therefore
seemingly
rational
discrimination
indeed
the
very
point
of
data
mining
is
to
provide
a
rational
basis
upon
which
to
distinguish
between
individuals
and
to
reliably
confer
to
the
individual
the
qualities
possessed
by
those
who
seem
statistically
similar
nevertheless
data
mining
holds
the
potential
to
unduly
discount
members
of
legally
protected
classes
and
to
place
them
at
systematic
relative
disadvantage
unlike
more
subjective
forms
of
decision
making
data
mining
s
ill
effects
are
often
not
traceable
to
human
bias
conscious
or
unconscious
this
part
describes
five
mechanisms
by
which
these
disproportionately
adverse
outcomes
might
occur
walking
through
a
sequence
of
key
steps
in
the
overall
data
mining
process
a
defining
the
target
variable
and
class
labels
in
contrast
to
those
traditional
forms
of
data
analysis
that
simply
return
records
or
summary
statistics
in
response
to
a
specific
query
data
mining
attempts
to
locate
statistical
relationships
in
a
dataset
n
in
particular
it
automates
the
process
of
discovering
useful
patterns
revealing
regularities
upon
which
subsequent
decision
making
can
rely
the
accumulated
set
of
discovered
relationships
is
commonly
called
a
model
and
these
models
can
be
employed
to
automate
the
process
of
classifying
entities
or
activities
of
interest
estimating
the
value
of
unobserved
variables
or
predicting
future
outcomes
n
familiar
examples
of
such
applications
include
spam
or
fraud
detection
credit
scoring
and
insurance
pricing
these
examples
all
involve
attempts
to
determine
the
status
or
likely
outcome
of
cases
under
consideration
based
solely
on
access
to
correlated
data
n
data
mining
helps
identify
cases
of
spam
and
fraud
and
anticipate
default
and
poor
health
by
treating
these
states
and
outcomes
as
a
function
of
some
other
set
of
observed
characteristics
n
in
particular
by
exposing
so
called
machine
learning
algorithms
to
examples
of
the
cases
of
interest
previously
identified
instances
of
fraud
spam
default
and
poor
health
the
algorithm
learns
which
related
attributes
or
activities
can
serve
as
potential
proxies
for
those
qualities
or
outcomes
of
interest
n
two
concepts
from
the
machine
learning
and
data
mining
literature
are
important
here
target
variables
and
class
labels
the
outcomes
of
interest
discussed
above
are
known
as
target
variables
n
while
the
target
variable
defines
what
data
miners
are
looking
for
class
labels
divide
all
possible
values
of
the
target
variable
into
mutually
exclusive
categories
the
proper
specification
of
the
target
variable
is
frequently
not
obvious
and
the
data
miner
s
task
is
to
define
it
to
start
data
miners
must
translate
some
amorphous
problem
into
a
question
that
can
be
expressed
in
more
formal
terms
that
computers
can
parse
in
particular
data
miners
must
determine
how
to
solve
the
problem
at
hand
by
translating
it
into
a
question
about
the
value
of
some
target
variable
the
open
endedness
that
characterizes
this
part
of
the
process
is
often
described
as
the
art
of
data
mining
this
initial
step
requires
a
data
miner
to
understand
the
project
objectives
and
requirements
from
a
business
perspective
and
then
convert
this
knowledge
into
a
data
mining
problem
definition
n
through
this
necessarily
subjective
process
of
translation
data
miners
may
unintentionally
parse
the
problem
in
such
a
way
that
happens
to
systematically
disadvantage
protected
classes
problem
specification
is
not
a
wholly
arbitrary
process
however
data
mining
can
only
address
problems
that
lend
themselves
to
formalization
as
questions
about
the
state
or
value
of
the
target
variable
data
mining
works
exceedingly
well
for
dealing
with
fraud
and
spam
because
these
cases
rely
on
extant
binary
categories
a
given
instance
either
is
or
is
not
fraud
or
spam
and
the
definitions
of
fraud
or
spam
are
for
the
most
part
uncontroversial
n
a
computer
can
then
flag
or
refuse
transactions
or
redirect
emails
according
to
well
understood
distinctions
n
in
these
cases
data
miners
can
simply
rely
on
these
simple
preexisting
categories
to
define
the
class
labels
sometimes
though
defining
the
target
variable
involves
the
creation
of
new
classes
consider
credit
scoring
for
instance
although
now
taken
for
granted
the
predicted
likelihood
of
missing
a
certain
number
of
loan
repayments
is
not
a
self
evident
answer
to
the
question
of
how
to
successfully
extend
credit
to
consumers
n
unlike
fraud
or
spam
creditworthiness
is
an
artifact
of
the
problem
definition
itself
there
is
no
way
to
directly
measure
creditworthiness
because
the
very
notion
of
creditworthiness
is
a
function
of
the
particular
way
the
credit
industry
has
constructed
the
credit
issuing
and
repayment
system
that
is
an
individual
s
ability
to
repay
some
minimum
amount
of
an
outstanding
debt
on
a
monthly
basis
is
taken
to
be
a
nonarbitrary
standard
by
which
to
determine
in
advance
and
all
at
once
whether
he
is
worthy
of
credit
n
data
mining
has
many
uses
beyond
spam
detection
fraud
detection
credit
scoring
and
insurance
pricing
as
discussed
in
the
introduction
this
essay
will
focus
on
the
use
of
data
mining
in
employment
decisions
extending
this
discussion
to
employment
then
where
employers
turn
to
data
mining
to
develop
ways
of
improving
and
automating
their
search
for
good
employees
they
face
a
number
of
crucial
choices
like
creditworthiness
the
definition
of
a
good
employee
is
not
a
given
good
must
be
defined
in
ways
that
correspond
to
measurable
outcomes
relatively
higher
sales
shorter
production
time
or
longer
tenure
for
example
when
employers
mine
data
for
good
employees
they
are
in
fact
looking
for
employees
whose
observable
characteristics
suggest
that
they
would
meet
or
exceed
some
monthly
sales
threshold
perform
some
task
in
less
than
a
certain
amount
of
time
or
remain
in
their
positions
for
more
than
a
set
number
of
weeks
or
months
rather
than
drawing
categorical
distinctions
along
these
lines
data
mining
could
also
estimate
or
predict
the
specific
numerical
value
of
sales
production
time
or
tenure
period
enabling
employers
to
rank
rather
than
simply
sort
employees
these
may
seem
like
eminently
reasonable
things
for
employers
to
want
to
predict
but
they
are
by
necessity
only
part
of
an
array
of
possible
definitions
of
good
an
employer
may
instead
attempt
to
define
the
target
variable
in
a
more
holistic
way
by
for
example
relying
on
the
grades
that
prior
employees
have
received
in
annual
reviews
which
are
supposed
to
reflect
an
overall
assessment
of
performance
these
target
variable
definitions
simply
inherit
the
formalizations
involved
in
preexisting
assessment
mechanisms
which
in
the
case
of
human
graded
performance
reviews
may
be
far
less
consistent
n
thus
the
definition
of
the
target
variable
and
its
associated
class
labels
will
determine
what
data
mining
happens
to
find
while
critics
of
data
mining
have
tended
to
focus
on
inaccurate
classifications
false
positives
and
false
negatives
n
as
much
if
not
more
danger
resides
in
the
definition
of
the
class
label
itself
and
the
subsequent
labeling
of
examples
from
which
rules
are
inferred
n
while
different
choices
for
the
target
variable
and
class
labels
can
seem
more
or
less
reasonable
valid
concerns
with
discrimination
enter
at
this
stage
because
the
different
choices
may
have
a
greater
or
lesser
adverse
impact
on
protected
classes
for
example
as
later
parts
will
explain
in
detail
hiring
decisions
made
on
the
basis
of
predicted
tenure
are
much
more
likely
to
have
a
disparate
impact
on
certain
protected
classes
than
hiring
decisions
that
turn
on
some
estimate
of
worker
productivity
if
the
turnover
rate
happens
to
be
systematically
higher
among
members
of
certain
protected
classes
hiring
decisions
based
on
predicted
length
of
employment
will
result
in
fewer
job
opportunities
for
members
of
these
groups
even
if
they
would
have
performed
as
well
as
or
better
than
the
other
applicants
the
company
chooses
to
hire
b
training
data
as
described
above
data
mining
learns
by
example
accordingly
what
a
model
learns
depends
on
the
examples
to
which
it
has
been
exposed
the
data
that
function
as
examples
are
known
as
training
data
quite
literally
the
data
that
train
the
model
to
behave
in
a
certain
way
the
character
of
the
training
data
can
have
meaningful
consequences
for
the
lessons
that
data
mining
happens
to
learn
as
computer
science
scholars
explain
biased
training
data
leads
to
discriminatory
models
n
this
can
mean
two
rather
different
things
though
if
data
mining
treats
cases
in
which
prejudice
has
played
some
role
as
valid
examples
to
learn
from
that
rule
may
simply
reproduce
the
prejudice
involved
in
these
earlier
cases
or
if
data
mining
draws
inferences
from
a
biased
sample
of
the
population
any
decision
that
rests
on
these
inferences
may
systematically
disadvantage
those
who
are
under
or
overrepresented
in
the
dataset
both
can
affect
the
training
data
in
ways
that
lead
to
discrimination
but
the
mechanisms
improper
labeling
of
examples
and
biased
data
collections
are
sufficiently
distinct
that
they
warrant
separate
treatment
labeling
examples
labeling
examples
is
the
process
by
which
the
training
data
is
manually
assigned
class
labels
in
cases
of
fraud
or
spam
the
data
miners
draw
from
examples
that
come
prelabeled
when
individual
customers
report
fraudulent
charges
or
mark
a
message
as
spam
they
are
actually
labeling
transactions
and
email
for
the
providers
of
credit
and
webmail
likewise
an
employer
using
grades
previously
given
at
performance
reviews
is
also
using
prelabeled
examples
in
certain
cases
however
there
may
not
be
any
labeled
data
and
data
miners
may
have
to
figure
out
a
way
to
label
examples
themselves
this
can
be
a
laborious
process
and
it
is
frequently
fraught
with
peril
n
often
the
best
labels
for
different
classifications
will
be
open
to
debate
on
which
side
of
the
creditworthy
line
does
someone
who
has
missed
four
credit
card
payments
fall
for
example
n
the
answer
is
not
obvious
even
where
the
class
labels
are
uncontested
or
uncontroversial
they
may
present
a
problem
because
analysts
will
often
face
difficult
choices
in
deciding
which
of
the
available
labels
best
applies
to
a
particular
example
certain
cases
may
present
some
but
not
all
criteria
for
inclusion
in
a
particular
class
n
the
situation
might
also
work
in
reverse
where
the
class
labels
are
insufficiently
precise
to
capture
meaningful
differences
between
cases
such
imperfect
matches
will
demand
that
data
miners
exercise
judgment
the
unavoidably
subjective
labeling
of
examples
will
skew
the
resulting
findings
such
that
any
decisions
taken
on
the
basis
of
those
findings
will
characterize
all
future
cases
along
the
same
lines
this
is
true
even
if
such
characterizations
would
seem
plainly
erroneous
to
analysts
who
looked
more
closely
at
the
individual
cases
for
all
their
potential
problems
though
the
labels
applied
to
the
training
data
must
serve
as
ground
truth
n
thus
decisions
based
on
discoveries
that
rest
on
haphazardly
labeled
data
or
data
labeled

unintentionally

seem
valid

the
customary

methods
employed
by

miners
so
long
as
prior

affected
by
some
form
of
prejudice

as
examples
of
correctly
rendered
determinations

will
necessarily
infer
rules

the

prejudice
consider
a
real

example
from
a
different
context
as
to
how
biased
data
labeling
can
skew
results
st
george
s
hospital
in
the
united
kingdom
developed
a
computer
program
to
help
sort
medical
school
applicants
based
on
its
previous
admissions
decisions
n
those
admissions
decisions
it
turns
out
had
systematically
disfavored
racial
minorities
and
women
with
credentials
otherwise
equal
to
other
applicants
n
in
drawing
rules
from
biased
prior
decisions
st
george
s
hospital
unknowingly
devised
an
automated
process
that
possessed
these
very
same
prejudices
as
editors
at
the
british
medical
journal
noted
at
the
time
t
he
program
was
not
introducing
new
bias
but
merely
reflecting
that
already
in
the
system
n
were
an
employer
to
undertake
a
similar
plan
to
automate
its
hiring
decisions
by
inferring
a
rule
from
past
decisions
swayed
by
prejudice
the
employer
would
likewise
arrive
at
a
decision
procedure
that
simply
reproduces
the
prejudice
of
prior
decision
makers
indeed
automating
the
process
in
this
way
would
turn
the
conscious
prejudice
or
implicit
bias
of
individuals
involved
in
previous
decision
making
into
a
formalized
rule
that
would
systematically
alter
the
prospects
of
all
future
applicants
for
example
the
computer
may
learn
to
discriminate
against
certain
female
or
black
applicants
if
trained
on
prior
hiring
decisions
in
which
an
employer
has
consistently
rejected
jobseekers
with
degrees
from
women
s
or
historically
black
colleges
not
only
can
data
mining
inherit
prior
prejudice
through
the
mislabeling
of
examples
it
can
also
reflect
current
prejudice
through
the
ongoing
behavior
of
users
taken
as
inputs
to
data
mining
this
is
what
professor
latanya
sweeney
discovered
in
a
study
that
found
that
google
queries
for
black
sounding
names
were
more
likely
to
return
contextual
i
e
key
word
triggered
advertisements
for
arrest
records
than
those
for
white
sounding
names
n
sweeney
confirmed
that
the
companies
paying
for
these
advertisements
had
not
set
out
to
focus
on
black
sounding
names
rather
the
fact
that
black
sounding
names
were
more
likely
to
trigger
such
advertisements
seemed
to
be
an
artifact
of
the
algorithmic
process
that
google
employs
to
determine
which
advertisements
to
display
alongside
certain
queries
n
although
it
is
not
fully
known
how
google
computes
the
so
called
quality
score
according
to
which
it
ranks
advertisers
bids
one
important
factor
is
the
predicted
likelihood
based
on
historical
trends
that
users
will
click
on
an
advertisement
n
as
sweeney
points
out
the
process
learns
over
time
which
advertisement
text
gets
the
most
clicks
from
viewers
of
the
advertisement
and
promotes
that
advertisement
in
its
rankings
accordingly
n
sweeney
posits
that
this
aspect
of
the
process
could
result
in
the
differential
delivery
of
advertisements
that
reflect
the
kinds
of
prejudice
held
by
those
exposed
to
the
advertisements
n
in
attempting
to
cater
to
users
preferences
google
will
unintentionally
reproduce
the
existing
prejudices
that
inform
users
choices
a
similar
situation
could
conceivably
arise
on
websites
that
recommend
potential
employees
to
employers
as
linkedin
does
through
its
talent
match
feature
n
if
linkedin
determines
which
candidates
to
recommend
based
on
the
demonstrated
interest
of
employers
in
certain
types
of
candidates
talent
match
will
offer
recommendations
that
reflect
whatever
biases
employers
happen
to
exhibit
in
particular
if
linkedin
s
algorithm
observes
that
employers
disfavor
certain
candidates
who
are
members
of
a
protected
class
talent
match
may
decrease
the
rate
at
which
it
recommends
these
candidates
to
employers
the
recommendation
engine
would
learn
to
cater
to
the
prejudicial
preferences
of
employers
there
is
an
old
adage
in
computer
science
garbage
in

out
because
data
mining
relies
on
training
data
as
ground
truth
when
those
inputs
are
themselves
skewed
by
bias
or
inattention
the
resulting
system
will
produce

are
at

unreliable
and
at
worst
discriminatory
data
collection
decisions
that
depend
on
conclusions
drawn
from
incorrect
partial

nonrepresentative
data
may
discriminate
against

the
individual

that
a

maintains
about
a

have
serious
mistakes
n
the
records
of
the

of
which
this

is
a

might
also
have
similar
mistakes
at
a
higher
rate
than
other
groups

the
entire

of

may
fail
to
reflect

in
accurate

to

n
in
other
words
the
quality
and
representativeness
of

might
vary
in
ways
that

for
certain

even
a

of
consistently
high

can
suffer
from
statistical
biases
that
fail
to
represent
different

in
accurate
proportions
much
attention
has
focused
on
the
harms
that
might
befall
individuals
whose
records
in
various
commercial
databases
are
error
ridden
n
far
less
consideration
however
has
been
paid
to
the
systematic
disadvantage
that
members
of
protected
classes
may
suffer
from
being
miscounted
and
as
a
result
misrepresented
in
the
evidence
base
recent
scholarship
has
begun
to
stress
this
point
jonas
lerman
for
example
worries
about
the
nonrandom
systemic
omission
of
people
who
live
on
big
data
s
margins
whether
due
to
poverty
geography
or
lifestyle
and
whose
lives
are
less
datafied
than
the
general
population
s
n
professor
kate
crawford
has
likewise
warned
that
b
ecause
not
all
data
is
created
or
even
collected
equally
there
are
signal
problems
in
big
data
sets
dark
zones
or
shadows
where
some
citizens
and
communities
are
overlooked
or
underrepresented
n
errors
of
this
sort
may
befall
historically
disadvantaged
groups
at
higher
rates
because
they
are
less
involved
in
the
formal
economy
and
its
data
generating
activities
have
unequal
access
to
and
relatively
less
fluency
in
the
technology
necessary
to
engage
online
or
are
less
profitable
customers
or
important
constituents
and
therefore
less
interesting
as
targets
of
observation
n
not
only
will
the
quality
of
individual
records
of
members
of
these
groups
be
poorer
as
a
consequence
but
these
groups
as
a
whole
will
also
be
less
well
represented
in
datasets
skewing
conclusions
that
may
be
drawn
from
an
analysis
of
the
data
as
an
illustrative
example
crawford
points
to
street
bump
an
application
for
boston
residents
that
takes
advantage
of
accelerometers
built
into
smart
phones
to
detect
when
drivers
ride
over
potholes
n
while
crawford
praises
the
cleverness
and
cost
effectiveness
of
this
passive
approach
to
reporting
road
problems
she
rightly
warns
that
whatever
information
the
city
receives
from
street
bump
will
be
biased
by
the
uneven
distribution
of
smartphones
across
populations
in
different
parts
of
the
city
n
in
particular
systematic
differences
in
smartphone
ownership
will
very
likely
result
in
the
underreporting
of
road
problems
in
the
poorer
communities
where
protected
groups
disproportionately
congregate
n
if
the
city
were
to
rely
on
this
data
to
determine
where
it
should
direct
its
resources
it
would
only
further
underserve
these
communities
indeed
the
city
would
discriminate
against
those
who
lack
the
capability
to
report
problems
as
effectively
as
wealthier
residents
with
smartphones
n
a
similar
dynamic
could
easily
apply
in
an
employment
context
if
members
of
protected
classes
are
unable
to
report
their
interest
in
and
qualification
for
jobs
listed
online
as
easily
or
effectively
as
others
due
to
systematic
differences
in
internet
access
the
eeoc
has
established
a
program
called
eradicating
racism
colorism
from
employment
e
race
that
aims
at
least
in
part
to
prevent
this
sort
of
discrimination
from
occurring
due
to
an
employer
s
desire
for
high
tech
hiring
such
as
video
r
sum
s
n
e
race
not
only
attempts
to
lower
the
barriers
that
would
disproportionately
burden
applicants
who
belong
to
a
protected
class
but
also
ensures
that
employers
do
not
develop
an
inaccurate
impression
of
the
incidence
of
qualified
and
interested
candidates
from
these
communities
if
employers
were
to
rely
on
tallies
of
high
tech
candidates
to
direct
their
recruiting
efforts
for
example
any
count
affected
by
a
reporting
bias
could
have
adverse
consequences
for
specific
populations
systematically
underrepresented
in
the
dataset
employers
would
deny
equal
attention
to
those
who
reside
in
areas
incorrectly
pegged
as
having
a
relatively
lower
concentration
of
qualified
candidates
additional
and
even
more
severe
risks
may
reside
in
the
systematic
omission
of
members
of
protected
classes
from
such
datasets
the
street
bump
and
internet
job
application
examples
only
discuss
decisions
that
depend
on
raw
tallies
rather
than
datasets
from
which
decision
makers
want
to
draw
generalizations
and
generate
predictions
but
data
mining
is
especially
sensitive
to
statistical
bias
because
data
mining
helps
to
discover
patterns
that
organizations
tend
to
treat
as
generalizable
findings
even
though
the
analyzed
data
only
includes
a
partial
sample
from
a
circumscribed
period
to
ensure
that
data
mining
reveals
patterns
that
hold
true
for
more
than
the
particular
sample
under
analysis
the
sample
must
be
proportionally
representative
of
the
entire
population
even
though
the
sample
by
definition
does
not
include
every
case
n
if
a
sample
includes
a
disproportionate
representation
of
a
particular
class
more
or
less
than
its
actual
incidence
in
the
overall
population
the
results
of
an
analysis
of
that
sample
may
skew
in
favor
of
or
against
the
over
or
underrepresented
class
while
the
representativeness
of
the
data
is
often
simply
assumed
this
assumption
is
rarely
justified
and
is
perhaps
more
often
incorrect
than
correct
n
data
gathered
for
routine
business
purposes
tend
to
lack
the
rigor
of
social
scientific
data
collection
n
as
lerman
points
out
businesses
may
ignore
or
undervalue
the
preferences
and
behaviors
of
consumers
who
do
not
shop
in
ways
that
big
data
tools
can
easily
capture
aggregate
and
analyze
n
in
the
employment
context
even
where
a
company
performs
an
analysis
of
the
data
from
its
entire
population
of
employees
avoiding
the
apparent
problem
of
even
having
to
select
a
sample
the
organization
must
assume
that
its
future
applicant
pool
will
have
the
same
degree
of
variance
as
its
current
employee
base
an
organization
s
tendency
however
to
perform
such
analyses
in
order
to
change
the
composition
of
their
employee
base
should
put
the
validity
of
this
assumption
into
immediate
doubt
the
potential
effect
of
this
assumption
is
the
future
mistreatment
of
individuals
predicted
to
behave
in
accordance
with
the
skewed
findings
derived
from
the
biased
sample
worse
these
results
may
lead
to
decision
procedures
that
limit
the
future
contact
an
organization
will
have
with
specific
groups
skewing
still
further
the
sample
upon
which
subsequent
analyses
will
be
performed
n
limiting
contact
with
specific
populations
on
the
basis
of
unsound
generalizations
may
deny
members
of
these
populations
the
opportunity
to
prove
that
they
buck
the
apparent
trend
overrepresentation
in
a
dataset
can
also
lead
to
disproportionately
high
adverse
outcomes
for
members
of
protected
classes
consider
an
example
from
the
workplace
managers
may
devote
disproportionate
attention
to
monitoring
the
activities
of
employees
who
belong
to
a
protected
class
and
consequently
observe
mistakes
and
transgressions
at
systematically
higher
rates
than
others
in
part
because
these
managers
fail
to
subject
others
who
behave
similarly
to
the
same
degree
of
scrutiny
not
only
does
this
provide
managers
with
justification
for
their
prejudicial
suspicions
but
it
also
generates
evidence
that
overstates
the
relative
incidence
of
offenses
by
members
of
these
groups
where
subsequent
managers
who
hold
no
such
prejudicial
suspicions
cannot
observe
everyone
equally
they
may
rely
on
this
evidence
to
make
predictions
about
where
to
focus
their
attention
in
the
future
and
thus
further
increase
the
disproportionate
scrutiny
that
they
place
on
protected
classes
the
efficacy
of
data
mining
is
fundamentally
dependent
on
the
quality
of
the
data
from
which
it
attempts
to
draw
useful
lessons
if
these

capture
the
prejudicial
or

decision
makers
data
mining
will
learn
from
the
bad
example
that
these
decisions
set
if
the
data
fail
to
serve
as
a
good
sample
of
a
protected
group
data
mining
will
draw
faulty
lessons
that
could
serve
as
a
discriminatory
basis
for
future
decision
making
c
feature
selection
through
a
process
called
feature
selection
organizations
and
the
data
miners
that
work
for
them
make
choices
about
what
attributes
they
observe
and
subsequently
fold
into
their
analyses
n
these
decisions
can
also
have
serious
implications
for
the
treatment
of
protected
classes
if
those
factors
that
better
account
for
pertinent
statistical
variation
among
members
of
a
protected
class
are
not
well
represented
in
the
set
of
selected
features
n
members
of
protected
classes
may
find
that
they
are
subject
to
systematically
less
accurate
classifications
or
predictions
because
the
details
necessary
to
achieve
equally
accurate
determinations
reside
at
a
level
of
granularity
and
coverage
that
the
selected
features
fail
to
achieve
this
problem
arises
because
data
are
necessarily
reductive
representations
of
an
infinitely
more
specific
real
world
object

phenomenon
n
these
representations

fail

increasing
the
resolution

still
fail

capture
the
mechanisms

not
lend

n
while
these
limitations
lend
credence
to
the
argument
that
a
dataset
can
never
fully
encompass
the
full
complexity
of
the
individuals
it
seeks
to
represent
they
do
not
reveal
the
inherent
inadequacy
of
representation
as
such
at
issue
really
are
the
coarseness
and
comprehensiveness
of
the
criteria
that
permit
statistical
discrimination
and
the
uneven
rates
at
which
different
groups
happen
to
be
subject
to
erroneous
determinations
crucially
these
erroneous
and
potentially
adverse
outcomes
are
artifacts
of
statistical
reasoning
rather
than
prejudice
on
the
part
of
decision
makers
or
bias
in
the
composition
of
the
dataset
as
professor
frederick
schauer
explains
decision
makers
that
rely
on
statistically
sound
but
nonuniversal
generalizations
are
being
simultaneously
rational
and
unfair
because
certain
individuals
are
actuarially
saddled
by
statistically
sound
inferences
that
are
nevertheless
inaccurate
n
obtaining
information
that
is
sufficiently
rich
to
permit
precise
distinctions
can
be
expensive
even
marginal
improvements
in
accuracy
may
come
at
significant
practical
costs
and
may
justify
a
less
granular
and
encompassing
analysis
n
to
take
an
obvious
example
from
the
employment
context
hiring
decisions
that
consider
academic
credentials
tend
to
assign
enormous
weight
to
the
reputation
of
the
college
or
university
from
which
an
applicant
has
graduated
even
though
such
reputations
may
communicate
very
little
about
the
applicant
s
job
related
skills
and
competencies
n
if
equally
competent
members
of
protected
classes
happen
to
graduate
from
these
colleges
or
universities
at
disproportionately
low
rates
decisions
that
turn
on
the
credentials
conferred
by
these
schools
rather
than
some
set
of
more
specific
qualities
that
more
accurately
sort
individuals
will
incorrectly
and
systematically
discount
these
individuals
even
if
employers
have
a
rational
incentive
to
look
beyond
credentials
and
focus
on
criteria
that
allow
for
more
precise
and
more
accurate
determinations
they
may
continue
to
favor
credentials
because
they
communicate
pertinent
information
at
no
cost
to
the
employer
n
similar
dynamics
seem
to
account
for
the
practice
known
as
redlining
n
in
which
financial
institutions
employ
especially
general
criteria
to
draw
distinctions
between
subpopulations
i
e
the
neighborhood
in
which
individuals
happen
to
reside
despite
the
fact
that
such
distinctions
fail
to
capture
significant
variation
within
each
subpopulation
that
would
result
in
a
different
assessment
for
certain
members
of
these
groups
while
redlining
in
america
is
well
known
to
have
had
its
basis
in
racial
animus
and
prejudice
n
decision
makers
operating
in
this
manner
may
attempt
to
justify
their
behavior
by
pointing
to
the
cost
efficiency
of
relying
on
easily
accessible
information
in
other
words
decision
makers
can
argue
that
they
are
willing
to
tolerate
higher
rates
of
erroneous
determinations
for
certain
groups
because
the
benefits
derived
from
more
granular
data
and
thus
better
accuracy
do
not
justify
the
costs
of
course
it
may
be
no
coincidence
that
such

analyses
seem
to
justify
treating
groups
composed
disproportionately
of
members
of
protected
classes
to
systematically
less
accurate
determinations
n
redlining
is
illegal
because
it
can
systematically
discount
entire
areas
composed
primarily
of
members
of
a
protected
class
despite
the
presence
of
some
qualified
candidates
n
cases
of
so
called
rational
racism
are
really
just
a
special
instance
of
this
more
general
phenomenon
one
in
which
race
happens
to
be
taken
into
consideration
explicitly
in
such
cases
decision
makers
take
membership
in
a
protected
class
into
account
even
if
they
hold
no
prejudicial
views
because
such
membership
seems
to
communicate
relevant
information
that
would
be
difficult
or
impossible
to
obtain
otherwise
accordingly
the
persistence
of
distasteful
forms
of
discrimination
may
be
the
result
of
a
lack
of
information
rather
than
a
continued
taste
for
discrimination
n
professor
lior
strahilevitz
has
argued
for
instance
that
when
employers
lack
access
to
criminal
records
they
may
consider
race
in
assessing
an
applicant
s
likelihood
of
having
a
criminal
record
because
there
are
statistical
differences
in
the
rates
at
which
members
of
different
racial
groups
have
been
convicted
of
crimes
n
in
other
words
employers
fall
back
on
more
immediately
available
and
coarse
features
when
they
cannot
access
more
specific
or
verified
information
n
of
course
as
strahilevitz
points
out
race
is
a
highly
imperfect
basis
upon
which
to
predict
an
individual
s
criminal
record
despite
whatever
differences
may
exist
in
the
rates
at
which
members
of
different
racial
groups
have
been
convicted
of
crimes
because
it
is
too
coarse
as
an
indicator
n
d
proxies
cases
of
decision
making
that
do
not
artificially
introduce
discriminatory
effects
into
the
data
mining
process
may
nevertheless
result
in
systematically
less
favorable
determinations
for
members
of
protected
classes
this
is
possible
when
the
criteria
that
are
genuinely
relevant
in
making
rational
and
well
informed
decisions
also
happen
to
serve
as
reliable
proxies
for
class
membership
in
other
words
the
very
same
criteria
that
correctly
sort
individuals
according
to
their
predicted
likelihood
of
excelling
at
a
job
as
formalized
in
some
fashion
may
also
sort
individuals
according
to
class
membership
in
certain
cases
there
may
be
an
obvious
reason
for
this
just
as
mining
from
historical
data
may
discover
traditional
prejudices
that
are
endemic
in
reality
i
e
taste
based
discrimination
so
too
may
data
mining
discover
patterns
of
lower
performances
skills
or
capacities
of
protected
by
law
groups
n
these
discoveries
not
only
reveal
the
simple
fact
of
inequality
but
they
also
reveal
that
these
are
inequalities
in
which
members
of
protected
classes
are
frequently
in
the
relatively
less
favorable
position
this
has
rather
obvious
implications
if
features
held
at
a
lower
rate
by
members
of
protected
groups
nevertheless
possess
relevance
in
rendering
legitimate
decisions
such
decisions
will
necessarily
result
in
systematically
less
favorable
determinations
for
these
individuals
for
example
by
conferring
greater
attention
and
opportunities
to
employees
that
they
predict
will
prove
most
competent
at
some
task
employers
may
find
that
they
subject
members
of
protected
groups
to
consistently
disadvantageous
treatment
because
the
criteria
that
determine
the
attractiveness
of
employees
happen
to
be
held
at
systematically
lower
rates
by
members
of
these
groups
n
decision
makers
do
not
necessarily
intend
this
disparate
impact
because
they
hold
prejudicial
beliefs
rather
their
reasonable
priorities
as
profit
seekers
unintentionally
recapitulate
the
inequality
that
happens
to
exist
in
society
furthermore
this
may
occur
even
if
proscribed
criteria
have
been
removed
from
the
dataset
the
data
are
free
from
latent
prejudice
or
bias
the
features
are
especially
granular
and
diverse
and
the
only
goal
is
to
maximize
classificatory
or
predictive
accuracy
the
problem
stems
from
what
researchers
call
redundant
encodings
cases
in
which
membership
in
a
protected
class
happens
to
be
encoded
in
other
data
n
this
occurs
when
a
particular
piece
of
data
or
certain
values
for
that
piece
of
data
are
highly
correlated
with
membership
in
specific
protected
classes
data
s
significant
statistical
relevance
to
the
decision
at
hand
helps
explain
why
data
mining
can
result
in
seemingly
discriminatory
models
even
when
its
only
objective
is
to
ensure
the
greatest
possible
accuracy
for
its
determinations
if
there
is
a
disparate
distribution
of
an
attribute
a
more
precise
form
of
data
mining
will
be
more
likely
to
capture
that
distribution
better
data
and
more
features
will
simply
come
closer
to
exposing
the
exact
extent
of
inequality
e
masking
data
mining
could
also
breathe
new
life
into
traditional
forms
of
intentional
discrimination
because
decision
makers
with
prejudicial
views
can
mask
their
intentions
by
exploiting
each
of
the
mechanisms
enumerated
above
stated
simply
any
form
of
discrimination
that
happens
unintentionally
can
also
be
orchestrated
intentionally
for
instance
decision
makers
could
knowingly
and
purposefully
bias
the
collection
of
data
to
ensure
that
mining
suggests
rules
that
are
less
favorable
to
members
of
protected
classes
n
they
could
likewise
attempt
to
preserve
the
known
effects
of
prejudice
in
prior
decision
making
by
insisting
that
such
decisions
constitute
a
reliable
and
impartial
set
of
examples
from
which
to
induce
a
decision
making
rule
and
decision
makers
could
intentionally
rely
on
features
that
only
permit
coarse
grained
distinction
making
distinctions
that
result
in
avoidably
higher
rates
of
erroneous
determinations
for
members
of
a
protected
class
in
denying
themselves
finer
grained
detail
decision
makers
would
be
able
to
justify
writing
off
entire
groups
composed
disproportionately
of
members
of
protected
classes
a
form
of
digital
redlining
this
decision
masks
efforts
to
engage
in
intentional
discrimination
by
abstracting
to
a
level
of
analysis
that
fails
to
capture
lower
level
variations
as
a
result
certain
members
of
protected
classes
might
not
be
seen
as
attractive
candidates
here
prejudice
rather
than
some
legitimate
business
reason
such
as
cost
motivates
decision
makers
to
intentionally
restrict
the
particularity
of
their
decision
making
to
a
level
that
can
only
paint
in
avoidably
broad
strokes
this
condemns
entire
groups
composed
disproportionately
of
members
of
protected
classes
to
systematically
less
favorable
treatment
because
data
mining
holds
the
potential
to
infer
otherwise
unseen
attributes
including
those
traditionally
deemed
sensitive
n
it
can
indirectly
determine
individuals
membership
in
protected
classes
and
unduly
discount
penalize
or
exclude
such
people
accordingly
in
other
words
data
mining
could
grant
decision
makers
the
ability
to
distinguish
and
disadvantage
members
of
protected
classes
even
if
those
decision
makers
do
not
have
access
to
explicit
information
about
individuals
class
membership
data
mining
could
instead
help
to
pinpoint
reliable
proxies
for
such
membership
and
thus
place
institutions
in
the
position
to
automatically
sort
individuals
into
their
respective
class
without
ever
having
to
learn
these
facts
directly
n
the
most
immediate
implication
is
that
institutions
could
employ
data
mining
to
circumvent
the
barriers
both
practical
and
legal
that
have
helped
to
withhold
individuals
protected
class
membership
from
consideration
additionally
data
mining
could
provide
cover
for
intentional
discrimination
of
this
sort
because
the
process
conceals
the
fact
that
decision
makers
determined
and
considered
the
individual
s
class
membership
the
worry
then
is
not
simply
that
data
mining
introduces
novel
ways
for
decision
makers
to
satisfy
their
taste
for
illegal
discrimination
rather
the
worry
is
that
it
may
mask
actual
cases
of
such
discrimination
n
although
scholars
policy
makers
and
lawyers
have
long
been
aware
of
the
dangers
of
masking
n
data
mining
significantly
enhances
the
ability
to
conceal
acts
of
intentional
discrimination
by
finding
ever
more
remote
and
complex
proxies
for
proscribed
criteria
n
intentional
discrimination
and
its
masking
have
so
far
garnered
disproportionate
attention
in
discussions
of
data
mining
n
often
to
the
exclusion
of
issues
arising
from
the
many
forms
of
unintentional
discrimination
described
above
while
data
mining
certainly
introduces
novel
ways
to
discriminate
intentionally
and
to
conceal
those
intentions
most
cases
of
employment
discrimination
are
already
sufficiently
difficult
to
prove
employers
motivated
by
conscious
prejudice
would
have
little
to
gain
by
pursuing
these
complex
and
costly
mechanisms
to
further
mask
their
intentions
n
when
it
comes
to
data
mining
unintentional
discrimination
is
the
more
pressing
concern
because
it
is
likely
to
be

more
common

n
formal
discrimination
in
which
membership
in

is
used
as
an
input
to
the

corresponds
to
an
employer
classifying
employees
or
potential
hires
according
to
membership
in
a
protected
class
and
differentiating
them
on
that
basis
formal
discrimination
covers
both
the
straightforward
denial
of
opportunities
based
on
protected
class
membership
and
the
use
of
rational
racism
n
in
traditional
contexts
rational
racism
is
considered
rational
because
there
are
cases
in
which
its
users
believe
it
is
an
accurate
if
coarse
grained
proxy
or
at
least
the
best
available
one
in
a
given
situation
n
in
the
world
of
data
mining
though
that
need
not
be
the
case
even
if
membership
in
a
protected

were
specified
as
an
input
the
eventual
model
that
emerges
could
see
it
as
the
least
significant
feature
in
that
case
there
would
be
no
discriminatory
effect
but
there
would
be
a
disparate
treatment
violation
because
considering
membership
in
a
protected
class
as
a
potential
proxy
is
a
legal
classificatory
harm
in
itself
n
formal
liability
does
not
correspond
to
any
particular
discrimination
mechanism
within
data
mining
it
can
occur
equally
well
in
any
of
them
because
classification
itself
can
be
a
legal
harm
irrespective
of
the
effect
n
the
same
should
be
true
of
using
protected
class
as
an
input
to
a
system
for
which
the
entire
purpose
is
to
build
a
classificatory
model
n
the
irony
is
that
the
use
of
protected
class
as
an
input
is
usually
irrelevant
to
the
outcome
in
terms
of
discriminatory
effect
at
least
given
a
large
enough
number
of
input
features
the
target
variable
will
in
reality
be
correlated
to
the
membership
in
a
protected
class
somewhere
between
percent
and
percent
if
the
trait
is
perfectly
uncorrelated
including
membership
in
the
protected
class
as
an
input
will
not
change
the
output
and
there
will
be
no
discriminatory
effect
n
on
the
other
end
of
the
spectrum
where
membership
in
the
protected
class
is
perfectly
predictive
of
the
target
variable
the
fact
will
be
redundantly
encoded
in
the
other
data
the
only
way
using
membership
in
the
protected
class
as
an
explicit
feature
will
change
the
outcome
is
if
the
information
is
otherwise
not
rich
enough
to
detect
such
membership
membership
in
the
protected
class
will
prove
relevant
to
the
exact
extent
it
is
already
redundantly
encoded
given
a
rich
enough
set
of
features
the
chance
that
such
membership
is
redundantly
encoded
approaches
certainty
thus
a
data
mining
model
with
a
large
number
of
variables
will
determine
the
extent
to
which
membership
in
a
protected
class
is
relevant
to
the
sought
after
trait
whether
or
not
that
information
is
an
input
formal
discrimination
therefore
should
have
no
bearing
whatsoever
on
the
outcome
of
the
model
additionally
by
analyzing
the
data
an
employer
could
probabilistically
determine
an
employee
s
membership
in
that

did
indeed
want
to
know

formal

doctrine

treatment
case
will
generally
proceed
under
either
the
mcdonnell
douglas
burden
shifting
scheme
or
the
price
waterhouse
mixed
motive
regime
n
under
the
mcdonnell
douglas
framework
the
plaintiff
who
has
suffered
an
adverse
employment
action
has
the
initial
responsibility
to
establish
a
prima
facie
case
of
discrimination
by
demonstrating
that
a
similarly
situated
person
who
is
not
a
member
of
a
protected
class
would
not
have
suffered
the
same
fate
n
this
can
be
shown
with
circumstantial
evidence
of
discriminatory
intent
such
as
disparaging
remarks
made
by
the
employer
or
procedural
irregularities
in
promotion
or
hiring
only
very
rarely
will
an
employer
openly
admit
to
discriminatory
conduct
if
the
plaintiff
successfully
demonstrates
that
the
adverse
action
treated
protected
class
members
differently
then
the
burden
shifts
to
the
defendant
employer
to
offer
a
legitimate
nondiscriminatory
basis
for
the
decision
the
defendant
need
not
prove
the
reason
is
true
his
is
only
a
burden
of
production
n
once
the
defendant
has
offered
a
nondiscriminatory
alternative
the
ultimate
burden
of
persuasion
falls
to
the
plaintiff
to
demonstrate
that
the
proffered
reason
is
pretextual
n
in
the
data
mining
context
liability
for
masking
is
clear
as
a
theoretical
matter
no
matter
which
mechanism
for
discrimination
is
employed
the
fact
that
it
is
accomplished
algorithmically
does
not
make
it
less
of
a
disparate
treatment
violation
as
the
entire
idea
of
masking
is
pretextual
in
fact
in
the
traditional
non
data
mining
context
the
word
masking
has
occasionally
been
used
to
refer
to
pretext
n
like
in
any
disparate
treatment
case
however
proof
will
be
difficult
to
come
by
something
even
truer
for
masking
n
the
mcdonnell
douglas
framework
operates
on
a
presumption
that
if
the
rationale
that
the
employer
has
given
is
found
to
be
untrue
the
employer
must
be
hiding
his
true
discriminatory
motive
n
because
the
focus
of
the
mcdonnell
douglas
framework
is
on
pretext
and
cover
up
it
can
only
address
conscious
willful
discrimination
n
under
the
mcdonnell
douglas
framework
a
court
must
find
either
that
the
employer
intended
to
discriminate
or
did
not
discriminate
at
all
n
thus
unintentional
discrimination
will
not
lead
to
liability
a
title
vii
disparate
treatment
case
can
also
be
tried
under
the
mixed
motive
framework
first
recognized
in
price
waterhouse
v
hopkins
n
and
most
recently
modified
by
desert
palace
inc
v
costa
n
in
the
mixed
motive
framework
a
plaintiff
need
not
demonstrate
that
the
employer
s
nondiscriminatory
rationale
was
pretextual
but
merely
that
discrimination
was
a
motivating
factor
in
the
adverse
employment
action
n
as
a
practical
matter
this
means
that
the
plaintiff
must
show
that
the
same
action
would
not
have
been
taken
absent
the
discriminatory
motive
n
as
several
commentators
have
pointed
out
motive
and
intent
are
not
necessarily
synonymous
n
motive
can
be
read
more
broadly
to
include
unconscious
discrimination
including
anything
that
influences
a
person
to
act
such
as
emotions
or
desires
n
nonetheless
courts
have
conflated
the
meanings
of
motive
and
intent
such
that
the
phrase
motive
or
intent
has
come
to
refer
only
to
conscious
choices
n
thus
while
most
individual
decision
making
probably
belongs
in
a
mixed
motive
framework
as
each
decision
a
person
makes
comprises
a
complicated
mix
of
motivations
n
the
mixed
motive
framework
will
be
no
better
than
the
pretext
framework
at
addressing
bias
that
occurs
absent
conscious
intent

by
stipulation
unintentional
unintentional
disparate
treatment
is
not
a
problem
that
is
new
to
data

a
vast
scholarly
literature
has
developed
regarding
the
law
s
treatment
of
unconscious
implicit
bias
n

can
occur
when
an
employer
has
internalized
some
racial
stereotype
and
applies
it
or
without
realizing
it
monitors
an
employee
more
closely
until
the
employer
finds
a
violation
n
the
employee
is
clearly
treated
differently
but
it
is
not
intentional
and
the
employer
is
unaware
of
it
as
professor
samuel
bagenstos
summarized
at
this
point
it
may
be
difficult
if
not
impossible
for
a
court
to
go
back
and
reconstruct
the
numerous
biased
evaluations
and
perceptions
that
ultimately
resulted
in
an
adverse
employment
decision
n
within
the
scholarly
literature
there
is
s
urprising
unanimity
that
the
law
does
not
adequately
address
unconscious
disparate
treatment
n
there
are
a
few
possible
ways
to
analogize
discriminatory
data
mining
to
unintentional
disparate
treatment
in
the
traditional
context
based
on
where
one
believes
the
treatment
lies
either
the
disparate
treatment
occurs
at
the
decision
to
apply
a
predictive
model
that
will
treat
members
of
a
protected
class
differently
or
it
occurs
when
the
disparate
result
of
the
model
is
used
in
the
ultimate
hiring
decision
in
the
first
scenario
the
intent
at
issue
is
the
decision
to
apply
a
predictive
model
with
known
disproportionate
impact
on
protected
classes
in
the
second
the
disparate
treatment
occurs
if
after
the
employer
sees
the
disparate
result
he
proceeds
anyway
if
the
employer
continues
because
he
liked
the
discrimination
produced
in
either
scenario
then
intent
is
clear
if
not
then
this
just
devolves
into
a
standard
disparate
impact
scenario
with
liability
based
on
effect
under
disparate
impact
theory
deciding
to
follow
through
on
a
test
with
discriminatory
effect
does
not
suddenly
render
it
disparate
treatment
n
another
option
is
to
imagine
the
model
as
the
decision
maker
exhibiting
implicit
bias
that
is
because
of
biases
hidden
to
the
predictive
model
such
as
nonrepresentative
data
or
mislabeled
examples
the
model
reaches
a
discriminatory
result
this
analogy
turns
every
mechanism
except
proxy
discrimination
into
the
equivalent
of
implicit
bias
exhibited
by
individual
decision
makers
the
effect
of
bias
is
one
factor
among
the
many
different
factors
that
go
into
the
model
driven
decision
just
like
in
an
individual
s
adverse
employment
decision
n
would
a
more
expansive
definition
of
motive
fix
this
scenario
because
the
doctrine
focuses
on
human
decision
makers
as
discriminators
the
answer
is
no
even
if
disparate
treatment
doctrine
could
capture
unintentional
discrimination
it
would
only
address
such
discrimination
stemming
from
human
bias
for
example
the
person
who
came
up
with
the
idea
for
street
bump
ultimately
devised
a
system
that
suffers
from
reporting
bias
n
but
it
was
not
because
he
or
she
was
implicitly
employing
some
racial
stereotype
rather
it
was
simply
inattentiveness
to
problems
with
the
sampling
frame
this
is
not
to
say
that
his
or
her
own
bias
had
nothing
to
do
with
it
the
person
likely
owned
a
smartphone
and
thus
did
not
think
about
the
people
who
do
not
but
no
one
would
say
that
it
was
even
implicit
bias
against
protected
classes
that
motivated
the
decision
even
under
the
expansive
definition
of
the
word
motive
n
the
only
possible
analogy
relevant
to
disparate
treatment
then
is
to
those
data
mining
mechanisms
of
unintentional
discrimination
that
reflect
a
real
person
s
bias
something
like
linkedin
s
talent
match
recommendation
engine
which
relies
on
potentially
prejudiced
human
assessments
of
employees
n
as
a
general
rule
an
employer
may
not
avoid
disparate
treatment
liability
by
encoding
third
party
preferences
as
a
rationale
for
a
hiring
decision
n
but
once
again
to
be
found
liable
under
current
doctrine
the
employer
would
likely
both
have
to
know
that
this
is
the
specific
failure
mechanism
of
the
model
and
choose
it
based
on
this
fact
there
is
one
other
interesting
question
regarding
disparate
treatment
doctrine
whether
the
intent
standard
includes
knowledge
this
is
not
a
problem
that
arises
often
when
a
human
is
making
a
single
employment
determination
assuming
disparate
treatment
occurs
in
a
given
case
it
is
generally
either
intended
or
unconscious
what
would
it
mean
to
have
an
employer
know
that
he
was
treating
an
employee
differently
but
still
take
the
action
he
had
always
planned
to
take
without
intent
to
treat
the
employee
differently
it
seems
like
an
impossible
line
to
draw
n
with
data
mining
though
unlike
unconscious
bias
it
is
possible
to
audit
the
resulting
model
and
inform
an
employer
that
she
will
be
treating
individuals
differently
before
she
does
so
if
an
employer
intends
to
employ
the
model
but
knows
it
will
produce
a
disparate
impact
does
she
intend
to
discriminate
this
is
a
more
realistic
parsing
of
intent
and
knowledge
than
in
the
case
of
an
individual
nonsystematic
employment
decision
neither
pretext
nor
motive
exists
here
and
throughout
civil
and
criminal
law
knowledge
and
intent
are
considered
distinct
states
of
mind
so
there
would
likely
be
no
liability
on
the
other
hand
courts
may
use
knowledge
of
discrimination
as
evidence
to
find
intent
n
and
while
the
statute
s
language
only
covers
intentional
discrimination
n
a
broad
definition
of
intent
could
include
knowledge
or
substantial
certainty
of
the
result
n
because
the
situation
has
not
come
up
often
the
extent
of
the
intent
required
is
as
yet
unknown
n
in
sum
aside
from
rational
racism
and
masking
with
some
difficulties
disparate
treatment
doctrine
does
not
appear
to
do
much
to
regulate
discriminatory
data
mining
b
disparate
impact
where
there
is
no
discriminatory
intent
disparate
impact
doctrine
should
be
better
suited
to
finding
liability
for
discrimination
in
data
mining
in
a
disparate
impact
case
a
plaintiff
must
show
that
a
particular
facially
neutral
employment
practice
causes
a
disparate
impact
with
respect
to
a
protected
class
n
if
shown
the
defendant
employer
may
demonstrate
that
the
challenged
practice
is
job
related
for
the
position
in
question
and
consistent
with
business
necessity
n
if
the
defendant
makes
a
successful
showing
to
that
effect
the
plaintiff
may
still
win
by
showing
that
the
employer
could
have
used
an
alternative
employment
practice
with
less
discriminatory
results
n
the
statute
is
unclear
as
to
the
required
showing
for
essentially
every
single
element
of
a
disparate
impact
claim
first
it
is
unclear
how
much
disparate
impact
is
needed
to
make
out
a
prima
facie
case
n
the
eeoc
charged
with
enforcing
title
vii
s
mandate
has
created
the
so
called
four
fifths
rule
as
a
presumption
of
adverse
impact
a
selection
rate
for
any
race
sex
or
ethnic
group
which
is
less
than
four
fifths
of
the
rate
for
the
group
with
the
highest
rate
will
generally
be
regarded
as
evidence
of
adverse
impact
n
the
uniform
guidelines
on
employment
selection
procedures
guidelines
also
state
however
that
smaller
differences
can
constitute
adverse
impact
and
greater
differences
may
not
depending
on
circumstances
thus
the
four
fifths
rule
is
truly
just
a
guideline
n
for
the
purposes
of
this
part
it
is
worthwhile
to
just
assume
that
the
discriminatory
effects
are
prominent
enough
to
establish
disparate
impact
as
an
initial
matter
n
the
next
step
in
the
litigation
is
the
business
necessity
defense
this
defense
is
in
a
very
real
sense
the
crux
of
disparate
impact
analysis
weighing
title
vii
s
competing
goals
of
limiting
the
effects
of
discrimination
while
allowing
employers
discretion
to
advance
important
business
goals
griggs
v
duke
power
co
n
the
decision
establishing
the
business
necessity
defense
alongside
disparate
impact
doctrine
itself
articulated
the
defense
in
several
different
ways
a
challenged
employment
practice
must
be
shown
to
be
related
to
job
performance
have
a
manifest
relationship
to
the
employment
in
question
be
demonstrably
a
reasonable
measure
of
job
performance
bear
some
relationship
to
job
performance
ability
and
or
must
measure
the
person
for
the
job
and
not
the
person
in
the
abstract
n
the
supreme
court
was
not
clear
on
what
if
any
difference
existed
between
job
relatedness
and
business
necessity
at
one
point
seeming
to
use
the
terms
interchangeably
the
touchstone
is
business
necessity
if
an
employment
practice
which
operates
to
exclude
negroes
cannot
be
shown
to
be
related
to
job
performance
the
practice
is
prohibited
n
the
focus
of
the
court
was
clearly
on
future
job
performance
and
the
term
job
related
has
come
to
mean
a
practice
that
is
predictive
of
job
performance
n
because
the
definitions
of
job
relatedness
and
business
necessity
have
never
been
clear
courts
defer
when
applying
the
doctrine
and
finding
the
appropriate
balance
n
originally
the
business
necessity
defense
seemed
to
apply
narrowly
in
griggs
duke
power
had
instituted
new
hiring
requirements
including
a
high
school
diploma
and
success
on
a
general
intelligence
test
for
previously
white
only
divisions
duke
power
did
not
institute
such
requirements
in
divisions
where
it
had
previously
hired
black
employees
n
the
court
ruled
that
the
new
requirements
were
not
a
business
necessity
because
employees
who
have
not
completed
high
school
or
taken
the
tests
have
continued
to
perform
satisfactorily
and
make
progress
in
departments
for
which
the
high
school
and
test
criteria
are
now
used
n
furthermore
the
requirements
were
implemented
without
any
study
of
their
future
effect
n
the
court
also
rejected
the
argument
that
the
requirements
would
improve
the
overall
quality
of
the
workforce
n
by
the
court
began
treating
business
necessity
as
a
much
looser
standard
n
in
new
york
city
transit
authority
v
beazer
n
the
transit
authority
had
implemented
a
rule
barring
drug
users
from
employment
including
current
users
of
methadone
otherwise
known
as
recovering
heroin
addicts
in
dicta
the
court
stated
that
a
narcotics
rule
which
significantly
serves
the
legitimate
employment
goals
of
safety
and
efficiency
was
assuredly
job
related
n
this
was
the
entire
analysis
of
the
business
necessity
defense
in
the
case
moreover
the
rationale
was
acceptable
as
applied
to
the
entire
transit
authority
even
where
only
percent
of
the
jobs
were
labeled
as
safety
sensitive
n
ten
years
later
the
court
made
the
business
necessity
doctrine
even
more
defendant
friendly
in
wards
cove
packing
co
v
atonio
n
after
wards
cove
the
business
necessity
defense
required
a
court
to
engage
in
a
reasoned
review
of
the
employer
s
justification
for
his
use
of
the
challenged
practice
t
here
is
no
requirement
that
the
challenged
practice
be
essential
or
indispensable
to
the
employer
s
business
for
it
to
pass
muster
n
the
court
also
reallocated
the
burden
to
plaintiffs
to
prove
that
business
necessity
was
lacking
and
even
referred
to
the
defense
as
a
business
justification
rather
than
a
business
necessity
n
the
wards
cove
court
went
so
far
that
congress
directly
addressed
the
decision
in
the
civil
rights
act
of
act
which
codified
disparate
impact
and
reset
the
standards
to
the
day
before
wards
cove
was
decided
n
because
the
substantive
standards
for
job
relatedness
or
business
necessity
were
uncertain
before
wards
cove
however
the
confusion
persisted
even
after
the
act
was
passed
n
at
the
time
both
sides
civil
rights
groups
and
the
bush
administration
proponents
of
a
rigorous
and
more
lenient
business
necessity
defense
respectively
declared
victory
n
since
then
courts
have
recognized
that
business
necessity
lies
somewhere
in
the
middle
of
two
extremes
n
some
courts
require
that
the
hiring
criteria
bear
a
manifest
relationship
n
to
the
employment
in
question
or
that
they
be
significantly
correlated
to
job
performance
n
the
third
circuit
was
briefly
an
outlier
holding
that
hiring
criteria
must
effectively
measure
the
minimum
qualifications
for
successful
performance
of
the
job
in
order
to
meet
the
strict
business
necessity
standard
n
this
tougher
standard
would
as
a
practical
matter
ban
general
aptitude
tests
with
any
disparate
impact
because
a
particular
cutoff
score
cannot
be
shown
to
distinguish
between
those
able
and
completely
unable
to
do
the
work
n
for
example
other
unmeasured
skills
and
abilities
could
theoretically
compensate
for
the
lower
score
on
an
aptitude
test
rendering
a
certain
minimum
score
not
necessary
if
it
does
not
measure
minimum
qualifications
n
in
a
subsequent
case
however
the
third
circuit
recognized
that
title
vii
does
not
require
an
employer
to
choose
someone
less
qualified
as
opposed
to
unqualified
in
the
name
of
nondiscrimination
and
noted
that
aptitude
tests
can
be
legitimate
hiring
tools
if
they
accurately
measure
a
person
s
qualifications
n
the
court
concluded
putting
these
standards
together
then
we
require
that
employers
show
that
a
discriminatory
hiring
policy
accurately
but
not
perfectly
ascertains
an
applicant
s
ability
to
perform
successfully
the
job
in
question
in
addition
title
vii
allows
the
employer
to
hire
the
applicant
most
likely
to
perform
the
job
successfully
over
others
less
likely
to
do
so
n
thus
all
circuits
seem
to
accept
varying
levels
of
job
relatedness
rather
than
strict
business
necessity
n
the
last
piece
of
the
disparate
impact
test
is
the
alternative
employment
practice
prong
shortly
after
griggs
the
supreme
court
decided
albemarle
paper
co
v
moody
holding
in
part
that
i
f
an
employer
does
then
meet
the
burden
of
proving
that
its
tests
are
job
related
it
remains
open
to
the
complaining
party
to
show
that
other
tests
or
selection
devices
without
a
similarly
undesirable
racial
effect
would
also
serve
the
employer
s
legitimate
interest
in
efficient
and
trustworthy
workmanship
n
this
burden
shifting
scheme
was
codified
in
the
act
as
the
alternative
employment
practice
requirement
n
congress
did
not
define
the
phrase
and
its
substantive
meaning
remains
uncertain
wards
cove
was
the
first
case
to
use
the
specific
phrase
so
congress
s
instruction
to
reset
the
law
to
the
pre
wards
cove
standard
is
particularly
perplexing
n
the
best
interpretation
is
most
likely
albemarle
s
reference
to
other
tests
or
selection
devices
without
a
similarly
undesirable
racial
effect
n
but
this
interpretation
is
slightly
odd
because
in
albemarle
business
necessity
was
still
somewhat
strict
and
it
is
hard
to
imagine
a
business
practice
that
is
necessary
while
there
exists
a
less
discriminatory
alternative
that
is
just
as
effective
n
if
business
necessity
or
job
relatedness
is
a
less
stringent
requirement
though
then
the
presence
of
the
alternative
employment
practice
requirement
does
at
least
give
it
some
teeth
now
return
to
data
mining
for
now
assume
a
court
does
not
apply
the
strict
business
necessity
standard
but
has
some
variation
of
job
related
in
mind
as
all
federal
appellate
courts
do
today
n
the
threshold
issue
is
clearly
whether
the
sought
after
trait
the
target
variable
is
job
related
regardless
of
the
machinery
used
to
predict
it
if
the
target
variable
is
not
sufficiently
job
related
a
business
necessity
defense
would
fail
regardless
of
the
fact
that
the
decision
was
made
by
algorithm
thus
disparate
impact
liability
can
be
found
for
improper
care
in
target
variable
definition
for
example
it
would
be
difficult
for
an
employer
to
justify
an
adverse
determination
based
on
the
appearance
of
an
advertisement
suggesting
a
criminal
record
alongside
the
search
results
for
a
candidate
s
name
sweeney
found
such
a
search
to
have
a
disparate
impact
n
and
the
eeoc
and
several
federal
courts
have
interpreted
title
vii
to
prohibit
discrimination
on
the
sole
basis
of
criminal
record
unless
there
is
a
specific
reason
the
particular
conviction
is
related
to
the
job
n
this
is
true
independent
of
the
fact
that
the
disparity
is
an
artifact
of
third
party
bias
all
that
matters
is
whether
the
target
variable
is
job
related
in
the
end
though
because
determining
that
a
business
practice
is
not
job
related
actually
requires
a
normative
determination
that
it
is
instead
discriminatory
courts
tend
to
accept
most
common
business
practices
for
which
an
employer
has
a
plausible
story
n
once
a
target
variable
is
established
as
job
related
the
first
question
is
whether
the
model
is
predictive
of
that
trait
the
nature
of
data
mining
suggests
that
this
will
be
the
case
data
mining
is
designed
entirely
to
predict
future
outcomes
and
if
seeking
a
job
related
trait
future
job
performance
one
commentator
lamented
that
f
ederal
case
law
has
shifted
from
a
prospective
view
of
meritocracy
to
a
retrospective
view
thereby
weakening
disparate
impact
law
n
the
author
meant
that
in
griggs
the
court
recognized
that
education
and
other
external
factors
were
unequal
and
therefore
discounted
a
measure
of
meritocracy
that
looked
to
past
achievements
in
favor
of
comparing
the
likelihood
of
future
ones
but
by
the
time
the
court
had
decided
wards
cove
it
had
shifted
to
a
model
of
retrospective
meritocracy
that
presumed
the
legitimacy
of
past
credentials
thus
upholding
the
status
quo
n
while
data
mining
must
take
the
past
represented
by
the
training
data
as
given
it
generates
predictions
about
workplace
success
that
are
much
more
accurate
than
predictions
based
on
those
past
credentials
that
disparate
impact
doctrine
has
come
to
accept
n
in
a
hypothetical
perfect
case
of
data
mining
the
available
information
would
be
rich
enough
that
reliance
on
the
past
information
would
fully
predict
future
performance
thus
robust
data
mining
would
likely
satisfy
even
the
griggs
court
s
standard
that
the
models
are
looking
toward
future
job
performance
not
merely
past
credentials
the
second
question
asks
whether
the
model
adequately
predicts
what
it
is
supposed
to
predict
in
the
traditional
context
this
question
arises
in
the
case
of
general
aptitude
tests
that
might
end
up
measuring
unrelated
elements
of
cultural
awareness
rather
than
intelligence
n
this
is
where
the
different
data
mining
mechanisms
for
discriminatory
effects
matter
part
i
posited
that
proxy
discrimination
optimizes
correctly
so
if
it
evidences
a
disparate
impact
it
reflects
unequal
distribution
of
relevant
traits
in
the
real
world
therefore
proxy
discrimination
will
be
as
good
a
job
predictor
as
possible
given
the
current
shape
of
society
models
trained
on
biased
samples
and
mislabeled
examples
on
the
other
hand
will
result
in
correspondingly
skewed
assessments
rather
than
reflect
real
world
disparities
the
same
effect
may
be
present
in
models
that
rely
on
insufficiently
rich
or
insufficiently
granular
datasets
by
designation
they
do
not
reflect
reality
these
models
might
or
might
not
be
considered
job
related
depending
on
whether
the
errors
distort
the
outcomes
enough
that
the
models
are
no
longer
good
predictors
of
job
performance
the
guidelines
have
set
forth
validation
procedures
intended
to
create
a
job
relatedness
standard
quantifiable
tests
that
have
a
disparate
impact
must
be
validated
according
to
the
procedures
in
the
guidelines
if
possible
otherwise
a
presumption
arises
that
they
are
not
job
related
n
under
the
guidelines
a
showing
of
validity
takes
one
of
three
forms
criterion
related
content
or
construct
n
criterion
related
validity
consist
s
of
empirical
data
demonstrating
that
the
selection
procedure
is
predictive
of
or
significantly
correlated
with
important
elements
of
job
performance
n
the
relationship
between
performance
on
the
procedure
and
performance
on
the
criterion
measure
is
statistically
significant
at
the
level
of
significance
n
content
validity
refers
to
testing
skills
or
abilities
that
generally
are
or
have
been
learned
on
the
job
though
not
those
that
could
be
acquired
in
a
brief
orientation
n
construct
validity
refers
to
a
test
designed
to
measure
some
innate
human
trait
such
as
honesty
a
user
of
a
construct
should
show
by
empirical
evidence
that
the
selection
procedure
is
validly
related
to
the
construct
and
that
the
construct
is
validly
related
to
the
performance
of
critical
or
important
work
behavior
s
n
as
a
statistical
predictive
measure
a
data
mining
model
could
be
validated
by
either
criterion
related
or
construct
validity
depending
on
the
trait
being
sought
either
way
there
must
be
statistical
significance
showing
that
the
result
of
the
model
correlates
to
the
trait
which
was
already
determined
to
be
an
important
element
of
job
performance
this
is
an
exceedingly
low
bar
for
data
mining
because
data
mining
s
predictions
necessarily
rest
on
demonstrated
statistical
relationships
data
mining
will
likely
only
be
used
if
it
is
actually
predictive
of
something
so
the
business
necessity
defense
solely
comes
down
to
whether
the
trait
sought
is
important
enough
to
job
performance
to
justify
its
use
in
any
context
even
assuming
the
guidelines
validation
requirement
is
a
hurdle
for
data
mining
some
courts
ignore
the
guidelines
recommendation
that
an
unvalidated
procedure
be
rejected
preferring
to
rely
on
common
sense
or
finding
a
manifest
relationship
between
the
criteria
and
successful
job
performance
n
moreover
it
is
possible
that
the
supreme
court
inadvertently
overruled
the
guidelines
in
in
ricci
v
destefano
a
case
that
will
be
discussed
in
greater
detail
in
part
iii
b
the
court
found
no
genuine
dispute
that
the
tests
at
issue
met
the
job
related
and
business
necessity
standards
n
despite
not
having
been
validated
under
the
guidelines
and
despite
the
employer
actively
denying
that
they
could
be
validated
n
while
the
business
necessity
defense
was
not
directly
at
issue
in
ricci
o
n
the
spectrum
between
heavier
and
lighter
burdens
of
justification
the
court
came
down
decidedly
in
favor
of
a
lighter
burden
n
thus
there
is
good
reason
to
believe
that
any
or
all
of
the
data
mining
models
predicated
on
legitimately
job
related
traits
pass
muster
under
the
business
necessity
defense
models
trained
on
biased
samples
mislabeled
examples
and
limited
features
however
might
trigger
liability
under
the
alternative
employment
practice
prong
if
a
plaintiff
can
show
that
an
alternative
less
discriminatory
practice
that
accomplishes
the
same
goals
exists
and
that
the
employer
refuses
to
use
it
the
employer
can
be
found
liable
in
this
case
a
plaintiff
could
argue
that
the
obvious
alternative
employment
practice
would
be
to
fix
the
problems
with
the
models
fixing
the
models
however
is
not
a
trivial
task
for
example
in
the
linkedin
hypothetical
where
the
demonstrated
interest
in
different
kinds
of
employees
reflects
employers
prejudice
linkedin
is
the
party
that
determines
the
algorithm
by
which
the
discrimination
occurs
in
this
case
based
on
reacting
to
third
party
preferences
if
an
employer
were
to
act
on
the
recommendations
suggested
by
the
linkedin
recommendation
engine
there
would
not
be
much
he
could
do
to
make
it
less
reflective
of
third
party
prejudice
aside
from
calling
linkedin
and
asking
nicely
thus
it
could
not
really
be
said
that
the
employer
refuses
to
use
an
alternative
employment
practice
the
employer
could
either
use
the
third
party
tool
or
not
similarly
it
might
be
possible
to
fix
an
app
like
street
bump
that
suffers
from
reporting
bias
but
the
employer
would
need
access
to
the
raw
input
data
in
order
to
do
so
n
in
the
case
of
insufficiently
rich
or
granular
features
the
employer
would
need
to
collect
more
data
in
order
to
make
the
model
more
discerning
but
collecting
more
data
can
be
time
consuming
and
costly
n
if
not
impossible
for
legal
or
technical
reasons
moreover
the
under
and
overrepresentation
of
members
of
protected
classes
in
data
is
not
always
evident
nor
is
the
mechanism
by
which
such
under
or
overrepresentation
occurs
the
idea
that
the
representation
of
different
social
groups
in
the
dataset
can
be
brought
into
proportions
that
better
match
those
in
the
real
world
presumes
that
analysts
have
some
independent
mechanism
for
determining
these
proportions
thus
there
are
several
hurdles
to
finding
disparate
impact
liability
for
models
employing
data
that
under
or
overrepresents
members
of
protected
classes
the
plaintiff
must
prove
that
the
employer
created
or
has
access
to
the
model
can
discover
that
there
is
discriminatory
effect
and
can
discover
the
particular
mechanism
by
which
that
effect
operates
the
same
can
be
said
for
models
with
insufficiently
rich
feature
sets
clearly
there
are
times
when
more
features
would
improve
an
otherwise
discriminatory
outcome
but
it
is
almost
by
definition
hard
to
know
which
features
are
going
to
make
the
model
more
or
less
discriminatory
indeed
it
is
often
impossible
to
know
which
features
are
missing
because
data
miners
do
not
operate
with
causal
relationships
in
mind
so
while
theoretically
a
less
discriminatory
alternative
would
almost
always
exist
proving
it
would
be
difficult
there
is
yet
another
hurdle
neither
congress
nor
courts
have
specified
what
it
means
for
an
employer
to
refuse
to
adopt
the
less
discriminatory
procedure
scholars
have
suggested
that
perhaps
the
employer
cannot
be
held
liable
until
it
has
considered
the
alternative
and
rejected
it
n
thus
if
the
employer
has
run
an
expensive
data
collection
and
analysis
operation
without
ever
being
made
aware
of
its
any
discriminatory
tendencies
and
the
employer
cannot
afford
to
re
run
the
entire
operation
is
the
employer
refusing
to
use
a
less
discriminatory
alternative
or
does
one
simply
not
exist
how
much
would
the
error
correction
have
to
cost
an
employer
before
it
is
not
seen
as
a
refusal
to
use
the
procedure
n
should
the
statute
actually
be
interpreted
to
mean
that
an
employer
unreasonably
refuses
to
use
an
alternative
employment
practice
these
are
all
difficult
questions
but
suffice
it
to
say
the
prospect
of
winning
a
data
mining
discrimination
case
on
alternative
employment
practice
grounds
seems
slim
the
third
and
final
consideration
regarding
disparate
impact
liability
for
data
mining
is
whether
a
court
or
congress
might
reinvigorate
strict
business
necessity
n
in
that
case
things
look
a
little
better
for
plaintiffs
bringing
disparate
impact
claims
where
an
employer
models
job
tenure
n
for
example
a
court
may
be
inclined
to
hold
that
it
is
job
related
because
the
model
is
a
legitimate
non
discriminatory
business
objective
n
but
it
is
clearly
not
necessary
to
the
job
the
same
reasoning
applies
to
mining
for
any
single
trait
that
is
job
related
the
practice
of
data
mining
is
not
focused
on
discovering
make
or
break
skills
unless
the
employer
can
show
that
below
the
cut
score
employees
cannot
do
the
work
then
the
strict
business
necessity
defense
will
fail
thus
disparate
impact
that
occurs
as
an
artifact
of
the
problem
specification
stage
can
potentially
be
addressed
by
strict
business
necessity
this
reasoning
is
undermined
though
where
employers
do
not
mine
for
a
single
trait
but
automate
their
decision
process
by
modeling
job
performance
on
a
holistic
measure
of
what
makes
good
employees
if
employers
determine
traits
of
a
good
employee
by
simple
ratings
and
use
data
mining
to
appropriately
divine
good
employees
characteristics
among
several
different
variables
then
the
argument
that
the
model
does
not
account
for
certain
skills
that
could
compensate
for
the
employee
s
failings
loses
its
force
taken
to
an
extreme
an
feature
holistic
determination
of
a
good
employee
would
still
not
be
strictly
necessary
holding
a
business
to
such
a
standard
however
would
simply
be
forbidding
that
business
from
ranking
candidates
if
any
disparate
impact
results
thus
while
the
strict
business
necessity
defense
could
prevent
myopic
employers
from
creating
disparate
impacts
by
their
choice
of
target
variable
it
would
still
not
address
forms
of
data
mining
that
model
general
job
performance
rather
than
predict
specific
traits
disparate
impact
doctrine
was
created
to
address
unintentional
discrimination
but
it
strikes
a
delicate
balance
between
allowing
businesses
the
leeway
to
make
legitimate
business
judgments
and
preventing
artificial
arbitrary
and
unnecessary
discrimination
n
successful
data
mining
operations
will
often
both
predict
future
job
performance
and
have
some
disparate
impact
unless
the
plaintiff
can
find
an
alternative
employment
practice
to
realistically
point
to
a
tie
goes
to
the
employer
c
masking
and
problems
of
proof
masking
poses
separate
problems
for
finding
title
vii
liability
as
discussed
earlier
there
is
no
theoretical
problem
with
finding
liability
for
masking
n
it
is
a
disparate
treatment
violation
as
clear
as
any
but
like
traditional
forms
of
intentional
discrimination
it
suffers
from
difficulties
of
proof
while
finding
intent
from
stray
remarks
or
other
circumstantial
evidence
is
challenging
in
any
scenario
masking
presents
additional
complications
for
detection
data
mining
allows
employers
who
wish
to
discriminate
on
the
basis
of
a
protected
class
to
disclaim
any
knowledge
of
the
protected
class
in
the
first
instance
while
simultaneously
inferring
such
details
from
the
data
an
employer
may
want
to
discriminate
by
using
proxies
for
protected
classes
such
as
in
the
case
of
redlining
n
due
to
housing
segregation
neighborhood
is
a
good
proxy
for
race
and
can
be
used
to
redline
candidates
without
reference
to
race
n
this
is
a
relatively
unsophisticated
example
however
it
is
possible
that
some
combination
of
musical
tastes
n
stored
likes
on
facebook
n
and
network
of
friends
n
will
reliably
predict
membership
in
protected
classes
an
employer
can
use
these
traits
to
discriminate
by
setting
up
future
models
to
sort
by
these
items
and
then
disclaim
any
knowledge
of
such
proxy
manipulation
more
generally
as
discussed
in
part
i
any
of
the
mechanisms
by
which
unintentional
discrimination
can
occur
can
also
be
employed
intentionally
the
example
described
above
is
intentional
discrimination
by
proxy
but
it
is
also
possible
to
intentionally
bias
the
data
collection
process
purposefully
mislabel
examples
or
deliberately
use
an
insufficiently
rich
set
of
features
n
though
some
of
these
would
probably
require
a
great
deal
of
sophistication
these
methods
of
intentional
discrimination
will
look
for
all
intents
and
purposes
identical
to
the
unintentional
discrimination
that
can
result
from
data
mining
therefore
detecting
discrimination
in
the
first
instance
will
require
the
same
techniques
as
detecting
unintentional
discrimination
namely
a
disparate
impact
analysis
further
assuming
there
is
no
circumstantial
evidence
like
an
employer
s
stray
remarks
with
which
to
prove
intent
a
plaintiff
might
attempt
to
prove
intent
by
demonstrating
that
the
employer
is
using
less
representative
data
poorer
examples
or
fewer
and
less
granular
features
than
he
might
otherwise
use
were
he
interested
in
the
best
possible
candidate
that
is
one
could
show
that
the
neutral
employment
practice
is
a
pretext
by
demonstrating
that
there
is
a
more
predictive
alternative
this
looks
like
disparate
impact
analysis
a
plaintiff
proving
masked
intentional
discrimination
asks
the
same
question
as
in
the
alternative
employment
practice
prong
whether
there
were
more
relevant
measures
the
employer
could
have
used
n
but
the
business
necessity
defense
is
not
available
in
a
disparate
treatment
case
n
so
alternative
employment
practice
is
not
the
appropriate
analysis
scholars
have
noted
though
that
the
line
between
disparate
treatment
and
disparate
impact
in
traditional
title
vii
cases
is
not
always
clear
n
and
sometimes
employer
actions
can
be
legitimately
categorized
as
either
or
both
n
as
professor
george
rutherglen
has
pointed
out
concrete
issues
of
proof
more
than
any
abstract
theory
reveal
the
fundamental
similarity
between
claims
of
intentional
discrimination
and
those
of
disparate
impact
the
evidence
submitted
to
prove
one
kind
of
claim
invariably
can
be
used
to
support
the
other
n
rutherglen
s
point
is
exactly
what
must
happen
in
the
data
mining
context
disparate
treatment
and
disparate
impact
become
essentially
the
same
thing
from
an
evidentiary
perspective
to
the
extent
that
disparate
impact
and
treatment
are
in
reality
different
theories
they
are
often
confused
for
each
other
plaintiffs
will
raise
both
types
of
claims
as
a
catch
all
because
they
cannot
be
sure
on
which
theory
they
might
win
so
both
theories
will
be
in
play
in
a
given
case
n
as
a
result
courts
often
seek
evidence
of
state
of
mind
in
disparate
impact
cases
n
and
objective
statistical
evidence
in
disparate
treatment
cases
n
assuming
the
two
theories
are
not
functionally
the
same
using
the
same
evidence
for
disparate
treatment
and
disparate
impact
will
only
lead
to
more
confusion
and
as
a
result
more
uncertainty
within
the
courts
thus
despite
its
clear
nature
as
a
theoretical
violation
it
is
less
clear
that
a
plaintiff
will
be
able
to
win
a
masking
disparate
treatment
case
a
final
point
is
that
traditionally
employers
who
do
not
want
to
discriminate
go
to
great
lengths
to
avoid
raising
the
prospect
that
they
have
violated
the
law
thus
they
tend
to
avoid
collecting
information
about
attributes
that
reveal
an
individual
s
membership
in
a
protected
class
employers
even
pay
third
parties
to
collect
relatively
easy
to
find
information
on
job
applicants
such
as
professional
honors
and
awards
as
well
as
compromising
photos
videos
or
membership
in
online
groups
so
that
the
third
party
can
send
back
a
version
of
the
report
that
remove
s
references
to
a
person
s
religion
race
marital
status
disability
and
other
information
protected
under
federal
employment
laws
n
this
allows
employers
to
honestly
disclaim
any
knowledge
of
the
protected
information
nonetheless
if
an
employer
seeks
to
discriminate
according
to
protected
classes
she
would
be
able
to
infer
class
membership
from
the
data
thus
employers
old
defense
to
suspicion
of
discrimination
that
they
did
not
even
see
the
information
is
no
longer
adequate
to
separate
would
be
intentional
discriminators
from
employers
that
do
not
intend
to
discriminate
iii
the
difficulty
for
reforms
while
each
of
the
mechanisms
for
discrimination
in
data
mining
presents
difficulties
for
title
vii
as
currently
written
there
are
also
certain
obstacles
to
reforming
title
vii
to
address
the
resulting
problems
computer
scientists
and
others
are
working
on
technical
remedies
n
so
to
say
that
there
are
problems
with
legal
remedies
does
not
suggest
that
the
problems
with
discrimination
in
data
mining
cannot
be
solved
at
all
nonetheless
this
part
focuses
on
the
legal
aspects
as
it
illustrates
even
assuming
that
the
political
will
to
reform
title
vii
exists
potential
legal
solutions
are
not
straightforward
this
part
discusses
two
types
of
difficulties
with
reforming
title
vii
first
there
are
issues
internal
to
the
data
mining
process
that
make
legal
reform
difficult
for
example
the
subjectivity
in
defining
a
good
employee
is
unavoidable
but
at
the
same
time
some
answers
are
clearly
less
discriminatory
than
others
n
how
does
one
draw
that
line
can
employers
gain
access
to
the
additional
data
necessary
to
correct
for
collection
bias
how
much
will
it
cost
them
to
find
it
how
do
we
identify
the
correct
baseline
historical
data
to
avoid
reproducing
past
prejudice
or
the
correct
level
of
detail
and
granularity
in
a
dataset
before
laws
can
be
reformed
policy
level
answers
to
these
basic
technical
philosophical
and
economic
questions
need
to
be
addressed
at
least
to
some
degree
second
reform
will
face
political
and
constitutional
constraints
external
to
the
logic
of
data
mining
that
will
affect
how
title
vii
can
be
permissibly
reformed
to
address
it
not
all
of
the
mechanisms
for
discrimination
seem
to
be
amenable
to
procedural
remedies
if
that
holds
true
only
after
the
fact
reweighting
of
results
may
be
able
to
compensate
for
the
discriminatory
outcomes
this
is
not
a
matter
of
missing
legislation
it
is
a
matter
of
practical
reality
unfortunately
while
in
many
cases
no
procedural
remedy
will
be
sufficient
any
attempt
to
design
a
legislative
or
judicial
remedy
premised
on
reallocation
of
employment
outcomes
will
not
survive
long
in
the
current
political
or
constitutional
climate
as
it
raises
the
specter
of
affirmative
action
politically
anything
that
even
hints
at
affirmative
action
is
a
nonstarter
today
and
to
the
extent
that
it
is
permissible
to
enact
such
policies
their
future
constitutionality
is
in
doubt
n
a
internal
difficulties
defining
the
target
variable
settling
on
a
target
variable
is
a
necessarily
subjective
exercise
n
disputes
over
the
superiority
of
competing
definitions
are
often
insoluble
because
the
target
variables
are
themselves
incommensurable
there
are
of
course
easier
cases
where
prejudice
or
carelessness
leads
to
definitions
that
subject
members
of
protected
classes
to
avoidably
high
rates
of
adverse
determinations
but
most
cases
are
likely
to
involve
genuine
business
disagreements
over
ideal
definitions
with
each
having
a
potentially
greater
or
lesser
impact
on
protected
classes
there
is
no
stable
ground
upon
which
to
judge
the
relative
merits
of
definitions
because
they
often
reflect
competing
ideas
about
the
very
nature
of
the
problem
at
issue
n
as
professor
oscar
gandy
has
argued
c
ertain
kind
s
of
biases
are
inherent
in
the
selection
of
the
goals
or
objective
functions
that
automated
systems
will
be
designed
to
support
n
there
is
no
escape
from
this
situation
a
target
variable
must
reflect
judgments
about
what
really
is
the
problem
at
issue
in
making
hiring
decisions
for
certain
employers
it
might
be
rather
obvious
that
the
problem
is
one
of
reducing
the
administrative
costs
associated
with
turnover
and
training
for
others
it
might
be
improving
sales
for
still
others
it
might
be
increasing
innovation
any
argument
for
the
superiority
of
one
target
variable
over
the
other
will
simply
make
appeals
to
competing
and
incommensurate
values
for
these
same
reasons
however
defining
the
target
variable
also
offers
an
opportunity
for
creative
thinking
about
the
potentially
infinite
number
of
ways
of
making
sound
hiring
decisions
data
miners
can
experiment
with
multiple
definitions
that
each
seem
to
serve
the
same
goal
even
if
these
fall
short
of
what
they
themselves
consider
ideal
in
principle
employers
should
rely
on
proxies
that
are
maximally
proximate
to
the
actual
skills
demanded
of
the
job
while
there
should
be
a
tight
nexus
between
the
sought
after
features
and
these
skills
this
may
not
be
possible
for
practical
and
economic
reasons
this
leaves
data
miners
in
a
position
to
dream
up
many
different
nonideal
ways
to
make
hiring
decisions
that
may
have
a
greater
or
less
adverse
impact
on
protected
classes
the
second
circuit
considered
such
an
approach
in
hayden
v
county
of
nassau
n
in
hayden
the
county
s
goal
was
to
find
a
police
entrance
exam
that
was
valid
yet
minimized
the
adverse
impact
on
minority
applicants
n
the
county
thus
administered
an
exam
with
twenty
five
parts
that
could
be
scored
independently
by
design
a
statistically
valid
result
could
be
achieved
by
one
of
several
configurations
that
counted
only
a
portion
of
the
test
sections
without
requiring
all
of
them
n
the
county
ended
up
using
nine
of
the
sections
as
a
compromise
after
rejecting
one
configuration
that
was
more
advantageous
to
minority
applicants
but
less
statistically
sound
n
this
is
a
clear
example
of
defining
a
problem
in
such
a
way
that
it
becomes
possible
to
reduce
the
disparate
impact
without
compromising
the
accuracy
of
the
assessment
mechanism
training
data
a
labeling
examples
any
solution
to
the
problems
presented
by
labeling
must
be
a
compromise
between
a
rule
that
forbids
employers
from
relying
on
past
discrimination
and
one
that
allows
them
to
base
hiring
decisions
on
historical
examples
of
good
employees
in
theory
a
rule
that
forbids
employers
from
modeling
decisions
based
on
historical
examples
tainted
by
prejudice
would
address
the
problem
of
improper
labeling
but
if
the
only
examples
an
employer
has
to
draw
on
are
those
of
past
employees
who
had
been
subject
to
discrimination
all
learned
rules
will
recapitulate
this
discrimination
title
vii
has
always
had
to
balance
its
mandate
to
eliminate
discrimination
in
the
workplace
with
employers
legitimate
discretion
for
example
one
of
the
most
common
selection
procedures
that
explicitly
reproduced
past
discrimination
was
seniority
n
seniority
was
and
is
still
often
a
legitimate
metric
for
promotion
and
is
especially
important
in
collective
bargaining
after
the
passage
of
title
vii
however
seniority
was
also
often
used
to
keep
black
people
from
advancing
to
better
jobs
because
they
had
not
been
hired
until
title
vii
forced
employers
to
hire
them
n
despite
this
obvious
problem
with
seniority
title
vii
contains
an
explicit
carve
out
for
bona
fide
seniority
or
merit
system
s
n
as
a
result
the
supreme
court
has
held
that
absent
a
discriminatory
purpose
the
operation
of
a
seniority
system
cannot
be
an
unlawful
employment
practice
even
if
the
system
has
some
discriminatory
consequences
n
given
the
inherent
tension
between
ensuring
that
past
discrimination
is
not
reproduced
in
future
decisions
and
permitting
employers
legitimate
discretion
it
should
be
unsurprising
that
when
translated
to
data
mining
the
problem
is
not
amenable
to
a
clear
solution
in
fact
this
difficulty
is
even
more
central
to
data
mining
data
miners
who
attempt
to
remove
the
influence
of
prejudice
on
prior
decisions
by
recoding
or
relabeling
examples
may
find
that
they
cannot
easily
resolve
what
the
nonprejudicial
determination
would
have
been
as
calders
and

out
t
he
notion
of
what

the
correct

fuzzy
n
employers
are
unlikely
to
have
perfectly
objective
and
exhaustive
standards
for
hiring
indeed
part
of
the
hiring
process
is
purposefully
subjective
at
the
same
time
employers
are
unlikely
to
have
discriminated
so
completely
in
the
past
that
the
only
explanation
for
rejecting
an
applicant
was
membership
in
protected
classes
this
leaves
data
miners
tasked
with
correcting
for
prior
prejudice
with
the
impossible
challenge
of
determining
what
the
correct
subjective
employment
decision
would
have
been
absent
prejudice
undoing
the
imprint
of
prejudice
on
the
data
may
demand
a
complete
rerendering
of
the
biased
decisions
rather
than
simply
adjusting
those
decisions
according
to
some
fixed
statistical
measure
b

although
there
are
some
cases
with
obviously
skewed
datasets
that
are
relatively
easy
to
identify
and

n
street
bump

from
a
visually
evident
bias
when
the

was
plotted
on

boston

therefore
able
to
partner
with
a
range
of
academics
to
take
into
account
issues
of
equitable

and
digital
divides
n
in
many
cases
however
an
analyst
can
only
determine
the
extent
of
and
correct
for
unintentional
discrimination
that
results
from
reporting
sampling
and
selection
biases
if
the
analyst
has
access
to
information
that
somehow
reveals
misrepresentations
of
protected

in
the

often
there
may
be
no
practical
alternative
method
for
collecting
information
that
would
even
reveal
the
existence
of
a

any
attempt
to
correct
for
collection
bias
immediately
confronts
the
problem
of
whether
or
not
the
employer
recognizes
the
specific
type
of
bias
that
is
producing
disparate
results
then
in
order
to
correct
for
it
an
employer
must
have
access
to
the
underlying
data
and
often
an
ability
to
collect
more
where
more
data
is
clearly
not
accessible
data
miners
can
proactively
compensate
for
some
of
the
bias
by
oversampling
underrepresented
communities
n
if
the
employer
fails
to
be
proactive
or
tries
and
fails
to
detect
the
bias
that
causes
the
disparate
impact
liability
is
an
open
question
as
discussed
in
part
ii
b
liability
partly
depends
on
how
liberally
a
court
interprets
the
requirement
that
an
employer
refuses
to
use
an
alternative
scheme
n
even
a
liberal
interpretation
though
would
require
evidence
of
the
particular
type
of
discrimination
at
issue
coupled
with
evidence
that
such
an
alternative
scheme
exists
thus
finding
liability
seems
unlikely
worse
where
such
showing
is
possible
there
may
be
no
easy
or
obvious
way
to
remedy
the
situation
to
address
collection
bias
directly
an
employer
or
an
auditor
must
have
access
to
the
underlying
data
and
the
ability
to
adjust
the
model
congress
could
require
this
directly
of
any
employer
using
data
mining
techniques
some
employers
are
investing
in
their
own
data
now
and
could
potentially
meet
such
requirements
n
but
employers
also
seem
happy
to
rely
on
models
developed
and
administered
by
third
parties
who
may
have
a
far
greater
set
of
examples
and
far
richer
data
than
any
individual
company
n
furthermore
due
to
economies
of
scale
that
are
especially
important
in
data
analysis
one
can
imagine
that
third
parties
specializing
in
work
force
science
will
be
able
to
offer
employers
this
service
much
less
expensively
than
they
could
manage
it
themselves
if
congress
attempted
to
demand
that
employers
have
access
to
the
data
it
would
face
strong
resistance
from
the
ever
growing
data
analysis
industry
whose
business
depends
on
the
proprietary
nature
of
the
amassed
information
more
likely
congress
could
require
audits
by
a
third
party
like
the
eeoc
or
a
private
auditor
in
order
to
protect
trade
secrets
but
this
still
seems
a
tall
task
ultimately
because
proactive
oversampling
and
retroactive
data
correction
are
at
least
possible
collection
bias
has
the
most
promising
prospects
for
a
workable
remedy
of
any
of
the
identified
data
mining
mechanisms
feature
selection
even
in
the
absence
of
prejudice
or
bias
determining
the
proper
degree
of
precision
in
the
distinctions
drawn
through
data
mining
can
be
extremely
difficult
under
formal
disparate
treatment
this
is
straightforward
any
decision
that
expressly
classifies
by
membership
in
a
protected
class
is
one
that
draws
distinctions
on
illegitimate
grounds
it
is
far
less
clear
however
what
constitutes
legitimate
statistical
discrimination
when
individuation
does
not
rely
on
proscribed
criteria
in
these
cases
the
perceived
legitimacy
seems
to
depend
on
a
number
of
factors
whether
the
errors
seem
avoidable
because
gaining
access
to
additional
or
more
granular
data
would
be
trivial
or
would
not
involve
costs
that
outweigh
the
benefits
this
seems
to
suggest
that
the
task
of
evaluating
the
legitimacy
of
feature
selection
can
be
reduced
to
a
rather
straightforward
cost
benefit
analysis
companies
would
have
an
obligation
to
pursue
ever
more
and
more
granular
data
until
the
costs
of
gathering
that
data
exceed
the
benefits
conferred
by
the
marginal
improvements
in
accuracy
unfortunately
as
is
often
the
case
with
cost
benefit
analyses
this
approach
fails
to
consider
how
different
actors
will
perceive
the
value
of
the
supposed
benefits
as
well
as
the
costs
associated
with
errors
the
obvious
version
of
this
criticism
is
that
actuarially
saddled
victims
of
inaccurate
determinations
may
find
cold
comfort
in
the
fact
that
certain
decisions
are
rendered
more
reliably
overall
when
decision
makers
employ
data
mining
n
a
more
sophisticated
version
of
this
criticism
focuses
on
the
way
such
errors
assign
costs
and
benefits
to
different
actors
at
systematically
different
rates
a
model
with
any
error
rate
that
continues
to
turn
a
profit
may
be
acceptable
to
decision
makers
at
a
company
no
matter
the
costs
or
inconvenience
to
specific
customers
n
even
when
companies
are
subject
to
market
pressures
that
would
force
them
to
compete
by
lowering
these
error
rates
the
companies
may
find
that
there
is
simply
no
reason
to
invest
in
efforts
that
do
so
if
the
errors
happen
to
fall
disproportionately
on
especially
unprofitable
groups
of
consumers
furthermore
assessing
data
mining
as
a
matter
of
balancing
costs
and
benefits
leaves
no
room
to
consider
morally
salient
disparities
in
the
degree
to
which
the
costs
are
borne
by
different
social
groups
this
raises
the
prospect
that
there
might
be
systematic
differences
in
the
rates
at
which
members
of
protected
classes
are
subject
to
erroneous
determinations
n
condemning
these
groups
to
bear
the
disproportionate
burden
of
erroneous
determinations
would
strike
many
as
highly
objectionable
despite
greater
accuracy
in
decision
making
for
the
majority
group
n
indeed
simply
accepting
these
cost
differences
as
a
given
would
subject
those
already
in
less
favorable
circumstances
to
less
accurate
determinations
even
if
companies
assume
the
responsibility
for
ensuring
that
members
of
protected
classes
do
not
fall
victim
to
erroneous
determinations
at
systematically
higher
rates
they
could
find
that
increasing
the
resolution
and
range
of
their
analyses
still
fails
to
capture
the
causal
relationships
that
account
for
different
outcomes
because
those
relationships
are
not
easily
represented
in
data
n
in
such
cases
rather
than
reducing
the
error
rate
for
those
in
protected
classes
data
miners
could
structure
their
analyses
to
minimize
the
difference
in
error
rates
between
groups
this
solution
may
involve
some
unattractive
tradeoffs
however
in
reducing
the
disparate
impact
of
errors
it
may
increase
the
overall
amount
of
errors
in
other
words
generating
a
model
that
is
equally
unfair
to
protected
and
unprotected
classes
might
increase
the
overall
amount
of
unfairness
proxies
computer
scientists
have
been
unsure
how
to
deal
with
redundant
encodings
in
datasets
simply
withholding
these
variables
from
the
data
mining
exercise
often
removes
criteria
that
hold
demonstrable
and
justifiable
relevance
to
the
decision
at
hand
as
calders
and
x
d
liobait
x
note
i
t
is
problematic
to
remove
a
correlated
attribute
if
the
attribute
to
be
removed
also
carries
some
objective
information
about
the
label
quality
of
interest
n
part
of
the
problem
seems
to
be
that
there
is
no
obvious
way
to
determine
how
correlated
a
relevant
attribute
must
be
with
class
membership
to
be
worrisome
nor
is
there
a
self
evident
way
to
determine
when
an
attribute
is
sufficiently
relevant
to
justify
its
consideration
despite
its
high
correlation
with
class
membership
as
professors
devin
pope
and
justin
sydnor
explain
v
ariables
are
likely
neither
solely
predictive
nor
purely
proxies
for
omitted
characteristics
n
but
there
is
a
bigger
problem
here
attempting
to
ensure
fairly
rendered
decisions
by
excising
highly
correlated
criteria
only
makes
sense
if
the
disparate
impact
happens
to
be
an
avoidable
artifact
of
a
particular
way
of
rendering
decisions
and
yet
even
when
denied
access
to
these
highly
correlated
criteria
data
mining
may
suggest
alternative
methods
for
rendering
decisions
that
still
result
in
the
same
disparate
impact
focusing
on
isolated
data
points
may
be
a
mistake
because
class
membership
can
be
encoded
in
more
than
one
specific
and
highly
correlated
criterion
indeed
it
is
very
likely
that
class
membership
is
reflected
across
a
number
of
interrelated
data
points
n
but
such
outcomes
might
instead
demonstrate
something
more
unsettling
that
other
relevant
criteria
whatever
they
are
happen
to
be
possessed
at
different
rates
by
members
of
protected
classes
this
explains
why
for
instance
champions
of
predictive
policing
have
responded
to
critics
by
arguing
that
i
f
you
wanted
to
remove

making
accurate
determinations
means
considering
factors
that
are
somehow
correlated
with
proscribed
features
computer
scientists
have
even
shown
that
r
emoving
all
such
correlated
attributes
before
training
does
remove
discrimination
but
with
a
high
cost
in

accuracy
n
this
reveals
a
rather
uncomfortable
truth
the
current
distribution
of
relevant
attributes
attributes
that
can
and
should
be
taken
into
consideration
in
apportioning
opportunities
fairly
is
demonstrably
correlated
with
sensitive
attributes
because
the
sensitive
attributes
have
meaningfully
conditioned
what
relevant
attributes
individuals
happen
to
possess
n
as
such
attempts
to
ensure
procedural
fairness
by
excluding
certain
criteria
from

may
conflict
with
the
imperative
to
ensure
accurate
determinations
the
only
way
to
ensure
that
decisions

not
systematically
disadvantage
members
of

to
reduce
the

data

will
never
be
able
to
fully
disentangle
legitimate
and
proscribed
criteria

the

means
that

violate

opportunity
standards
n
scholars
have
taken
these
cases
as
a
sign
that
the
major
challenge
is
how
to
find
out
which
part
of
information
carried
by
a
sensitive

correlated
attribute
is
sensitive

which
is

n
while
researchers
are
well
aware
that
this
may
not
be
easy
to
resolve
let
alone
formalize
into
a
computable
problem
there
is
a
bigger
challenge
from
a
legal
perspective
any
such
undertaking
would
necessarily
wade
into
the
highly
charged
debate
over
the
degree
to
which
the
relatively
less
favorable
position
of
protected
classes
warrants
the
protection
of
antidiscrimination
law
in
the
first
instance
the
problems
that
render
data
mining
discriminatory
are
very
rarely
amenable
to
obvious
complete
or
welcome
resolution
when
it
comes
to
setting
a
target
variable
and
feature
selection
policy
cannot
lay
out
a
clear
path
to

reducing
the
disparate
impact
will
necessitate
open

exploration
without
any
way
of
knowing
when
analysts
have
exhausted
the
possibility
for

likewise
policies
that
compel
institutions
to
correct
tainted
datasets
or

will
make
impossible
demands
of
analysts
in
most
cases
they
will
not
be
able
to
determine
what
the
objective
determination
should
have
been
or
independently
observe
the
makeup
of
the
entire
population

with
both
of
these
problems
will
ultimately
fall
to
analysts

judgment

that
reduce
the
accuracy
of
decisions

minimize
the

force

to
make

offs

necessary
to
determine
the
appropriate

of
these
imperfect

even
when

voluntarily
adopt

strategies
these
internal
difficulties
will
likely
allow

to
persist

the

there
are
further
political
and
constitutional
restraints
on

inadequacies
with

mining
data
mining
discrimination
will
force
a
confrontation
between
the
two
divergent
principles
underlying
antidiscrimination
law
anticlassification
and
antisubordination
n
which
of
these
two
principles
motivates
discrimination
law
is
a
contentious
debate
and
making
remedies
available
under
antidiscrimination
law
will
require
a
commitment
to
antisubordination
principles
that
have
thus
far
not
been
forthcoming
from
legislatures
this
is
not
merely
a
political
concern
as
substantive
remediation
is
becoming
ever
more
suspect
constitutionally
as
well
n
while
such
remedies
may
be
politically
and
legally
impossible
the
nature
of
data
mining
itself
makes
them
practically
necessary
accordingly
these
external
difficulties
may
prevent
antidiscrimination
law
from
fully
addressing
data
mining
discrimination
two
competing
principles
have
always
undergirded
antidiscrimination
law
anticlassification
and
antisubordination
anticlassification
is
the
narrower
of
the
two
holding
that
the
responsibility
of
the
law
is
to
eliminate
the
unfairness
individuals
in
certain
protected
classes
experience
due
to
decision
makers
choices
n
antisubordination
theory
in
contrast
holds
that
the
goal
of
antidiscrimination
law
is
or
at
least
should
be
to
eliminate
status
based
inequality
due
to
membership
in
those
classes
not
as
a
matter
of
procedure
but
of
substance
n
different
mitigation
policies
effectuate
different
rationales
disparate
treatment
doctrine
arose
first
clearly
aligning
with
the
anticlassification
principle
by
proscribing
intentional
discrimination
in
the
form
of
either
explicit
singling
out
of
protected
classes
for
harm
or
masked
intentional
discrimination
since
disparate
impact
developed
however
there
has
never
been
clarity
as
to
which
of
the
principles
it
is
designed
to
effectuate
n
on
the
one
hand
disparate
impact
doctrine
serves
anticlassification
by
being
an
evidentiary
dragnet
used
to
smoke
out
well
hidden
disparate
treatment
n
on
the
other
hand
as
an
effects
based
doctrine
there
is
good
reason
to
believe
it
was
intended
to
address
substantive
inequality
n
in
this
sense
the
business
necessity
defense
is
a
necessary
backstop
that
prevents
members
of
traditionally
disadvantaged
groups
from
simply
forcing
their
way
in
without
the
necessary
skills
or
abilities
n
thus
the
mapping
from
anticlassification
and
antisubordination
to
disparate
treatment
and
disparate
impact
was
never
clean
early
critics
of
civil
rights
laws
actually
complained
that
proscribing
consideration
of
protected
class
was
a
subsidy
to
black
people
n
this
argument
quickly
gave
way
in
the
face
of
the
rising
importance
of
the
anticlassification
norm
n
over
the
years
the
anticlassification
principle
has
come
to
dominate
the
landscape
so
thoroughly
that
a
portion
of
the
populace
thinks
as
do
a
few
justices
on
the
supreme
court
that
it
is
the
only
valid
rationale
for
antidiscrimination
law
n
the
move
away
from
antisubordination
began
only
five
years
after
disparate
impact
was
established
in
griggs
in
washington
v
davis
the
court
held
that
disparate
impact
could
not
apply
to
constitutional
claims
because
equal
protection
only
prohibited
intentional
discrimination
n
since
then
the
various
affirmative
action
cases
have
overwritten
the
distinction
between
benign
and
harmful
categorizations
of
race
in
favor
of
a
formalistic
anticlassification
principle
removed
from
its
origins
as
a
tool
to
help
members
of
historically
disadvantaged
groups
n
white
men
can
now
bring
disparate
treatment
claims
n
if
antidiscrimination
law
is
no
longer
thought
to
serve
the
purpose
of
improving
the
relative
conditions
of
traditionally
disadvantaged
groups
antisubordination
is
not
part
of
the
equation
while
the
court
has
clearly
established
that
antisubordination
is
not
part
of
constitutional
equal
protection
doctrine
that
it
does
not
mean
that
antisubordination
cannot
animate
statutory
antidiscrimination
law
antisubordination
and
anticlassification
came
into
sharp
conflict
in
ricci
v
destefano
a
case
in
which
the
city
of
new
haven
refused
to
certify
a
promotion
exam
given
to
its
firefighters
on
the
grounds
that
it
would
have
produced
a
disparate
impact
based
on
its
results
n
the
supreme
court
held
that
the
refusal
to
certify
the
test
a
facially
race
neutral
attempt
to
correct
for
perceived
disparate
impact
was
in
fact
a
race
conscious
remedy
that
constituted
disparate
treatment
of
the
majority
white
firefighters
who
would
have
been
promoted
based
on
the
exam
s
results
n
the
court
held
that
disparate
treatment
cannot
be
a
remedy
for
disparate
impact
without
a
strong
basis
in
evidence
that
the
results
would
lead
to
actual
disparate
treatment
liability
n
ricci
was
the
first
indication
at
the
supreme
court
that
disparate
impact
doctrine
could
be
in
conflict
with
disparate
treatment
n
the
court
had
previously
ruled
in
essence
that
the
antisubordination
principle
could
not
motivate
a
constitutional
decision
n
but
it
had
not
suggested
that
law
effectuating
that
principle
could
itself
be
discriminatory
against
the
dominant
groups
that
has
now
changed
n
the
decision
has
two
main
consequences
for
data
mining
first
where
the
internal
difficulties
in
resolving
discrimination
in
data
mining
described
above
can
be
overcome
legislation
that
requires
or
enables
such
resolution
may
run
afoul
of
ricci
suppose
for
example
congress
amended
title
vii
to
require
that
employers
make
their
training
data
and
models
auditable
in
order
to
correct
for
detected
biases
in
the
training
data
that
result
in
a
model
with
a
disparate
impact
the
employer
would
first
have
to
consider
membership
in
the
protected
class
the
remedy
is
inherently
race
conscious
the
ricci
court
did
hold
that
an
employer
may
tweak
a
test
during
the
test
design
stage
however
n
so
as
a
matter
of
timing
data
mining
might
not
formally
run
into
ricci
if
the
bias
resulting
in
a
disparate
impact
is
corrected
before
applied
to
individual
candidates
after
an
employer
begins
to
use
the
model
to
make
hiring
decisions
only
a
strong
basis
in
evidence
that
the
employer
will
be
successfully
sued
for
disparate
impact
will
permit
corrective
action
n
of
course
unless
every
single
model
used
by
an
employer
is
subject
to
a
prescreening
audit
an
idea
that
seems
so
resource
intensive
that
it
is
effectively
impossible
the
disparate
impact
will
be
discovered
only
when
the
employer
faces
complaints
additionally
while
ricci
s
holding
was
limited
in
scope
the
strong
basis
in
evidence
standard
did
not
seem
to
be
dictated
by
the
logic
of
the
opinion
which
illustrated
a
more
general
conflict
between
disparate
treatment
and
disparate
impact
n
second
where
the
internal
difficulties
cannot
be
overcome
there
is
likely
no
way
to
correct
for
the
discriminatory
outcomes
aside
from
results
focused
balancing
and
requiring
this
will
pose
constitutional
problems
for
those
who
adhere
to
the
anticlassification
principle
alone
such
an
impasse
may
be
perfectly
acceptable
they
might
say
that
as
long
as
employers
are
not
intentionally
discriminating
based
on
explicitly
proscribed
criteria
the
chips
should
fall
where
they
may
to
those
who
believe
some
measure
of
substantive
equality
is
important
over
and
above
procedural
equality
this
result
will
be
deeply
unsatisfying
an
answer
to
the
impasse
created
by
situations
that
would
require
results
focused
rebalancing
is
to
reexamine
the
purpose
of
antidiscrimination
law
the
major
justification
for
reliance
on
formal
disparate
treatment
is
that
prejudice
is
simply
irrational
and
thus
unfair
but
if
an
employer
knows
that
his
model
has
a
disparate
impact
but
it
is
also
his
most
predictive
the
argument
that
the
discrimination
is
irrational
loses
any
force
thus
data
mining
may
require
us
to
reevaluate
why
and
whether
we
care
about
not
discriminating
consider
another
example
involving
tenure
predictions
one
in
which
an
employer
ranks
potential
employees
with
the
goal
of
hiring
only
those
applicants
that
the
company
expects
to
retain
for
longer
periods
of
time
in
optimizing
its
selection
of
applicants
in
this
manner
the
employer
may
unknowingly
discriminate
against
women
if
the
historical
data
demonstrates
that
they
leave
their
positions
after
fewer
years
than
their
male
counterparts
if
gender
accounts
for
a
sufficiently
significant
difference
in
employee
tenure
data
mining
will
generate
a
model
that
simply
discriminates
on
the
basis
of
gender
or
those
criteria
that
happen
to
be
proxies
for
gender
although
selecting
applicants
with
an
eye
to
retention
might
seem
both
rational
and
reasonable
granting
significance
to
predicted
tenure
would
subject
women
to
systematic
disadvantage
if
gender
accounts
for
a
good
deal
of
the
difference
in
tenure
if
that
is
the
case
any
data
mining
exercise
that
attempts
to
predict
tenure
will
invariably
rediscover
this
relationship
one
solution
could
be
for
congress
to
amend
title
vii
to
reinvigorate
strict
business
necessity
n
this
would
allow
a
court
to
accept
that
relying
on
tenure
is
rational
but
not
strictly
necessary
and
that
perhaps
other
factors
could
make
up
for
the
lack
of
predicted
tenure
but
this
solution
and
all
others
must
rely
on
the
antisubordination
principle
consider
this
question
should
the
law
permit
a
company
to
hire
no
women
at
all
or
none
that
it
correctly
predicts
will
depart
following
the
birth
of
a
child
because
it
is
the
most
rational
choice
according
to
their
model
n
the
answer
seems
obviously
to
be
no
but
why
not
what
forms
the
basis
for
law
s
objection
to
rational
decisions
based
on
seemingly
legitimate
criteria
that
place
members
of
protected
classes
at
systematic
disadvantage
the
supreme
court
has
observed
that
title
vii
requires
employers
to
treat
their
employees
as
individuals
not
as
simply
components
of
a
racial
religious
sexual
or
national
class
n
on
the
strength
of
that
statement
the
court
held
that
employers
could
not
force
women
to
pay
more
into
an
annuity
because
they
as
women
were
likely
to
live
longer
n
but
it
is
not
clear
that
this
reasoning
translates
directly
to
data
mining
here
the
model
takes
a
great
deal
of
data
about
an
individual
and
while
it
does
make
a
determination
based
on
statistics
it
will
make
a
different
one
if
analyzing
two
different
women
so
if
the
model
said
to
hire
no
women
it
would
be
illegal
but
according
to
the
doctrine
perhaps
only
because
every
woman
ends
up
with
the
same
result
the
only
escape
from
this
situation
may
be
one
in
which
the
relevance
of
gender
in
the
model
is
purposefully
ignored
and
all
factors
correlated
with
gender
are
suppressed
the
outcome
would
be
a
necessarily
less
accurate
model
the
justification
for
placing
restrictions
on
employers
and
limiting
the
effectiveness
of
their
data
mining
would
have
to
depend
on
an
entirely
different
set
of
arguments
than
those
advanced
to
explain
the
wrongfulness
of
biased
data
collection
poorly
labeled
examples
or
an
impoverished
set
of
features
here
shielding
members
of
protected
classes
from
less
favorable
treatment
is
not
justified
by
combatting
prejudice
or
stereotyping
in
other
words
any
prohibition
in
this
case
could
not
rest
on
a
procedural
commitment
to
ensuring
ever
more
accurate
determinations
instead
the
prohibition
would
have
to
rest
on
a
substantive
commitment
to
equal
representation
of
women
in
the
workplace
that
is
it
would
have
to
rest
on
a
principle
of
antisubordination
the
dilemma
is
clear
the
farther
the
doctrine
gets
from
substantive
remediation
the
less
utility
it
has
in
remedying
these
kinds
of
discriminatory
effects
n
but
the
more
disparate
impact
is
thought
to
embody
the
antisubordination
principle
as
opposed
to
the
evidentiary
dragnet
in
service
of
the
anticlassification
norm
the
more
it
will
invite
future
constitutional
challenges
n
this
also
raises
a
point
about
disparate
treatment
and
data
mining
within
data
mining
the
effectiveness
of
prohibiting
the
use
of
certain
information
exists
on
a
spectrum
on
one
end
the
prohibition
has
little
to
no
effect
because
either
the
information
is
redundantly
encoded
or
the
results
do
not
vary
along
lines
of
protected
class
on
the
other
end
the
prohibition
reduces
the
accuracy
of
the
models
that
is
if
protected
class
data
were
not
prohibited
that
information
would
alter
the
results
presumably
by
making
members
of
protected
classes
worse
or
in
some
cases
better
off
thus
as
a
natural
consequence
of
data
mining
a
command
to
ignore
certain
data
has
either
no
effect
n
or
the
effect
of
altering
the
fortunes
of
those
protected
classes
in
substantive
ways
therefore
with
respect
to
data
mining
due
to
the
zero
sum
nature
of
a
ranking
system
even
disparate
treatment
doctrine
is
a
reallocative
remedy
similar
to
affirmative
action
n
once
again
this
erodes
the
legitimate
rationale
for
on
the
one
hand
supporting
an
anticlassification
principle
but
on
the
other
holding
fast
against
antisubordination
in
this
context
the
two
principles
tend
to
accomplish
the
same
thing
but
one
is
less
effective
at
achieving
substantive
equality
this
reveals
that
the
pressing
challenge
does
not
lie
with
ensuring
procedural
fairness
through
a
more
thorough
stamping
out
of
prejudice
and
bias
but
rather
with
developing
ways
of
reasoning
to
adjudicate
when
and
what
amount
of
disparate
impact
is
tolerable
abandoning
a
belief
in
the
efficacy
of
procedural
solutions
leaves
policy
makers
in
an
awkward
position
because
there
is
no
definite
or
consensus
answer
to
questions
about
the
fairness
of
specific
outcomes
these
need
to
be
worked
out
on
the
basis
of
different
normative
principles
at
some
point
society
will
be
forced
to
acknowledge
that
this
is
really
a
discussion
about
what
constitutes
a
tolerable
level
of
disparate
impact
in
employment
under
the
current
constitutional
order
and
in
the
political
climate
it
is
tough
to
even
imagine
having
such
a
conversation
but
until
that
happens
data
mining
will
be
permitted
to
exacerbate
existing
inequalities
in
difficult
to
counter
ways
conclusion
this
essay
has
identified
two
types
of
discriminatory
outcomes
from
data
mining
a
family
of
outcomes
where
data
mining
goes
wrong
and
outcomes
where
it
goes
too
right
data
mining
can
go
wrong
in
any
number
of
ways
it
can
choose
a
target
variable
that
correlates
to
protected
class
more
than
others
would
reproduce
the
prejudice
exhibited
in
the
training
examples
draw
adverse
lessons
about
protected
classes
from
an
unrepresentative
sample
choose
too
small
a
feature
set
or
not
dive
deep
enough
into
each
feature
each
of
these
potential
errors
is
marked
by
two
facts
the
errors
may
generate
a
manifest
disparate
impact
and
they
may
be
the
result
of
entirely
innocent
choices
made
by
data
miners
where
data
mining
goes
right
data
miners
could
not
have
been
any
more
accurate
given
the
starting
point
of
the
process
this
very
accuracy
exposing
an
uneven
distribution
of
attributes
that
predict
the
target
variable
gives
such
a
result
its
disparate
impact
if
the
data
accurately
models
inequality
attempts
to
devise
an
alternative
way
of
making
the
same
prediction
will
only
narrow
the
disparate
impact
if
these
efforts
reduce
the
accuracy
of
the
decision
procedure
by
now
it
should
be
clear
that
title
vii
and
very
likely
other
similarly
process
oriented
civil
rights
laws
cannot
effectively
address
this
situation
this
means
something
different
for
the
two
families
and
it
should
be
slightly
more
surprising
for
the
former
at
a
high
level
of
abstraction
where
a
decision
process
goes
wrong
and
this
wrongness
creates
a
disparate
impact
title
vii
and
similar
civil
rights
laws
should
be
up
to
the
task
of
solving
the
problem
that
is
ostensibly
their
entire
purpose
but
aside
from
a
few
more
obvious
cases
involving
manifest
biases
in
the
dataset
it
is
quite
difficult
to
determine
ahead
of
time
what
correct
data
mining
looks
like
a
decision
maker
can
rarely
discover
that
the
choice
of
a
particular
target
variable
is
more
discriminatory
than
other
choices
until
after
the
fact
at
which
point
it
may
be
difficult
and
costly
to
change
course
while
data
miners
might
have
some
intuitions
about
the
influence
that
prejudice
or
bias
played
in
the
prior
decisions
that
will
serve
as
training
data
data
miners
may
not
have
any
systematic
way
of
measuring
and
correcting
for
that
influence
and
even
though
ensuring
reliable
samples
before
training
a
model
is
a
possibility
the
data
may
never
be
perfect
it
may
be
impossible
to
determine
ex
ante
how
much
the
bias
contributes
to
the
disparate
impact
it
may
not
be
obvious
how
to
collect
additional
data
that
makes
the
sample
more
representative
and
it
may
be
prohibitively
expensive
to
do
so
companies
will
rarely
be
able
to
resolve
these
problems
completely
their
models
will
almost
always
suffer
from
some
deficiency
that
results
in
a
disparate
impact
a
standard
that
holds
companies
liable
for
any
amount
of
theoretically
avoidable
disparate
impact
is
likely
to
ensnare
all
companies
thus
even
at
this
level
of
abstraction
it
becomes
clear
that
holding
the
decision
makers
responsible
for
these
disparate
impacts
is
at
least
partly
troubling
from
a
due
process
perspective
such
concerns
may
counsel
against
using
data
mining
altogether
this
would
be
a
perverse
outcome
given
how
much
even
imperfect
data
mining
can
do
to
help
reduce
the
very
high
rates
of
discrimination
in
employment
decisions
if
liability
for
getting
things
wrong
is
difficult
to
imagine
how
does
liability
for
getting
things
right
make
any
more
sense
that
proxy
discrimination
largely
rediscovers
preexisting
inequalities
suggests
that
perhaps
title
vii
is
not
the
appropriate
remedial
vehicle
if
what
is
at
stake
are
the
results
of
decades
of
historical
discrimination
and
wealth
concentration
that
have
created
profound
inequality
in
society
is
that
not
too
big
a
problem
to
remedy
through
individual
lawsuits
assuming
affirmative
action
and
similar
policies
are
off
the
table
thus
perfect
data
mining
forces
the
question
if
employers
can
say
with
certainty
that
given
the
status
quo
n
candidates
from
protected
classes
are
on
average
less
ready
for
certain
jobs
than
more
privileged
candidates
should
employers
specifically
be
penalized
for
hiring
fewer
candidates
from
protected
classes
doctrinally
the
answer
is
yes
to
some
extent
professor
christine
jolls
has
written
that
disparate
impact
doctrine
is
akin
to
accommodation
in
disability
law
that
is
both
accommodations
and
disparate
impact
specifically
require
employers
to
depart
from
pure
market
rationality
and
incur
costs
associated
with
employing
members
of
protected
classes
n
similarly
the
title
vii
annuity
cases
n
and
title
vii
s
ban
on
following
racist
third
party
preferences
n
each
require
a
departure
from
market
rationality
thus
title
vii
makes
that
decision
to
a
degree
but
to
what
degree
how
much
cost
must
an
employer
bear
title
vii
does
not
require
an
employer
to
use
the
least
discriminatory
means
of
running
a
business
n
likewise
title
vii
does
not
aim
to
remedy
historical
discrimination
and
current
inequality
by
imposing
all
the
costs
of
restitution
and
redistribution
on
individual
employers
n
it
is
more
appropriately
understood
as
a
standard
of
defensible
disparate
impact
one
route
then
to
addressing
the
problems
is
to
make
the
inquiry
more
searching
and
put
the
burden
on
the
employer
to
avoid
at
least
the
easy
cases
in
a
system
that
is
as
unpredictable
as
data
mining
can
be
perhaps
the
proper
way
of
thinking
about
the
solution
is
a
duty
of
care
a
theory
of
negligent
discrimination
n
but
if
title
vii
alone
cannot
solve
these
problems
where
should
society
look
for
answers
well
the
first
answer
is
to
question
the
status
quo
data
mining
takes
the
existing
state
of
the
world
as
a
given
and
ranks
candidates
according
to
their
predicted
attributes
in
that
world
data
mining
by
its
very
nature
treats
the
target
variable
as
the
only
item
that
employers
are
in
a
position
to
alter
everything
else
that
happens
to
correlate
with
different
values
for
the
target
variable
is
assumed
stable
but
there
are
many
reasons
to
question
these
background
conditions
sorting
and
selecting
individuals
according
to
their
apparent
qualities
hides
the
fact
that
the
predicted
effect
of
possessing
these
qualities
with
respect
to
a
specific
outcome
is
also
a
function
of
the
conditions
under
which
these
decisions
are
made
recall
the
tenure
example
from
part
iii
b
in
approaching
appropriate
hiring
practices
as
a
matter
of
selecting
the
right
candidates
at
the
outset
an
employer
will
fail
to
recognize
potential
changes
that
he
could
make
to
workplace
conditions
a
more
family
friendly
workplace
greater
on
the
job
training
or
a
workplace
culture
more
welcoming
to
historically
underrepresented
groups
could
affect
the
course
of
employees
tenure
and
their
long
term
success
in
ways
that
undermine
the
seemingly
prophetic
nature
of
data
mining
s
predictions
these
are
all
traditional
goals
for
reducing
discrimination
within
the
workplace
and
they
continue
to
matter
even
in
the
face
of
the
eventual
widespread
adoption
of
data
mining
but
data
can
play
a
role
here
too
for
example
comparing
the
performance
of
equally
qualified
candidates
across
different
workplaces
can
help
isolate
the
formal
policies
and
institutional
dynamics
that
are
more
or
less
likely
to
help
workers
flourish
research
of
this
sort
could
also
reveal
areas
for
potential
reform
n
education
is
also
important
employers
may
take
some
steps
to
rectify
the
problem
on
their
own
if
they
better
understand
the
cause
of
the
disparity
right
now
many
of
the
problems
described
in
part
i
are
relatively
unknown
but
the
more
employers
and
data
miners
understand
these
pitfalls
the
more
they
can
strive
to
create
better
models
on
their
own
many
employers
switch
to
data
driven
practices
for
the
express
purpose
of
eradicating
bias
n
if
employers
discover
that
they
are
introducing
new
forms
of
bias
they
can
correct
course
even
employers
seeking
only
to
increase
efficiency
or
profit
may
find
that
their
incentives
align
with
the
goals
of
nondiscrimination
faulty
data
and
data
mining
will
lead
employers
to
overlook
or
otherwise
discount
people
who
are
actually
good
employees
where
the
cost
of
addressing
these
problems
is
at
least
compensated
for
by
a
business
benefit
of
equal
or
greater
value
employers
may
have
natural
incentives
to
do
so
finally
employers
could
also
make
more
effective
use
of
the
tools
that
computer
scientists
have
begun
to
develop
n
advances
in
these
areas
will
depend
crucially
on
greater
and
more
effective
collaboration
between
employers
computer
scientists
lawyers
advocates
regulators
and
policy
makers
n
this
essay
is
a
call
for
caution
in
the
use
of
data
mining
not
its
abandonment
while
far
from
a
panacea
data
mining
can
and
should
be
part
of
a
panoply
of
strategies
for
combatting
discrimination
in
the
workplace
and
for
promoting
fair
treatment
and
equality
ideally
institutions
can
find
ways
to
use
data
mining
to
generate
new
knowledge
and
improve
decision
making
that
serves
the
interests
of
both
decision
makers
and
protected
classes
but
where
data
mining
is
adopted
and
applied
without
care
it
poses
serious
risks
of
reproducing
many
of
the
same
troubling
dynamics
that
have
allowed
discrimination
to
persist
in
society
even
in
the

of
conscious

contradicting

it

juveniles
in
ways
that
have
lasting
policy
consequences
moreover
this
distortion
is
visited
especially
heavily
on
minority
youth
and
constitutes
an
engine
of
racial

sided

written
by
a

this
harms
individual

this

reveals
the

this

examines
delinquency
databasing
through
the
lens
of
the
constructed
category
of
childhood
too
little
legal
scholarship
has
critically
examined
the
role
of
the
concept
of

in
shaping
law
and
social
practices
and
the
role
that

and

play
in

the
conceptions
of

less
nuanced

it
could
be

the
prevailing

of

as
a

separate
from

marshaling
adolescent

psychosocial

and
recent

it
shows
that

their
capacity
for

and
their

as

play
an
important

in
guiding

ii
uncovers
the
vast
extent
of
modern
delinquency
databasing
it
explains
how
despite
youths
vulnerability
to
harm
and
capacity
for

juveniles
now
find
themselves
indefinitely
cataloged
in

and

it
documents
the
unprecedented
breadth
and
permanence
of
law
enforcement
and

recordkeeping
it
shows
how
schools
have
become
mandated
law
enforcement
informants
and
it
maps
the
many
ways
that
this
information
travels
within
and
outside
of
the
criminal
justice
system
while
extensive
data
collection
and
publicly
available
criminal

can
be
a
rational
law
enforcement
strategy
that
promotes
public
safety

iii
identifies
the
many
harms
that
databasing
delinquency
inflicts
on
juveniles
they
include
devastating
impacts
on
their
immediate
lives
in
the
form
of
punishment
restrictions
on
their
life
choices
stigma
and
perhaps
increases
in
recidivism
compiled
early
in
the
life
of
their
subject
when
identities
and
character
are
still
taking
shape
n
and
skewed
in
content
these
criminal
justice
biographies
also
distort
perceptions
of
juveniles
in
ways
that
facilitate
support
for
punitive
policies
toward
youth
and
discrimination
against
them
this
distortion
and
discrimination
is
visited
especially
heavily
on
minority
youth
and
constitutes
an
engine
of
racial
bias
in
its
own
right
part
iii
further
shows
that
databasing
delinquency
reshapes
the
very
meaning
of
childhood
breaching
its
protected
space
and
contradicting
the
special
understandings
that
guide
the
regulation
of
youth
n
rather
than
honoring
the
particular
developmental
characteristics
of
youth
databasing
delinquency
ignores
them
and
treats
young
people
like
adults
this
contradicts
the
long
dominant
diversionary
approach
to
juvenile
wrongdoing
n
and
gainsays
the
fundamental
message
of
a
quartet
of
recent
supreme
court
cases
that
criminal
law
and
the
police
cannot
proceed
against
young
people
as
though
they
were
not
children
n
cognizant
that
this
is
a
critical
time
in
the
rebuilding
of
juvenile
justice
norms
n
part
iv
proposes
limitations
on
what
information
law
enforcement
should
gather
how
long
that
information
should
be
stored
and
with
whom
the
information
may
be
shared

principles
and

i
young

s
vulnerability
their
capacity
for
change
and
their
future
as

members
of

inform
the
recommendations
the
proposed
reforms
would
reduce
the
short
and
long
term
harms
caused
by
databasing
delinquency
enabling
the
criminal
justice
system
to
promote
public
safety
and
hold
juveniles
accountable
without
unduly
hindering
their
development
into
productive
adults
i
childhood
we
recognize
and
accommodate
many
values
when
we
choose
how
to
marshal
technology
s
unprecedented
data
collection
abilities
for
law
enforcement
purposes
that
we
have
extended
the
reach
of
law
enforcement
dataveillance
to
juveniles
necessarily
injects
the
developmental
characteristics
of
youth
and
the
purpose
and
meaning
of
childhood
into
the
debate
therefore
a
brief
introduction
to
the
concept
of
childhood
is
necessary
childhood
is
an
essential
and
permanent
component
of
the
social
order
n
it
is
a
natural
fact
children
are
different
from
adults
in
known
and
measurable
ways
n
yet
childhood
marks
something
more
than
empirical
biological
realities
or
chronological
age
n
it
is
also
a
social
construction
a
contingent
category
whose
boundaries
are
not
inevitable
or
fixed
but
are
instead
defined
and
maintained
by
law
n
as
such
childhood
is
the
product
of
our
collective
imagination
reflecting
prevailing
societal
priorities
and
aspirations
n
this
leads
to
varying
definitions
of
the
scope
of
childhood
individuals
cannot
lawfully
drive
a
vehicle
until
sixteen
vote
until
eighteen
or
drink
alcohol
until
twenty
one
n
the
variety
in
cut
offs
is
inevitable
as
different
activities
require
different
levels
of
skill
or
maturity
wherever
the
lines
between
childhood
and
adulthood
rest
the
expressive
function
of
the
law
then
feeds
the
law
s
definition
s
of
childhood
back
to
society
shaping
or
reinforcing
popular
views
of
childhood
n
the
prevailing
conception
of
childhood
today
is
a
protected
space
separated
from
the
broader
adult
society
n
childhood
is
separate
from
adulthood
because
children
are
different
from
adults
and
require
their
own
spaces
rules
and
institutions
n
childhood
is
protected
because
young
people
are
vulnerable
they
make
mistakes
and
have
a
greater
capacity
for
change
than
adults
as
a
result
the
law
applies
special
rules
to
young
people
n
indeed
it
provides
an
entirely
separate
forum
for
adjudicating
juvenile
matters
n
that
delivers
youth
focused
services
and
developmentally
appropriate
levels
of
accountability
as
a
matter
of
first
principles
the
law
aims
to
avoid
imposing
harsh
enduring
consequences
and
stigmas
so
that
juveniles
do
not
carry
the
burden
of
their
youthful
mistakes
into
adulthood
n
the
ultimate
goal
is
to
shepherd
children
into
a
self
sufficient
democratic
productive
and
autonomous
adulthood
n
this
part
explains
how
three
foundational
truths
about
youth
that
they
are
vulnerable
that
they
change
and
that
they
are
future
adults
guide
the
law
s
approach
to
childhood
a
youth
are
vulnerable
young
people
by
definition
are
immature
juveniles
are
in
the
earlier
stages
of
their
emotional
growth
their
intellectual
development
is
incomplete
they
have
had
only
limited
practical
experience
and
their
value
systems
have
not
yet
been
clearly
identified
or
firmly
adopted
n
their
immaturity
profoundly
impacts
how
they
live
their
lives
first
and
foremost
it
makes
them
vulnerable
according
to
leading
juvenile
developmental
psychologist
laurence
steinberg
adolescence
is
often
a
period
of
especially
heightened
vulnerability
n
two
particular
vulnerabilities
of
youth
their
susceptibility
to
poor
decisionmaking
and
their
physical
and
emotional
immaturity
shape
the
legal
regulation
of
juveniles
juveniles
incomplete
cognitive
and
psychosocial
development
undermines
their
ability
to
make
competent
decisions
n
young
people
are
less
able
to
process
information
quickly
and
thoughtfully
and
have
less
general
knowledge
and
experience
to
draw
upon
leading
to
poorly
reasoned
choices
n
in
addition
adolescents
are
less
likely
to
consider
the
long
term
consequences
of
their
actions
and
are
more
reward
sensitive
and
less
risk
averse
than
adults
n
this
poor
impulse
control
is
compounded
by
the
fact
that
they
are
profoundly
attuned
to
and
influenced
by
peers
n
taken
together
these
qualities
often
lead
to
delinquent
behavior
indeed
largely
on
account
of
these
attributes
offending
peaks
during
late
adolescence
n
leading
many
to
consider
delinquency
a
part
of
the
normal
life
course
n
their
physical
and
emotional
immaturity
also
makes
youth
especially
vulnerable
to
harm
young
people
suffer
specific
and
often
greater
harms
as
youth
and
they
are
more
likely
to
suffer
them
because
of
their
youth
n
they
are
for
example
more
susceptible
to
suffering
psychological
harms
than
their
adult
counterparts
under
similar
circumstances
n
they
are
especially
vulnerable
to
victimization
in
adult
institutions
and
are
at
a
greater
risk
than
adult
inmates
of
psychological
harm
and
suicide
n
young
people
are
also
particularly
vulnerable
to
lasting
problems
as
a
result
of
stigma
including
mental
health
problems
substance
abuse
and
re
offending
n
moreover
particular
practices
such
as
a
life
long
criminal
record
or
a
life
without
parole
sentence
impose
greater
harms
on
juveniles
by
virtue
of
the
simple
fact
that
juveniles
will
live
with
the
sanction
longer
n
on
account
of
their
immaturity
and
vulnerability
the
regulation
of
youth
has
long
been
infused
with
the
idea
that
they
deserve
special
protections
n
this
protective
regime
first
came
to
legal
fruition
in
the
late
nineteenth
century
when
progressive
era
reformers
the
so
called
child
savers
passed
compulsory
education
laws
restricted
child
labor
and
created
the
child
welfare
system
and
juvenile
court
n
over
one
hundred
years
later
it
still
prevails
rules
protect
juveniles
from
being
subjected
to
the
same
procedures
and
punishments
imposed
on
adults
in
civil
tort
proceedings
for
example
children
are
judged
by
a
reasonable
person
of
like
age
intelligence
and
experience
under
like
circumstances
standard
that
leads
to
limited
civil
responsibility
for
damages
they
cause
n
to
protect
minors
from
foolishly
squandering
their
wealth
through
improvident
contracts
with
crafty
adults
who
would
take
advantage
of
them
in
the
marketplace
n
a
contracting
minor
may
repudiate
the
contract
at
any
time
before
reaching
majority
or
within
a
reasonable
time
afterwards
n
the
protective
approach
to
childhood
necessarily
includes
the
criminal
law
the
juvenile
court
was
founded
over
a
century
ago
on
the
proposition
that
children
are
different
from
adults
and
should
avoid
the
punitive
and
stigmatizing
consequences
imposed
by
criminal
court
n
it
survives
today
because
society
continues
to
recognize
that
youth
deserve
a
separate
more
protective
forum
that
will
impose
accountability
while
honoring
the
childhood
of
those
before
the
court
many
protections
extend
to
those
juveniles
processed
in
criminal
court
n
for
instance
the
supreme
court
has
held
that
the
death
penalty
cannot
be
constitutionally
imposed
on
juveniles
because
their
vulnerability
and
comparative
lack
of
control
over
their
immediate
surroundings
mean
juveniles
have
a
greater
claim
than
adults
to
be
forgiven
for
failing
to
escape
negative
influences
in
their
whole
environment
n
their
vulnerability
similarly
prevents
law
enforcement
from
ignoring
childhood
during
criminal
investigations
n
this
is
not
to
say
that
youth
are
innocents
while
vulnerable
juveniles
are
autonomous
actors
who
have
the
ability
to
recognize
right
from
wrong
and
they
exercise
that
autonomy
by
choosing
at
times
to
do
bad
things
n
moreover
they
require
and
respond
to
accountability
but
youths
reduced
culpability
and
increased
vulnerability
to
harm
mean
that
the
quantity
of
accountability
appropriate
for
juvenile
behavior
is
necessarily
limited
n
b
youth
change
young
people
are
developing
in
almost
every
arena
physically
biochemically
intellectually
emotionally
and
psychosocially
their
physical
bodies
undergo
a
growth
spurt
between
the
ages
of
ten
and
eighteen
n
and
neuroscientists
describe
adolescence
as
a
period
of
profound
social
cognitive
change
n
it
is
also
a
time
when
identity
is
taking
shape
and
character
forms
n
as
the
supreme
court
observed
the
signature
qualities
of
youth
are
transient
n
the
dynamism
of
youth
matters
greatly
to
the
law
s
response
to
juvenile
offending
as
explained
above
youths
immaturity
contributes
to
delinquent
behavior
yet
most
youth
desist
from
delinquency
as
they
mature
into
adulthood
n
studies
frequently
find
that
only
five
percent
to
ten
percent
of
adolescent
offenders
continue
offending
in
adulthood
n
this
is
because
many
of
the
factors
associated
with
antisocial
risky
or
criminal
behavior
lose
their
intensity
as
individuals
become
more
developmentally
mature
n
in
fact
it
has
proven
nearly
impossible
to
researchers
to
identify
which
few
among
the
many
youthful
offenders
will
persist
into
adulthood
n
courts
and
policymakers
have
regularly
affirmed
the
relevance
of
youths
capacity
for
change
to
the
proper
regulation
of
childhood
it
goes
a
long
way
in
explaining
why
juvenile
court
was
invented
and
why
it
aims
to
privilege
rehabilitation
over
punishment
the
notion
of
change
pervaded
the
words
of
one
of
the
nation
s
earliest
juvenile
court
judges
who
explained
that
the
purpose
of
the
juvenile
court
was
not
so
much
to
punish
as
to
reform
not
to
degrade
but
to
uplift
not
to
crush
but
to
develop
not
to
make
him
a
criminal
but
a
worthy
citizen
n
as
such
delinquency
adjudications
do
not
necessarily
become
part
of
a
young
person
s
permanent
criminal
record
n
instead
stricter
confidentiality
provisions
protect
them
against
disclosure
and
juvenile
court
records
typically
can
be
sealed
or
expunged
when
the
young
person
reaches
a
particular
age
n
youth
s
capacity
for
change
likewise
protects
them
when
they
are
charged
in
criminal
court
in
a
trio
of
recent
sentencing
cases
the
supreme
court
recognized
that
the
character
of
a
juvenile
is
not
as
well
formed
as
that
of
an
adult
and
that
their
personality
traits
are
more
transitory
less
fixed
n
because
juveniles
are
more
capable
of
change
than
are
adults
their
actions
are
less
likely
to
be
evidence
of
irretrievably
depraved
character
than
are
the
actions
of
adults
n
in
short
a
greater
possibility
exists
that
a
minor
s
character
deficiencies
will
be
reformed
n
as
a
result
the
law
seeks
to
protect
them
from
conclusive
judgments
and
permanent
legal
disabilities
according
to
the
supreme
court
from
a
moral
standpoint
it
would
be
misguided
to
equate
the
failings
of
a
minor
with
those
of
an
adult
n
the
constitution
thus
forbids
the
imposition
of
the
death
penalty
and
mandatory
life
without
parole
sentences
for
crimes
committed
by
youth
and
protects
youthful
offenders
from
life
without
parole
for
non
homicide
crimes
n
c
youth
ideally
become
productive
adults
childhood
is
a
time
limited
developmental
category
n
as
leading
critical
childhood
scholars
allison
james
and
adrian
james
observed
all
children
do
grow
up
and
in
doing
so
leave
their
childhood
behind
them
n
that
young
people
will
leave
childhood
and
become
adults
has
two
important
consequences
for
the
regulation
of
childhood
first
children
must
be
taught
social
norms
including
that
society
imposes
consequences
for
misbehavior
n
second
that
lesson
must
be
delivered
in
a
way
that
preserves
their
chances
for
a
productive
adulthood
n
the
juvenile
court
was
created
to
accomplish
both
those
tasks
n
its
purpose
was
to
divert
juveniles
from
the
criminal
process
and
its
debilitating
punishments
and
stigma
to
a
forum
where
their
cases
would
be
handled
by
trained
specialists
dedicated
to
imposing
accountability
while
promoting
the
youth
s
rehabilitation
n
because
children
are
future
adults
the
criminal
justice
system
as
a
whole
including
law
enforcement
and
criminal
courts
has
a
greater
interest
in
promoting
youth
development
and
rehabilitating
those
who
offend
than
punishing
stigmatizing
and
marginalizing
them
thus
some
jurisdictions
have
recently
sought
to
make
transfer
of
youth
charged
with
crimes
to
adult
court
more
difficult
n
and
attempted
to
minimize
the
consequences
for
youth
processed
in
criminal
court
through
legislatively
created
classifications
like
youthful
offender
status
n
other
statutes
limit
the
amount
of
restitution
juveniles
may
be
ordered
to
pay
to
avoid
saddling
them
with
debts
that
would
cripple
their
transition
to
independent
adulthood
n
these
policies
aim
to
protect
youth
from
full
accountability
to
preserve
their
future
life
chances
these
protective
impulses
reflect
the
view
that
severe
punishments
permanent
disabilities
and
lasting
stigma
for
youthful
mistakes
do
not
serve
the
long
term
interests
of
society
while
reforms
have
not
gone
as
far
as
they
might
n
the
vulnerability
of
youth
their
capacity
for
change
and
their
future
as
adults
have
taken
a
more
central
role
in
policymaking
in
the
twenty
first
century
one
notable
exception
to
this
trend
is
law
enforcement
data
collection
where
special
protections
for
youth
are
falling
away
compiling
criminal

biographies

disregards
their

ii
of
this
article
demonstrates
in
contrast
to
decades
of
practices
that
mostly
shielded
young
people
from
accumulating
law
enforcement
records
the
criminal
justice
system
today
largely
treats
juveniles

adults
when
it
comes
to
the
collection
and
retention
of
information

a
remarkable
amount
of
information
about

but
it
is
not
just
criminal
information
that
is
being
collected
stored
and
shared
law
enforcement
collects
genetic
samples
from
juveniles
it
catalogs
their
friends

movements

the
law
requires
that
personal
information
of
youth

as
their

posted

that

seeks
to
gather
as
much
information
as
it
can
about
them
the
modern
tool
it
uses
to
collect
organize
and
disseminate
intelligence
information
prior
to
a
criminal
case
is
the
gang
database
gang
databases
are
repositories
for
information
about

and
suspected
gang
members
the
los

county
sheriff
s

instituted
the
first
modern
gang
database
in

similar
gang
databases

now
maintained
across
the
nation
at
the
local
state
and
federal
levels
n
gang
databases
can
include
almost
anything
but
typically
record
the
youth
s
name
address
dress
tattoos
locations
behaviors
criminal
histories
vehicles
school
family
and
friends
n
law
enforcement
collects
the
information
entered
into
the
database
primarily
through
routine
stops
on
the
street
and
in
schools
n
gang
membership
is
not
a
crime
and
a
conviction
is
not
necessary
before
an
individual
s
information
can
be
entered
into
a
gang
database
n
indeed
neither
an
arrest
nor
a
criminal
investigation
need
precipitate
the
categorization
of
a
youth
as
gang
involved
n
instead
police
decide
who
gets
included
n
inclusion
can
be
triggered
by
street
encounters
with
police
self
admission
or
a
combination
of
other
indicators
in
some
jurisdictions
qualifying
criteria
are
statutory
while
that
ostensibly
limits
police
discretion
the
qualifying
criteria
can
include
vague
and
perfectly
lawful
things
such
as
being
in
a
photograph
with
a
known
gang
member
corresponding
with
known
gang
members
frequenting
a
gang
area
or
wearing
certain
clothing
n
in
victor
rios
s
study
of
oakland
youth
he
described
how
a
fifteen
year
old
who
was
not
in
a
gang
ended
up
in
a
gang
database
after
he
was
attacked
while
sitting
on
his
front
door
steps
talking
with
friends
n
because
the
attackers
were
gang
members
detectives
assumed
that
the
victim
was
as
well
and
registered
him
as
an
active
gang
member
n
the
broad
criteria
for
inclusion
in
gang
databases
and
the
discretion
afforded
to
law
enforcement
in
deciding
whom
to
include
make
it
difficult
for
young
people
living
in
gang
heavy
communities
to
avoid
qualifying
criteria
law
enforcement
s
desire
to
collect
as
much
intelligence
and
potential
evidence
as
possible
about
those
it
expects
to
be
offenders
encourages
it
to
be
over
inclusive
in
its
classifications
n
the
lack
of
age
limits
for
inclusion
in
gang
databases
means
that
children
as
young
as
ten
are
present
in
gang
databases
n
while
the
particularities
of
gang
databases
vary
most
use
a
software

highest
penalty
possible
in

related
prosecutions
n
school
officials
use
gang
information
to
direct
security
resources
and
assign
counseling
resources
n
the
structure
and
management
of
gang
databases
make
it
difficult
if
not
impossible
to
know
whether
a
particular
person
has
been
classified
as
a
gang
member
the
information
in
gang
databases
is
not
publicly
available
according
to
the
california
attorney
general
website
release
of
calgang
r
criminal
intelligence
information
is
on
a
right
to
know
a
law
enforcement
officer
and
need
to
know
legitimate
law
enforcement
purpose
basis
only
n
only
a
few
gang
databases
have
provisions
that
require
law
enforcement
to
notify
parents
when
youth
are
classified
as
gang
members
n
moreover
law
enforcement
typically
does
not
offer
a
procedure
for
individuals
to
contest
their
inclusion
or
to
seek
or
confirm
their
purging
from
a
gang
database
this
means
that
youth
classified
as
gang
involved
by
police
can
remain
in
a
gang
database
often
unbeknownst
to
them
for
years
even
where
purging
procedures
are
in
place
they
are
rarely
carried
out
n
there
is
little
incentive
for
law
enforcement
to
purge
records
from
their
intelligence
databases
and
because
of
how
the
guidelines
governing
many
gang
databases
work
purging
is
allowed
only
if
no
new
information
is
entered
regarding
an
individual
for
two
or
five
years
n
police
can
intentionally
avoid
purging
by
checking
in
on
someone
regularly
entering
gang
related
information
gained
during
the
encounter
perhaps
about
friends
or
family
members
of
the
juvenile
though
gang
databases
are
not
publicly
available
and
despite
the
fact
that
many
youth
never
know
they
have
been
classified
by
law
enforcement
as
a
gang
member
the
information
in
gang
databases
leaks
beyond
law
enforcement
as
a
general
matter
criminal
law
scholar
james
jacobs
noted
that
once
information
is
entered
into
an
investigative
or
intelligence
database
it
can
easily
migrate
to
other
public
and
private
databases
and
therefore
can
become
more
difficult
to
purge
or
edit
effectively
n
specific
studies
of
gang
database
information
have
found
this
to
be
true
according
to
one
study
information
collected
in
calgang
has
been
shared
with
employers
landlords
public
housing
and
section
and
school
administrators
n
others
have
found
that
police
share
gang
information
with
schools
n
b
schools
as
informants
schools
have
increasingly
become
a
contact
point
for
youth
and
the
criminal
justice
system
scholars
in
many
fields
including
law
education
political
science
and
sociology
have
traced
the
rise
of
the
culture
of
control
in
the
classroom
and
its
devastating
impacts
on
youth
n
from
metal
detectors
and
fingerprint
identification
required
for
entry
to
video
surveillance
and
police
presence
on
campuses
schools
are
policed
more
than
ever
n
in
addition
schools
have
criminalized
normal
adolescent
behavior
pushing
and
shoving
has
become
battery
swiping
a
classmate
s
headphones
has
become
theft
or
robbery
and
talking
back
to
staff
has
become
disorderly
conduct
or
obstructing
n
as
a
result
young
people
are
intentionally
and
increasingly
diverted
from
the
classroom
to
the
juvenile
and
criminal
justice
systems
n
these
practices
are
particularly
prevalent
in
urban
public
schools
attended
primarily
by
minority
youth
n
a
disparity
that
is
not
explained
by
more
frequent
or
more
serious
misbehavior
by
students
of
color
n
the
upshot
of
these
changes
is
that
schools
are
less
likely
to
handle
disciplinary
matters
internally
n
this
criminalization
of
school
discipline
n
makes
schools
the
first
institution
in
which
most
youth
have
an
opportunity
to
be
marked
as
failures
criminals
or
deviants
n
the
fact
that
schools
increasingly
turn
to
law
enforcement
to
deal
with
misbehavior
reinforces
the
perceived
criminality
of
the
acts
in
the
last
two
decades
legislatures
across
the
country
have
turned
schools
into
mandated
informants
requiring
school
officials
to
report
to
law
enforcement
a
wide
variety
of
behaviors
and
suspected
acts
by
students
at
school
as
a
result
all
sorts
of
behavior
and
suspicions
that
in
the
past
would
have
stayed
on
campus
are
now
shared
with
law
enforcement
n
this
leads
to
more
criminal
justice
contact
for
youth
disruptions
in
their
education
and
negative
outcomes
n
one
main
reason
that
schools
are
now
in
the
collecting
and
reporting
business
is
that
congress
has
incentivized
it
two
major
pieces
of
legislation
do
most
of
the
work
the
improving
america
s
schools
act
of
provided
funds
to
public
schools
that
demonstrated
an
existing
crime
problem
compelling
schools
nationwide
to
develop
data
collection
systems
and
define
crimes
broadly
so
that
they
could
qualify
for
federal
funds
n
many
of
these
funds
were
spent
on
school
police
partnerships
such
as
hiring
security
or
law
enforcement
officers
to
patrol
school
campuses
n
the
mere
presence
of
these
officers
both
facilitates
reporting
and
makes
more
crime
possible
as
refusing
to
follow
the
orders
of
these
school
security
officers
is
a
crime
n
then
in
the
no
child
left
behind
act
required
school
districts
receiving
federal
funds
to
have
a
policy
requiring
that
any
student
who
brings
a
firearm
or
weapon
to
school
be
referred
to
law
enforcement
n
with
federal
money
tied
to
documenting
crime
in
school
and
reporting
it
to
law
enforcement
it
is
no
surprise
that
almost
all
states
require
school
officials
to
report
to
law
enforcement
suspected
violent
crimes
or
incidents
that
involve
deadly
weapons
or
dangerous
instruments
n
other
states
go
much
farther
many
including
california
require
schools
to
report
when
students
use
sell
or
possess
drugs
or
alcohol
n
connecticut
requires
principals
to
notify
law
enforcement
when
the
principal
believes
that
any
acts
of
bullying
constitute
criminal
conduct
n
and
illinois
requires
principals
to
notify
law
enforcement
of
each
incident
of
intimidation
and
each
alleged
incident
of
intimidation
which
is
reported
to
him
or
her
n
kansas
requires
an
immediate
report
to
law
enforcement
by
or
on
behalf
of
any
school
employee
who
knows
or
has
reason
to
believe
that
a
misdemeanor
was
committed
at
school
or
a
school
supervised
activity
n
given
the
funding
incentives
schools
are
likely
to
err
on
the
side
of
reporting
even
when
they
do
not
believe
or
know
that
an
act
constitutes
a
crime
the
failure
of
a
school
employee
to
report
incidents
to
law
enforcement
can
carry
consequences
for
example
it
is
a
class
b
misdemeanor
in
kansas
to
willfully
and
knowingly
fail
to
report
suspected
crimes
to
law
enforcement
n
and
it
is
an
infraction
punishable
by
a
fine
of
up
to
in
california
for
any
employee
of
a
school
district
who
is
attacked
assaulted
or
physically
threatened
by
any
pupil
to
not
promptly
report
the
incident
to
the
appropriate
law
enforcement
authorities

not
just
sharing
behavioral
information
with
law
enforcement

have
surfaced

schools

records
with
noncriminal
justice

agencies

as

information
also
flows
from
law

to
the

nineteen
states

to
provide
criminal
or
delinquency
information

decades

efforts

to
make

further

n
these
practices
continued
well
into
the
late
twentieth
century
as
recently
as
only
a
quarter
of
law
enforcement
agencies
fingerprinted
juveniles
n
today
these
protections
have
faded
juvenile
law
enforcement
records
increasingly
resemble
adult
law
enforcement
records
they
are
more
regularly
created
include
more
information
are
stored
with
adult
records
and
are
more
widely
available
nearly
every
state
allows
juveniles
to
be
fingerprinted
at
arrest
n
all
states
allow
juvenile
arrestees
to
be
photographed
and
nearly
all
send
information
about
juvenile
arrestees
to
statewide
repositories
n
the
fbi
authorizes
the
inclusion
of
juvenile
criminal
history
record
information
in
the
fbi
s
national
crime
information
center
ncic
database
on
the
same
basis
as
adult
records
n
the
supreme
court
has
held
that
the
media
cannot
be
stopped
from
disclosing
a
juvenile
arrestee
s
identity
as
long
as
it
acquired
the
information
lawfully
n
the
impact
of
eroded
protections
for
youth
has
been
multiplied
because
technology
has
enabled
law
enforcement
to
record
store
organize
and
retrieve
more
data
than
ever
a
traditional
method
for
police
to
gather
information
on
individuals
is
the
field
interview
fi
card
known
by
different
names
these
are
forms
filled
out
by
police
officers
after
encounters
with
individuals
n
they
record
pedigree
information
such
as
name
address
and
date
of
birth
and
details
about
the
encounter
n
police
often
complete
fi
cards
after
routine
encounters
done
without
probable
cause
a
great
many
of
which
did
not
end
in
an
arrest
n
the
fi
card
practice
has
been
transformed
by
technology
law
enforcement
staff
used
to
record
and
organize
the
information
by
hand
a
laborious
manual
entry
process
the
information
is
now
aggregated
and
stored
in
computers
making
it
easy
to
search
and
retrieve
software
companies
have
developed
computer
and
smartphone
applications
that
allow
officers
to
complete
fi
cards
using
their
smartphones
n
these
applications
eliminate
the
need
to
manually
enter
information
recorded
by
the
officer
on
the
paper
form
into
a
database
because
both
processes
happen
at
once
this
reduces
the
amount
of
time
required
for
data
entry
enabling
law
enforcement
to
record
more
information
after
more
encounters
n
it
also
makes
retrieval
and
analysis
of
the
information
gathered
much
easier
the
archetypal

a

created
by

to

n
rap

are
no
longer

some
seventeen
million

possible
by
networked
computers
n
moreover
some
police
departments
go
beyond
what
constitutional
and
statutory
law
requires
aggressively
disseminating
arrestee
information
n
as
a
result
a
system
created
by
police
for
the
police
is
now
more
often
used
to
provide
criminal
biographies
for
non
criminal
justice
purpose
n
law
enforcement
agencies
across
the
nation
also
maintain
a
variety
of
intelligence
databases
that
store
much
more
than
just
records
of
arrests
including
the
gang
databases
already
mentioned
as
well
as
tattoo

birthmark
and
scar

teeth
databases
and
many
others
n
information
in
these
databases
comes
from
all
the
information
collected
by
officers
during
street
encounters
and
reported
in
fi

as
well
as
from
bookings
calls

the
granddaddy
of
all
law

databases
is
the

for
those

n
convictions

court
records
are
recorded
as
they
are
for
adults
other
than
the
limited
availability
of
youthful

status
and
its
narrow
protections
no
special
provisions
protect
the
records
of
juveniles
convicted
in
criminal
court
n
this
is
significant
because
criminal
court
records
have
long
been
available
for
public
inspection
according
to
jacobs
only
the
united
states
and
canada
permit
anyone
to
look
at

without
having
to
persuade
a

that
she
has
a
good
reason
to
see

n
before
the
computerization
of
court

though
they
were
difficult
to
access
n
review
required
physical
travel
to
the
local
courthouse
or
record
repository
and
time
spent
retrieving

today
court
records
are
much
more
accessible
meaning
that
police
and
non
law
enforcement
personnel
can
access
an
individual
s
court
history
with
minimal
effort
most
state
court
systems
have
websites
that
allow
anyone
sometimes
for
a
fee
to
search
docket
sheets
and
retrieve
criminal
court
record
information
on
individuals
approximately
twenty
state
court
systems
sell
copies
of
their
criminal
court
docket
sheets
to
commercial
information
vendors
n
the
vast
majority
of
juveniles
charged
with
crimes
have
their
cases
handled
in
a
juvenile
court
instead
of
a
criminal
court
n
consistent
with
the
institution
s
diversionary
aim
to
prevent
children
from
being
treated
as
criminals
n
juvenile
courts
have
offered
more
robust
protections
against
the
creation
of
a
criminal
dossier
at
its
inception
juvenile
court
proceedings
were
held
in
private
before
only
a
judge
and
not
a
jury
by
design
such
proceedings
were
not
criminal
and
resulted
in
something
other
than
a
criminal
conviction
n
most
states
limited
disclosure
of
information
about
juveniles
adjudications
and
required
court
case
files
to
be
automatically
sealed
when
the
juvenile
turned
twenty
one
n
when
judicial
opinions
regarding
delinquency
proceedings
were
issued
they
protected
a
juvenile
s
identity
by
using
the
juvenile
s
initials
instead
of
her
full
name
many
of
these
protective
policies
remain
today
there
still
are
no
juries
n
and
case
opinions
continue
to
mask
the
juvenile
s
identity
delinquency
adjudications
do
not
necessarily
become
part
of
a
young
person
s
permanent
criminal
record
instead
stricter
confidentiality
provisions
protect
against
disclosure
of
juvenile
adjudications
and
juvenile
court
records
typically
can
be
sealed
or
expunged
at
a
particular
age
n
but
as
with
police
records
these
confidentiality
provisions
have
eroded
over
time
juvenile
court
proceedings
today
are
less
likely
to
be
closed
to
the
public
n
juvenile
court
records
are
also
more
broadly
available
as
no
state
completely
protects
juvenile
court
records
from
dissemination
to
certain
entities
outside
the
court
and
law
enforcement
n
only
nine
states
require
a
court
order
before
juvenile
court
records
can
be
released
only
eighteen
states
ensure
that
juvenile
record
information
is
not
available
to
the
public
or
accessible
on
any
online
database
n
in
maine
for
example
anyone
can
obtain
a
person
s
delinquency
adjudications
for
a
thirty
one
dollar
fee
n
juvenile
records
can
be
obtained
in
florida
for
twenty
four
dollars
n
arizona
and
idaho
provide
no
confidentiality
protections
to
juvenile
court
records
n
compounding
the
significance
of
this
confidentiality
erosion
the
supreme
court
has
also
ruled
that
state
laws
cannot
protect
testifying
witnesses
from
impeachment
by
these
juvenile
records
n
while
juvenile
courts
used
to
seal
or
expunge
juvenile
court
records
on
their
own
initiative
today
only
five
states
automatically
expunge
juvenile
records
n
in
all
other
states
the
youth
or
another
party
must
file
a
petition
and
convince
a
court
at
a
hearing
to
seal
or
expunge
a
juvenile
court
record
n
in
many
of
those
states
youth
are
not
advised
of
their
obligation
to
initiate
sealing
or
expungement
and
as
a
result
many
do
not
even
when
juveniles
do
initiate
sealing
or
expungement
procedures
more
than
half
the
states
include
statutory
exceptions
to
sealing
and
expungement
based
on
age
at
time
of
offense
the
nature
of
the
offense
and
the
amount
of
time
that
has
passed
since
the
case
was
closed
n
the
end
result
is
that
police
and
courts
create
more
records
about
youth
than
ever
the
records
last
longer
and
they
are
more
accessible
by
those
outside
of
courts
and
law
enforcement
than
ever
before
d
dna
databases
another
controversial
criminal
justice
practice
that
has
similarly
expanded
to
include
juveniles
is
dna
profiling
in
short
it
works
as
follows
a
biological
sample
containing
a
person
s
entire
genetic
code
is
collected
via
buccal
swab
or
blood
draw
n
and
analyzed
by
a
laboratory
to
create
a
dna
profile
n
dna
profiles
are
then
entered
into
one
or
more
government
databases
n
the
combined
dna
information
system
codis
is
a
software
program
that
facilitates
the
matching
of
the
dna
profiles
of
known
offenders
or
arrestees
to
profiles
generated
from
crime
scene
dna
evidence
n
dna
databasing
is
a
powerful
tool
that
makes
it
possible
to
solve
crimes
quickly
and
confidently
including
very
old
crimes
and
can
even
exonerate
the
wrongfully
convicted
n
collection
of
biological
samples
is
accomplished
primarily
through
contact
with
the
criminal
justice
system
the
federal
government
and
all
fifty
states
compel
dna
collection
from
anyone
convicted
of
a
felony
in
criminal
court
n
in
every
state
except
hawaii
this
includes
any
juvenile
convicted
of
any
felony
in
criminal
court
n
all
but
four
states
also
mandate
collection
from
all
persons
convicted
of
certain
misdemeanors
including
juveniles
n
dna
collection
from
juveniles
is
not
limited
to
those
charged
as
adults
twenty
nine
states
compel
dna
samples
from
juveniles
following
a
finding
of
juvenile
delinquency
n
of
those
twenty
nine
states
twenty
collect
dna
for
all
felony
adjudications
while
nine
collecting
only
for
a
subset
of
felony
adjudications
n
nineteen
states
mandate
dna
collection
from
juveniles
adjudicated
delinquent
for
a
misdemeanor
n
neither
a
conviction
nor
a
delinquency
adjudication
is
a
necessary
predicate
for
dna
collection
in
some
states
a
mere
arrest
can
trigger
compulsory
dna
collection
as
of
the
federal
government
and
twenty
seven
states
require
individuals
arrested
but
not
yet
convicted
or
adjudicated
delinquent
to
provide
dna
samples
n
of
the
twenty
seven
nineteen
permit
collection
from
juveniles
at
arrest
n
law
enforcement
also
acquires
dna
samples
from
juveniles
based
on
consent
most
notable
in
this
regard
is
orange
county
california
s
dna
collection
and
crime
deterrence
program
known
colloquially
as
the
spit
and
acquit
program
n
in
place
since
spit
and
acquit
permits
individuals
who
are
arrested
to
have
their
charges
dismissed
or
reduced
if
they
provide
law
enforcement
with
a
dna
sample
n
this
dna
collection
initiative
has
reportedly
generated
over
dna
profiles
n
the
program
does
not
restrict
collection
from
juveniles
even
in
the
absence
of
such
organized
dna
collection
initiatives
law
enforcement
seeks
dna
samples
from
juveniles
based
on
consent
for
example
police
went
to
albert
einstein
middle
school
in
sacramento
california
to
obtain
dna
cheek
swabs
from
adolescents
as
part
of
a
murder
investigation
n
authorities
in
brighton
colorado
similarly
acquired
consent
based
dna
samples
from
a
twelve
and
eleven
year
old
when
their
parents
were
not
home
as
part
of
an
investigation
into
car
break
ins
n
all
told
law
enforcement
has
already
compiled
dna
profiles
of
hundreds
of
thousands
of
juveniles
n
going
forward
as
many
as
several
hundred
thousand
juveniles
could
be
required
each
year
to
provide
a
genetic
sample
for
purposes
of
dna
profiling

while
most
criminal

use
some

a
much
broader
purpose
they
seek
to
publicize
criminal
record
information
about
those
who
have
committed
particularly
heinous
offenses
in
doing
so
they
enable
public
shaming
and
lasting
discrimination
the
leading
example
of
these
data
systems
are
sex

various
federal
and
state
laws
juveniles

not
specify

the
states
decided
themselves
whether
such

were
subject

most
protected

an
engine

also
threatens

narrow
conception
of

at
odds
with
longstanding
legal
principles
undisputed
scientific

and
recent

denies
certain

this
reshapes

of

invasion
of

constitutes
a

cannot
know

certainly
feel
anxiety

the
perception

negative
attributes

the
negative
label
often
serves

separate

from
us
research
has
shown
how
delinquent
or
criminal
labels
embed
juveniles
into
deviant
social
groups
through
association
and
exclusion
n
in
some
cases
the
stigmatized
person
is
thought
to
be
so
different
from
us
as
to
be
not
really
human
n
this
has
certainly
happened
with
juvenile
offenders
most
infamously
in
the
mid
s
when
john
diiulio
described
teenaged
offenders
as
severely
morally
impoverished
juvenile
super
predators
n
these
attitudes
have
internal
and
external
effects
having
your
youthful
mistakes
and

cataloged

an
internal
stigma

according
to

theory
stigmatic
labels
are
self
fulfilling
prophecies
when
juveniles
are
identified
as
deviants
or
criminals
they
are
more
likely
to
act
like
criminals
n
delinquency
databasing
communicates
to
the
juveniles
subject
to
it
that
the
state
believes
they
already
committed
crimes
that
data
collection
will
help
solve
and
that
they
will
commit
crimes
in
the
future
n
juveniles
then
internalize
this
label
which
leads
to
marginalization
and
additional
offending
more
recent
research
has
suggested
a
slightly
different
mechanism
for
how
stigmatic
criminal
labels
impact
individuals
and
lead
to
deviance
modified
labeling
theory
posits
that
the
individual
s
desire
to
manage
shame
leads
him
to
follow
strategies
such
as
withdrawal
and
secrecy
which
generate
secondary
deviance
n
sex
offender
registration
and
community
notification
requirements
for
example
cause
sex
offenders
to
isolate
themselves
in
the
community
away
from
support
systems
that
help
prevent
recidivism
n
the
harm
is
magnified
for
juveniles
the
label
of
sex
offender
child
molester
or
sexual
predator
can
cause
profound
damage
to
a
child
s
development
and
self
esteem
n
the
stigma
continues
even
when
a
juvenile
is
no
longer
subject
to
registration
and
law
enforcement
no
longer
publishes
her
information
on
a
website
n
perhaps
it
is
no
surprise
then
that
evidence
indicates
that
sex
offender
registration
actually
raises
the
risk
of
recidivism
amongst
juveniles
n
likewise
including
marginal
youth
in
gang
databases
so
called
wannabes
n
potentially
drives
them
into
gang
membership
because
they
are
being
treated
as
and
known
as
gang
members
n
rather
than
reducing
the
crime
problem
linked
to
gangs
it
exacerbates
it
the
same
effect
appears
when
schools
the
first
social
institution
outside
of
the
family
in
which
most
youth
have
an
opportunity
to
be
marked
as
failures

as
informants
and

information
with

enforcement
about

at

at

one
international
court
has
recognized
the
risk
of
stigmatization
brought
by
collecting
dna
from

n
stigmatic
labels

criminal
justice
actors
and
others
to
stop
seeing
young
people
as

to
instead
see
and
treat
them
as

n
this
is
the
external
stigma
of
databasing
delinquency
status
loss
follows
which
is
then
accompanied
by
formal
and
informal
discrimination
n
it
should
not
be
forgotten
that

have
less
mobility
than
adults
making
it
more
difficult
for
them
to
escape
from
a
community
in
which
harmful
information
has
cast
them
in
an
unfavorable

however

of
change

not
reflect

depraved
character
n
indeed
experts
agree
that
it
is

impossible
to
predict
which
juvenile
offenders
will
persist
into

n
therefore
because
the

of

information
has
much
less
value
than
it
does
for

in

are
less
deterrable

preventing

is
minimal

sold
as

little
empirical

supports
a

it
may
provide

diminished
if

lost
with

as
a
group

differently
are
more
subject

the

andrew
guthrie
ferguson
has
shown
how
police
access
to
the
kind
of
data
gathered
in
these
databases
makes
it
easier
for
law
enforcement
to
believe
that
probable
cause
exists
to
arrest
an
individual
n
according
to
guthrie
ferguson
if
officers
view
those
individualized
and
particularized
identifying
characteristics
such
as
prior
convictions

associations
and
gps
coordinates
near
the
scene
of
the
crime
as
suspicious
then
otherwise
innocent
actions
might
create
a
predictive
composite
that
satisfies
the
reasonable
suspicion
standard

who
experienced
a

of
police
stops
after
they
were
erroneously
entered
into
a

n
finally
the
challenges

be

this
proclivity

heightens
the
harmful
impact
of

discussed
in
the
next
section
that
the
mistaken

the

the

n
the

problem
could
be
minimized
if
law

offered
a
procedure
for
youth
to
seek
or
confirm
the
purging
of
their
information
from
a
database

it
rarely
does
as
described

exit
the

they
can
provide

is
difficult

the
burden
to
initiate

is
almost
always
placed
on
the

procedures
are
in
place
they
are
rarely
carried
out
n
by
storing
negative
information

including
inaccurate

databasing

the
foundational
principle

suffering

not
by
itself
troublesome
as
law
and
philosophy
scholar
anita
allen
has
explained
accountability
for
conduct
is
a
pervasive
feature
of
human
association
n
accountability
includes
being
accountable
to
individuals
often
in
the
form
of
providing
information
about
oneself
and
accountable
for
conduct
typically
in
the
form
of
negative
consequences
for
wrongs
n
criminal
law
and
law
enforcement
are
strong
forms
of
accountability
modern
surveillance
and
the
data
collection
practices
discussed
above
represent
a
technologically
supercharged
form
of
informational
accountability
n
some
amount
of
accountability
is
necessary
to
regulate
childhood
n
as
future
full
members
of
society
children
must
be
taught
social
norms
and
learn
that
society
imposes
consequences
for
misbehavior
n
no
one
maintains
that
children
not
be
held
to
some
amount
of
accountability
under
the
law
the
characteristics
that
define
youth
however
mean
that
the
quantity
of
accountability
appropriate
during
childhood
is
necessarily
limited
n
and
the
harms
imposed
by
databasing
delinquency
which
frustrate
juveniles
ability
to
succeed
in
adulthood
go
too
far
b
databasing
undermines
childhood
childhood
is
fragile
n
shifts
in
public
mood
can
lead
to
profound
changes
in
the
rights
and
responsibilities
of
young
people
one
such
shift
took
place
in
the
late
s
and
s
when
a
spike
in
violent
crime
by
young
people
triggered
a
moral
panic
about
juvenile
offending
n
events
like
the
central
park
jogger
case
where
five
youth
were
convicted
of
a
beating
and
rape
that
left
a
woman
comatose
a
crime
it
turned
out
that
none
of
the
five
committed
n
and
school
shootings
like
the
one
at
columbine
high
school
n
ignited
the
panic
academics
in
the
popular
press
fueled
the
flame
by
promising
a
coming
generation
of
severely
morally
impoverished
juvenile
super
predators
n
in
the
public
eye
juveniles
ceased
to
be
wayward
youth
in
need
of
help
and
became
hardened
criminals
in
need
of
being
locked
up
n
reforms
throughout
the
criminal
justice
system
led
to
more
juveniles
being
increasingly
treated
like
and
punished
alongside
adults
n
sentences
increased
and
laws
changed
permitting
the
prosecution
of
more
juveniles
in
criminal
court
the
supreme
court
refused
to
extend
or
recognize
special
protections
for
youth
n
confidentiality
waned
as
the
authors
of
a
report
on
juvenile
records
wrote
if
an
individual
wishes
to
be
protected
under
the
law
then
that
individual
must
first
act
within
the
law
when
a
juvenile
chooses
a
lifestyle
of
crime
and
violence
that
individual
should
not
expect
to
have
these
activities
shielded
from
disclosure
to
others
n
juvenile
justice
scholar
franklin
zimring
calls
this
the
forfeiture
theory
where
loss
of
the
protected
status
of
youth
becomes
in
effect
one
penal
consequence
of
the
forbidden
act
n
juveniles
who
break
the
law
are
seen
as
having
forfeited
by
their
conduct
the
protections
typically
afforded
to
youth
n
the
forfeiture
happens
despite
their
remaining
chronologically
developmentally
and
legally
children
as
zimring
observed
there
is
certainly
no
logically
necessary
reason
that
protective
features
of
youth
policy
are
only
for
nice
kids
n
databasing
delinquency
is
a
stout
and
expanding
remnant
of
the
forfeiture
era
it
subjects
juveniles
to
record
practices
and
consequences
akin
to
those
for
adults
including
juveniles
who
have
committed
no
crimes
sex
offender
registration
gang
databases
dna
collection
and
laws
turning
schools
into
informants
all
emerged
after
holistically
they
reflect
a
narrower
conception
of
the
protective
space
of
childhood
than
the
prevailing
notion
and
are
at
odds
with
developmental
science
the
continued
existence
of
juvenile
courts
and
recent
supreme
court
jurisprudence
as
a
result
databasing
delinquency
does
more
than
cause
immediate
and
lasting
harm
to
individual
juveniles
it
reshapes
the
very
meaning
of
childhood
breaching
its
protected
space
and
contradicting
the
special
understandings
that
policymakers
insist
must
dominate
the
regulation
of
youth
the
prevailing
concept
of
childhood
and
the
necessity
and
propriety
of
enhanced
protections
is
grounded
in
part
on
a
notion
of
childhood
as
innocence
n
that
childhood
is
marked
by
innocence
is
certainly
contested
and
undoubtedly
false
especially
with
regard
to
adolescents
despite
their
immaturity
juveniles
are
autonomous
actors
who
have
the
ability
to
recognize
right
from
wrong
and
exercise
such
autonomy
by
choosing
on
occasion
to
do
bad
things
n
indeed
delinquency
appears
to
be
a
normal
part
of
adolescence
n
their
offenses
however
do
not
make
them
adults
yet
the
criminal
justice
system
more
so
than
other
arenas
tends
to
treat
young
people
who
do
not
fit
the
innocent
image
as
outside
of
childhood
and
thus
not
cloaked
by
or
deserving
of
its
protections
in
the
last
decade
however
a
shift
back
to
first
principles
has
been
evident
the
superpredator
era
has
been
replaced
by
the
rebuilding
n
from
the
appropriate
amount
of
punishment
to
the
proper
treatment
by
police
courts
and
legislatures
have
displayed
a
renewed
commitment
to
the
primacy
of
special
protections
for
youth
n
in
the
wake
of
a
sharp
and
steady
decline
in
juvenile
offending
since
n
and
perhaps
in
response
to
the
punitive
extremes
of
s
reforms
courts
and
legislatures
have
made
it
clear
that
the
law
must
take
account
of
the
differences
between
youth
and
adults
n
as
a
result
several
juvenile
justice
policies
grounded
in
the
forfeiture
theory
have
been
rejected
in
recent
years
n
yet
it
is
not
just
the
dubious
forfeiture
theory
that
undergirds
delinquency
databasing
minority
youth
need
not
break
the
rules
before
they
lose
the
protections
of
childhood
n
for
them
by
virtue
of
being
black
or
brown
they
are
perceived
as
more
likely
to
be
criminal
more
culpable
for
the
same
behavior
committed
by
white
youth
and
older
than
their
actual
chronological
age
race
it
seems
overrides

within
the
criminal
justice
apparatus
as
a
result
minority

exit

protective
space
sooner
justifying
their
subjection
to
adult
like
law
enforcement
practices
like
databasing
americans
have
long
associated
blackness
and
criminality
n
the
perceived
link
between
blackness
and
criminality
has
contributed
to
racial
disparities
throughout
criminal
justice
including
skews
in
enforcement
and
punishment
of
black
juveniles
n
one
study
for
example
found
that
african
american
youth
are
disproportionately
arrested
in
twenty
six
of
twenty
nine
offense
categories
overrepresented
in
cases
referred
to
juvenile
court
more
likely
to
be
formally
charged
more
likely
to
be
waived
into
adult
court
and
disproportionately
detained
in
both
juvenile
and
adult
facilities
n
these
enforcement
skews
then
result
in
racial
skews
in
data
collection
as
law
enforcement
is
more
likely
to
collect
and
retain
information
on
minorities
because
it
disproportionately
makes
contact
with
minorities
n
emerging
research
connects
this
racial
perception
and
skew
data
to
the
expanding
surveillance
of
minority
youth
researchers
have
found
that
black
youth
are
seen
as
older
than
their
actual
age
and
more
culpable
for
the
same
behavior
as
white
youth
in
one
study
researchers
tested
police
officers
in
large
urban
areas
mostly
white
males
average
age
thirty
seven
and
mostly
white
female
undergraduate
students
from
large
public
u
s
universities
to
determine
their
levels
of
certain
types
of
bias
n
they
found
that
black
youth
were
more
likely
to
be
mistaken
as
older
than
their
actual
age
by
an
average
of
years
n
the
same
study
found
that
white
undergraduate
female
students
judged
children
up
to
nine
years
old
as
equally
innocent
regardless
of
race
but
considered
black
children
significantly
less
innocent
than
other
children
in
every
age
group
beginning
at
age
ten
n
in
another
study
researchers
had
a
nationally
representative
sample
of
white
americans
participate
in
an
online
study
about
support
for
life
without
parole
sentences
for
juveniles
n
participants
read
a
sample
about
a
recipient
of
the
sentencing
option
a
fourteen
year
old
male
with
seventeen
prior
juvenile
convictions
on
his
record
who
brutally
raped
an
elderly
woman
researchers
manipulated
just
one
word
across
the
two
study
conditions
in
the
description
of
the
example
recipient
of
the
sentencing
option
the
juvenile
was
described
as
either
black
or
white
the
researchers
found
that
in
the
black
prime
condition
participants
perceived
juveniles
as
more
similar
to
adults
in
blameworthiness
than
they
did
in
the
white
prime
condition
n
this
led
participants
in
the
black
prime
condition
to
express
more
support
for
life
without
parole
sentences
for
juveniles
in
non
homicide
cases
than
did
those
in
the
white
prime
condition
n
in
short
when
test
subjects
knew
the
subject
of
a
potential
criminal
justice
sanction
was
black
they
showed
increased
support
for
punitive
policies
n
this
effect
is
occurring
in
schools
as
well
professor
ann
arnett
ferguson
spent
over
three
years
observing
a
racially
mixed
public
intermediate
school
grades
four
to
six
n
she
concluded
that
african
american
boys
are
not
seen
as
childlike
but
adultified
as
naturally
naughty
and

willfully
bad
n
their
misbehavior
was
not
seen
as
typical
childishness
but
was
likely
to
be
interpreted
as
symptomatic
of
ominous
criminal
proclivities
n
in
one
example
a
white
teacher
described
african
american
children
who
borrowed
books
from
a
classroom
without
returning
them
as
looters
as
ferguson
put
it
what
might
be
interpreted
as
the
careless
behavior
of
children
is
displaced
by
images
of
adult
acts
of
thefts
that
conjure
up
violence
and
mayhem
n
as
a
result
of
this
adultification
black
male
youth
became
exempted
from
the
dispensations
granted
the
child
and
the
boy
justifying
increased
surveillance
and
harsher
more
punitive
responses
to
rule
breaking
behavior
n
this
research
shows
that
race
profoundly
affects
the
degree
to
which
juveniles
are
afforded
the
established
protection
associated
with
childhood
status
n
this
happens
even
in
the
absence
of
wrongdoing
indeed
race
appears
to
override
youth
when
it
comes
to
support
for
punitive
juvenile
justice
policies
black
youth
are
viewed
as
older
than
their
actual
age
are
associated
with
criminality
and
are
seen
as
responsible
for
their
actions
at
an
age
when
white
youth
remain
protected
by
the
reduced
culpability
conception
of
childhood
as
a
result
law
enforcement
practices
like
the
databasing
described
here
that
treat
youth
of
color
like
adults
flourish
iv
reforms
there
is
ample
evidence
that
policymakers
are
rethinking
the
punitive
adult
like
policies
adopted
in
a
climate
of
fear
and
hostility
toward
juvenile
offenders
in
the
late
twentieth
century
n
this
momentum
toward
first
principles
led
juvenile
justice
scholar
terry
maroney
to
describe
the
current
era
as
the
rebuilding
of
juvenile
justice
n
in
that
spirit
this
part
offers
three
recommendations
to
curbing
delinquency
databasing
that
would
realign
law
enforcement
data
collection
practices
with
current
developmental
research
and
the
prevailing
conception
of
childhood
as
a
separate
protected
space
first
to
account
for
juveniles
unique
vulnerability
to
harms
laws
should
limit
the
amount
of
information
that
law
enforcement
may
collect
about
juveniles
second
because
most
juveniles
do
not
persist
in
offending
but
instead
mature
into
law
abiding
individuals
laws
should
limit
the
length
of
time
that
gathered
information
can
be
retained
third
in
recognition
of
juveniles
future
lives
as
adults
laws
should
restrict
law
enforcement
s
ability
to
share
the
information
it
gathers
and
stores
this
would
have
no
impact
on
law
enforcement
s
mission
and
would
facilitate
access
to
the
employment
higher
education
and
housing
that
is
so
critical
as
youth
transition
to
adulthood
a
limiting
what
information
is
gathered
the
easiest
way
to
limit
the
harms
caused
by
databasing
delinquency
is
to
not
gather
the
information
in
the
first
place
n
it
would
avoid
the
privacy
intrusion
attendant
to
the
gathering
of
information
and
would
prevent
the
additional
punishments
and
stigma
discussed
above
that
ensue
it
would
also
eliminate
the
long
shadow
of
a
young
person
s
mistakes
helping
to
ensure
that
juveniles
enter
adulthood
with
the
greatest
chance
for
a
productive
life
but
law
enforcement
will
not
be
prohibited
from
gathering
information
in
any
foreseeable
future
a
feasible
focus
becomes
limiting
law
enforcement
s
data
collection
abilities
deciding
how
much
to
limit
it
depends
in
part
on
the
role
of
law
enforcement
with
respect
to
juveniles
if
the
police
play
a
role
similar
to
that
of
a
general
welfare
agency
then
all
data
is
potentially
pertinent
and
the
limitations
proposed
here
will
not
come
to
be
n
but
if
law
enforcement
s
mission
is
limited
to
crime
solving
and
suppression
then
much
of
the
information
about
a
young
person
gathered
in
the
delinquency
databases
loses
its
value
to
law
enforcement
instead
a
narrower
universe
of
data
collection
is
justified
this
is
especially
so
for
data
collection
that
occurs
before
a
young
person
has
become
the
target
of
a
criminal
investigation
it
seems
safe
to
say
that
the
police
are
not
child
welfare
officials
n
and
therefore
every
last
bit
of
information
about
young
people
is
not
of
police
concern
gathering
data
about
the
friends
and
associations
of
juveniles
or
logging
reports
from
schools
of
bullying
especially
in
the
absence
of
a
criminal
investigation
that
would
make
the
information
relevant
is
thus
difficult
to
justify
on
the
other
hand
it
is
difficult
to
cull
the
information
that
has
or
might
have
intelligence
value
to
law
enforcement
from
that
which
does
not
n
indeed
the
belief
that
it
is
better
to
have
information
and
not
need
it
than
to
need
it
and
not
have
it
and
the
lure
of
complete
collection
has
proven
irresistible
to
the
government
n
one
guiding
principle
could
be
that
law
enforcement
may
only
collect
information
relevant
to
an
individual
s
identity
or
to
a
specific
investigation
restrictions
on
law
enforcement
s
ability
to
gather
information
are
not
impossible
the
fourth
and
fifth
amendments
stand
as
foundational
hurdles
to
unrestricted
government
data
collection
n
and
states
still
maintain
protective
rules
for
children
with
regard
to
police
identity
records
take
fingerprints
as
an
example

some
states
such
as

make
no
distinctions

rules

limited
the
content

integration
the
federal
requirement
that

be
placed
on

in
direct
conflict
with
that
public
policy

concerns
the
state
of
washington

sex

have
also
found

unconstitutional

of

elements
of

the
avoidance

that

the

helps

and
plays
some
role
in

many

change
while
many
participate

some
form
of
delinquency

desist
as

of

factors

criminal
behavior
lose
their

change
means

in
recognition
of
this
truth
limits
on
the
length
of

enforcement
to
keep
information
during
peak
offending
years
while
also
protecting
young
people
from
the
long
shadow
of
youthful
mistakes
numerous
proposals
have
sought
to
limit
the
length
of
time
that
law
enforcement
can
retain
records
about

before
the
dawn
of

dataveillance
the
aba
issued
a
report
entitled
standards
relating

systems

in
it
the
aba
recommended
that
juvenile
police
and
court
records
be
destroyed
if
a
juvenile
who
is
arrested
or
detained
is
not
referred
to
a
court
n
the
report
emphasized
that
unless
the
juvenile
s
police
record
is
also
destroyed
when
the
court
record
is
destroyed
the
destruction
of
the
court
record
alone
would
become
a
relatively
meaningless
reform
n
in
a
foreshadowing
of
what
has
become
the
report
acknowledged
that
the
increasing
use
of
computers
to
disseminate
arrest
records
magnifies
the
risks
created
by
the
existence
of
arrest
records
n
the
juvenile
crime
wave
of
the
s
and
early
s
and
the
punitive
reforms
that
followed
meant
the
aba
s
proposal
was
not
heeded
similar
reform
proposals
are
now
making

have
begun
to
reimpose
limitations
on
how
long
juvenile
records
may
be
maintained

passed

law
allowing
for
most
juvenile
records
to
be
automatically
sealed

turns
eighteen

in
explaining
the
bill
representative
ruth
kagi
said
that
up
until
today
youth
in
washington
had
their
mistakes
follow
them
forever
the
sealing
of
juvenile
records
will
give
youth
the
chance
to
get
an
education
a
job
housing
and
a
productive
life
n
senators
rand
paul
and
cory
booker
proposed
a
similar
bill
at
the
federal
level
in
their
redeem
act
would
automatically
seal
juvenile
criminal
records
for
nonviolent
offenses
n
the
movement
toward
protective
juvenile
record
policies
is
not
limited
to
the
united
states
in
recent
commentary
on
the
european
rules
for
juvenile
offenders
the
council
of
europe
advised
that
sanctions
and
measures
imposed
on
juvenile
offenders
should
not
be
held
against
them
for
the
rest
of
their
lives
records
of
the
offences
of
juveniles
should
not
be
kept
for
longer
than
absolutely
necessary
n
just
how
long
is
necessary
would
undoubtedly
be
subject
to
great
debate
empirics
on
juvenile
offending
help
to
identify
an
appropriate
target
expunging
police
and
court
records
could
be
triggered
when
juveniles
hit
a
particular
age
such
as
eighteen
or
twenty
one
this
would
accord
with
offending
data
which
shows
that
offending
peaks
at
seventeen
and
then
sharply
and
steadily
decreases
n
as
a
result
the
intelligence
value
to
law
enforcement
of
all
that
the
delinquency
databases
contain
drops
off
just
as
sharply
and
steadily
into
the
future
since
it
is
increasingly
unlikely
to
be
actionable
information
there
is
less
justification
for
continuing
to
store
it
the
value
of
the
information
about
friends
and
associations
such
as
that
which
fills
gang
databases
diminishes
even
more
sharply
with
time
as
social
groups
and
activity
change
that
databasing
causes
such
extensive
harms
not
just
from
the
mere
gathering
of
the
information
but
also
from
the
retention
of
erroneous
information
and
the
broad
sharing
of
information
increases
the
need
for
limiting
its
storage
alternatively
records
could
be
expunged
when
a
juvenile
avoids
a
conviction
or
adjudication
for
a
certain
period
of
time
this
would
be
expungement
earned
not
by
simply
growing
old
but
by
behavior
data
about
desistance
would
support
such
an
approach
researchers
have
found
that
individuals
with
a
prior
criminal
justice
contact
who
stay
arrest
free
for
seven
years
or
more
pose
very
little
risk
of
future
crime
n
moreover
that
low
risk
converges
with
the
risk
of
a
same
aged
individual
from
the
general
population
at
around
seven
years
after
contact
and
approaches
though
never
equals
that
of
same
aged
individuals
with
a
clean
criminal
record
n
therefore
for
juveniles
who
avoid
arrests
and
conviction
there
would
be
little
risk
to
public
safety
of
destroying
their
old
records
the
upside
would
be
reduced
stigma
and
fewer
barriers
to
housing
education
and
employment
n
indeed
record
sealing
or
destruction
mechanisms
are
already
in
place
all
states
enable
the
destruction
expunging
or
sealing
of
some
juvenile
records
n
new
york
for
example
requires
fingerprint
records
to
be
destroyed
when
a
person
adjudicated
delinquent
reaches
the
age
of
twenty
one
or
has
been
discharged
from
placement
for
at
least
three
years
and
has
no
intervening
criminal
convictions
or
pending
criminal
actions
n
there
are
even
protections
in
some
states
for
juveniles
charged
in
criminal
court
under
youthful
offender
statutes
accusatory
instruments
can
be
sealed
and
records
that
would
otherwise
be
public
kept
confidential
n
the
software
that
enables
the
delinquency
databases
could
easily
accomplish
automatic
record
deletion
all
that
it
would
seemingly
require
would
be
an
allocation
of
resources
from
the
government
to
develop
programs
that
could
identify
records
due
for
sealing
or
destruction
and
accomplish
the
sealing
or
destruction
c
limiting

information
is

described
above

to
access

according
to
leading
criminal
records
scholar
jacobs
the
united
states
which
invented
a
juvenile
court
committed
to
confidentiality
now
is
exceptional
for
the
amount
of
juvenile
offender
information
that
is
disclosed
to
diverse
government
agencies
and
the
public
n
once
the
information
gets
beyond
law
enforcement
and
into
the
hands
of
employers
school
officials
and
landlords
the
harmful
impacts
are
felt
immediately
moreover
once
the
information
gets
beyond
law
enforcement
it
is
almost
impossible
to
make
it
go
away
or
control
the
havoc
it
wreaks
n
as
a
result
its
impact
is
lasting
this
liberal
policy
regarding
disclosure
is
in
part
linked
to
the
american
commitment
to
open
government
and
the
freedom
of
the
press
and
it
is
also
a
result
of
the
gradual
shift
of
law
enforcement
records
from
a
system
created
by
police
for
police
to
one
used
heavily
by
noncriminal
justice
actors
like
employers
and
schools
distributing
the
information
is
particularly
harmful
because
of
its
devastating
impacts
on
an
individual
s
ability
to
secure
employment
housing
and
school
that
accompany
sharing
criminal
history
n
not
only
does
criminal
history
information
sharing
frustrate
the
ability
of
young
people
and
adults
with
a
youthful
criminal
record
to
earn
a
living
educate
themselves
and
find
a
place
to
live
all
of
these
factors
are
linked
to
desistance
n
instead
of
punishing
youth
far
into
the
future
the
law
should
cabin
the
information
that
is
gathered
and
stored
by
law
enforcement
to
law
enforcement
as
much
as
possible
this
is
especially
true
for
intelligence
information
like
that
gathered
in
gang
databases
and
nonconviction
records
like
those

noncriminal

actors
like

principle

n
demands
that
the
criminal

system
only
share
police
record
information
when
it
reflects
certainty
that
the
act
was
committed
a
number
of
reforms
limiting
the
sharing
of
law
enforcement
records
have
recently
been
put
in
place
as
discussed
above
jurisdictions
are
limiting
the
extent
to
which
juveniles
are
subject
to
sex
offender
registration
and
federal
guidelines
do
not
require
that
juveniles
be
subject
to
community
notification
procedures
n
there
is
a
nationwide
movement
to
restrict
what
criminal
history
information
employers
can
access
n
colleges
are
beginning
to
add
nuance
to
their
use
of
criminal
history
information
in
admissions
instead
of
using
it
as
a
blunt
sorting
tool
n
public
schools
have
also
been
seeking
ways
to
minimize
law
enforcement
involvement
in
school
matters
n
as
these
efforts
demonstrate
limiting
what
criminal
history
information
gets
shared
beyond
law
enforcement
is
probably
the
most
attainable
reform
proposal
it
is
also
arguably
the
most
important
cabining
the
information
to
law
enforcement
reduces
the
negative
impact
the
criminal
justice
biography
may
have
while
they
are
still
subject
to
privacy
invasions
and
stigma
harms
and
law
enforcement
is
more
likely
to
police
them
and
their
communities
each
no
small
consequence
law
enforcement
does
not
hire
them
for
jobs
accept
them
to
colleges
or
act
as
their
landlord
without
access
to
the
information
employers
colleges
and
landlords
will
not
be
able
to
so
easily
discriminate
against
individuals
based
on
criminal
history
conclusion
because
adolescents
are
vulnerable
because
they
change
and
because
they
are
future
adults
we
must
strive
for
a
constellation
of
practices
that
protect
them
from
harm
and
promote
their
positive
development
the
criminal
justice
system
is
a
critical
part
of
that
constellation
with
renewed
vigor
courts
legislatures
and
policymakers
today
are
correcting
the
missteps
of
the
s
that
favored
treating
juveniles
like
adults
in
the
criminal
justice
system
by
reinstating
the
primacy
of
special
protections
for
youth
databasing
delinquency
a
broad
data
collection
retention
and
distribution
system
that
treats
juveniles
on
par
with
adults
reveals
that
two
pernicious
distortions
continue
to
inform
this
aspect
of
juvenile
justice
policy
first
youth
who
break
the
rules
are
seen
as
having
forfeited
the
protections
of
childhood
second
childhood
status
is
particularly
fragile
for
minority
youth
who
age
out
of
childhood
s
protective
space
sooner
than
white
youth
as
a
result
many
youth
are
saddled
with
a
record
of
mistakes
and
suspicions
that
haunt
them
into
adulthood
the
unwillingness
to
forgive
and
forget
youthful
mistakes
embedded
in
databasing
delinquency
ignores
the
fundamental
nature
of
adolescence
rather
than
pursuing
adult
like
surveillance
practices
in
the
name
of
public
safety
that
inflict
debilitating
short
and
long
term
harms
the
developmental
characteristics
of
youth
and
the
purpose
and
meaning
of
childhood
must
guide
juvenile
justice
policy
to
that
end
we
must
avoid
practices
that
unduly
stigmatize
that
permanently
punish
and
that
promote
or
entrench
criminal
behavior
by
limiting
the
information
that
the
criminal
justice
system
gathers
stores
and
shares
about
juveniles
we
can
avoid
those
harms
without
frustrating
public
safety

systems

have

two

this

first
i
investigate
the
role
played
by
advanced
military
technologies
and
methods
within
civilian

departments
these
approaches
have
enabled
a
new
focus
on
deterrence
and
crime
prevention
by
creating
a
system
of
structural
surveillance
where

automates
de

i

systems

their
effects

paying
particular
attention
to
the
racial
societal
economic
and
geographic
factors
that
play
into
the
public
perception
of
these
new

regimes
i
will
conclude
by
proposing
potential
solutions
to
this
problem
that
incorporate
tests
for
racial

to
create
an
alternative

introduction
as
militaries
transition
from

footing

posture
they
inevitably
shed
excess
equipment

technology
that
is

no

or
too

to
maintain
in
the
drawdown
from
the
wars

the

found
willing
recipients
of
this
material
in

police
departments
in

these
technology
transfers
local

military
tactics

procedures

originally
conceived
and
designed
for
military
units
in
combat
operations
for
use
in
their
day

policing
this
combination
has
led
to
the
overall
militarization
of
civilian
police
forces
in
the
united
states
putting
wartime
tools
in
the
hands
of
peace
officers
this
trend
toward
police
militarization
has

enthusiastic
support
from
departments
adhering
to
the
broken
windows
theory
of
policing
especially
with
respect
to
technologies
and
ttps
meant
for
intelligence
analysis
or
surveillance
purposes
the
locus
of
this
relationship
can
be
found
in
the
information
centric
approaches
found
in
broken
windows
policing
and
other
zero
tolerance
quality
of
life
police
programs
since
military
intelligence
has
long
prized
information
centric
methods
as
critical
to
the
goal
of
actionable
intelligence
militarized
systems
and
approaches
appear
to
be
a
perfect
fit
to
modern
policing
this
phenomenon
may
be
seen
as
the
natural
result
of
the
industrial
and
post
industrial
society
s
desire
to
maximize
control
and
efficiency
across
all
spheres
of
life
through
careful
observation
and
data
analysis
while
advances
in
policing
techniques
have
garnered
many
societal
benefits
they
have
also
established
a
system
of
structural
surveillance
that
has
entered
a
renaissance
with
the
help
of
military
technologies
automated
surveillance
analysis
systems
developed
in
the
wake
of
have
given
police
departments
a
powerful
toolkit
to
advance
algorithmic
policing
strategies
but
these
algorithmic
approaches
too
often
target
poor
and
minority
communities
inserting
a
de
facto
racial
component
into
the
system
even
when
the
automated
intelligence
systems
are
fed
objective
crime
data
for
example
in
a
recent
investigation
of
software
used
by
state
and
local
criminal
justice
authorities
to
predict
the
risk
of
recidivism
of
those
booked
into
city
and
county
jails
researchers
found
that
these
algorithms
were
not
only
wildly
inaccurate
in
their
assessments
but
were
also
highly
likely
to
falsely
flag
black
defendants
as
future
criminals
n
algorithmic
scoring
mechanisms
like
this
are
becoming
increasingly
common
tools
for
criminal
courts
and
law
enforcement
which
are
seeking
an
information
based
advantage
in
the
control
of
criminal
activity
these
programs
have
become
so
popular
in
fact
that
congress
is
considering
mandating
their
use
in
federal
prisons
n
this
article
examines
how
military
automated
surveillance
and
intelligence
systems
when
used
by
civilian
police
departments
to
enhance
predictive
policing
programs
have
reinforced
racial
bias
in
policing
i
will
focus
on
two
facets
of
this
problem
first
my
research
studies
the
role
played
by
advanced
military
technologies
and
methods
within
civilian
police
departments
these
methods
have
enabled
a
new
focus
on
deterrence
and
crime
prevention
by
creating
a
system
of
structural
surveillance
where
decision
support
relies
increasingly
upon
algorithms
and
automated
data
analysis
tools
and
which
automates
de
facto
penalization
and
containment
based
on
race
second
i
will
explore
these
systems
and
their
effects
from
an
outside
in
perspective
paying
particular
attention
to
racial
societal
economic
and
geographic
factors
that
play
into
the
public
perception
of
these
policing
regimes
i
will
conclude
by
proposing
potential
solutions
to
this
problem
that
incorporate
tests
for
racial
bias
to
create
an
alternative
system
that
follows
a
true
community
policing
model
i
the
militarization
of
police
intelligence
operations
the
militarization
of
civilian
law
enforcement
agencies
leas
has
long
been
viewed
as
anathema
to
the
founding
principles
of
the
united
states
and
corrosive
to
civil
liberties
in
a
constitutional
democracy
generally
n
paradoxically
contemporary
american
society
has
increasingly
taken
a
distinctly
militaristic
approach
to
solving
its
non
military
political
social
and
economic
issues
applying
war
metaphors
to
programs
and
policies
to
emphasize
the
seriousness
of
the
problem
and
the
approach
to
it
for
example
the
war
on
drugs
or
the
war
on
poverty
n
these
mixed
signals
have
been
the
backdrop
to
a
steady
increase
in
the
militarization
of
u
s
civilian
police
forces
post
world
war
ii
with
racial
tensions
broken
windows
policing
the
war
on
drugs
and
the
global
war
on
terror
acting
as
the
primary
catalysts
of
this
phenomenon
n
the
most
visible
aspect
of
police
militarization
can
be
seen
in
the
increased
deployment
within
leas
of
weapons
equipment
and
training
designed
for
use
in
combat
by
militaries
n
while
these
manifestations
might
be
the
most
outwardly
obvious
signs
of
this
militarization
trend
there
is
a
more
basic
facet
of
it
that
leas
have
almost
universally
adopted
intelligence
operations
n
a
military
intelligence
and
the
development
of
the
ooda
loop
the
importance
of
intelligence
operations
to
the
military
is
a
long
accepted
principle
since
as
often
quite
large
and
widely
distributed
organizations
militaries
are
expected
to
think
and
act
as
if
they
were
a
unitary
being
n
the
pace
environment
and
sheer
horror
of
combat
combine
to
create
a
state
of
near
chaos
the
realm
of
uncertainty
through
which
militaries
are
forced
to
navigate
n
to
mitigate
at
least
some
of
the
disorienting
effects
of
warfare
modern
militaries
must
organize
themselves
around
rational
bureaucratic
principles
with
robust
networks
of
communication
and
information
management
at
their
core
n
military
command
structures
simply
cannot
function
without
the
timely
communication
of
information
on
a
wide
range
of
broad
and
narrow
topics
including
terrain
troop
strength
and
movements
civilian
considerations
transportation
networks
availability
of
supplies
enemy
disposition
and
morale
weather
and
light
conditions
and
more
all
in
support
of
the
theory
that
the
better
prepared
and
informed
army
has
the
advantage
n
this
general
concept
is
often
referred
to
as
military
intelligence
or
more
succinctly
intelligence
n
the
term
intelligence
is
not
well
defined
however
as
it
draws
from
a
wide
array
of
broader
issues
such
as
strategy
command
and
control
and
communications
n
it
is
clearly
more
than
an
exhaustive
cataloging
of
all
available
information
even
if
this
were
possible
such
a
tool
would
quickly
prove
useless
to
militaries
as
their
organizations
became
mired
in
irrelevant
information
and
would
be
forced
to
spend
valuable
time
and
resources
ferreting
out
the
useful
bits
n
intelligence
therefore
must
produce
information
in
a
form
and
quantity
that
can
be
used
by
the
organization
to
make
timely
decisions
regarding
plans
and
operations
this
characteristic
is
often
summarized
as
actionable
intelligence
n
the
goal
of
perfectly
actionable
intelligence
is
often
unattainable
however
and
is
best
thought
of
in
aspirational
terms
n
the
industrialization
of
the
th
th
and
th
centuries
yielded
paradigmatic
advances
in
the
technology
and
subsequently
the
conduct
of
warfare
which
in
turn
brought
with
it
the
critical
need
for
more
rapidly
made
decisions
based
on
fresher
more
accurate
and
more
detailed
intelligence
n
the
united
states
military
experience
in
vietnam
illustrated
just
how
crucial
intelligence
and
communications
had
become
in
modern
warfare
where
larger
better
equipped
forces
were
often
outmatched
by
much
smaller
yet
better
informed
groups
of
guerrillas
and
regular
army
soldiers
n
the
post
vietnam
collapse
of
the
u
s
military
sent
shock
waves
through
the
pentagon
whose
leadership
began
the
arduous
process
of
rebuilding
a
communications
and
intelligence
centric
army
capable
of
fighting

fourth

this

flight
instructor
named
john
boyd
long
known
by
military
strategists
for
his
highly
analytical
approach
to
solving
military
problems
began
development
of
a
general
theory
of
military
organizational
analysis
and
action
he
sought
to
address
the
challenge
of
intelligence
and
communication
in
a
fast
moving
conflict
n
as
a
veteran
of
air
combat
flying
the
f
sabre
in
mig
alley
during
the
korean
war
boyd
knew
well
the
challenge
for
fighter
pilots
of
gathering
processing
and
acting
on
information
in
a
very
short
amount
of
time
all
while
flying
an
aircraft
filled
with
jet
fuel
and
munitions
at
hundreds
of
miles
per
hour
often
while
being
shot
at
n
boyd
a
student
not
only
of
the
great
modern
military
theorists
such
as
clausewitz
and
j
f
c
fuller
but
also
of
philosophers
mathematicians
and
physicists
including
kurt
godel
and
werner
heisenberg
actively
sought
out
symmetries
and
commonalities
in
his
analyses
in
an
attempt
to
get
at
the
true
root
of
the
problem
at
hand
n
his
multidisciplinary
approach
allowed
him
to
extrapolate
common
principles
from
his
experiences
and
in
he
authored
the
first
of
five
essays
on
the
cognitive
psychological
and
temporal
processes
core
to
all
military
intelligence
analysis
and
decision
making
processes
from
the
highest
command
levels
to
the
lowest
n
boyd
s
described
his
groundbreaking
theory
as
a
cognitive
cycle
containing
four
tasks
observation
orientation
decision
and
action
ooda
see
figure
n
these
actions
worked
together
to
create
a
feedback
loop
that
gave
those
who
were
more
adept
at
accelerating
this
loop
a
tactical
advantage
over
their
less
nimble
adversaries
as
applied
to
boyd
s
initial
use
of
the
term
in
aviation
combat
a
pilot
first
considers
the
relevant
information
available
about
the
situation
observation
such
as
an
adversary
s
weaponry
their
level
of
training
and
the
environmental
conditions
the
pilot
uses
these
observations
to
narrow
the
possible
universe
of
decisions
orientation
in
the
tactical
situation
based
on
these
first
two
steps
the
pilot
selects
the
best
solution
to
their
tactical
problem
decision
and
makes
the
necessary
adjustments
to
realize
their
decision
action
figure
the
ooda
loop
through
informed
use
of
the
boyd
cycle
more
often
referred
to
as
the
ooda
loop
one
could
not
only
gain
a
strategic
or
tactical
advantage
over
one
s
enemy
but
in
turn
disrupt
the
enemy
s
own
ooda
loop
by
denying
them
the
ability
to
run
through
its
stages
due
to
the
speed
at
which
you
are
able
to
run
through
your
own
n
the
goal
for
any
military
organization
according
to
boyd
is
to
increase
the
speed
at
which
it
can
navigate
this
cycle
or
to
tighten
the
ooda
loop
n
therefore
the
army
that
can
affect
the
tightest
ooda
loop
is
able
to
get
inside
their
opponent
s
cycle
and
thus
disrupt
their
ability
to
gather
process
and
act
on
intelligence
n
the
ooda
loop
as
boyd
observed
characterized
the
process
all
living
things
go
through
as
part
of
their
everyday
survival
n
learning
and
adapting
are
what
successful
individuals
and
groups
accomplish
faster
than
their
less
lucky
competitors
boyd
s
great
contribution
was
distilling
this
naturally
occurring
process
into
a
form
which
could
be
analyzed
and
implemented
by
military
strategists
and
tacticians
boyd
continued
to
develop
this
concept
through
the
mid
s
and
continued
to
present
his
theories
to
large
military
and
civilian
audiences
well
into
his
retirement
n
boyd
s
theories
enjoyed
moderate
success
among
contemporary
military
leadership
at
the
time
mainly
among
theorists
and
scholars
but
in
the
early
s
his
ideas
were
rediscovered
and
found
a
heightened
relevance
among
a
new
generation
of
warriors
joining
a
high
tech
military
in
a
post
world
n
this
renewed
popularity
soared
even
further
when
nonmilitary
and
quasi
military
organizations
seeking
a
competitive
advantage
over
crime
through
information
centric
efficiency
universally
accepted
as
the
path
to
success
since
the
earliest
days
of
industrialization
increasingly
turned
to
military
organizational
theories
and
doctrines
for
inspiration
n
b
the
audit
society
and
the
allure
of
information
management
while
boyd
s
ooda
loop
theories
were
revolutionary
in
their
military
context
their
foundations
began
to
form
nearly
two
centuries
earlier
with
the
emergence
of
industrialization
and
the
associated
growth
of
information
centric
organizational
theory
n
the
rise
of
bureaucracy
as
an
efficient
means
of
organizing
at
scales
unnecessary
in
agrarian
society
brought
with
it
a
strong
inclination
toward
surveillance
information
processing
and
data
based
planning
as
a
means
of
constant
management
and
improvement
a
school
of
thought
both
inspired
and
followed
by
military
organizational
theory
n
weber
s
theory
of
legitimate
order
and
authority
within
a
bureaucratic
structure
with
its
duties
without
regard
to
personal
considerations
and
an
obligation
to
obedience
provided
the
sort
of
military
based
organizational
socialization
needed
albeit
with
some
allowance
of
modification
for
less
martial
pursuits
for
the
management
of
such
modern
concepts
as
large
scale
factories
prisons
hospitals
and
law
enforcement
n
militaries
of
the
th
and
th
centuries
were
quick
to
adopt
these
organizational
innovations
which
fit
well
with
their
existing
hierarchical
frameworks
and
provided
the
tools
to
realize
a
modern
form
of
military
intelligence
and
personnel
management
which
contemporary
organizational
models
would
not
support
n
all
of
these
advances
were
necessary
to
support
and
maintain
large
armies
but
military
intelligence
was
perhaps
the
biggest
beneficiary
of
these
innovations
the
increasing
amounts
of
information
necessary
to
make
military
or
in
fact
any
state
decisions
in
a
rapidly
modernizing
world
highlighted
the
importance
of
bureaucracy
as
an
essential
tool
in
dealing
with
the
modern
crisis
of
control
n
but
even
with
the
benefit
of
a
modern
bureaucracy
some
of
which
already
existed
within
military
organizations
an
army
s
ability
to
process
intelligence
information
had
been
quite
limited
by
existing
technologies
n
this
limitation
of
a
military
organization
s
ability
to
make
informed
decisions
based
on
coded
intelligence
information
was
directly
dependent
upon
its
ability
to
communicate
store
and
process
that
information
described
in
weber
s
concept
of
rationalization
n
the
promise
of
increasingly
detailed
intelligence
pictures
improved
situational
awareness
generated
by
a
combination
of
the
improved
organizational
methods
of
weberian
bureaucracy
and
the
advances
in
communication
transportation
and
information
processing
technologies
of
industrialization
began
to
move
military
thinking
toward
an
information
centric
style
of
warfare
n
this
quest
for
more
information
better
data
processing
tools
and
improved
communication
methods
has
become
paradigmatic
of
modern
and
post
modern
society
n
this
control
revolution
as
beniger
puts
it
has
grown
to
permeate
every
area
of
society
where
efficiency
is
sought
bringing
with
it
a
need
to
develop
metrics
for
program
effectiveness
n
the
concept
of
civilian
police
agencies
is
driven
primarily
by
as
the
realization
of
a
society
s
social
control
function
and
as
such
makes
them
prime
candidates
for
the
information
centric
style
of
organization
and
leadership
n
the
quasi
military
structure
most
police
departments
now
adhere
to
can
be
found
in
the
organization
of
sir
robert
peel
s
london
metropolitan
police
in
credited
as
the
first
modern
civilian
law
enforcement
organization
n
the
rapid
industrialization
of
europe
and
the
united
states
in
the
first
half
of
the
th
century
brought
with
it
a
sudden
increase
in
the
population
much
of
it
concentrated
in
urban
areas
n
this
caused
no
small
amount
of
concern
among
the
upper
classes
who
feared
disease
petty
crime
property
damage
and
political
insurrections
just
to
name
a
few
of
the
phobias
the
ruling
elite
held
regarding
the
dangerous
classes
n
peel
as
chief
secretary
for
ireland
introduced
legislation
creating
paramilitary
forces
to
suppress
catholic
and
nationalist
disturbances
peel
applied
the
methods
he
had
refined
in
ireland
to
london
and
continued
the
use
of
the
military
organization
as
a
model
for
civilian
law
enforcement
n
in
addition
peel
recognized
that
former
members
of
the
military
made
excellent
candidates
for
the
role
of
civilian
police
officer
since
they
would
arrive
on
the
job
pre
acclimated
to
a
quasi
military
environment
and
would
have
an
instinctive
preference
for
hierarchy
discipline
and
order
n
these
somewhat
practical
decisions
cannot
however
be
separated
entirely
from
the
growth
of
information
centric
organization
theory
political
economics
and
surveillance
technologies
which
were
interlaced
with
much
of
the
social
political
and
economic
activity
of
industrialization
and
modernity
in
the
period
from
the
mid
th
through
the
mid
th
centuries
as
industrialization
in
western
nations
began
to
create
increasingly
complex
systems
of
interdependencies
between
manufacturing
capital
energy
production
labor
and
markets
new
means
of
communication
and
control
were
required
to
take
full
advantage
of
new
economies
of
scale
and
realize
productivity
levels
unheard
of
under
earlier
forms
of
management
and
organization
n
as
giddens
points
out
advances
in
the
information
management
enabled
organizations
to
form
more
effective
bureaucratic
structures
and
gave
these
budding
bureaucracies
more
control
over
the
timing
and
spacing
of
human
activities
n
these
advances
joined
with
the
modern
bureaucracy
s
growing
appetite
for
information
ultimately
led
to
the
surveillant
assemblage
as
integrated
into
our
contemporary
concept
of
governance
n
in
the
mid
s
a
movement
among
military
theorists
began
to
develop
around
the
concept
of
exploiting
a
technological
and
communications
advantage
to
create
a
new
kind
of
army
where
every
soldier
and
piece
of
material
was
equipped
with
sensors
that
would
allow
direct
communication
of
information
at
the
lowest
organizational
levels
but
would
also
pass
this
information
up
the
chain
of
command
to
give
military
leaders
a
god
s
eye
view
of
the
battle
space
allowing
for
even
tighter
ooda
loops
n
this
concept
generally
known
as
network
centric
warfare
envisioned
the
sort
of
information
driven
military
hitherto
impossible
now
enabled

like
the

also
discovered
the
promise
of
network
centricity
a
concept
that
fit
well
within
the
quasi
military
organizational
structures
found
in
most
police
organizations
n
beginning
in
the
mid
s
police
departments
especially
those
in
larger
u
s
cities
began
to
feel
political
pressure
to
address
what
was
widely
seen
as
a
crime
epidemic
and
the
downward
spiral
of
urban
decay
that
accompanied
a
post
industrial
economic
slowdown
n
the
standard
tactics
built
around
the
police
patrol
car
did
not
seem
to
be
having
any
real
success
in
reducing
the
crime
rate
and
leas
were
looking
for
alternatives
n
in
the
atlantic
monthly
published
an
article
written
by
two
social
scientists
who
after
studying
the
tactics
of
police
departments
concluded
that
disorder
and
crime
are
inextricably
linked
and
therefore
by
addressing
the
petty
crimes
associated
with
community
disorder
such
as
loitering
vandalism
and
public
intoxication
humble
crimes
that
were
generally
considered
unworthy
of
police
attention
leas
will
in
turn
prevent
the
more
serious
crimes
from
flourishing
in
those
areas
n
the
approach
became
known
as
broken
windows
policing
named
for
the
tendency
for
buildings
with
a
broken
window
to
encourage
further
window
breaking
and
other
forms
of
vandalism
a
phenomenon
described
by
stanford
psychologist
philip
zimbardo
in
his
well
known
abandoned
car
experiment
n
police
departments
in
large
american
cities
began
to
take
an
active
interest
in
the
broken
windows
theory
and
by
the
late
s
and
early
s
police
departments
in
new
york
city
chicago
and
los
angeles
had
all
implemented
some
version
of
this
model
n
in
new
york
then
mayor
rudy
giuliani
introduced
a
version
of
broken
windows
known
as
zero
tolerance
policing
which
placed
a
greater
emphasis
on
the
quality
of
life
issues
that
wilson
and
kelling
pointed
out
in
their
original
work
n
as
an
early
adopter
of
the
broken
windows
model
the
new
york
police
department
nypd
quickly
discovered
that
any
effective
implementation
of
such
a
program
would
require
curbing
disorder
not
only
on
the
streets
but
also
within
the
police
department
itself
which
had
been
in
a
decades
long
decline
of
poor
leadership
corruption
and
an
overall
breakdown
of
discipline
n
addressing
these
not
unrelated
problems
in
a
city
the
size
of
new
york
with
a
sworn
police
force
numbering
in
the
tens
of
thousands
would
require
an
approach
that
could
go
beyond
classical
organizational
techniques
n
the
data
and
network
centric
approaches
made
possible
by
the
rapid
technological
advances
beginning
in
the
late
s
and
early
s
and
implemented
as
a
successful
proof
of
concept
by
wal
mart
during
this
time
began
to
instill
in
the
nypd
other
police
departments
a
growing
faith
in
algorithms
and
automated
decision
tools
n
c
drugs
terrorism
and
the
blurring
of
military
and
civilian
spheres
the
confluence
of
military
and
police
use
of
data
and
network
centric
approaches
in
their
hitherto
separate
spheres
can
be
traced
in
its
earliest
forms
to
the
war
on
drugs
n
as
drug
trafficking
began
to
be
seen
not
only
as
a
law
enforcement
issue
but
also
a
threat
to
national
security
military
and
police
agencies
began
to
engage
as
partners
in
this
effort
sometimes
through
the
exchange
of
ideas
sometimes
quite
literally
through
interagency
actions
n
these
activities
were
complicated
by
the
fact
that
the
posse
comitatus
act
generally
prohibited
the
use
of
federal
military
forces
for
domestic
law
enforcement
purposes
n
congress
amended
the
posse
comitatus
act
in
to
address
this
legal
obstacle
which
allowed
for
military
support
of
civilian
leas
with
the
clear
legislative
intent
that
this
military
law
enforcement
cooperation
be
employed
in
counterdrug
operations
n
both
the
concept
and
the
realization
of
the
war
on
drugs
have
a
rather
spotty
record
n
the
political
rhetoric
that
tends
to
accompany
calls
for
such
a
war
creates
images
of
a
dangerous
other
who
threatens
social
stability
due
to
lax
morals
and
inherent
inabilities
to
exercise
self
control
n
efforts
within
the
war
on
drugs
are
therefore
designed
to
target
such
deviant
groups
within
society
and
by
doing
so
promise
to
reestablish
the
societal
values
held
by
the
upstanding
citizens
the
laws
are
there
to
protect
n
these
words
describing
the
dangerous
other
are
carefully
selected
to
mask
their
veiled
intent
to
play
on
white
fears
of
racial
minorities
n
the
disproportionate
effects
of
this
war
on
african
americans
and
hispanics
have
been
well
documented
resulting
in
broken
social
structures
overcrowded
prisons
and
a
retrenchment
of
jim
crow
policies
albeit
under
different
names
n
a
vivid
example
of
the
literal
law
enforcement
military
partnership
in
the
drug
war
can
be
found
in
the
formation
of
joint
task
force
now
known
as
joint
task
force
south
jtf
south
which
combined
combat
and
reconnaissance
forces
from
the
department
of
defense
dod
intelligence
services
and
civilian
leas
to
patrol
sections
of
the
u
s
mexican
border
on
drug
interdiction
missions
n
the
regular
armed
border
patrols
by
military
personnel
abruptly
stopped
in
after
a
young
u
s
marine
shot
and
killed
an
unarmed
civilian
n
the
american
public
s
appetite
for
the
use
of
military
troops
within
its
borders
evaporated
after
this
incident
only
to
be
revived
on
september
n
the
terrorist
attacks
of
opened
the
floodgates
on
law
enforcement
military
cooperation
with
many
of
the
political
and
legal
objections
to
such
partnerships
disappearing
almost
overnight
this
sudden
paradigm
shift
brought
on
by
a
level
of
terroristic
violence
previously
unthinkable
in
the
united
states
created
an
environment
within
which
the
traditionally
separate
spheres
of
military
and
civilian
law
enforcement
began
to
significantly
blur
n
the
military
contractors
large
and
small
that
tooled
up
to
support
the
war
effort
both
the
literal
combat
operations
in
afghanistan
and
iraq
as
well
as
the
larger
more
metaphorical
sense
began
making
much
of
this
material
available
to
civilian
leas
including
machine
guns
semi
automatic
shotguns
night
vision
equipment
sniper
rifles
combat
uniforms
grenades
and
high
tech
surveillance
gear
n
many
civilian
police
departments
were
especially
appreciative
of
the
expansion
of
two
dod
programs
designed
to
equip
leas
with
military
gear
through
the
transfer
or
direct
purchase
of
material
n
because
of
the
highly
visible
nature
of
military
equipment
such
as
armored
personnel
carriers
flash
bang
grenades
and
sniper
rifles
much
of
the
subsequent
attention
from
those
examining
the
increased
militarization
of
civilian
police
forces
has
been
focused
on
these
items
n
but
the
use
of
this
sort
of
military
gear
by
civilian
law
enforcement
is
largely
limited
to
special
police
units
and
is
not
typically
found
on
the
average
patrol
officer
n
it
is
the
widespread
and
increased
adoption
by
civilian
police
agencies
of
military
intelligence
technologies
many
of
which
are
integrated
invisibly
into
existing
police
information
and
decision
support
tools
which
likely
has
a
more
dramatic
impact
across
entire
police
departments
this
invisibility
coupled
with
an
unproven
or
misplaced
faith
in
these
technologies
has
led
to
a
growing
system
of
structural
surveillance
that
has
had
a
disparate
racial
impact

many
cases

recognized

could
be
found
not

on

also
within

changing
the
direction
of
an
organization
the
size
of
the
nypd
as
a
shift
to
the
broken

model
surely
required
would
be
a
difficult
task
in
even
the
most
functional
of
police
departments
something
new
york
city
had
not
had
for
decades
n
the
organizational
management
tools
necessary
for
such
an
endeavor
simply
did
not
exist
until
advances
in
information
technology
opened
up
the
possibility
of
automated

that
could
take
vast
amounts
of

as
input
analyze

and
provide
critical
insights
to
its
human
users
all
within
the
relative
blink
of
an
eye
n
it
was
exactly
this
sort
of
system
that
a
few
forward
thinkers
within
the
nypd
proposed
as
a
solution
to
their
burgeoning
organizational
management
problem
in
nypd
commissioner
william
bratton
revealed
the
compstat
program
as
a
centralized
solution
to
the
department
s
organizational
dilemma
n
the
goal
of
the
program
was
to
obtain
accurate
up
to
date
crime
statistics
at
every
level
within
the
department
something
that
had
proven
impossible
up
to
that
point
n
by
requiring
patrol
officers
to
keep
records
of
their
daily
activities
including
stops
arrests
and
the
details
of
each
incident
the
nypd
could
collect
these
data
on
a
computer
database
which
allowed
them
to
generate
weekly
books
of
city
wide
statistics
they
could
slice
and
dice
as
they
saw
fit
if
they
wanted
statistics
on
gun
crimes
specifically
or
wished
to
compare
precinct
activity
they
could
do
so
with
relative
ease
n
with
these
data
and
analysis
tools
the
nypd
could
now
begin
to
efficiently
address
the
city
s
broken
windows
trouble
spots
and
do
so
by
directing
the
minimum
amount
of
manpower
to
the
right
place
at
the
right
time
exactly
the
outcome
giuliani
and
bratton
sought
n
the
nypd
began
to
see
a
significant
amount
of
success
with
the
compstat
system
both
with
their
ability
to
address
the
quality
of
life
crimes
highlighted
by
broken
windows
policing
as
well
as
in
their
ability
to
effectively
manage
a
large
and
growing
police
force
n
this
successful
adoption
gave
compstat
a
fair
amount
of
national
publicity
and
it
was
touted
alongside
broken
windows
policing
as
the
new
paradigm
of
crime
prevention
in
the
united
states
n
soon
other
cities
began
to
emulate
and
adapt
compstat
systems
within
their
own
police
departments
n
with
the
early
success
of
compstat
also
came
a
redoubled
faith
in
the
possibilities
of
automated
law
enforcement
intelligence
systems
allowing
police
departments
to
do
more
with
less
n
as
police
departments
became
increasingly
convinced
that
the
broken
windows
model
of
policing
with
its
dynamic
problem
oriented
approach
would
replace
the
old
static
bureaucratic
model
that
police
agencies
had
relied
on
for
generations
they
began
to
accept
and
explore
more
deeply
the
managerial
tools
and
techniques
offered
by
algorithmic
data
driven
systems
n
this
new
thinking
sparked
a
flurry
of
data
and
network
centric
experiments
in
leas
around
the
world
and
revived
a
global
interest
in
an
intelligence
based
model
of
policing
that
had
been
deployed
by
british
police
departments
since
the
s
n
b
the
rise
of
intelligence
led
policing
the
british
model
of
intelligence
led
policing
was
developed
in
part
as
a
response
to
the
privatization
initiatives
in
the
uk
in
the
s
and
s
where
portions
of
government
services
were
either
taken
over
by
private
companies
or
adopted
a
private
business
model
within
their
organizations
effectively
becoming
quasi
private
agencies
n
the
british
national
criminal
intelligence
service
ncis
originally
organized
to
address
drug
trafficking
and
later
expanded
to
include
organized
crime
generally
adopted
a
business
data
processing
model
to
develop
the
national
intelligence
model
nim
a
nationwide
system
for
use
by
all
police
agencies
across
the
uk
replacing
their
existing
bureaucratic
management
processes
with
an
intelligence
led
policing
model
n
this
model
had
been
developed
by
british
authorities
to
mimic
the
traditional
military
intelligence
model
where
data
are
collected
and
analyzed
in
order
to
identify
patterns
and
generate
actionable
intelligence
to
best
prioritize
the
deployment
of
patrols
based
on
a
set
of
problem
oriented
goals
n
it
is
not
difficult
to
see
the
allure
of
such
a
system
the
combination
of
tightening
budgets
increased
public
concern
over
crime
and
disorder
and
a
rising
perception
that
the
world
had
become
a
more
dangerous
place
due
in
large
part
to
drug
trafficking
terrorism
and
a
general
breakdown
of
civil
order
created
an
environment
that
made
automated
solutions
to
these
problems
all
the
more
credible
rapid
advances
in
technology
and
research
into
data
mining
and
automated
intelligent
decision
support
systems
began
to
instill
in
police
departments
a
newfound
enthusiasm
for
technology
not
generally
seen
since
the
days
of
sputnik
and
the
space
race
researchers
began
looking
for
existing
mathematical
and
physical
models
which
could
provide
even
faster
and
more
accurate
intelligence
n
by
the
late
s
police
departments
began
to
consider
the
possibility
that
intelligence
led
policing
coupled
with
advanced
technologies
and
analytical
tools
could
move
leas
beyond
mere
crime
fighting
and
into
the
realm
of
crime
prevention
n
c
the
tantalizing
prospect
of
predictive
policing
organizations
seeking
to
tighten
their
respective
ooda
loops
have
followed
boyd
s
logic
to
an
inevitable
conclusion
instead
of
merely
seeking
further
methods
to
tighten
the
ooda
loop
they
find
ways
to
tighten
the
loop
to
a
point
where
it
has
inverted
into
itself
that
is
the
decision
cycle
becomes
predictive
rather
than
reactive
n
the
possibility
of
preventing
crime
before
it
actually
happens
has
been
the
holy
grail
of
police
departments
especially
when
local
state
and
federal
governments
were
actively
looking
for
ways
to
cut
back
on
police
budgets
n
the
apparent
successes
of
broken
windows
and
zero
tolerance
policing
backed
by
sophisticated
decision
support
systems
like
compstat
and
intelligence
led
policing
gave
many
in
law
enforcement
the
firm
belief
that
these
systems
and
methodologies
would
eventually
yield
tools
that
would
collect
the
massive
amounts
of
data
now
available
from
inside
and
outside
of
police
departments
swiftly
store
and
analyze
those
data
and
produce
results
to
anticipate
prevent
and
respond
more
effectively
to
future
crime
n
a
common
trope
among
police
department
is
that
an
experienced
and
talented
officer
can
apply
their
knowledge
and
analytical
skills
to
attain
an
imperfect
version
of
predictive
policing
but
that
the
model
does
not
scale
well
n
the
benefit
these
new
analytical
tools
and
methods
could
bring
to
these
officers
could
mean
the
difference
between
investigating
a
crime
that
just
occurred
versus
preventing
the
crime
from
happening
in

alone
make
this
a
worthy
goal
for
a
data
and
network
centric
police
force

for
such
a
police
intelligence
system
to
work
as
advertised
one
needs

provide

the
nearest
thing
to
a
god
s
eye
view
thus
allowing
the
analyst
to
find
the
proverbial
needle
in
the
haystack
n
this
means
police
agencies
need
to
turn
to
nontraditional
sources
of
information
such
as
social
media
as
well
as
developing
and
refining
internal
data
sources

approach

is
rushed

otherwise
undertaken
without

full
understanding

implications
can
include
not

the

obvious
issues

also
technical
liabilities

criticisms
of
the
broken
windows
policing
model
the
broken
windows
policing
model
along
with
the
collection
of
technologies
and
techniques
supporting
this
approach
have
met
with
a
growing
body
of
criticisms
even
as
police
departments
continue
to
adopt
and
promote
these
methods
n
central
to
many
of
these
criticisms
is
the
core
role
that
disorder
plays
in
the
broken
windows
model
specifically
the
subjective
definition
and
measurement
of
the
term
as
well
as
the
limited
beneficiaries
of
this
approach
n
these
criticisms
have
seriously
questioned
the
premise
of
broken
windows
citing
statistics
that
indicate
that
the
broken
windows
model
has
a
measurable
direct
negative
effect
on
the
very
neighborhoods
and
communities
whose
hot
spots
were
supposedly
the
beneficiaries
of
increased
police
focus
n
among
the
sharpest
critiques
of
the
broken
windows
policing
model
is
that
whatever
the
original
intent
was
of
such
programs
their
implementations
have
been
less
about
policing
disorder
than
about
the
control
of
poor
neighborhoods
and
poor
people
most
of
whom
are
racial
minorities
n
the
longstanding
practice
within
the
american
legal
system
of
using
race
as
a
signal
of
increased
risk
of
criminal
behavior
combined
with
programs
encouraging
police
officers
to
gather
intelligence
data
through
arbitrary
stop
and
frisk
programs
sometimes
referred
to
as
enhanced
terry
stops
to
feed
into
automated
intelligence
systems
has
created
an
environment
where
racial
minorities
end
up
bearing
the
costs
of
broken
windows
while
wealthy
white
communities
tend
to
see
the
majority
of
its
benefits
n
the
social
disorder
that
broken
windows
policing
targets
has
been
shown
to
be
a
very
fluid
concept
where
the
perceptions
of
a
minority
neighborhood
s
residents
are
often
far
different
than
those
of
the
police
officers
patrolling
those
neighborhoods
who
frequently
come
from
other
wealthier
neighborhoods
n
the
result
of
the
intelligence
data
collected
based
on
race
or
class
bias
or
parochial
perceptions
of
social
disorder
creates
an
inherent
bias
in
automated
decision
support
systems
that
tends
to
be
reinforced
with
every
trip
around
the
ooda
loop
n
this
result
can
be
directly
traced
to
the
sort
of
feedback
loops
data
centric
decision
support
systems
like
compstat
are
prone
to
encounter
n
that
is
if
the
data
used
to
initiate
an
automated
decision
support
tool
is
biased
or
otherwise
flawed
the
actionable
intelligence
that
emerges
will
likely
also
be
biased
or
flawed
if
this
bad
intelligence
is
then
acted
upon
the
resulting
stops
or
arrests
will
likely
generate
even
more
bad
data
which
is
then
fed
back
into
the
decision
support
system

so
on

neutrality
and
bias
what
makes
automated
predictive
policing
systems
an
attractive
as
a
solution
for
leas
seeking
to
increase
efficiency
is
the
same
aspect
that
makes
them
potentially
dangerous
we
tend
to
implicitly
trust
algorithms
and
data
since
we
assume
that
computers
have
no
bias
and
numbers
do
not
lie
n
this
common
misconception
is
based
on
two
fundamental
misunderstandings
of
automated
decision
support
or
expert
systems
first
while
it
is
true
that
computers
as
finite
state
machines
that
at
their
core
no
pun
intended
are
strictly
limited
to
the
instructions
we
give
them
through
their
programming
it
does
not
follow
that
the
algorithms
we
run
on
these
computers
are
necessarily
unbiased
computer
programs
algorithms
coded
by
humans
into
a
form
a
computer
s
chipset
can
interpret
are
written
with
the
objectives

choices
and
general
experiences
of
the
programmer
as
background
the
series
of
instructions
data
structures
and
design
choices
that
end
up
in
a
finished
computer
program
can
often
translate
subtle
biases
often
in
unexpected
ways
n
for
example
from
an
algorithmic
modeling
perspective
incorrect
or
imbalanced
input
data
has
long
been
shown
to
lead
to
biased
results
n
perhaps
the
most
commonly
used
statistical
method
in
predictive
modeling
systems
is
linear
regression
n
particularly
a
maximum
likelihood
linear
regression
which
is
a
widely
used
technique
in
military
and
police
predictive
intelligence
systems
n
in
systems
such
as
these
the
data
used
often
contain
a
large
number
of
events
belonging
to
one
class
while
the
other
class
contains
only
a
few
data
points
a
data
disparity
known
as
a
class
imbalance
n
this
phenomenon
often
occurs
in
data
where
the
event
of
interest
the
crime
is
sampled
far
more
frequently
than
non
events
n
this
problem
also
manifests
itself
in
the
differences
in
class
data
representations
between
the
sample
set
and
the
actual
population
known
as
sampling
bias
n
there
are
of
course
statistical
sampling
methods
to
mitigate
these
effects
but
there
is
no
clear
consensus
as
to
which
method
of
class
distribution
sampling
will
work
best
in
all
or
even
most
situations
n
the
best
solutions
tend
to
be
those
that
are
specially
selected
based
on
such
factors
as
the
statistical
methods
employed
the
population
size
the
sample
size
and
specifics
regarding
the
event
in
question
n
in
plain
language
this
means
that
a
one
size
fits
all
solution
is
likely
to
produce
questionable
results
at
best
and
at
worst
dangerously
biased
results
this
danger
becomes
increasingly
amplified
when
one
examines
the
trend
of
police
analysis
being
extended
from
the
realm
of
geospatial
analysis
predicting
which
neighborhoods
are
most
likely
to
be
crime
hot
spots
to
the
individual
where
police
keep
close
tabs
on
people
who
according
to
predictive
algorithms
are
more
likely
to
be
involved
in
future
crimes
n
c
the
introduction
of
automation
bias
the
rise
of
the
information
and
audit
society
and
the
associated
increase
in
the
use
of
automated
information
systems
in
organizational
decision
making
often
leads
to
an
overreliance
on
and
overconfidence
in
the
results
of
these
systems
this
automation
bias
leads
to
misuse
of
automated
intelligence
systems
combined
with
automation
induced
user
complacency
n
the
negative
effects
of
this
automation
bias
have
been
seen
in
healthcare
transportation
power
distribution
defense
and
space
exploration
often
with
serious
life
threatening
consequences
n
there
are
multiple
reasons
for
this
behavior
including
our
natural
tendencies
to
seek
out
paths
of
least
cognitive
effort
to
expend
less
energy
when
part
of
a
team
including
teams
with
automated
members
and
to
treat
computers
as
decision
making
authorities
n
these
errors
have
been
further
categorized
into
two
classes
that
manifest
in
automated
environments
omission
errors
where
operators
fail
to
respond
to
system
anomalies
because
the
automated
system
fails
to
detect
or
warn
of
them
and
commission
errors
where
users
blindly
follow
incorrect
guidance
from
automated
systems
in
spite
of
contraindications
from
other
information
sources
n
studies
have
repeatedly
shown
that
automation
bias
of
both
types
leads
to
users
making
incorrect
decisions
at
a
rate
as
high
as
even
when
the
information
they
needed
to
make
the
correct
decision
was
readily
available
n
automation
bias
becomes
especially
dangerous
when
life
or
liberty
is
at
stake
multiple
studies
in
domains
such
as
health
care
air
transportation
and
military
command
and
control
have
repeatedly
shown
how
bias
and
complacency
lead
users
of
automated
systems
to
make
very
costly
mistakes
n
in
military
environments
especially
overconfidence
in
the
authority
of
automated
decision
support
systems
can
be
particularly
catastrophic
where
the
importance
of
situational
awareness
is
paramount
n
the
average
person
is
well
equipped
to
engage
in
naturalistic
decision
making
processes
where
one
is
expected
to
solve
real
world
problems
under
a
certain
amount
of
stress
n
we
are
however
prone
to
overreliance
on
sources
of
information
that
we
regard
as
authoritative
n
military
intelligent
decision
support
systems
operate
within
organizational
hierarchies
wherein
users
are
predisposed
through
their
training
to
defer
to
authorities
within
their
supervisory
structure
a
trait
that
remains
in
effect
when
users
of
these
systems
seek
guidance
from
algorithms
and
data
structures
n
the
natural
result
is
an
amplification
of
automation
bias
in
these
overtly
hierarchical
environments
where
users
exhibit
tendencies
to
rely
exclusively
on
automated
systems
even
when
conflicting
information
is
presented
by
other
available
systems
n
the
transfer
of
military
intelligent
decision
support
systems
to
civilian
law
enforcement
organizations
where
the
paramilitary
organizational
structure
closely
resembles
that
of
the
military
makes
police
susceptible
to
the
same
dangerous
automation
bias
exhibited
in
military
environments
so
how
do
law
enforcement
organizations
take
advantage
of
continued
advances
in
automated
intelligence
and
decision
support
techniques
without
either
further
alienating
the
communities
they
serve
or
succumbing
to
various
data
and
algorithm
based
biases
iv
a
community
policing
solution
to
algorithmic
race
bias
of
course
to
completely
ignore
the
opportunities
presented
by
advances
in
automation
makes
no
sense
there
are
many
tasks
that
computers
simply
do
better
than
humans
such
as
repetitive
tasks
rapid
response
to
control
tasks
rule
based
deductive
reasoning
and
simultaneous
task
handling
n
as
our
systems
both
human
and
computer
grow
increasingly
complex
we
need
automation
to
give
us
the
enhanced
capabilities
to
handle
time
critical
and
complex
control
environments
the
trick
then
is
to
recognize
the
critical
role
automated
information
systems
play
in
these
domains
but
at
the
same
time
maintain
an
informed
awareness
of
the
pitfalls
an
overreliance
on
automated
decision
support
can
bring
this
is
of
great
importance
to
leas
who
have
a
special
duty
to
their
communities
not
only
to
enforce
the
laws
but
also
to
protect
and
maintain
the
health
and
safety
of
everyone
in
those
communities
allocating
the
appropriate
amount
of
functionality
between
police
officers
and
automated
systems
is
critical
to
this
role
in
this
section
i
recommend
a
two
element
approach
to
this
problem
that
takes
into
account
both
the
important
social
role
police
play
within
their
communities
as
well
as
the
phenomenon
of
automation
and
data
bias
that
can
artificially
reinforce
racial
disparities
in
police
treatment
a
a
return
to
the
original
intent
of
community
policing
a
significant
part
of
the
original
broken
windows
policing
concept
articulated
by
wilson
and
kelling
was
the
role
of
the
police
officer
in
reassuring
community
members
of
their
safety
and
maintaining
a
high
degree
of
sensitivity
to
signaling
by
community
residents
with
respect
not
only
to
criminal
activity
but
also
with
their
comfort
with
the
police
agency
itself
n
community
policing
requires
a
more
holistic
approach
to
the
problem
of
public
safety
that
goes
beyond
mere
crime
fighting
to
encompass
overall
community
health
safety
and
quality
of
life
n
under
this
model
crime
fighting
was
not
an
end
in
itself
but
the
means
toward
healthier
communities
and
was
seen
as
a
more
modern
inclusive
method
of
policing
n
too
many
implementations
of
broken
windows
and
intelligence
led
policing
models
however
failed
to
follow
through
on
this
part
of
the
theory
rather
than
measure
their
performance
and
direct
their
activities
using
data
that
reflected
a
community
s
overall
health
and
quality
of
life
systems
like
compstat
relied
heavily
sometimes
exclusively
on
traditional
crime
statistics
such
as
the
number
of
stops
arrests
and
clearance
rates
despite
the
fact
that
these
metrics
have
repeatedly
been
shown
to
have
little
to
no
bearing
on
overall
community
safety
n
sadly
this
flawed
approach
to
the
original
community
policing
concept
originates
in
the
fact
that
these
crime
statistics
are
easy
to
collect
and
measure
and
police
departments
have
developed
a
high
degree
of
comfort
with
these
metrics
over
the
years
n
thus
the
most
direct
approach
to
solving
the
problem
of
bad
data
leading
to
biased
results
from
data
centric
decision
support
tools
is
to
require
that
police
departments
retool
their
data
collection
and
analysis
efforts
toward
more
meaningful
metrics
another
misinterpreted
requirement
of
the
original
wilson
and
kelling
model
is
the
concept
of
proactive
policing
most
police
departments
implementing
broken
windows
models
have
designed
their
systems
as
incident
oriented
frameworks
which
do
a
poor
job
at
addressing
levels
of
criminality
in
a
community
and
serve
mainly
to
feed
a
cycle
of
incarceration
n
the
wilson
and
kelling
method
of
proactive
policing
focuses
instead
on
the
root
causes
of
criminality
such
as
poverty
economic
and
ecological
injustice
and
racism
where
police
departments
form
part
of
a
larger
community
team
to
go
beyond
the
punishing
of
window
breakers
and
actually
fix
the
broken
windows
n
finally
community
policing
requires
police
departments
to
hone
their
sensitivities
to
cultural
norms
and
the
needs
of
the
community
since
perceptions
of
social
disorder
can
be
highly
dependent
upon
time
place
and
circumstance
and
most
police
officers
are
not
residents
of
the
communities
they
patrol
n
public
perceptions
can
also
vary
by
context
which
means
social
disorder
often
falls
into
the
i
can
t
define
it
but
i
know
it
when
i
see
it
category
n
when
police
officers
develop
a
feel
for
their
communities
they
patrol
they
will
also
benefit
their
departments
by
providing
better
more
meaningful
intelligence
data
which
can
then
be
used
to
improve
their
decision
support
outcomes
n
police
department
policies
and
procedures
that
are
put
in
place
with
automated
decision
support
tools
like
compstat
which
supports
the
broken
windows
policing
regimes
have
had
a
distinctly
negative
effect
on
minority
communities
n
as
discussed
in
section
iii
above
this
problem
is
not
a
new
one
but
is
instead
one
that
has
been
exacerbated
by
the
use
of
military
tactics
and
technologies
n
leas
already
obligated
to
collect
evidence
especially
feel
the
pressure
in
information
societies
to
observe
collect
record
and
evaluate
all
available
data
n
this
predilection
leads
police
to
treat
their
communities
as
intelligence
landscapes
and
people
as
data
elements
n
resulting
in
dissociative
or
adversarial
relationships
between
cop
and
citizen
n
this
result
is
counter
to
the
original
intent
behind
community
policing
n
in
hindsight
there
is
a
certain
level
of
disconnect
between
the
algorithmic
policing
model
and
the
community
policing
model
since
algorithmic
policing
seeks
to
build
a
centralized
automated
police
force
that
operates
from
the
inside
out
while
the
community
policing
model
requires
a
process
that
begins
and
ends
with
the
citizen
n
but
a
key
driver
behind
broken
windows
and
algorithmic
policing
is
a
heightened
fear
of
crime
and
disorder
a
fear
that
has
not
diminished
significantly
over
the
past
few
decades
despite
the
nearly
universal
drop
in
crime
rates
nationally
n
a
necessary
part
of
this
transformation
therefore
is
to
cultivate
a
base
level
of
trust
within
police
organizations
as
well
as
stakeholder
communities
one
method
of
building
this
trust
is
to
continue
to
use
the
automated
policing
systems
while
redesigning
them
to
focus
on
local
community
goals
rather
than
those
of
police
departments
or
outside
interests
transparency
is
critical
to
this
step
s
success
police
management
must
create
a
system
through
which
community
members
can
not
only
seek
police
assistance
but
can
examine
the
systems
and
goals
the
police
themselves
use
to
guide
their
day
to
day
patrol
activities
another
critical
part
of
this
transformation
is
an
immediate
increase
in
accountability
within
police
departments
automation
bias
data
bias
and
corrupted
procedures
and
goals
often
give
police
departments
a
certain
amount
of
artificial
cover
when
things
go
badly
however
technological
opacity
is
no
substitute
for
human
accountability
up
and
down
the
lea
management
chain
finally
law
enforcement
resources
must
be
shifted
towards
a
citizen
focused
organization
giving
rank
and
file
police
officers
the
power
to
help
drive
automation
policy
while
also
giving
them
the
discretion
to
problem
solve
independent
of
the
automated
process
b
incorporate
outcome
and
process
feedback
into
existing
systems
we
live
in
a
time
in
which
our
lives
are
increasingly
influenced
and
affected
whether
we
know
it
or
not
by
data
algorithms
and
machine
learning
n
it
would
be
a
mistake
to
believe
that
police
departments
would
somehow
be
immune
to
this
trend
therefore
the
solution
to
modern
or
post
modern
problems
of
public
safety
is
not
to
go
the
way
of
ned
ludd
but
to
develop
police
decision
support
systems
with
an
eye
toward
civil
rights
and
avoiding
race
discrimination
and
economic
injustice
the
key
principle
in
developing
any
of
these
systems
is
transparency
in
floyd
et
al
v
city
of
new
york
n
the
court
held
that
the
nypd
s
stop
and
frisk
program
violated
the
fourth
amendment
by
systematically
conducting
warrantless
searches
of
pedestrians
the
majority
of
which
were
african
american
or
hispanic
under
the
nypd
s
stop
and
frisk
program
police
made
over
million
stops
between
and
n
over
half
of
these
stops
were
of
black
citizens
thirty
percent
were
of
hispanic
citizens
and
only
ten
percent
were
of
white
citizens
n
the
guidelines
that
backed
such
a
system
were
based
on
opaque
police
policy
decisions
implementing
a
broken
windows
policing
model
and
thereby
creating
the
sort
of
insular
environment
that
often
fails
to
punish
bad
actors
and
creates
perverse
incentives
n
further
since
most
police
departments
do
not
employ
software
developers
or
statisticians
they
are
forced
to
purchase
their
decision
support
systems
from
third
party
contractors
n
the
same
principles
of
transparency
should
apply
to
contractors
so
as
to
avoid
these
problems
next
algorithmic
and
predictive
policing
systems
need
to
be
based
on
accurate
and
meaningful
data
for
example
police
stop
and
frisk
programs
despite
criticisms
and
claims
of
racial
bias
inherent
in
these
programs
have
been
widely
supported
by
leas
based
on
their
assertions
that
while
more
minorities
are
subject
to
these
stops
it
is
only
because
minorities
commit
disproportionately
more
crimes
than
whites
and
not
due
to
any
particular
bias
of
police
officers
and
departments
n
to
support
these
claims
police
often
cite
automated
police
intelligence
systems
such
as
compstat
to
justify
these
stops
n
statistical
studies
conducted
on
stop
and
frisk
data
however
have
shown
that
minorities
are
far
more
likely
subjects
of
these
programs
with
statistical
patterns
pointing
toward
a
structural
racial
bias
reinforced
through
automated
decision
support
tools
n
finally
we
must
be
cognizant
of
the
limitations
of
purely
technical
solutions
to
human
problems
mathematical
and
computer
models
of
real
life
systems
can
of
course
provide
critical
insights
into
complex
systems
but
they
are
imperfect
algorithms
for
deriving
patterns
from
large
amounts
of
seemingly
random
data
are
getting
better
as
research
and
technology
progress
but
their
most
effective
use
within
the
broken
windows
policing
model
is
as
a
supplemental
tool
informing
human
decision
making
not
as
a
digital
crutch
upon
which
bad
practices
and
biased
policing
may
rest
further
known
biases
in
automation
systems
can
be
mitigated
through
a
number
of
established
means
for
example
automation
bias
and
automation
complacency
can
be
avoided
by
increasing
accountability
by
the
users
of
a
system
n
by
requiring
system
operators
to
provide
complete
justifications
for
their
decisions
beyond
the
machine
told
me
so
users
will
be
driven
toward
deeper
cognitive
engagement
and
awareness
of
alternative
information
sources
n
the
level
of
automation
used
in
a
situation
should
also
be
carefully
assessed
on
a
domain
basis
that
is
the
level
of
automation
available
can
exceed
the
level
of
automation
necessary
for
a
given
situation
n
repetitive
rigid
tasks
that
expect
no
user
decision
making
flexibility
are
often
good
candidates
for
a
high
degree
of
automation
while
those
tasks
that
rely
on
human
intuition
pattern
perception
and
contextual
reasoning
are
best
served
with
lower
levels
of
automation
n
much
of
the
work
of
law
enforcement
falls
into
this
latter
category
for
the
time
being
algorithmic
and
predictive
approaches
are
only
as
useful
as
their
human
creators
selecting
the
proper
policing
model
for
every
instance
is
likely
impossible
so
one
of
the
most
important
decisions
in
the
field
of
machine
learning
is
the
selection
of
the
model
that
will
provide
superior
results
for
a
particular
problem
a
task
which
still
requires
an
experienced
and
informed
human
in
the
loop
n
but
this
limit
can
be
leveraged
as
a
benefit
rather
than
a
liability
by
using
predictive
systems
to
decentralize
police
command
structures
and
allow
more
creativity
and
initiative
among
rank
and
file
patrol
officers
characteristics
that
are
critical
to
a
true
community
policing
model
n
conclusion
the
problem
of
bias
in
algorithmic
policing
has
deep
roots
as
evidenced
above
solutions
to
this
problem
cannot
ignore
technological
advances
that
help
us
make
better
more
efficient
decisions
but
they
also
cannot
allow
these
technologies
to
subvert
the
proper
role
of
public
safety
in
our
communities
we
live
in
an
information
society
that
is
once
again
experiencing
a
crisis
of
control
that
we
are
naturally
inclined
to
solve
through
data
and
analytic
methods
but
our
approach
must
be
based
on
lessons
learned
from
our
successes
and
failures
in
this
arena
many
of
these
failures
have
led
to
a
trust
deficit
between
authorities
and
the
communities
they
govern
especially
where
racial
prejudices
have
been
part
of
these
failures
addressing
these
disparities
in
algorithmic
policing
cannot
solve
all
of
these
problems

with
it
a
requirement
to
explain
its
definition

context
here
i
refer
to
control
in
its
most
general
sense
to
influence
or
direct
behavior
toward
some
predetermined
goal
this
definition
is
informed
by
the
sociology
literature
which
examines
the
social
relationship
the
organization
voluntary
or
compulsory
social
participation
and
consensual
and
imposed
order
hence
control
in
this
sense
is
primarily
concerned
with
the
two
elements
of
influence
and
purpose
and
control
theory

among

perhaps
the

is
that
of

rapid
advances
in
manufacturing

transportation
technologies
brought
an
abrupt
end

societies

thus
required

to

may

the

reported
phys

it
is
the
first
time
that
social
media
has
been
used
in
the
united
states
to
create
predictive
policing
models
of
hate
crime
over
the
next
three
years
the
team
will
be
closely
scrutinizing
data
taken
from
twitter
and
cross
referencing
this
with
reported
hate
crimes
in
los
angeles
to
develop
markers
or
signatures
which
could
indicate
if
and
where
a
hate
crime
is
likely
to
take
place
at
a
certain
point
in
time
and
then
enable
police
officers
to
intervene
the
term
hate
crime
is
used
to
describe
a
prejudice
motivated
crime
often
violent
which
occurs
when
a
perpetrator
targets
a
victim
because
of
his
or
her
affiliation
to
a
social
group
such
as
their
sex
ethnicity
disability
or
religion
according
to
the

in
an
increase
of

cent
compared
with
previous
research
from
the

science
lab
has
already
shown
that
twitter
data
can
be
used
to
identify
hot
spots
such
as
certain
states
or
cities
where
hate
speech
has
occurred
but
where
hate
crime
has
not
been
reported
one
example
is
an
area
when
recent
immigrants
may
be
unlikely
to
report
crime
due
to
fear
of
deportation
professor
matt
williams
from
the
university
s
school
of
social
science
said
developing
a
better
understanding
of
hateful
sentiments
online
and
their
relationship
with
crime
on
the
streets
could
push
law
enforcement
to
better
identify
report
and
address
hate
crimes
that
are
occurring
offline
the
insights
provided
by
our
work
will
help
us
localities
to
design
policies
to
address
specific
hate
crime
issues
unique
to
their
jurisdiction
and
allow
service
providers
to
tailor
their
services
to
the
needs
of
victims
especially
if
those
victims
are
members
of
an
emerging
category
of
hate
crime
targets
the
los
angeles
police
department
has
a
history
of
incorporating
progressive
and
forward
thinking
methods
into
their
policing
having
previously
used
mathematical
models
to
predict
other
areas
of
crime
which
have
been
shown
to
successfully
lower
crime
rates
the
huge
volumes
of
data
that
social
media
now
generates
has
provided
researchers
with
large
swathes
of
information
that
can
be
used
to
identify
emerging
patterns
and
trends
in
a
number
of
areas
across
society
including
crime
dr

this
is
the
first
study
in
the
united

to
use

data
in
predictive
policing
models
of
hate
crime
predictive
policing
is
a
proactive
law
enforcement
model
that
has
become
more
common
partially
due
to
the
advent
of
advanced
analytics
such
as
data
mining
and
machine
learning
methods
new
analytic
approaches
and
the
ability
to
process
very
large
data
sets
have
increased
the
accuracy
of
predictive
models
over
traditional
crime
analysis
methods
and
this

can

introduction
police
authority
to
stop
question
and
frisk
citizens
on
the
street
has
been
a
controversial
police
practice
for
more
than
a
century
consider
that
in
sam
b
warner
a
member
of
the
interstate
commission
on
crime
started
his
law
review
article
on
the
uniform
arrest
act
by
noting
that
the
law
governing
police
authority
to
stop
question
frisk
and
arrest
suspects
illustrates
the
discrepancy
between
law
in
the
books
and
the
law
in
action
n
since
the
early
s
this
discrepancy
has
grown
into
a
highly
divisive
controversy
as
a
function
of
a
strong
disconnect
between
how
police
authority
to
stop
question
and
frisk
suspects
is
supposed
to
work
in
principle
and
how
it
has
actually
worked
in
practice
n
on
one
hand
the
practice
is
grounded
in
a
historical
and
legal
tradition
dating
back
hundreds
of
years
the
basis
of
a
police
officer
s
authority
to
stop
question
and
frisk
a
suspicious
person
can
be
traced
back
to
english
common
law
as
watchmen
and
private
citizens
had
the
authority
to
arrest
any
suspicious
nigh
twalker
and
detain
him
till
he
give
a
good
account
of
himself
n
that
common
law
approach
to
stop
and
frisk
carried
over
to
some
united
states
jurisdictions
although
the
legal
authority
for
the
practice
was
nebulous
at
best
n
the
lack
of
a
clear
legal
framework
for
stop
and
frisk
led
the
u
s
interstate
commission
on
crime
to
draft
the
uniform
arrest
act
in
n
that
model
statute
outlined
nine
different
types
of
police
citizen
contacts
including
q
uestioning
and
detaining
suspects
and
s
earching
suspects
for
weapons
n
litigation
over
various
statutes
authorizing
stop
and
frisk
led
the
u
s
supreme
court
to
formally
establish
stop
and
frisk
as
a
constitutionally
permissible
policing
tactic
in
the
landmark
decision
in
terry
v
ohio
n
in
the
terry
case
the
court
held
that
police
may
temporarily
detain
and
question
a
citizen
if
the
officer
has
reasonable
articulable
suspicion
that
a
person
may
be
involved
in
criminal
activity
n
the
court
also
held
that
officers
may
superficially
search
frisk
a
detained
person
if
there
is
reasonable
articulable
suspicion
that
the
person
may
be
armed
and
dangerous
n
since
the
terry
ruling
the
court
has
not
only
consistently
reaffirmed
the
constitutionality
of
stop
and
frisk
but
also
expanded
officers
authority
during
such
stops
n
on
the
other
hand
police
use
of
stop
and
frisk
in
numerous
jurisdictions
has
strayed
dramatically
from
the
principles
set
forth
in
terry
and
its
progeny
n
in
some
cases
police
use
of
stop
and
frisk
has
been
characterized
by
gross
overuse
and
misuse
of
the
strategy
violations
of
citizens
fourth
and
fourteenth
amendment
rights
strained
police
community
relationships
low
or
no
police
legitimacy
and
significant
emotional
psychological
and
physical
consequences
experienced
by
citizens
n
the
new
york
city
police
department
nypd
epitomizes
this
story
in
the
office
of
the
new
york
state
attorney
general
released
a
report
that
examined
stops
and
raised
serious
questions
about
their
constitutionality
as
well
as
racial
disparities
in
those
who
were
stopped
n
allegations
of
racial
discrimination
in
stops
conducted
by
the
nypd
led
to
two
federal
lawsuits
that
mired
the
nypd
and
its
stop
and
frisk
program
in
federal
court
for
more
than
a
decade
daniels
v
city
of
new
york
n
and
floyd
v
city
of

n
the
controversy
came
to
a
head
in

when

s
district

judge
shira
scheindlin
ruled
that
the
nypd
s
stop

was
unconstitutional
n
allegations

have
not
been
limited
to
new

in
november
the
american
civil

union
aclu
of
pennsylvania
filed
a
lawsuit
in
federal
court
alleging
that
the
philadelphia
police
department
was
engaged
in
widespread
racial
profiling

a

fostered
larger
discussions
about
the
mechanisms

the
origins
and
authority
of
stop
and
frisk
n
a
law
enforcement
officer
s
legal
authority
to
detain
and
question
a
suspicious
person
dates
back
to
the
common
law
of
england
english
common
law
had
very
strict
rules
governing
formal
arrests
n
legal
proscriptions
on
investigation
of
crime
however
were
significantly
more
lax
a
from
english
common
law
to
the
uniform
arrest
act
english
constables
and
watchmen
were
permitted
to
detain
night
walkers
suspicious
people
encountered
at
night
n
indeed
according
to
sir
matthew
hale
s
treatise
on
english
common
law
those
on
the
night
watch
could
legally
arrest
such
as
pass
by
until
the
morning
and
if
no
suspicion
they
are
then
to
be
delivered
released
and
if
suspicion
be
touching
them
they
shall
be
delivered
to
the
sheriff
n
even
private
citizens
had
the
authority
to
detain
and
question
suspicious
night
walkers
n
until
there
was
considerable
variation
in
how
u
s
law
handled
police
initiated
contacts
with
citizens
that
did
not
reach
the
level
of
arrest
in
some
states
it
was
unclear
if
american
common
law
borrowing
from
its
english
antecedents
conferred
a
right
to
detain
and
question
suspects
when
the
requirements
for
a
full
arrest
were
clearly
absent
n
in
other
jurisdictions
the
right
to
detain
and
question
suspects
was
conferred
on
police
by
state
statute
or
by
municipal
ordinance
n
in
these
states
detentions
for
questioning
were
generally
left
to
the
discretion
of
individual
officers
and
were
not
subject
to
constitutional
protections
or
judicial
oversight
n
inconsistency
in
state
law
came
to
be
viewed
as
entirely
inadequate
to
meet
the
modern
needs
for
questioning
and
detaining
suspects
n
in
the
interstate
commission
on
crime
authorized
a
study
to
examine
how
arrests
were
made
across
the
united
states
the
study
examined
the
feasibility
of
creating
a
model
law
that
states
could
adopt
to
harmonize
arrest
practices
across
the
country
and
to
bring
the
actions
of
police
into
alignment
with
constitutional
standards
n
once
drafted
that
model
law
became
known
as
the
uniform
arrest
act
its
provisions
dealt
with
nine
types
of
police
initiated
contacts
with
citizens

first
two
of
which
were
q
uestioning
and
detaining
suspects

for

n
section
of
the

officer
may
stop

person
abroad

he
has
reasonable
ground
to
suspect

committing

committed

is
about
to
commit
a

the
total
period
of
detention
provided
for
by
this
section
shall
not
exceed
two
hours
n
additionally
section
of
the
act
stated
that
an
officer
was
permitted
to
conduct
a
search
for
a
dangerous
weapon
whenever
he
has
reasonable
ground
to
believe
a
person
stopped
or
detained
for
questioning
possesses
a
dangerous
weapon
n
in
the
legislatures
of
new
hampshire
and
rhode
island
adopted
the
uniform
arrest
act
as
the
laws
of
their
states

delaware
followed
suit
in
n
other
states
enacted
statutes
authorizing
stop
and
frisk
practices
that
were
not
consistent
with
the
uniform
arrest
act
n
as
a
consequence
considerable
variation
persisted
across
states
with
regard
to
stop
and
frisk
authority
n
prompted
by
the
need
to
clarify
the
scope
of
permissible
conduct
during
stop
and
frisk
procedures
and
perhaps
concerns
about
how
vagrancy
and
loitering
laws
contributed
to
police
infringements
on
constitutionally
protected
liberty
interests
the
u
s
supreme
court
issues
three
landmark
rulings
in
that
set
federal
constitutional
benchmarks
for

within
the
framework
of

fourth
amendment

v

n
in
the
interest
of
brevity
the
next
section
summarizes
only
the
key
facts
and
holdings
of
these
cases
n
b
terry
sibron
and
peters
in
terry
detective
martin
mcfadden
testified
that
he
observed
two
men
while
on
patrol
the
court
summarized
mcfadden
s
observations
as
follows
he
saw
one
of
the
men
leave
the
other
one
and
walk
southwest
on
huron
road
past
some
stores
the
man
paused
for
a
moment
and
looked
in
a
store
window
then
walked
on
a
short
distance
turned
around
and
walked
back
toward
the
corner
pausing
once
again
to
look
in
the
same
store
window
he
rejoined
his
companion
at
the
corner
and
the
two
conferred
briefly
then
the
second
man
went
through
the
same
series
of
motions
strolling
down
huron
road
looking
in
the
same
window
walking
on
a
short
distance
turning
back
peering
in
the
store
window
again
and
returning
to
confer
with
the
first
man
at
the
corner
the
two
men
repeated
this
ritual
alternately
between
five
and
six
times
apiece
in
all
roughly
a
dozen
trips
at
one
point
while
the
two
were
standing
together
on
the
corner
a
third
man
approached
them
and
engaged
them
briefly
in
conversation
this
man
then
left
the
two
others
and
walked
west
on
euclid
avenue
chilton
and
terry
resumed
their
measured
pacing
peering
and
conferring
after
this
had
gone
on
for
to
minutes
the
two
men
walked
off
together
heading
west
on
euclid
avenue
following
the
path
taken
earlier
by
the
third
man
n
mcfadden
s
observations
led
him
to
suspect
that
the
men
were
planning
to
commit
a
robbery
in
the
store
he
therefore
approached
the
men
and
began
to
question
them
fearing
that
they
might
be
armed
he
patted
them
down
and
recovered
a
revolver
on
two
of
the
men
mcfadden
arrested
the
men
for
illegal
possession
of
the
firearms
in
upholding
their
convictions
the
u
s
supreme
court
made
it
clear
that
the
fourth
amendment
applies
to
stop
and
frisk
activities
n
but
i
nstead
of
applying
the
probable
cause
standard
to
stops
and
frisks
the
court
applied
the
fundamental
test
of
the
fourth
amendment
the
reasonableness
under
all
the
circumstances
of
the
particular
governmental
invasion
of
a
citizen
s
personal
security
n
in
deciding
to
analyze
the
reasonableness
of
officer
mcfadden
s
conduct
the
court
approved
a
line
of
inquiry
that
is
distinct
from
questions
of
probable
cause
indeed
the
court
analyzed
the
reasonableness
of
officer
mcfadden
s
conduct
as
a
general
proposition
by
balancing
the
need
to
search
or
seize
against
the
invasion
which
the
search
or
seizure
entails
n
moreover
the
court
maintained
that
this
balancing
test
depends
on
whether
a
law
enforcement
officer
can
point
to
specific
and
articulable
facts
which
taken
together
with
rational
inferences
from
those
facts
reasonably
warrant
that
intrusion
n
the
court
then
applied
a
similar
balancing
test
to
assess
the
reasonableness
of
mcfadden
s
search
for
weapons
in
doing
so
the
court
found
the
search
to
be
permissible
under
the
fourth
amendment
in
large
part
because
of
its
limited
nature
namely
the
pat
down
of
the
men
s
outer
clothing
for
weapons
he
did
not
conduct
a
general
exploratory
search
for
whatever
evidence
of
criminal
activity
he
might
find
n
in
sibron
the
defendant
was
convicted
of
the
unlawful
possession
of
heroin
over
the
course
of
several
hours
a
police
officer
observed
the
defendant
talking
with
six
or
eight
persons
whom
he
patrolman
martin
knew
from
past
experience
to
be
narcotics
addicts
n
the
officer
did
not
hear
any
of
the
conversations
nor
did
anyone
ever
pass
anything
to
the
defendant
during
these
conversations
nonetheless
the
officer
subsequently
approached
sibron
and
said
you
know
what
i
am
after
prompting
sibron
to
reach
into
his
pocket
that
action
in
turn
caused
the
officer
to
reach
into
sibron
s
pocket
and
retrieve
several
glassine
envelopes
that
contained
heroin
n
the
u
s
supreme
court
overturned
sibron
s
conviction
on
the
grounds
that
the
officer
s
initial
stop
was
not
supported
by
reasonable
suspicion
that
sibron
was
involved
in
any
criminal
activity
so
far
as
the
officer
knew
they
might
indeed
have
been
talking
about
the
world
series
the
inference
that
persons
who
talk
to
narcotics
addicts
are
engaged
in
the
criminal
traffic
in
narcotics
is
simply
not
the
sort
of
reasonable
inference
required
to
support
an
intrusion
by
the
police
upon
an
individual
s
personal
security
n
moreover
the
court
determined
that
the
officer
lacked
reasonable
suspicion
that
sibron
was
armed
and
dangerous
in
fact
the
court
reasoned
that
the
officer
s
opening
statement
to
sibron
you
know
what
i
am
after
made
it
abundantly
clear
that
he
sought
narcotics
and
did
not
believe
that
sibron
was
reaching
for
a
weapon
n
in
peters
an
off
duty
police
officer
heard
strange
noises
outside
his
apartment
door
he
investigated
and
observed
two
men
he
had
never
seen
before
tiptoeing
out
of
the
apartment
building
in
which
the
officer
had
lived
for
years
believing
that
he
had
happened
upon
the
two
men
in
the
course
of
an
attempted
burglary
the
officer
opened
his
door
entered
the
hallway
and
slammed
the
door
loudly
behind
him
this
precipitated
a
flight
down
the
stairs
on
the
part
of
the
two
men
and
the
officer
gave
chase
n
the
officer
patted
down
the
men
and
found
burglar
s
tools
the
court
affirmed
peters
conviction
because
the
officer
had
probable
cause
to
believe
the
men
were
involved
in
an
attempted
burglary
in
light
of
the
existence
of
probable
cause
to
arrest
the
search
of
peters
could
be
justified
as
a
search
incident
to
arrest
a
more
complete
search
than
the
limited
frisk
patdown
for
weapons
authorized
under
terry
n
c
key
court
cases
after
terry
v
ohio
established
the
legal
parameters
for
stop
and
frisk
in
the
united
states
the
supreme
court
revisited
stop
and
frisk
just
over
a
decade
later
in
two
cases
brown
v
texas
n
and
ybarra
v
illinois
n
the
court
invalidated
police
actions
and
reinforced
the
narrow
authority
granted
under
terry
by
the
s
however
courts
began
to
interpret
terry
as
providing
significant
leeway
to
law
enforcement
officers
to
conduct
stops
additionally
the
u
s
supreme
court
directed
the
lower
courts
to
assess
the
validity
of
stops
based
on
the
whole
picture
or
what
came
to
be
known
as
the
totality
of
the
circumstances
n
perhaps
more
importantly
the
court
told
lower
courts
to
defer
to
the
professional
judgment
and
experience
of
police
when
assessing
the
totality
of
the
circumstances
n
throughout
the
s
the
u
s
supreme
court
exempted
several
classes
of
stops
from
the
usual
requirements
of
terry
for
example
in
united
states
v
mendenhall
the
court
ruled
that
a
stop
had
not
occurred
when
federal
agents
approached
the
defendant
in
the
open
concourse
area
of
an
airport
n
because
the
agents
neither
wore
uniforms
nor
displayed
weapons
and
because
they
requested
but
did
not
demand
to
see
the
defendant
s
ticket
and
identification
the
court
reasoned
that
the
encounter
did
not
constitute
a
stop
that
qualified
as
a
seizure
for
fourth
amendment
purposes
but
rather
a
voluntary
and
cooperative
encounter
because
at
no
time
should
a
reasonable
person
in
the
defendant
s
situation
have
ever
felt
that
she
could
not
leave
n
then
in
i
n
s
v
delgado
the
free
to
leave
test
morphed
into
something
even
more
restrictive
on
personal
liberty
free
to
continue
working
and
moving
about
a
factory
while
armed
agents
wearing
badges
roamed
the
premises
questioning
people
about
their
immigration
status
n
the
court
further
narrowed
terry
in
florida
v
bostick
when
it
clarified
that
law
enforcement
officers
have
the
authority
to
stop
and
ask
basic
investigatory
questions
including
requests
to
examine
identification
or
to
search
luggage
of
bus
passengers
without
there
being
a
seizure
for
fourth
amendment
purposes
as
long
as
the
police
do
not
convey
a
message
that
compliance
with
their
requests
is
required
n
in
short
bostick
all
but
abandoned
mendenhall
s
free
to
leave
test
by
changing
the
inquiry
to
one
of
coercive
police
tactics
through
shows
of
authority
in
other
cases
the
u
s
supreme
court
extended
the
authority
of
police
to
conduct
frisks
consider
that
in
michigan
v
long
the
court
permitted
the
police
to
conduct
a
brief
search
of
the
passenger
compartment
of
a
car
to
look
for
hidden
weapons
n
perhaps
most
importantly
the
court
has
partially
retreated
from
sibron
s
holding
that
reasonable
suspicion
needed
to
be
based
on
more
than
just
hunches
in
alabama
v
white
the
court
upheld
a
stop
of
a
vehicle
based
on
an
anonymous
tip
even
though
there
was
no
indication
of
the
reliability
of
the
tip
n
michigan
department
of

county
v

extended
that
reasoning
to
uphold
random
drug
testing
of
all
students
who
participate
in
any
extracurricular
activities
n
illinois
v
wardlow
approved
an
inference
of
suspicion
from
flight
n
an
inference
that
logically
extends
to
any
type
of
evasive
behavior
n
whren
v
united
states
upheld
pretextual
stops
thereby
allowing
police
to
conduct
stops
for
minor
infractions
so
they
could
investigate
other
more
serious
crimes
n
and
because
minnesota
v
dickerson
approved
of
the
so
called
plain
feel
exception
n
police
likely
have
an
incentive
to
frisk
people
even
when
they
do
not
actually
fear
the
presence
of
a
weapon
but
rather
hope
to
feel
some
drugs
in
the
pat
down
a
seemingly
permissible
pretext
in
light
of
whren
n
in
sum
the
terry
ruling
in
set
the
initial
rules
for
stop
and
frisk
since
court
rulings
in
most
of
the
associated
cases
have
expanded
police
authority
to
stop
question
and
frisk
citizens
this
expanded
authority
undoubtedly
increased
the
risk
that
officers
would
employ
racial
ethnic
and
socio
economic
class
stereotypes
as
part
of
a
calculus
of
suspicion
to
initiate
stop
and
frisk
activities
the
expansion
of
stop
and
frisk
authority
and
the
increased
risk
of
racial
profiling
is
especially
problematic
when
considering
the
persistent
undercurrent
of
racial
injustice
throughout
nearly
two
centuries
of
american
policing
iii
stop
and
frisk
and
the
undercurrent
of
racial
injustice
n
an
undercurrent
of
racial
injustice
and
discrimination
has
served
as
a
backdrop
in
professional
policing
in
the
united
states
for
the
last
years
n
the
larger
race
relation
problems
that
have
defined
american
policing
provide
an
important
lens
through
which
to
view
the
rulings
in
terry
and
subsequent
cases
as
well
as
the
increasing
reliance
on
mass
stop
and
frisk
programs
in

elsewhere

in

ohio

his
opinion
in
terry
v
ohio
chief
justice
warren
noted
that
stop
and
frisk
activities
by
police
contributed
to
racial
strife
we
would
be
less
than
candid
if
we
did
not
acknowledge
that
this
question
thrusts
to
the
fore
difficult
and
troublesome
issues
regarding
a
sensitive
area
of
police
activity
issues
which
have
never
before
been
squarely
presented
to
this
court
reflective
of
the
tensions
involved
are
the
practical
and
constitutional
arguments
pressed
with
great
vigor
on
both
sides
of
the
public
debate
over
the
power
of
the
police
to
stop
and
frisk
as
it
is
sometimes
euphemistically
termed
suspicious
persons
n
the
opinions
in
terry
however
omitted
or
glossed
over
several
important
facts
relevant
to
the
racial
issues
underlying
the
case
indeed
nowhere
in
any
of
the
opinions
in
terry
does
any
justice
mention
that
both
terry
and
chilton
were
black
men
n
nor
does
any
justice
mention
that
katz
who
was
white
was
not
charged
he
was
held
as
a
suspicious
person
and
released
after
two
days
n
according
to
the
transcript
of
the
trial
court
s
suppression
hearing
in
terry
officer
mcfadden
testified
that
when
he
saw
the
men
standing
on
the
street
they
didn
t
look
right
to
him
at
the
time
n
criminologists
delores
jones
brown
and
brian
maule
suggested
that
mcfadden
s
attention
may
have
been
drawn
to
the
men
on
account
of
their
race
n
this
conclusion
is
bolstered
by
a
number
of
ambiguities
and
inconsistencies
in
officer
mcfadden
s
account
of
the
case
as
law
professor
lewis
r
katz
explained
mcfadden
was
not
acquainted
with
either
man
by
name
or
sight
and
he
had
received
a
bsolutely
no
information
regarding
the
men
at
all
officer
mcfadden
did
not
explain
what
about
the
two
men
didn
t
look
right
to
him
the
two
men
were
dressed
in
topcoats
the
standard
dress
of
the
day
they
were
engaged
in
no
unusual
behavior
when
they
initially
attracted
mcfadden
s
attention
when
pressed
on
what
about
the
two
men
attracted
his
interest
and
whether
he
would
pursue
them
as
he
did
if
he
saw
them
that
day
across
from
the
courthouse
officer
mcfadden
replied
i
really
don
t
know
what
happened
as
mcfadden
studied
terry
and
chilton
depends
upon
which
version
of
officer
mcfadden
s
statement
of
the
facts
one
reads
and
in
which
court
opinion
the
facts
appear
mcfadden
watched
the
men
over
a
period
ten
minutes
he
watched
as
one
of
the
two
men
left
the
other
and
walked
down
the
street
and
looked
inside
a
shop
window
and
continued
walking
and
then
walked
back
to
the
other
man
again
looking
in
the
shop
window
the
second
man
then
repeated
the
same
behavior
that
behavior
is
the
critical
conduct
which
gives
rise
to
the
stop
in
this
case
if
they
did
it
once
or
twice
each
their
behavior
was
pretty
unremarkable
so
how
many
times
they
looked
in
the
store
window
is
crucial
in
the
police
report
filed
the
same
day
as
the
incident
officer
mcfadden
wrote
that
the
men
did
this
about
three
times
each
between
the
day
of
the
event
when
he
wrote
the
police
report
and
his
memory
was
freshest
and
the
suppression
hearing
which
was
almost
one
year
to
the
day
after
the
event
officer
mcfadden
s
memory
changed
at
the
suppression
hearing
three
times
each
became
at
least
four
or
five
times
apiece
which
later
turned
into
four
to
six
trips
each
moreover
at
trial
when
asked
how
many
trips
he
observed
officer
mcfadden
replied
about
four
trips
three
to
four
trips
maybe
four
to
five
trips
maybe
a
little
more
it
might
be
a
little
less
i
don
t
know
i
didn
t
count
the
trips
the
ohio
court
of
appeals
decision
in
the
case
picked
up
on
the
uncertainty
and
asserted
that
the
men
separated
and
looked
in
the
window
at
least
two
to
five
times
each
however
by
the
time
the
fact
worked
its
way
into
chief
justice
warren
s
majority
opinion
in
the
supreme
court
the
number
expands
exponentially
he
wrote
that
the
men
did
this
between
five
or
six
times
apiece
in
all
roughly
a
dozen
trips
later
in
the
majority
opinion
chief
justice
warren
came
up
with
still
another
number
when
he
described
terry
and
chilton
s
behavior
where
these
men
pace
alternately
along
an
identical
route
pausing
to
stare
in
the
same
store
window
roughly
twenty
four
times
the
body
of
law
which
stems
from
terry
is
dependent
upon
this
single
fact
officer
mcfadden
was
never
sure
which
store
was
the
subject
of
the
suspects
attention
at
the
suppression
hearing
he
admitted
he
had
no
experience
in
observing
the
activities
of
individuals
who
were
casing
a
store
for
a
robbery
in
the
police
report
officer
mcfadden
indicated
that
they
were
looking
in
an
airline
ticket
office
at
the
suppression
hearing
the
detective
mentioned
an
airline
office
or
a
jewelry
store
n
in
light
of
these
facts
mcfadden
s
inability
to
explain
why
he
was
initially
suspicious
of
the
men
the
ever
changing
number
of
trips
the
men
made
up
and
down
the
street
and
the
uncertainty
of
the
type
of
store
into
which
the
men
were
looking
the
reasonableness
of
the
initial
stop
appears
to
be
more
open
to
debate
than
the
terry
decision
suggests
the
failure
of
the
court
to
address
the
questionable
reasonableness
of
the
stop
in
terry
illustrates
how
the
very
foundation
of
the
reasonable
suspicion
standard
in
american
constitutional
law
masks
racially
disparate
stop
and
frisk
practices
with
the
cloak
of
race
neutrality
n
b
racial
issues
throughout
american
policing
police
scholars
george
kelling
and
mark
moore
developed
a
widely
cited
historical
framework
that
contextualizes
years
of
police
history
into
three
eras
political
reform
and
community
problem
solving
n
though
the
kelling
and
moore
framework
is
useful
for
examining
police
history
it
has
been
criticized
for
overlooking
the
role
of
racism
in
professional
policing
hubert
williams
and
patrick
murphy
for
example
argue
that
the
origins
of
american
policing
are
rooted
in
slave
patrols
in
the
south
and
that
the
advances
that
have
occurred
through
the
reform
and
community
problem
solving
eras
excluded
minority
citizens
n
in
effect
as
policing
progressed
through
the
political
professional
and
community
problem
solving
eras
the
minority
community
was
left
behind
williams
and
murphy
referred
to
this
as
the
minority
view
of
policing
kelling
and
moore
published
their
framework
in
the
late
s
but
the
experiences
of
numerous
agencies
with
stop
and
frisk
suggest
that
williams
and
murphy
s
minority
view
of
policing
is
still
a
stark
reality
the
philadelphia
police
department
ppd
stopped
more
than
citizens
in
prompting
the
american
civil
liberties
union
of
pennsylvania
aclu
pa
to
file
a
federal
lawsuit
in
november
n
the
lawsuit
bailey
v
city
of
philadelphia
alleged
that
the
ppd
was
engaged
in
racial
profiling
the
litigation
resulted
in
a
settlement
agreement
between
the
plaintiffs
and
the
philadelphia
police
department
that
centered
on
quarterly
analysis
of
stop
data
by
the
aclu
pa
appointment
of
an
independent
monitor
retraining
of
officers
and
new
protocols
governing
stop
and
frisk
practices
n
the
aclu
pa
subsequently
reported
to
the
court
and
the
settlement
monitor
that
although
the
number
of
stops
had
declined
by
n
there
had
been
no
significant
improvement
in
the
quality
of
stops
and
frisks
by
our
analysis
pedestrian
stops
are
being
made
without
reasonable
suspicion
in
approximately
of
the
cases
frisks
are
being
conducted
without
reasonable
suspicion
in
over
of
the
cases
by
race
of
the
stops
were
of
minorities
african
americans
and
latinos
and
of
the
frisks
were
of
minorities
the
findings
as
to
impermissible
stops
and
frisks
are
particularly
disturbing
given
the
fact
that
the
police
department
had
the
time
and
resources
following
the
entry
of
the
agreement
to
re
train
its
officers
on
stop
and
frisk
practices
and
to
establish
supervisory
reviews
to
ensure
accountability
for
practices

failed

what

that

to
a

between

seated
in
his

the

the
persistent

of
racial

in

what
williams

termed
the
minority
view
of

n
although
many
u

cities
continue
to
struggle
with
racial
and
ethnic
tensions
in
police
citizen
relationships
the
unique
ways
in
which
stop
and
frisk
was
implemented
in
new

contributed
to
that

most
vexing
and
persistent
problems
with

stop
and

and
the
nypd
the
nypd
story
demonstrates
how
use
of
stop
and
frisk
as
a
widespread
crime
control
strategy
can
go
terribly
wrong
leading
to
the
violation
of
the
constitutional
rights
of
thousands
of
mostly
minority
new
york
city
residents
for
a
period
of
nearly
twenty
years
the
story
represents
a
collision
between
a
constitutionally
permissible
tactic
used
in
an
unconstitutional
manner
the
persistent
undercurrent
of
racial
injustice
in
policing
and
an
effort
to
use
federal
civil
litigation
as
a
mechanism
to
force

reform
the
next
section
describes
how
this
collision
developed
a
crime
disorder
and
broken
windows
new
york
city
like
many
cities
across
the
united
states
experienced
a
major
spike
in
violence
crime
and
disorder
in
the
s
n
much
of
the
violence
in
new
york
was
driven
by
the
emergence
of
crack
cocaine
and
competition
for
the
drug
market
n
homicides
climbed
steadily
from
in
to
in
n
at
the
same
time
the
city
and
subway
system
were
struggling
with
rampant
social
and
physical
disorder
n
marijuana
heroin
cocaine
and
crack
cocaine
were
regularly
and
openly
being
sold
on
street
corners
blocks
and
city
parks
n
kelling
and
coles
estimated
that
a
pproximately
to
persons
a
night
were
sleeping
in
the
subway
system
n
the
new
york
transit
authority
appointed
william
bratton
as
chief
of
the
transit
police
to
address
crime
and
disorder
in
the
subway
system
n
chief
bratton
partnered
with
criminologist
george
kelling
to
develop
an
enforcement
strategy
based
on
wilson
and
kelling
s
broken
windows
theory
n
that
targeted
low
level
offenses
e
g
turnstile
jumping
as
well
as
social
and
physical
disorder
through
frequent
arrests
and
removals
from
the
subway
system
n
broken
windows
theory
posits
that
minor
forms
of
social
and
physical
disorder
cause
a
breakdown
in
informal
social
control
as
citizen
investment
in
an
area
diminishes
n
as
citizens
withdraw
from
the
area
the
level
of
disorder
increases
and
the
risk
for
more
serious
types
of
crime
to
emerge
becomes
greater
n
the
theory
suggests
that
police
focus
enforcement
efforts
on
disorder
and
quality
of
life
offenses
as
a
mechanism
for
reengaging
law
abiding
citizens
commitment
to
the
area
n
under
chief
bratton
the
transit
police
adopted
a
broken
windows
based
strategy
in
the
subway
system
over
the
next
two
years
the
level
of
disorder
dropped
dramatically
and
felony
offenses
declined
by
n
in
new
york
city
mayor
rudolph
giuliani
appointed
william
bratton
as
the
commissioner
of
the
nypd
and
bratton
immediately
began
implementation
of
a
broken
windows
based
strategy
throughout
new
york
n
two
policy
initiatives
defined
the
nypd
crime
control
strategy
first
reclaiming
the
public
spaces
of
new
york
outlined
the
broken
windows
theory
and
articulated
an
order
maintenance
strategy
that
targeted
disorder
and
quality
of
life
offenses
through
systematic
and
aggressive
enforcement
strategies
e
g
replicating
the
subway
strategy
n
second
getting
guns
off
the
streets
of
new
york
n
outlined
the
nypd
s
strategy
to
reduce
gun
violence
through
the
seizure
of
illegal
firearms
and
through
the
intensive
investigation
of
gun
related
incidents
n
stop
and
frisk
emerged
as
the
primary
tactic
to
meet
the
objectives
of
both
policy
initiatives
n
over
the
next
several
years
critics
argued
that
police
over
enforced
quality
of
life
infractions
through
a
zero
tolerance
approach
because
officers
could
easily
justify
the
stops
under
the
reasonable
suspicion
standard
n
as
waldeck
states
there
is
not
any
doubt
that
the
police
use
quality
of
life
offenses
as
excuses
to
fish
for
drugs
guns
or
evidence
of
a
more
serious
crime
n
the
effects
of
the
stop
and
frisk
program
were
immediate
from
to
arrests
rose
by
including
a
increase
in
misdemeanor
arrests
and
a
increase
in
drug
arrests
n
the
nypd
made
approximately
gun
related
arrests
over
a
three
year
period
resulting
in
the
removal
of
more
than
guns
from
the
streets
n
stop
and
frisk
also
produced
a
large
increase
in
arrests
for
marijuana
possession
in
geller
and
fagan
reported
that
there
were
arrests
for
marijuana
possession
marking
a
increase
from
the
previous
decade
n
the
nypd
s
use
of
stop
and
frisk
increased
steadily
in
the
late
s
into
the
twenty
first
century
in
for
example
nypd
officers
conducted
more
than
stop
and
frisks
of
citizens
n
in
the
nypd
implemented
operation
impact
a
hot
spots
strategy
where
police
commanders
identified
twenty
four
high
crime
impact
zones
that
would
be
targeted
with
saturation
foot
patrol
in
combination
with
resources
from
a
variety
of
departmental
divisions
n
stop
and
frisk
activity
increased
dramatically
over
the
next
several
years
peaking
at
more
than
in
n
as
the
frequency
of
stops
increased
critics
attacked
the
strategy
s
low
rates
of
return
jones
brown
and
colleagues
found
that
of
the
stops
in
just
stops
resulted
in
an
arrest
and
an
additional
stops
resulted
in
a
summons
thus
the
percentage
of
innocent
stops
those
not
resulting
in
summons
or
arrest
accounted
for
roughly
n
similarly
the
percentage
of
stops
resulting
in
the
recovery
of
a
gun
dropped
by
from
guns
recovered
out
of
a
total
of
stops
in
to
in
guns
recovered
out
of
a
total
of
stops
n
furthermore
the
percentage
of
citizen
complaints
involving
stops
increased
from
in
to
in
n
as
the
use
of
stop
and
frisk
expanded
dramatically
the
nypd
drifted
away
from
the
central
tenets
of
broken
windows
theory
and
the
program
devolved
into
a
strictly
zero
tolerance
approach
against
social
disorder
such
as
public
drunkenness
vandalism
loitering
panhandling
prostitution
and
the
like
n
in
other
words
rather
than
focusing
on
the
amelioration
of
physical
disorder
in
partnership
with
the
community
the
nypd
focused
on
interdiction
of
social
disorder
n
these
efforts
led
the
nypd
to
implement
a
set
of
practices
that
encouraged
the
aggressive
pursuit
of
individuals
through
stop
and
frisks
rather
than
mutually
beneficial
interactions
with
law
abiding
citizens
n
this
zero
tolerance
mentality
compounded
the
police
department
s
disconnect
from
the
community
in
a
number
of
important
ways
first
the
nypd
focused
less
on
preventing
disorder
and
alternatives
to
arrest
and
more
on
aggressively
removing
weapons
and
wanted
criminals
from
the
community
n
second
the
nypd
de
emphasized
informal
interactions
between
police
and
the
community
in
the
manner
advocated
by
both
community
policing
principles
and
broken
windows
theory
n
the
lack
of
police
community
engagement
was
driven
in
large
part
by
the
management
style
that
bratton
embraced
from
the
private
sector
n
this
management
style
stressed
innovative
approaches
on
management
accountability
prioritization
and
data
driven
decision
making
n
one
of
the
primary
structural
modifications
to
emerge
from
this
management
system
was
compstat

system
defined
by
timely
and
accurate
information
rapid
deployment

effective
tactics

and
assessment
n
essentially
instead
of
identifying
community
needs
through
engagement
with
residents
the
nypd
determined

through
its
own

accountability
system

and

with

as
a
central
feature
the
city
witnessed
a
large
prolonged
drop
in
crime
from
the
mid
s
to
the
mid

street
crime
in
new

declined
approximately
a
decrease
roughly
twice
the
national
average

there
were

in

down
from
more
than
in
proponents
of
stop

point
to
new
york
city
s
crime
decline
over
the
last
two
decades
as
evidence
that
the
tactic
is
effective
for
example
former
nypd
commissioner
raymond
kelly
touted
stop
and
frisk
at
a
news
conference
by
saying
police
stops
are
just
one
component
of
multiple
efforts
by
the
department
that
have
saved
lives
and
driven
the
murder
rate
to
record
lows
in
the
first
years
of
mayor
bloomberg
s
tenure
there
were
fewer
murders
in
new
york
city
compared
to
the
years
prior
to
the
mayor
taking
office
n
former
new
york
city
mayor
michael
bloomberg
similarly
praised
the
effectiveness
of
stop
and
frisk
in
combatting
crime
stating
new
york
is
the
safest
big
city
in
the
nation
and
our
crime
reductions
have
been
steeper
than
any
other
big
city
s
for
instance
if
new
york
city
had
the
murder
rate
of
washington
d
c
more
new
yorkers
would
have
been
killed
last
year
n
whether
stop
and
frisk
caused
or
contributed
to
the
crime
decline
in
new
york
city
is
a
hotly
contested
proposition
n
several
studies
have
suggested
a
causal
connection
corman
and
mocan
reported
that
misdemeanor
arrests
were
associated
with
declines
in
robbery
motor
vehicle
theft
and
grand
larceny
but
not
homicide
assault
burglary
and
rape
n
similarly
kelling
and
sousa
found
that
misdemeanor
arrest
levels
were
significantly
associated
with
reductions
in
violent
crime
while
controlling
for
several
relevant
community
factors
n
smith
and
purtell
found
that
operation
impact
had
a
significant
effect
on
crimes
against
persons
in
impact
zones
n
smith
and
purtell
also
examined
the
effects
of
stop
and
frisk
on
crime
in
new
york
and
they
found
that
there
was
a
significant
inverse
relationship
between
stop
rates
and
robbery
burglary
motor
vehicle
theft
and
homicides
rates
n
zimring
argued
that
new
york
s
crime
decline
from
through
was
largely
attributable
to
the
nypd
s
policing
practices
n
conversely
there
are
a
number
of
studies
indicating
that
the
relationship
between
stop
and
frisk
and
the
crime
decline
in
new
york
city
is
modest
at
best
n
for
instance
rosenfeld
and
fornango
found
that
police
stops
did
not
decrease
robbery
and
burglary
rates
n
in
a
re
analysis
of
kelling
and
sousa
s
data
harcourt
and
ludwig
found
no
significant
relationships
between
policing
minor
disorder
offenses
and
new
york
city
s
crime
decline
n
macdonald
and
colleagues
conducted
a
comprehensive
examination
of
the
crime
effects
of
operation
impact
with
a
specific
focus
on
stop
and
frisk
they
concluded
impact
zones
were
significantly
associated
with
reductions
in
total
reported
crimes
assaults
burglaries
drug
violations
misdemeanor
crimes
felony
property
crimes
robberies
and
felony
violent
crimes
impact
zones
were
significantly
associated
with
increases
in
total
reported
arrests
arrests
for
burglary
arrests
for
weapons
arrests
for
misdemeanor
crimes
and
arrests
for
property
felony
crimes
impact
zones
were
also
significantly
associated
with
increases
in
investigative
stops
for
suspected
crimes
but
only
the
increase
in
stops
made
based
on
probable
cause
indicators
of
criminal
behaviors
were
associated
with
crime
reductions
the
largest
increase
in
investigative
stops
in
impact
zones
was
based
on
indicators
of
suspicious
behavior
that
had
no
measurable
effect
on
crime
the
findings
suggest
that
saturating
high
crime
blocks
with
police
helped
reduce
crime
in
new
york
city
but
that
the
bulk
of
the
investigative
stops
did
not
play
an
important
role
in
the
crime
reductions
the
findings
indicate
that
crime
reduction
can
be
achieved
with
more
focused
investigative
stops
n
c
the
social
costs
regardless
of
the
impact
on
crime
there
is
considerable
evidence
demonstrating
that
the
nypd
s
stop
and
frisk
program
exacted
significant
social
costs
that
were
disproportionately
experienced
by
ethnic
minorities
by
the
end
of
the
s
stop
and
frisk
had
become
a
point
of
contention
among
ethnic
minorities
a
vera
institute
of
justice
study
examined
the
experiences
of
more
than
people
who
had
been
stopped
by
the
nypd
of
young
people
surveyed
indicated
they
had
been
stopped
repeatedly
times
or
more
less
than
a
third

ever
being
informed
of
the
reason
for
a

young
people

reported
being
frisked
at
least
once
and
said
they
had
been
searched
reported
encountering
an
officer
who
threatened
them
and
said
they
had
experienced
physical
force
at
the
hands
of
an
officer
one
out
of
four
said
they
were
involved
in
a
stop
in
which
the
officer
displayed
his
or
her
weapon
stated
that
the
way
police
acted
towards
them
was
influenced
by
their
age
indicated
that
they
were
treated
worse
than
others
because
of
their
race
and
or
ethnicity
n
a
study
by
fagan
and
colleagues
on
stop
and
frisk
in
new
york
city
identified
three
noteworthy
findings
first
stops
within
neighborhoods
take
place
at
rates
in
excess
of
what
would
be
predicted
from
the
separate
and
combined
effects
of
population
demography
physical
and
social
conditions
and
the
crime
rate
this
excess
seems
to
be
concentrated
in
predominately
black
neighborhoods
second
the
excess
stops
in
these
neighborhoods
persist
over
time
even
as
the
black
population
declines
crime
rates
remain
low
and
effectively
unchanged
the
city
s
overall
social
and
economic
health
improves
and
housing
and
other
investments
increase
across
the
city
s
neighborhoods
including
its
poorest
and
most
segregated
neighborhoods
third
there
appears
to
be
a
declining
return
in
crime
detection
from
marginal
increases
in
enforcement
and
this
efficiency
gap
seems
to

section

by
rep
samuel

r
ohio
was
the
subject
of
only
limited
debate

was
swiftly
passed
without

its
primary
purpose
was
to
provide
a
mechanism
for
private
persons
to
enforce
the
rights
secured
by
the
fourteenth
amendment
n
although
it
has
been
amended
a
few
times
since
its
passage
the
language
of
the
act
today
remains
essentially
unchanged
from
the
original
n
section
was
hardly
used
from
the
time
of
its
enactment
until
the
early
s
n
in
the
u
s
supreme
court
decided
monroe
v
pape
n
that
case
upheld
the
authority
of
the
plaintiff
to
use
as
a
jurisdictional
basis
for
suing
police
officers
who
had
allegedly
conducted
an
illegal
search
of
his
home
in
violation
of
the
fourth
amendment
n
notably
the
court
refused
to
allow
the
lawsuit
to
proceed
against
the
city
of
chicago
as
the
employer
of
the
officers
reasoning
that
congress
had
not
intended
the
word
person
in
to
apply
to
municipalities
n
of
particular
relevance
to
this
article
however
the
court
reversed
itself
on
this
key
issue
in
the
case
of
monell
v
department
of
social
services
of
the
city
of
new
york
n
our
analysis
of
the
legislative
history
of
the
civil
rights
act
of
compels
the
conclusion
that
congress
did
intend
municipalities
and
other
local
government
units
to
be
included
among
those
persons
to
whom
applies
local
governing
bodies
therefore
can
be
sued
directly
under
for
monetary
declaratory
or
injunctive
relief
where
as
here
the
action
that
is
alleged
to
be
unconstitutional
implements
or
executes
a
policy
statement
ordinance
regulation
or
decision
officially
adopted
and
promulgated
by
that
body
s
officers
moreover
although
the
touchstone
of
the
action
against
a
government
body
is
an
allegation
that
official
policy
is
responsible
for
a
deprivation
of
rights
protected
by
the
constitution
local
governments
like
every
other
person
by
the
very
terms
of
the
statute
may
be
sued
for
constitutional
deprivations
visited
pursuant
to
governmental
custom
even
though
such
a
custom
has
not
received
formal
approval
through
the
body
s
official
decisionmaking
channels
n
importantly
municipal
practices
and
customs
are
so
broadly
defined
in
monell
that
the
terms
include
whatever
the
agency
does
routinely
whether
stated
in
official
policy
or
not
such
that
the
practice
amounts
to
a
custom
or
usage
that
is
tantamount
to
formal
law
or
policy
n
if
a
number
of
people
have
been
aggrieved
by
state
actors
whose
conduct
falls
within
a
municipal
policy
practice
or
custom
those
plaintiffs
lawsuits
may
be
certified
as
a
class
action
under
federal
rule
of
civil
procedure
b
n
such
class
action
lawsuits
play
a
critical
role
in
the
enforcement
of
civil
rights
if
the
plaintiffs
are
able
to
establish
the
requirements
to
be
certified
as
a
class
as
they
were
in
floyd
they
can
present
evidence
to
the
court
and
seek
federal
injunctive
relief
against
a
law
enforcement
agency
n
perhaps
because
claims
against
municipalities
can
seek
both
injunctive
relief
and
monetary
remedies
the
decision
in
monell
led
to
a
dramatic
increase
in
civil
litigation
against
police
because
it
opened
the
deep
pockets
of
government
treasuries
to
civil
rights
plaintiffs
n
for
example
from
the
city
of
los

paid
more
than
million

n
professors
marc
miller
and
ronald
wright
reported
that
although
some
of
these
settlements
garner
intense
media
attention
municipalities
quietly
settle
many
more
lawsuits
than
people
generally
assume
the
majority
of
which
involve
secret
settlements
that
are
filed
under
seal
n
there
have
been
few
evaluations
of
the
impact
of
lawsuits
on
police
misconduct
n
criminologist
candace
mccoy
argues
that
federal
lawsuits
have
led
to
improved
police
practices
because
of
the
unique
role
of
insurance
carriers
n
that
is
in
the
wake
of
the
monell
ruling
many
law
enforcement
agencies
sought
to
reduce
their
exposure
to
lawsuits
by
securing
liability
insurance
n
but
insurance
companies
would
not
offer
attractively
priced
policies
if
police
agencies
could
not
demonstrate
that
they
had
done
everything
possible
to
reduce
the
risk
of
lawsuits
n
insurance
companies
began
devising
risk
management
protocols
for
police
that
specified
mandates
for
training
policy
and
supervision
that
met
national
standards
n
mccoy
notes
that
litigation
coupled
with
the
professional
risk
management
skills
and
oversight
of
the
private
insurance
industry
have
not
been
given
the
credit
they
deserve
this
accountability
device
has
probably
been
the
source
of
the
most

deep

a

of
themes
emerge

decree
studies
first
officers
view
consent
decrees
skeptically
and
federal
oversight
negatively
affects
officer
morale
n
second
though

frequently
suggested
that
the
consent
decree
led

proactive
police
work
results
from
several
studies
showed
increased
levels
of
summons
stops
and

during

modest
evidence
that
both
use

n
and
citizen
complaints
n
decrease
during
consent
decrees
though

has
not
demonstrated
that
excessive
or
unlawful
force
declined
during

fourth
there
is
also
some
evidence
to
suggest
that
public
satisfaction
with
police
increases
as
a
result
of
consent
decrees
n
alternatively
several
studies
have
shown
that
racial
disparities
in
stops
and
arrests
persisted
despite
federal
oversight
n
the
dearth
of
research
on
consent
decrees
and
their
impact
is
troubling
given
their
significant
cost
for
example
the
consent
decree
for

estimated
to
have
cost
between
and
million
annually
totaling
million
over
five
years

the

post

to
address
these
research
questions
the
authors
first
examine
the
prevalence
of
nypd
stops
annually
from
through
second
the
authors
identify
the
geographic
locations
of
all
stops
in
and
at
the
precinct
level
and
examine
the
percent
change
in
stop
locations
pre
and
post
floyd
ruling
this
analysis
is
of
particular
interest
because
the
fagan
analyses
in
the
floyd
case
demonstrated
that
nypd
stop
activity
disproportionately
targeted
neighborhoods
and
precincts
where
the
majority
of
residents
were
ethnic
minorities
the
analyses
here
will
assess
whether
the
racially
geographic
concentration
of
stops
has
persisted
post

third
fagan
s
analyses
in
the
floyd
case
demonstrated
that
not
only
were
minorities
more
likely
to
be
stopped
they
were
also
disproportionately
likely
to
be
subjected
to

search
and

the
authors
descriptively
compare
stop
outcomes
both
overall
and
by
citizen
race
ethnicity
to
determine
whether
the
racial

finding
has
persisted
in
the

the

compare
the
rates
at
which

produce

pre

finally
the
authors
explore
trends
in
violent
and
property
crime
rates
as
well
as
total
homicides
through
to
determine
whether
reforms
in
stop
and
frisk
if
they
occurred
may
be
associated
with
changes
in
crime
in
new
york
the
current
study
does
suffer
from
several
limitations
that
should
be
acknowledged
first
the
current
study
presents
a
descriptive
year
to
year
comparison
only
which
restricts
statements
about
causality
between
the
federal
civil
litigation
and
changes
in
stop
and
frisk
practices
second
the
findings
are
based
on
nypd
administrative
data
and
several
critics
have
suggested
that
the
uf
data
may
not
be
complete
and
accurate
in
fact
there
are
indications
that
a
substantial
proportion
of
stops
occur
without
formal
documentation
consider
that
jones
brown
and
colleagues
reported
that
although
one
study
estimated
that
approximately
of
all
stops
were
captured
on
uf
forms
an
nypd
commander
estimated
that
only
in
stops
was
documented
by
officers
on
the
uf
n
finally
the
earlier
discussion
demonstrates
that
a
number
of
events
after
the
floyd
ruling
may
have
shaped
the
nypd
s
stop
and
frisk
program
including
media
attention
a
new
mayor
and
a
new
police
commissioner
though
many
of
these
events
are
directly
related
to
the
floyd
ruling
results
should
be
interpreted
in
the
context
of
these
limitations

discussion
and
conclusion
the
last
years
have
arguably
been
the
most
innovative
in
the
history
of
policing
n
since
the
mid
s
a
host
of
new
strategies
have
emerged
on
the
law
enforcement
landscape
from
problem
oriented
policing
pop
and
community
oriented
policing
cop
to
hot
spots
policing
focused
deterrence
pulling
levers
e
g
targeted
offender
strategies
intelligence
led
policing
and
even
predictive
policing
the
innovation
in
strategies
has
been
matched
by
the
development
of
new
technologies
such
as
geographic
information
systems
gis
crime
analysis
and
advanced
analytics
compstat
dna
and
forensics
license
plate
readers
less
lethal
alternatives
pepper
spray
taser
body
worn
cameras
and
gunshot
detection
systems
n
during
this
period
of
innovation
stop
and
frisk
has
emerged
as
a
preferred
tactic
for
controlling
crime
and
disorder
despite
the
tremendous
innovation
in
policing
one
phenomenon
that
has
remained
unchanged
is
the
undercurrent
of
racial
injustice
the
misuse
and
abuse
of
stop
and
frisk
appears
to
be
the
next
iteration
of
that
injustice
the
stories
of
stop
and
frisk
in
newark
philadelphia
chicago
pittsburgh
and
new
york
illustrate
that
williams
and
murphy
s
minority
view
of
policing
remains
a
stark
reality
the
deaths
of
eric
garner
michael
brown
and
freddie
gray
among
others
demonstrate
the
centrality
of
stop
and
frisk
to
the
persistent
racial
crisis
in
policing
these
tragic
deaths
have
led
to
unprecedented
attention
on
racial
disparities
in
police
actions
best
exemplified
by
the
president
s
task
force
on
st
century
policing
n
and
they
have
facilitated
a
national
dialogue
on
the
need
for
police
accountability
and
reform
as
part
of
this
dialogue
federal
civil
litigation
has
received
considerable
attention
as
a
potential
mechanism
for
police
reform
federal
civil
litigation
can
be
employed
through
a
variety
of
mechanisms
such
as
individual
or
class
action
lawsuits
and
u
s
department
of
justice
actions
via
unfortunately
very
little
research
has
examined
the
impact
of
federal
civil
litigation
on
unconstitutional
police
practices
and
as
a
result
there
is
little
understanding
of
its
effectiveness
or
lack
thereof
as
an
instrument
of
police
reform
a
federal
civil
litigation
and
police
reform
in
new
york
the
current
study
examines
the
new
york
city
confluence
of
racial
injustice
in
policing
misuse
of
stop
and
frisk
by
officers
and
federal
civil
litigation
designed
to
precipitate
police
reform
the
results
provide
direct
evidence
of
the
impact
of
federal
civil
litigation
on
unconstitutional
stop
and
frisk
practices
in
new
york
specifically
as
well
as
some
more
general
insights
on
the
potential
for
federal
civil
litigation
to
generate
police
reform
the
year
to
year
comparison
of
stop
and
frisk
in
new
york
highlights
a
number
of
positive
findings
suggesting
that
the
federal
civil
litigation
has
begun
to
alter
the
unconstitutional
practices
outlined
in
the
floyd
case
first
the
sheer
number
of
stops
conducted
by
officers
has
dropped
dramatically
by
more
than
second
the
geographic
concentration
of
stops
in
mostly
minority
precincts
has
also
declined
an
examination
of
ten
precincts
with
large
minority
populations
showed
that
the
racial
ethnic
concentration
of
stops
has
dropped
by
nearly
overall
in
those
precincts
with
some
precincts
experiencing
declines
of
or
more
third
stops
appear
to
be
more
efficient
and
accurate
the
percentage
of
stops
resulting
in
arrest
has
more
than
doubled
the
percentage
of
stops
where
weapons
and
contraband
were
seized
remain
low
but
those
percentages
have
doubled
or
tripled
compared
to
the
rates
in
short
the
nypd
has
altered
its
day
to
day
practices
with
regard
to
stop
and
frisk
to
the
benefit
of
thousands
of
new
yorkers
and
importantly
the
reforms
in
the
nypd
s
stop
and
frisk
program
coincided
with
continued
declines
in
crime
and
violence
in
new
york
especially
homicides
which
declined
by
from
to
the
one
negative
finding
is
the
persistence
of
racial
disparities
in
those
subjected
to
stop
and
frisk
minorities
remain
overrepresented
among
those
stopped
frisked
searched
and
arrested
by
the
nypd
according
to
the
census
bureau
the
racial
and
ethnic
composition
of
new
york
city
is
approximately
white
black
hispanic
asian
and
other
n
in
the
percentage
of
whites
blacks
and
hispanics
combining
black
hispanic
with
white
hispanic
stopped
was
and
respectively
the
authors
acknowledge
that
the
racial
composition
of
a
population
is
a
rough
at
best
benchmark
for
assessing
racial
disparities
other
benchmarks
such
as
the
racial
composition
of
the
arrestee
population
in
new
york
would
suggest
much
smaller
racial
disparities
n
nevertheless
the
stability
in
race
ethnicity
among
those
who
were
stopped
in
and
in
is
troubling
given
that
the
federal
court
determined
that
the
nypd
was
engaged
in
unconstitutional
stop
and
frisks
in
notably
the
persistence
of
racial
disparities
in
new
york
is
consistent
with
findings
from
the
few
studies
that
have
examined
the
impact
of
consent
decrees
on
discriminatory
police
practices
in
other
jurisdictions
e
g
new
jersey
and
los
angeles
n
it
is
clear
that
more
work
needs
to
be
done
in
new
york
but
this
fact
should
not
overshadow
the
considerable
progress
that
the
nypd
has
made
during
the
last
few
years
and
importantly
the
structure
for
effective
police
reform
in
new
york
is
in
place
for
example
recent
changes
have
been
made
to
training
and
policy
the
student
guide
for
patrol
recruits
presents
officers
with
a
more
inclusive
understanding
of
diversity
issues
as
police
officers
you
are
required
to
enforce
the
law
impartially
without
regard
to
actual
or
perceived
race
class
ethnicity
culture
religion
age
gender
sexual
orientation
disability
immigration
or
housing
status
at
the
same
time
we
are
members
of
a
larger
society
in
which
bias
and
discrimination
against
certain
groups
of
people
are
matters
of
historical
and
statistical
fact
as
noted
in
a
recent
speech
by
police
commissioner
bratton
american
policing
has
been
part
of
the
best
of
american
history
but
unfortunately
some
of
the
worst
parts
as
well
understanding
this
history
and
how
it
has
shaped
perceptions
will
help
you
become
a
better
more
effective
police
officer
n
the
nypd
is
also
in
the
process
of
revising
the
patrol
guide
to
provide
clearer
more
accurate
guidance
on
the
proper
legal
standards
for
stop
and
frisk
including
what
constitutes
a
stop
when
a
stop
may
be
conducted
when
a
frisk
may
be
conducted
and
when
a
search
may
be
conducted
a
definition
of
reasonable
suspicion
the
standard
needed
for
a
stop
based
on
terry
v
ohio
that
officers
must
have
separate
reasonable
suspicion
that
a
person
is
armed
and
dangerous
in
order
to
conduct
a
frisk
of
that
person
require
ing
officers
to
document
the
stop
and
reasonable
suspicion
and
if
conducted
the
frisk
on
both
a
stop
report
form
formerly
called
a
uf
and
in
their
activity
logs
require
ing
supervisory
review
of
stops
including
review
of
the
constitutionality
of
the
stop
not
just
that
a
stop
report
form
was
filled
out
and
provid
ing
for
supervisors
to
identify
officers
needing
further
training
and
or
potential
discipline
n
last
the
federal
monitor
reviews
nypd
activities
analyzes
data
and
issues
public
reports
with
recommendations
for
change
the
monitor
s
reports
can
document
progress
but
they
can
also
highlight
deficiencies
in
supervision
policy
and
training
the
reporting
of
deficiencies
provides
a
roadmap
for
continued
reform
and
the
public
nature
of
this
reporting
places
tremendous
pressure
on
the
nypd
to
follow
that
roadmap
and
address
the
identified
deficiencies
in
sum
the
findings
presented
here
show
that
the
nypd
has
made
significant
progress
since
and
the
proper
mechanisms
are
in
place
to
ensure
that
the
department
will
continue
to
move
toward
widespread
constitutional
policing
b
larger
lessons
for
federal
civil
litigation
as
an
instrument
for
police
reform
the
federal
court
litigation
in
new
york
was
relatively
unique
since
the
case
was
filed
as
a
class
action
lawsuit
plaintiffs
first
had
to
satisfy
the
four
requirements
for
class
certification
under
federal
rule
of
civil
procedure
b
namely
numerosity
commonality
typicality
and
adequacy
n
then
plaintiffs
were
required
to
demonstrate
fourth
and
fourteenth
amendment
liability
for
the
certified
class
as
a
result
of
the
nypd
s
stop
and
frisk
program
margeson
highlighted
the
power
of
this
federal
civil
litigation
approach
politics
socio
economic
inequality
and
the
accumulation
of
precedent
that
has
diminished
the
likelihood
of
legal
redress
for
fourth
and
fourteenth
amendment
violations
have
effectively
deregulated
police
power
to
conduct
investigative
terry
stops
the
floyd
litigation
demonstrates
the
immense
value
of
judicial
process
to
advocates
of
social
reform
especially
where
the
prospective
beneficiaries
have
been
underserved
by
the
democratic
process
in
floyd
the
democratic
and
judicial
processes
worked
in
tandem
to
effect
a
policy
shift
in
the
oversight
of
police
conduct
that
either
branch
acting
in
isolation
most
probably
would
not
have
achieved
n
though
the
floyd
case
began
as
a
class
action
suit
in
the
judge
s
ruling
in
mimicked
the
oversight
process
outlined
in
as
a
result
the
progress
made
by
the
nypd
in
the
three
years
since
the
floyd
ruling
speaks
directly
to
the
potential
for
consent
decrees
to
effect
change
in
police
departments
only
a
handful
of
studies
have
sought
to
assess
the
effectiveness
of
consent
decrees
on
law
enforcement
agencies
engaged
in
pattern
or
practice
unconstitutional
policing
the
research
is
mixed
but
there
are
modestly
promising
findings
from
that
small
body
of
work
e
g
enhanced
public
satisfaction
implementation
of
new
processes
and
policies
reductions
in
use
of
force
and
citizen
complaints
during
the
consent
decree
and
greater
transparency
via
access
to
department
data
and
independent
monitor
reports
n
more
generally
the
experiences
of
agencies
under
consent
decrees
demonstrate
that
police
reform
is
a
complex
multi
year
process
with
a
high
level
of
difficulty
it
involves
organizational
change
in
a
profession
characterized
by
resistance
to
change
and
the
remedies
target
functions
that
go
to
the
very
core
of
policing
supervision
training
policy
and
accountability
in
short
police
reform
is
a
marathon
not
a
sprint
the
results
from
this
study
demonstrate
that
important
police
reforms
can
be
achieved
early
on
during
the
marathon

it
should
be
noted
that
laws
against
vagrancy
and
loitering
exacerbated
the
problems
attendant
to
unclear
stop
and
frisk
authority
indeed
vagrancy
and
loitering
laws
blurred
suspicion
with
criminal
conduct
by
permitting
the
police
to
make
arrests
and
searches
incident
to
arrest
whenever
someone
seemed
out
of
place
or
presented
as
an
undesirable
in
a
particular
location
see
caleb
foote
vagrancy
type
law
and
its
administration
u
pa
l
rev
it
is
important
to
note
that
two
quite
different
kinds
of
suspicion
are
involved
the
alleged
vagrant
may
be
suspected
of
past
criminality
the
arrest
for
vagrancy
offering
the
opportunity
to
investigate
whether
the
suspect
is
wanted
in
another
jurisdiction
or
has
committed
other
crimes
on
the
other
hand
the
suspicion
may
be
of
future
criminality
the
inference
being
that
purposeful
poverty
is
likely
to
lead
to
other
crimes
unless
the
state
steps
in
id
at
footnote
omitted
in
other
words
much
of
the
crime
prevention
work
accomplished
by
modern
stop
and
frisk
procedures
used
to
be
accomplished
by
vagrancy
and
loitering
law
arrests
perhaps
it
is
therefore
unsurprising
that
within
four
years
of
the
terry
sibron
and
peters
stop
and
frisk
triumvirate
the
u
s
supreme

invalidated
a

the

harlan

concurring
opinion
did
so
and
clarified
that
a

is
distinct
from
an
arrest

a

is
different
from
a

over

marking
a
new
frontier
in

motivated
violence
is
about
to
occur
in

time
the
researchers
then
will
compare
the
data
against
records
of
reported
violent
acts
the
u

department
of
justice
is
investing
in
research
by
cardiff
university
social
data
science
lab
which
has
been
at
the
forefront
of
predictive
social

models
cardiff
university
professor
matthew
williams
said
the
research
is
designed
to
eventually
enable
authorities
to
predict
when
and
where
hate
crime
is
likely
to
occur
and
deploy
law
enforcement
resources
to
prevent
it
the
insights
provided
by
our
work
will
help
u
s
localities
to
design
policies
to
address
specific
hate
crime
issues
unique
to
their
jurisdiction
and
allow
service
providers
to
tailor
their
services
to
the
needs
of
victims
especially
if
those
victims
are
members
of
an
emerging
category
of
hate
crime
targets
his
lab
s
previous
research
in
the
united
kingdom
found
that
twitter
data
can
be
used
to
identify
areas
where
hate
speech
is
occurring
but
where
no
hate
crimes
have
been
committed
this
can
be
useful
researchers
said
in
neighborhoods
with
many
new
immigrants
who
are
unlikely
to
report
the
crime
because
of
fear
of
deportation
in
an
estimated
nonfatal
violent
and
property
hate
crimes
occurred
in
the
united
states
according
to
the
bureau
of
justice
statistics
about
percent
of
those
were
not
reported
the
justice
department
found
of
course
there
is
a
big
difference
between
someone
spouting
off
on
twitter
or
snapchat
and
an
actual
hate
crime
it
is
a
great
idea
in
the
abstract
but
it
is
not
the
panacea
you
might
think
said
brian
levin
executive
director
of
cal
state
san
bernardino
s
center
on
hate
and
extremism
the
problem
is
the
correlation
and
reliability
there
are
many
different
forms
of
social
media
levin
who
has
tracked
both
middle
eastern
terror
groups
and
local
neo
nazi
organizations
also
noted
that
some
hate
groups
don
t
advertise
their
work
on
social
media
local
tensions
may
arise
to
fly
and
be
absent
from
social
media
he
said
some
segments
of
the
community
shun
social
media
so
examining
social
media
as
a
predictor
can
be
a
bit
like
having
one
screwdriver
and
sometimes
it
doesn
t
work
predictive
policing
already
is
in
use
at
the
los
angeles
police
department
and
other
agencies
the
lapd
uses
a
predictive
policing
algorithm
to
deploy
officers
to
locations
where
prior
crime
patterns
strongly
suggest
similar
crimes
may
occur
as
crime
during
the
last
two
decades
has
dropped
dramatically
across
the
nation
and
los
angeles
police
commanders
are
increasingly
looking
for
any
edge
they
can
get
in
cutting
crime
l
a
county
is
particularly
useful
because
a
huge
volume
of
social
media
produces
massive
data
sets
that
increase
the
accuracy
of
predictive
models
over
traditional
crime
analysis
and
trend
chasing
said
pete
burnap
from
cardiff
university
s
school
of
computer
science
and
informatics
predictive
policing
is
a
proactive
law
enforcement
model
that
has
become
more
common
partially
due
to
the
advent
of
advanced
analytics
such
as
data
mining
and
machine
learning
methods
he
said
traditional
predictive
police
modeling
has
paired
historical
crime
records
with
geographical
locations
and
then
made
a
probable
calculation
to
predict
future
crimes
but
twitter
and
social
media
based
models
work
in
real
time
using
what
people
are
talking
about
now
the
algorithms
look
for
particular
language
that
is
likely
to
indicate
the
imminent
occurrence
of
a
crime
british
researchers
began
looking
at
cyber
hate
in

aftermath
of
the

of

as

usa
length
words
from
a
computer
at
chicago
s
police
headquarters
on
the
city
s
south
side
deputy
chief
jonathan
lewin
pulls
up
a
list
of
about
names
of
people
with
criminal
records
attached
to
each
name
is
a
mug
shot
demographics
prior
arrest
record
and
gang
affiliation
there
is
also
a
score
determined
by
a
computer
algorithm
based
on
weighted
variables
the
score
measures
the
likelihood
of
a
person
to
be
involved
in
a
shooting
either
as
a
victim
or
an
offender
the
scores
range
from
to
and
the
higher
the
score
the
more
likely
the
person
will
be
a
party
to
violence
this
is
really
evidence
based
policing
says
deputy
chief
lewin
chicago
is
at
the
forefront
of
a
growing
trend
in
police
departments
across
the
united
states
to
use
big
data
and
algorithms
to
determine
the
individuals
and
places
that
are
most
as
risk
for
violence
some
of
these
risk
assessments
are
astonishingly
accurate
but
while
the
people
centered
model
pioneered
in
chicago
is
now
spreading
predictive
policing
so
far
has
not
succeeded
in
bringing
down
the
murder
rate
here
that
s
led
some
to
question
whether
big
data
alone
can
prevent
crimes
it
is
certainly
possible
that
other
factors
such
as
a
breakdown
in
trust
between
police
and
minority
communities
a
need
to
hire
more
officers
or
the
overturning
of
the
city
s
gun
laws
in
federal
court
may
be
driving
the
increase
in
the
murder
rate
which
is
up
percent
over
this
time
last
year
supporters
of
the
data
program
for
their
part
say
they
believe
the
murder
spike
would
be
worse
without
the
predictive
tools
the
idea
that
one
might
be
able
to
target
and
approach
the
human
drivers
and
do
something
about
that
is
obviously
incredibly
attractive
to
police
departments
says
andrew
ferguson
a
law
professor
at
the
university
of
the
district
of
columbia
in
washington
the
difficulty
with
chicago
as
a
laboratory
is
that
predictive
policing
is
obviously
not
working
that
might
not
be
the
fault
of
the
theory
but
just
empirically
we
re
seeing
the
bodies
pile
up
in
the
city
other
cities
however
have
seen
success
in
using
data
to
bring
down
the
crime
rate
the
los
angeles
police
department
lapd
expanded
a
program
to
predict
where
to
deploy
its
officers
to
of
its
divisions
up
from
three
in
after
a
university
of
california
at
los
angeles
study
showed
that
the
computers
prevented
twice
as
much
crime
as
trained
analysts
chicago
uses
a
different
algorithm
and
it
also
may
have
aggravating
factors
contributing
to
its
rise
in
murders
in
the
wake
of
shootings
of
unarmed
minorities
the
city
has
been
wracked
by
months
of
turmoil
and
protests
that
led
to
the
firing
of
the
former
police
chief
the
federal
government
is
investigating
the
shooting
of
unarmed
teenager
laquan
mcdonald
and
a
months
long
investigation
by
the
police
accountability
task
force
concluded
in
april
that
the
chicago
police
department
has
a
history
of
using
excessive
force
against
minorities
and
perpetuating
a
code
of
silence
can
you
imagine
where
we
d
be
if
everyone
wasn
t
working
as
hard
as
they
were
now
says
christopher
mallette
executive
director
of
the
chicago
violence
reduction
strategy
the
reason
that
we
struggle
with
a
solution
is
that
people
don
t
want
to
look
at
the
problem
in
its
totality
we
want
to
look
at
the
part
that
makes
sense
to
us
can
math
save
lives
predictive
policing
has
its
origins
in
a
program
started
in
by
the
lapd
that
early
program
used
analytical
techniques
to
determine
locations
that
were
most
at
risk
for
criminal
activity
chicago
became
the
first
city
to
use
a
people
centered
model
when
it
launched
the
first
version
of
its
strategic
subject
list
algorithm
in
based
on
the
public
health
concept
that
crime
is
like
a
contagion
that
can
spread
from
person
to
person
the
model
analyzes
social
networks
to
determine
who
is
most
likely
to
be
involved
in
violent
crimes
since
then
kansas
city
los
angeles
and
new
orleans
have
started
using
big
data
to
determine
who
among
their
population
is
most
at
risk
sixty
six
people
were
killed
in
the
city
in
may
alone
making
last
month
the
deadliest
may
in
years
more
than
percent
of
shooting
victims
and
percent
of
individuals
arrested
for
shootings
in
so
far
have
been
on
the
ssl
so
why
hasn
t
the
accuracy
of
the
algorithm
translated
into
less
crime
on
the
street
professor
ferguson
says
that
while
many
initially
saw
big
data
as
a
panacea
for
reducing
crime
realistically
it
may
be
better
at
identifying
problems
that
preventing
murders
people
should
recognize
that
big
data
does
provide
real
insights
and
allows
you
to
see
things
that
you
might
not
see
without
the
data
says
ferguson
but
the
solution
is
not
in
the
data
it
s
in
what
you
do
with
the
data
i
think
what
a
lot
of
people
have
done
is
take
the
first
step
which
is
the
easier
step
to
crunch
the
numbers
and
not
taken
the
second
step
which
is
to
ask
now
that
we
ve
identified
these
risks
how
do
we
remedy
this
the
home
visit
model
in
chicago
law
enforcement
officers
community
members
and
social
service
agencies
all
take
part
in
the
home
visits
called
custom
notifications
the
police
department
does
for
people
on
the
strategic
subject
list
during
the
home
visit
police
officers
warn
the
person
on
the
ssl
and
their
family
that
they
are
in
danger
of
either
being
shot
killed
or
put
in
prison
then
a
community
partner
offers
help
in
the
form
of
job
training
opportunities
substance
abuse
counseling
and
better
housing
options
this
carrot
and
stick
model
comes
from
a
realization
on
the
police
department
s
part
that
as
new
superintendent
eddie
johnson
said
in
an
interview
we
cannot
arrest
our
way
out
of
this
situation
but
at
the
same
time
superintendent
johnson
says
that
those
who
do
not
accept
the
offer
of
help
on
custom
notification
visits
should
not
expect
leniency
what
those
individuals
need
to
know
if
they
choose
to
stay
in
that
lifestyle
we
ll
come
after
them
with
everything
that
we
have
says
johnson
rand
corp
is
currently
studying
the
effectiveness
of
chicago
s
ssl
and
its
data
informed
interventions
according
to
the
individuals
who
go
on
home
visits
results
thus
far
have
been
mixed
roughly
in
home
visits
results
in
someone
accepting
an
offer
of
help
according
to
mr
mallette
who
invites
representatives
from
one
of
six
outreach
and
support
organizations
to
each
house
call
he
says
that
the
police
have
connected
with
between
and
individuals
through
custom
notification
during
the
past
three
years
while
it
s
too
early
to
tell
the
long
term
effect
of
the
house
visits
mallette
says
that
he
s
seen
some
changes
in
those
individuals
in
the
short
term
chicago
police
deputy
chief
dave
mcnaughton
recalls
one
occasion
where
he
went
to
do
a
custom
notification
for
a
young
man
he
says
his
mother
was
in
complete
denial
about
her
son
s
risk
for
gun
violence
she
pretty
much
told
us
to
leave
the
home
which
we
did
of
course
says
deputy
chief
mcnaughton
i
remember
three
days
later
there
was
a
person
shot
right
behind
her
house
that
was
playing
with
her
son
on
the
same
day
that
mcnaughton
met
the
mother
he
did
a
custom
notification
for
a
person
who
was
deeply
involved
in
the
violence
in
the
th
police
district
on
chicago
s
southwest
side
he
met
with
the
subject
s
significant
other
and
she
accepted
their
offers
of
help
the
couple
got
services
to
move
out
of
the
neighborhood
and
mcnaughton
says
that
person
has
not
been
involved
in
violence
since
who
should
take
the
lead
ferguson
says
that
part
of
the
problem
with
chicago
s
data
driven
interventions
might
be
the
very
fact
that
the
police
are
the
ones
leading
them
like
risk
assessment
lists
in
many
cities
chicago
s
strategic
subject
list
is
made
available
only
to
law
enforcement
officers
and
is
not
given
out
to
the
social
service
agencies
who
lead
violence
prevention
programs
or
to
the
community
groups
who
may
know
the
individuals
most
at
risk
to
me
the
big
mistake
of
all
of
this
is
putting
predictive
policing
in
the
hands
of
the
police
says
ferguson
the
identifying
of
risk
within
a
society
should
be
put
in
the
hands
of
other
social
service
entities
it
should
be
with
the
larger
city
rather
than
just
the
police
mallette
agrees
that
the
community
should
play
an
important
role
in
data
driven
interventions
our
focus
isn
t
on
locking
people
up
our
focus
is
on
saving
people
s
lives
says
mallette
we
re
trying
to
take
active
measures
to
try
and
provide
assistance
from
multiple
angles
law
enforcement
is
doing
what
law
enforcement
is
doing
our
message
is
that
the
community
loves
you
we
value
you

three

milpitas
police
department
had
hopes
of
employing
a
new
crime
fighting
technology
that
bordered
on
something
one
might
see
in
a
science
fiction
movie
but
about
a
year
after
the
city
authorized
a
three
year
contract
with
california
based
predpol
inc
for
so
called
predictive
policing
software
which
uses
mathematics
social
science
and
probability
to
geographically
pinpoint
and
ultimately
reduce
crime
the
department
pulled
the
plug
on
the
agreement
after
approximately
one
year
of
usage
it
was
our
experience
that
the
minimal
benefit
did
not
justify
continuing
costs
milpitas
police

said
last

here
were

an
area
as
small
as
feet
by
feet
in
total
it
will
hopefully
reduce
crime
pangelinan
previously
said
fast
forward
three
years
and
the
police
chief
found
the
software
less
than
stellar
it
was
our
experience
that
we
often
did
not
have
sufficient
staff
to
post
officers
at
predpol
identified
locations
and
still
remain
responsive
to
priority
calls
for
service
pangelinan
said
he
added
his
police
force
discovered
that
within
milpitas
approximately
square
miles
the
existing
internal
processes
of
tracking
crime
and
identifying
potential
areas
of
exposure
were
often
more
accurate
than
results
received
from
predpol
since
ditching
predpol
pangelinan
asserted
milpitas
police
are
not
using
similar
crime
predictive
technologies
in
part
due
to
the
size
of
the
city
i
think
the
predpol
system
may
have
greater
benefit
to
law
enforcement
organizations
policing
much
larger
geographical
jurisdictions
where
greater
variables
in
crime
patterns
may
exist
he
said
when
the
city
s
police
force
had
envisioned
using
predpol
the
technology
had
come
with
some
fanfare
that
included
time
magazine
which
called
the
predictive
policing
software
one
of
the
best
inventions
of
similarly
a
associated
press
story
on
the
new
technology
stated
los
angeles
police
department
was
the
largest
agency
to
embrace
the
technology
predpol
s
website
states
its
tool
was
developed
over
the
course
of
six
years
by
a
team
of
mathematicians
and
social
scientists
at
the
university
of

at

states
the
mission
for
its

is
simple

to
give
them
the

have
implemented

s

and
claim
reductions
in

in
those
cities
the
firm

states
according
to
pangelinan
there
was
no
real
cost
to
the

he
said
meanwhile
pangelinan
asserted
that
crime
rates
which
can
be
cyclical
rising
and
falling
year
over
year
in
the
city
of
milpitas
has
been
declining
as
of

he
said
the
federal

s
part
serious
violent
crimes
such
as
murder
rape
robbery
aggravated
assault
auto
theft
arson
burglary
have
all
seen
decreases
in
milpitas
in
the
last
year
or
so
in
we
realized
a
percent
increase
in
fbi
part
crimes
and
in
a

increase
however
in
crime
in
these

categories
declined
by
more

percent
pangelinan
said
through
may
of
crime
in
these
same
categories
are
down
percent
below

to
date
numbers
in
but
pangelinan
would
not
comment
as
to
the
reason
whether
its
old
fashinoned

some
other

we

text
introduction
time
travel
fascinates
whether
it
is
the
science
fiction
of
h
g
wells
n
the
humor
of
back
to
the
future
n
or
the
hollywood
manifestations
in
terminator
genisys
n
project
almanac
n
and
tomorrowland
n
the
reality
is
quite
a
bit
more
pedantic
astronauts
travel
into
the
future
via
the
relativistic
effects
of
time
dilation
it
is
true
but
in
an
amount
measured
in
milliseconds
n
to
do
anything
more
impressive
would
require
greater
speeds
than
are
currently
possible
n
gazing
at
the
stars
is
seeing
events
of
time
past
it
is
true
n
but
i
can
do
the
same
by
inserting
a
dvd
or
opening
a
book
travel
into
the
past
remains
the
domain
and
dispute
of
theoretical
physics
and
its
einstein
rosen
bridges
more
commonly
known
as
wormholes
meaning
that
so
far
as
we
know
traveling
backwards
in
time
might
prove
forever
impossible
n
so
much
for
science
n
yet
when
it
comes
to
criminal
investigation
time
travel
seems
increasingly
possible
it
is
not
actually
time
travel
of
course
and
it
has
longstanding
roots
in
traditional
investigation
but
science
has
provided
us
remarkably
complete
historical
records
in
the
form
of
digital
data
n
well
over
a
half
century
ago
justice
robert
h
jackson
recognized
that
it
would
no
doubt
simplify
enforcement
of
all
criminal
laws
if
each
citizen
were
required
to
keep
a
diary
that
would
show
where
he
was
at
all
times
with
whom
he
was
and
what
he
was
up
to
n
the
law
requires
no
such
diary
only
in
certain
sector
specific
instances
such
as
banking
prescription
records
or
hotel
registries
has
the
law
itself
created
comprehensive
records
n
nonetheless
we
increasingly
create
a
diary
like
that
justice
jackson
envisioned
via
our
smartphones
and
online
technologies
and
we
even
helpfully
carry
it
with
us
wherever
we
go
further
the
national
security
agency
nsa
has
demonstrated
that
data
from
various
third
party
sources
might
be
gathered
stored
and
later
queried
for
evidence
of
criminality
or
in
that
case
evidence
of
threats
to
national
security
n
in
short
we
are
living
in
the
golden
age
of
surveillance
n
and
lest
we
think
criminal
investigation
can
only
offer
that
elusive
travel
back
in
time
developments
in
data
mining
and
machine
learning
are
demonstrating
that
significant
human
behavior
is
predictable
for
example
one
study
using
mobile
phone
data
found
that
location
is
predictable
n
and
based
only
upon
facebook
likes
a
computer
was
able
to
better
predict
personality
and
personal
problems
including
substance
abuse
than
real
life
friends
n
so
the
more
we
learn
about
the
past
the
better
we
can
predict
the
future
n
we
have
not
reached
anything
like
the
world
of
philip
k
dick
s
the
minority
report
with
its
mutant
forward
seeing
precogs
n
or
the
world
of
lewis
padgett
s
private
eye
with
its
ever
recording
surroundings
n
but
as
is
so
often
the
case
today
s
science
is
creeping
towards
yesterday
s
science
fiction
so
what
happens
as
technology
increasingly
permits
capture
of
almost
all
information
how
should
we
and
our
constitutional
jurisprudence
approach
bulk
government
capture
such
as
by
a
solar
powered
drone
employing
wide
area
persistent
stare
technology
n
or
by
a
massive
system
of
interconnected
ground
cameras
n
is
it
equivalent
to
a
general
warrant
that
can
never
be
reasonable
or
is
that
too
simplistic
an
analogy
n
the
general
warrant
permitted
indiscriminate
searching
not
merely
storing
is
such
direct
gathering
meaningfully
different
from
what
the
government
could
obtain
from
a
private
party
gathering
such
data
either
by
drone
n
or
by
a
vast
network
of
interconnected
cameras
n
is
it
meaningfully
different
from
what
is
available
via
an
internet
service
provider
that
logs
all
of
our
online
activity
or
from
a
mobile
phone
company
tracking
all
of
our
movements
what
about
searches
of
our
own
devices
that
spy
upon
us
like
our
computers
that
log
information
we
do
not
realize
or
desire
can
the
government
forever
freeze
and
store
that
data
creating
a
mini
targeted
time
machine
can
it
do
the
same
by
recording
every
home
that
officers
enter
perhaps
via
officer
body
cameras
while
it
may
not
be
immediately
obvious
what
to
do
about
these
disparate
fourth
amendment
time
machines
there
is
value
in
considering
them
for
what
they
are
we
should
consider
how
they
affect
the
security
in
our
persons
houses
papers
and
effects
n
and
we
should
consider
their
benefits
to
criminal
investigation
and
perhaps
separately
to
front
end
deterrence
we
have
always
known
that
limited
government
norms
like
that
expressed
in
the
fourth
amendment
are
anti
accuracy
if
police
could
enter
any
home
at
will
or
even
were
quartered
there
we
would
have
less
crime
n
but
life
would
be
insufferable
and
so
we
accept
more
crime
in
return
for
more
liberty
while
always
attempting
not
only
the
ideal
balance
whatever
that
might
be
but
also
always
seeking
pareto
superior
moves
that
increase
one
without
lessening
the
other
as
science
increasingly
permits
capture
without
immediate
human
observation
does
this
call
for
a
fundamental
rethinking
should
we
in
certain
instances
abandon
entirely
front
end
limitations
on
capture
so
long
as
we
are
guaranteed
evenhanded
treatment
that
traditional
investigation
lacks
and
back
end
limitations
on
access
use
and
distribution
can
we
ever
feel
secure
if
there
is
a
government
database
of
ruin
that
could
be
accessed
at
any
moment
n
yet
can
we
turn
our
backs
on
the
ability
to
save
lives
and
livelihoods
and
in
a
manner
that
uniformly
distributes
the
privacy
costs
n
for
some
perhaps
the
failed
east
german
state
and
its
stasi
is
sufficient
answer
a
view
to
which
i
am
personally
sympathetic
n
but
of
course
access
to
those
secret
police
files
was
not
strictly
circumscribed
by
fair
legal
process
and
more
importantly
the
data
in
the
files
were
created
by
and
for
officers
of
the
state
should
the
same
rules
apply
when
data
are
created
for
other
beneficial
purposes
or
will
never
be
subject
to
human
analysis
except
upon
demonstrated
cause
n
and
if
it
becomes
the
case
that
either
on
account
of
lack
of
political
will
or
perhaps
on
account
of
very
broadly
interpreted
first
amendment
rights
private
third
parties
retain
all
data
n
is
there
a
realistic
way
to
keep
them
out
of
government
hands
or
do
the
more
important
questions
essentially
once
again
amount
to
access
use
and
disclosure
if
a
store
everything
world
is
so
abhorrent
and
i
personally
believe
it
might
be
then
why
do
we
keep
rushing
towards
precisely
that
n
big
questions
rarely
have
small
or
singular
answers
and
this
article
will
hardly
provide
either
but
it
can
begin
the
conversation
or
more
accurately
continue
it
under
different
framing
it
does
so
in
the
following
manner
part
i
reminds
us
what
the
national
security
agency
was
attempting
with
its
bulk
telephone
metadata
collection
and
then
looks
at
two
recent
court
decisions
one
by
a
second
circuit
panel
in
united
states
v
ganias
now
headed
en
banc
n
and
one
from
the
united
states
supreme
court
in
riley
v
california
n
each
of
which
articulates
a
realization
that
historic
digital
data
are
meaningfully
different
for
fourth
amendment
purposes
it
then
considers
the
supreme
court
s
most
recent
fourth
amendment
decision
city
of
los
angeles
v
patel
in
which
the
court
floats
the
proposition
that
record
keeping
for
purposes
of
deterrence
might
be
a
special
need
subject
to
more
lenient
fourth
amendment
rules
n
all
three
decisions
and
the
nsa
metadata
program
concern
what
might
be
considered
fourth
amendment
time
machines
part
ii
canvasses
the
important
principles
of
information
privacy
that
are
at
stake
part
iii
then
travels
back
in
time
to
consider
a
proposal
by
harold
krent
in
which
he
argues
the
fourth
amendment
should
employ
use
restrictions
upon
data
law
enforcement
has
lawfully
acquired
n
the
second
circuit
panel
in
ganias
would
have
recognized
such
a
restriction
n
it
would
of
course
be
a
significant
further
move
to
argue
that
the
fourth
amendment
might
be
satisfied
by
such
restrictions
alone
a
move
i
believe
is
fraught
with
great
danger
in
most
contexts
but
perhaps
there
are
limited
contexts
in
which
a
move
to
solely
use
restrictions
is
one
that
legislatures
courts
agencies
and
commentators
should
at
least
debate
if
not
begin
to
experiment
with
particularly
when
designed
by
legislatures
perhaps
programs
of
uniform
applicability
should
generally
be
considered
constitutionally
reasonable
and
if
there
is
any
chance
we
are
ever
to
rely
solely
upon
back
end
limitations
in
the
world
of
fourth
amendment
time
machines
it
would
be
best
to
start
learning
now
in
smaller
spheres
whether
such
means
can
ever
alone
guarantee
the
securities
promised
by
the
fourth
amendment
thus
perhaps
an
ideal
sphere
for
experimentation
might
be
officer
body
cameras
here
the
benefits
of
always
recording
are
sufficiently
great
and
the
domain
sufficiently
narrow
that
it
seems
reasonable
and
perhaps
wise
to
always
record
and
to
rely
upon
access
use
and
disclosure
limitations
to
protect
our
security
interests
i
the
nsa
hard
drives
cell
phones
and
hotel
registries
on
june
glenn
greenwald
broke
the
first
story
based
upon
the
disclosures
of
former
nsa
contractor
edward
snowden
n
pursuant
to
an
order
from
the
secret
foreign
intelligence
surveillance
court
verizon
business
was
providing
the
national
security
agency
on
an
ongoing
daily
basis
all
call
detail
records
or
telephony
metadata
created
for
communications
i
between
the
united
states
and
abroad
or
ii
wholly
within
the
united
states
including
local
telephone
calls
n
telephony
metadata
was
defined
to
include
originating
and
terminating
telephone
number
and
time
and
duration
of
the
call
n
the
nsa
was
creating
a
database
of
all
telephone
calls
made
on
the
verizon
business
network
similar
orders
were
issued
to
other
carriers
such
that
the
nsa
was
databasing
virtually
all
telephone
calls
made
or
received
in
the
united
states
n
why
perhaps
no
program
of
surveillance
is
surprising
for
an
agency
that
eerily
declares
its
collection
posture
as
sniff
it
all
know
it
all
collect
it
all
process
it
all
exploit
it
all
partner
share
it
all
n
but
why
in
particular
did
the
nsa
want
to
gather
these
phone
records
because
the
nsa
wanted
a
time
machine
n
say
on
august
the
agency
obtained
reason
to
believe
a
particular
telephone
number
was
being
used
by
a
terrorist
that
might
lead
to
a
court
order
requiring
the
provider
to
place
a
pen
register
and
trap
and
trace
device
on
that
line
n
but
of
course
the
line
might
at
this
point
be
abandoned
or
at
least
this
would
not
reveal
communications
made
in
the
past
so
a
court
order
might
require
the
provider
to
produce
historic
records
n
only
the
provider
might
have
retained
those
records
for
only
a
limited
duration
moreover
the
nsa
wanted
guaranteed
access
not
only
to
the
numbers
with
which
had
communicated
first
hop
but
also
the
numbers
with
which
those
first
hop
numbers
had
communicated
second
hop
and
further
the
numbers
with
which
those
second
hop
persons
had
communicated
third
hop
n
the
amount
of
data
is
growing
exponentially
such
that
if
each
telephone
number
communicated
with
one
hundred
others
the
nsa
is
looking
at
one
million
records
quite
convenient
then
to
have
everything
stored
and
ready
to
query
in
their
own
servers
time
machines
are
handy
like
that
n
the
nsa
claimed
statutory
authorization
to
create
this
historical
repository
n
was
found
in
section
of
the
usa
patriot
act
n
whether
or
not
it
would
be
ideal
to
create
such
time
machines
the
nsa
was
certainly
wrong
in
claiming
it
had
been
granted
here
n
thus
the
co
author
of
usa
patriot
worked
to
enact
legislation
that
has
for
now
shut
down
this
particular
program
at
least
in
the
sense
that
the
telephone
records
are
no
longer
being
centralized
from
all
providers
and
held
by
the
government
n
but
this
has
not
been
the
first
such
government
attempt
n
and
it
would
be
startling
if
it
is
the
last
there
is
nothing
particularly
special
about
telephone
numbers
that
make
them
the
only
useful
time
machine
metadata
the
same
use
could
be
made
of
financial
internet
and
other
data
n
in
rejecting
the
nsa
s
contention
that
its
bulk
collection
satisfied
the
required
relevance
threshold
the
second
circuit
reasoned
as
follows
if
information
can
be
deemed
relevant
solely
because
of
its
necessity
to
a
particular
process
that
the
government
has
chosen
to
employ
regardless
of
its
subject
matter
then
so
long
as
the
government
develops
an
effective
means
of
searching
through
everything
in
order
to
find
something
everything
becomes
relevant
to
its
investigations
and
the
government
s
technological
capacity
to
ingest
information
and
sift
through
it
efficiently
would
be
the
only
limit
to
what
is
relevant
n
this
criticism
first
made
by
the
privacy
and
civil
liberties
oversight
board
is
a
fair
criticism
of
the
nsa
s
interpretation
of
relevance
in
that
it
is
an
interpretation
inconsistent
with
legal
tradition
but
notice
the
proposition
is
not
illogical
if
later
searches
would
prove
useful
in
investigating
national
security
threats
or
crime
the
existence
of
the
database
is
relevant
to
a
legitimate
government
role
and
the
program
did
include
audit
security
and
reporting
requirements
n
but
again
in
this
case
it
was
clear
this
novel
interpretation
was
not
one
congress
intended
the
second
circuit
was
correct
that
such
expansive
development
of
government
repositories
of
formerly
private
records
would
be
an
unprecedented
contraction
of
the
privacy
expectations
of
all
americans
perhaps
such
a
contraction
is
required
by
national
security
needs
in
the
face
of
the
dangers
of
contemporary
domestic
and
international
terrorism
but
we
would
expect
such
a
momentous
decision
to
be
preceded
by
substantial
debate
and
expressed
in
unmistakable
language
n
instead
usa
patriot
and
its
legislative
sponsors
intended
and
therefore
used
the
traditional
language
of
legal
relevance
n
but
what
if
the
debate
occurred
and
that
unmistakable
language
did
come
about
then
there
would
of
course
be
the
question
of
whether
it
is
a
method
of
investigation
the
constitution
will
abide
although
the
second
circuit
did
not
decide
this
constitutional
issue
it
recognized
the
issue
as
one
of
the
most
difficult
issues
in
fourth
amendment
jurisprudence
the
extent
to
which
modern
technology
alters
our
traditional
expectations
of
privacy
n
is
this
an
issue
of
technology
after
all
was
not
the
first
investigating
time
machine
an
officer
taking
notes
on
what
she
hears
and
sees
not
to
mention
the
myriad
recordkeeping
requirements
imposed
by
the
modern
industrial
state
three
recent
decisions
shed
more
light
on
this
issue
a
panel
decision
in
the
second
circuit
now
headed
en
banc
considering
a
digital
time
machine
in
the
form
of
government
preservation
of
private
computer
hard
drives
n
a
decision
by
the
united
states
supreme
court
considering
a
voluntarily
compiled
and
carried
digital
time
machine
in
the
form
of
a
mobile
phone
n
and
another
decision
by
the
supreme
court
considering
much
more
old
fashioned
recordkeeping
in
the
form
of
a
hotel
guest
registry
n
a
ganias
and
preservation
of
hard
drives
in
november
of
federal
agents
executed
a
search
warrant
on
the
accounting
offices
of
stavros
ganias
n
ganias
himself
was
not
the
target
but
rather
the
army
was
investigating
one
of
his
clients
with
whom
the
army
contracted
n
the
agents
executing
the
warrant
therefore
did
not
remove
ganias
s
three
computers
respecting
his
as
an
ongoing
business
but
instead
mirrored
the
hard
drives
making
exact
duplications
thereof
n
forensics
examiners
thereafter
copied
that
data
onto
two
sets
of
identical
dvds
thereby
preserving
the
government
originals
from
any
harm
occasioned
by
access
n
that
access
would
not
occur
for
eight
months
until
july
when
army
forensics
agents
began
to
review
the
dvds
pursuant
to
the
search
warrant
n
when
they
discovered
the
suspect
business
might
have
committed
tax
fraud
they
shared
a
copy
of
the
data
with
the
irs
n
and
together
the
two
sets
of
investigators
ultimately
identified
all
responsive
material
by
december
of
n
nonetheless
the
agents
did
nothing
to
try
and
delete
or
return
the
non
responsive
material
unlike
for
seized
physical
items
these
agents
never
consider
deleting
or
returning
non
responsive
digital
data
n
you
never
know
what
data
you
may
need
in
the
future
testified
one
n
in
july
of
some
twenty
months
after
the
search
of
ganias
s
office
and
corresponding
seizure
of
his
computer
data
army
and
irs
investigators
came
to
believe
that
ganias
might
have
been
underreporting
income
and
therefore
expanded
their
investigation
to
include
him
as
a
suspect
n
they
therefore
wanted
to
have
another
look
at
his
files
but
appropriately
did
not
consider
their
mere
possession
of
those
files
to
authorize
further
searches
thereof
n
to
understand
why
one
must
first
consider
traditional
searches
and
basic
fourth
amendment
law
when
police
search
a
home
pursuant
to
a
warrant
they
may
look
only
where
sought
after
items
can
be
n
and
they
may
seize
only
things
the
warrant
authorizes
or
things
so
located
for
which
authority
for
seizure
is
immediately
apparent
such
as
child
pornography
or
obviously
illegal
drugs
n
these
things
are
said
to
be
in
plain
view
n
so
for
example
police
searching
for
a
large
knife
should
not
open
a
small
book
at
all
it
cannot
contain
the
sought
after
knife
and
therefore
is
not
subject
to
search
whereas
police
searching
for
a
knife
and
any
threatening
communications
could
peruse
the
small
book
but
upon
finding
it
to
contain
entirely
unrelated
material
police
of
course
must
leave
the
book
behind
unless
that
material
is
independently
subject
to
seizure
meaning
the
officer
has
probable
cause
to
believe
it
either
the
fruit
of
crime
it
appears
to
be
a
rare
book
that
was
reported
stolen
an
instrumentality
of
crime
it
appears
to
be
the
very
book
used
to
lure
a
young
victim
contraband
it
appears
to
contain
child
pornography
or
evidence
of
crime
it
appears
to
contain
the
planning
for
a
recent
bank
robbery
n
in
rare
instances
large
quantities
of
physical
documents
might
be
impossible
to
sort
onsite
but
then
special
rules
are
to
be
followed
n
with
computers
everything
is
done
differently
because
they
contain
so
much
disparate
data
and
in
so
many
formats
police
cannot
reasonably
be
expected
to
bring
experts
to
sufficiently
sort
through
it
on
site
n
thus
courts
all
permit
over
seizure
of
digital
evidence
in
every
instance
the
entire
hard
drive
say
can
be
seized
even
though
much
most
or
even
all
of
its
contents
entire
libraries
of
digital
materials
let
alone
files
arguably
equivalent
to
that
small
book
found
in
the
hypothetical
home
search
are
in
fact
entirely
innocent
n
investigators
have
thus
obtained
a
time
machine
following
the
november
execution
of
the
search
warrant
ganias
modified
the
relevant
files
n
therefore
had
the
government
not
over
seized
and
then
retained
digital
content
that
it
knew
was
not
relevant
to
the
first
investigation
and
therefore
which
was
not
covered
by
the
original
warrant
this
evidence
would
not
have
existed
n
yet
because
agents
did
retain
not
only
the
exact
copies
of
his
hard
drive
but
also
the
dvds
the
data
did
exist
and
they
might
retain
such
data
for
ten
twenty
or
a
hundred
years
n
so
pursuant
to
another
warrant
obtained
in
april
some
two
and
a
half
years
after
the
data
s
seizure
the
government
once
again
searched
the
data
and
found
incriminating
evidence
time
machines
are
handy
like
that
the
second
circuit
panel
addressed
just
this
time
machine
functionality
although
its
opinion
is
now
vacated
pending
en
banc
review
n
we
consider
a
limited
question
whether
the
fourth
amendment
permits
officials
executing
a
warrant
for
the
seizure
of
particular
data
on
a
computer
to
seize
and
indefinitely
retain
every
file
on
that
computer
for
use
in
future
criminal
investigations
we
hold
that
is
does
not
n
the
over
two
year
retention
of
ganias
s
unresponsive
data
retained
a
year
and
a
half
after
the
government
had
concluded
it
was
non
responsive
violated
the
fourth
amendment
n
or
at
the
very
least
its
use
in
a
future
criminal
investigation
did
n
i
agree
though
i
differ
from
the
panel
s
reasoning
the
panel
believed
the
government
s
position
would
mean
that
every
warrant
to
search
for
particular
electronic
data
would
become
in
essence
a
general
warrant
n
that
does
not
seem
quite
apt
as
a
general
warrant
permitted
the
executive
to
search
anyone
s
house
for
information
of
interest
n
or
at
least
one
person
s
house
for
anything
incriminating
n
whereas
both
in
and
in
the
government
obtained
a
warrant
demonstrating
particularized
suspicion
towards
ganias
s
data
and
in
each
instance
agents
thereafter
only
looked
for
the
responsive
data
instead
the
government
s
position
would
turn
every
computer
warrant
into
an
investigative
time
machine
it
is
a
serious
invasion
if
the
government
can
over
seize
massive
amounts
of
private
information
and
forever
retain
it
for
indefinite
later
search
one
can
understand
the
concern
of
the
government
which
is
that
if
the
data
are
not
retained
in
their
original
form
it
might
be
difficult
to
answer
later
claims
of
unreasonable
search
or
challenges
to
authentication
n
but
like
the
panel
i
do
not
see
that
as
an
impossible
hurdle
n
so
perhaps
the
panel
s
answer
is
broadly
the
right
answer
maybe
the
fourth
amendment
bans
even
relatively
small
digital
time
machines
no
matter
how
useful
no
matter
how
regulated
and
no
matter
how
democratically
conceived
and
applied
the
government
can
retain
the
data
for
its
original
purposes
as
long
as
it
must
but
cannot
search
the
data
for
any
other
or
perhaps
such
time
machines
are
only
permissible
where
government
need
is
at
its
highest
such
as
for
purposes
of
national
security
or
where
the
retention
was
pursuant
to
a
carefully
structured
and
fairly
inclusive
legislative
authorization
i
will
return
to
these
questions
below
the
immediate
point
is
merely
to
highlight
that
digital
evidence
has
made
these
questions
increasingly
pressing
the
supreme
court
came
to
the
same
realization
when
it
considered
searches
of
cell
phones
incident
to
lawful
arrest
b
riley
and
searches
of
cell
phones
david
riley
was
stopped
for
a
minor
traffic
infraction
his
car
was
searched
pursuant
to
impoundment
and
he
was
arrested
for
illegally
possessing
two
handguns
found
therein
n
as
police
are
permitted
to
do
as
a
routine
incident
of
any
lawful
arrest
n
officers
searched
riley
s
person
and
found
a
smartphone
in
his
pocket
n
a
search
of
that
phone
onsite
and
a
couple
of
hours
later
at
the
station
yielded
relevant
evidence
in
the
form
of
incriminating
text
messages
videos
and
images
n
the
supreme
court
consolidated
riley
s
case
with
that
of
brima
wurie
who
was
arrested
following
an
apparent
drug
sale
n
at
the
police
station
officers
seized
two
phones
from
his
person
and
one
of
them
a
flip
phone
continued
to
receive
calls
from
a
number
the
phone
identified
as
my
house
n
officers
opened
the
phone
and
accessed
the
call
log
thereby
obtaining
the
phone
number
associated
with
these
calls
n
the
court
resoundingly
rejected
both
searches
modern
cell
phones
are
not
just
another
technological
convenience
with
all
they
contain
and
all
they
may
reveal
they
hold
for
many
americans
the
privacies
of
life
quoting
boyd
v
united
states
u
s
the
fact
that
technology
now
allows
an
individual
to
carry
such
information
in
his
hand
does
not
make
the
information
any
less
worthy
of
the
protection
for
which
the
founders
fought
our
answer
to
the
question
of
what
police
must
do
before
searching
a
cell
phone
seized
incident
to
an
arrest
is
accordingly
simple
get
a
warrant
n
established
doctrine
would
allow
similar
searches
of
non
digital
containers
immediately
associated
with
an
arrestee
s
person
including
any
found
in
the
same
pocket
as
riley
s
phone
n
so
why
did
all
nine
justices
reject
these
mobile
phone
searches
lacking
both
precedent
and
any
precise
guidance
from
the
founding
era
n
the
court
had
to
make
its
own
assessment
of
what
constitutes
an
unreasonable
search
n
and
that
is
done
by
assessing
on
the
one
hand
the
degree
to
which
it
intrudes
upon
an
individual
s
privacy
and
on
the
other
the
degree
to
which
it
is
needed
for
the
promotion
of
legitimate
governmental
interests
n
the
governmental
interests
motivating
searches
incident
to
arrest
officer
safety
and
evidence
preservation
n
are
not
particularly
relevant
to
this
article
but
very
briefly
what
swayed
the
court
was
that
the
interests
are
generally
less
significant
in
the
digital
context
n
as
for
officer
safety
there
is
no
possibility
the
digital
data
will
harm
the
arresting
officers
unlike
say
a
surreptitious
knife
or
razor
blade
n
as
for
the
remote
possibility
the
data
would
inform
officers
of
indirect
harm
for
example
that
dangerous
confederates
were
en
route
the
court
properly
held
this
to
be
a
case
specific
exigent
circumstance
sufficiently
accounted
for
by
that
doctrine
n
in
other
words
it
will
be
the
exception
not
the
rule
similarly
there
is
little
risk
of
evidence
destruction
once
the
officers
seize
the
mobile
phone
as
even
the
typically
negligible
possibility
of
the
device
being
remotely
wiped
can
be
countered
with
a
faraday
bag
the
cheap
version
of
which
is
wrapping
the
phone
in
aluminum
foil
n
more
importantly
for
the
purposes
of
this
article
the
privacy
interest
in
digital
data
is
very
significant
both
in
terms
of
quality
and
quantity
n
while
the
government
urged
that
a
search
of
all
data
stored
on
a
cell
phone
is
materially
indistinguishable
from
searches
of
wallets
and
purses
to
the
court
that
is
like
saying
a
ride
on
horseback
is
materially
indistinguishable
from
a
flight
to
the
moon
n
as
for
quality
a
cell
phone
collects
in
one
place
many
distinct
types
of
information
an
address
a
note
a
prescription
a
bank
statement
a
video
that
reveal
much
more
in
combination
than
any
isolated
record
n
as
for
quantity
a
phone
s
capacity
allows
even
just
one
type
of
information
to
convey
far
more
than
previously
possible
n
such
is
the
marvel
of
digital
data
and
its
modern
storage
n
indeed
it
is
no
exaggeration
to
say
that
many
of
the
more
than
of
american
adults
who

keep
on
their
person
a
digital
record
of
nearly
every
aspect
of
their
lives
from
the
mundane
to
the
intimate
n
it
did
not
come
at
government
behest
as
justice
jackson
feared
in
but
it
came
nonetheless
n
each
such
person
is
carrying
a
time
machine
and
the
court
has
now
recognized
how
especially
private
are
the
digital
data
contained
therein
as
the
court
recognized
a
single
mobile
phone
will
often
contain
more
information
than
an
entire
home
n
time
machines
are
useful
like
that
in
the
words
of
the
court
in
the
cell
phone
context
it
is
reasonable
to
expect
that
incriminating
information
will
be
found
on
a
phone
regardless
of
when
the
crime
occurred
n
so
while
riley
perhaps
left
things
unanswered
that
it
could
have
addressed
n
it
made
very
clear
that
when
it
comes
to
the
fourth
amendment
digital
is
different
and
while
compelled
government
access
therefore
required
a
warrant
this
does
not
necessarily
mean
the
court
is
generally
averse
to
the
existence
of
digital
time
machines
the
court
s
most
recent
fourth
amendment
decision
which
considered
records
that
could
be
either
analog
or
digital
contains
a
facially
surprising
claim
that
is
a
nod
to
time
machines
utility
c
patel
and
searches
of
hotel
registries
city
of
los
angeles
v
patel
is
a
case
about
mini
government
mandated
time
machines
in
the
form
of
hotel
guest
registries
n
a
provision
of
the
los
angeles
municipal
code
requires
that
hotels
record
and
maintain
information
about
their
guests
including
name
and
address
vehicle
license
plate
of
any
car
parked
on
the
premises
and
method
of
payment
n
under
certain
circumstances
additional
identification
information
must
be
recorded
such
as
when
a
guest
pays
by
cash
rents
a
room
without
a
reservation
or
stays
for
fewer
than
twelve
hours
n
registry
information
must
be
maintained
for
a
period
of
ninety
days
and
must
be
made
available
upon
officer
request
n
as
the
recent
publicity
regarding
the
hack
of
cheating
or
adultery
website
ashley
madison
demonstrates
n
it
is
not
hard
to
imagine
some
of
the
privacy
interests
implicated
by
knowledge
of
hotel
stays
n
at
the
same
time
such
a
recordkeeping
requirement
is
hardly
novel
and
the
hotels
did
not
challenge
it
n
a
group
of
hotel
operators
did
however
challenge
the
provision
requiring
that
the
registry
shall
be
made
available
to
any
officer
of
the
los
angeles
police
department
for
inspection
n
they
contended
such
unrestrained
access
violated
their
fourth
amendment
rights
and
a
closely
divided
supreme
court
agreed
n
according
to
the
five
justice
majority
the
officer
demand
requirement
is
unconstitutional
because
it
offers
no
opportunity
for
pre
compliance
legal
challenge
n
essentially
combining
the
ease
of
an
administrative
subpoena
with
the
effectiveness
of
a
warrant
patel
is
an
important
opinion
because
it
permits
meaningful
facial
challenges
under
the
fourth
amendment
n
and
because
it
limits
what
has
been
a
nebulous
closely
regulated
industry
exception
n
but
what
is
of
interest
for
this
article
is
the
court
s
dictum
regarding
deterrence
the
court
assumed
without
deciding
that
the
government
purpose
for
the
registry
program
was
a
special
need
outside
of
ordinary
crime
control
thus
lessening
the
fourth
amendment
burden
n
since
the
ordinance
was
clearly
aimed
at
solving
crime
it
is
hard
to
imagine
what
this
special
need
would
be
although
the
boundaries
have
always
been
unclear
in
the
automobile
context
for
example
the
court
has
differentiated
roadblocks
aimed
at
preventing
highway
fatalities
and
carnage
a
special
need
from
those
aimed
at
interdicting
drugs
ordinary
crime
control
n
officers
accessing
the
historic
registry
were
unlikely
to
prevent
imminent
threatened
harm
akin
to
that
posed
by
drunk
drivers
as
opposed
to
finding
the
clues
necessary
to
prosecute
past
offenses
this
seems
true
by
definition
for
a
registry
dating
back
three
months
yet
the
court
assumed
a
special
need
namely
deterring
criminality
n
it
seems
hard
to
imagine
deterrence
of
criminality
can
be
a
meaningful
special
need
deterrence
is
not
the
reason
for
legitimate
police
investigation
that
constitutes
a
search
or
a
seizure
but
instead
is
the
happy
albeit
very
important
byproduct
of
investigating
actual
crime
in
other
words
surely
police
cannot
routinely
make
warrantless
entry
into
homes
and
claim
the
special
need
of
deterring
crimes
that
might
otherwise
be
committed
therein
instead
when
law
enforcement
officers
enter
homes
pursuant
to
lawful
warrants
or
exceptions
thereto
and
people
learn
of
those
events
including
subsequent
prosecutions
they
are
deterred
from
themselves
engaging
in
such
criminality
so
why
the
odd
assertion
of
deterrence
as
a
special
need
presumably
because
of
the
intuition
that
the
registry
requirement
like
other
and
more
significant
time
machines
is
an
effective
and
perhaps
smart
way
to
go
after
criminal
behavior
but
even
if
that
might
be
so
the
court
was
right
to
find
problematic
the
complete
absence
of
access
restrictions
given
the
privacy
interests
at
stake
indeed
it
is
worth
stepping
back
to
broadly
consider
these
interests
of
information
privacy
before
contemplating
what
they
implicate
for
investigatory
time
machines
ii
privacy
as
integral
as
privacy
is
to
most
of
our
lives
or
at
least
as
integral
as
i
believe
it
is
to
mine
there
is
considerable
controversy
and
confusion
as
to
its
definition
including
as
to
whether
it
is
a
state
of
being
or
a
right
n
in
other
words
is
perfect
privacy
achieved
only
when
nobody
has
any
information
about
and
access
to
my
person
which
sounds
rather
awful
or
also
when
i
have
complete
control
over
those
modes
of
access
but
have
volitionally
granted
them
in
certain
amounts
which
sounds
rather
utopian
n
learned
philosophical
minds
have
debated
these
concepts
for
years
and
presumably
will
for
as
long
as
there
are
philosophers
to
debate
my
less
philosophically
tutored
mind
finds
useful
and
for
criminal
procedure
purposes
seemingly
sufficient
the
construct
that
information
privacy
is
the
ability
of
a
person
to
control
what
information
about
her
is
given
to
others
and
for
what
purposes
n
such
a
control
construct
was
most
notably
articulated
by
alan
westin
n
and
charles
fried
n
and
has
been
recognized
by
the
supreme
court
n
so
understood
privacy
can
be
seen
as
a
constitutive
element
of
human
autonomy
or
as
a
key
element
in
the
identity
formation
and
mental
freedom
that
is
central
to
a
fully
realized
autonomy
n
in
the
words
of
thomas
nagel
the
boundary
between
what
we
reveal
and
what
we
do
not
and
some
control
over
that
boundary
are
among
the
most
important
attributes
of
our
humanity
n
without
privacy
people
will
engage
in
harmful
self
censorship
not
only
in
what
they
will
say
and
in
what
they
will
do
but
even
in
what
they
will
think
as
they
internalize
an
awareness
that
they
are
always
watched
n
and
the
ability
to
think
freely
and
critically
is
essential
to
full
development
of
one
s
moral
character
n
this
is
not
to
deny
of
course
that
social
pressures
can
be
beneficial
ones
n
but
instead
only
to
recognize
that
they
can
also
be
debilitating
in
the
extreme
n
furthermore
without
privacy
people
are
at
best
stunted
in
their
ability
to
form
meaningful
and
diverse
relationships
as
those
relationships
depend
upon
a
volitional
gradual
and
granular
mutual
sharing
of
information
n
as
nagel
explains
selective
intimacy
permits
some
interpersonal
relations
to
be
open
to
forms
of
exposure
that
are
needed
for
the
development
of
a
complete
life
no
one
but
a
maniac
will
express
absolutely
everything
to
anyone
but
most
of
us
need
someone
to
whom
we
can
express
a
good
deal
that
we
would
not
reveal
to
others
n
as
ferdinand
shoeman
explains
information
appropriate
in
the
context
of
one
relationship
may
not
be
appropriate
in
another
n
indeed
devoid
of
intended
and
appropriate
context
information
can
present
a
vastly
incomplete
if
not
completely
inaccurate
assessment
n
a
spouse
for
example
should
have
sufficient
knowledge
of
a
partner
that
she
can
place
any
new
information
in
nearly
its
correct
context
but
a
stranger
acquaintance
or
even
fairly
good
friend
might
totally
misperceive
its
relevance
as
andrew
taslitz
has
noted
not
only
does
other
assessment
have
practical
manifestations
e
g
loss
of
a
job
opportunity
but
psychologically
we
hold
other
assessment
dear
n
without
privacy
people
thus
have
less
fully
developed
characters
and
relationships
which
in
turn
are
the
constituent
elements
of
a
robust
marketplace
of
ideas
associations
and
religions
n
in
other
words
privacy
may
be
critical
to
the
individual
in
a
manner
necessary
to
identity
formation
and
to
robust
small
scale
personal
relationships
but
it
is
ultimately
of
collective
societal
importance
especially
to
a
democracy
n
thus
it
is
not
surprising
that
alan
westin
found
a
correlation
between
political
philosophy
and
privacy
throughout
western
civilization
n
and
there
are
other
ramifications
without
privacy
there
is
increased
identity
theft
stalking
and
other
information
based
or
assisted
crimes
n
and
given
asymmetries
of
power
distortions
in
information
privacy
tend
to
run
solely
in
one
direction
or
at
least
are
not
distributed
equally
benefiting
some
at
the
costs
of
others
n
of
course
to
assert
that
information
privacy
is
about
control
is
not
to
say
that
one
must
exercise
absolute
control
most
rights
and
perhaps
all
rights
are
not
absolute
and
in
this
case
absolute
control
is
unthinkable
first
nobody
would
benefit
from
exercising
control
to
achieve
absolute
seclusion
n
and
society
could
not
permit
absolute
control
not
only
because
it
would
have
too
great
a
cost
to
the
social
order
but
also
because
once
any
information
about
me
is
known
to
another
person
my
right
of
privacy
control
runs
up
against
their
right
of
free
expression
n
fortunately
people
innately
understand
this
and
rarely
if
ever
expect
absolute
control
but
they
do
wish
to
exercise
some
control
even
as
they
are
becoming
increasingly
disillusioned
regarding
their
ability
to
do
so
n
as
sociologist
christena
nippert
eng
explains
based
upon
her
recent
studies
it
became
clear
that
what
i
now
think
of
as
the
process
of
selective
concealment
and
disclosure
plays
an
important
role
in
how
we
try
to
achieve
privacy
this
is
the
daily
activity
of
trying
to
deny
or
grant
varying
amounts
of
access
to
our
private
matters
to
specific
people
in
specific
ways
n
nippert
eng
unsurprisingly
found
disparate
people
each
trying
to
achieve
their
preferred
balance
n
thus
while
any
replacement
is
far
less
crisp
and
easy
i
have
long
been
a
critic
of
the
fourth
amendment
s
third
party
doctrine
which
tries
to
artificially
categorize
all
information
as
either
totally
secret
purely
private
or
freely
available
to
law
enforcement
effectively
purely
accessible
n
attempting
to
force
people
to
maintain
absolute
secrecy
in
order
to
have
any
degree
of
constitutional
protection
is
unrealistic
and
counter
productive
n
but
what
does
a
control
theory
of
information
privacy
have
to
say
about
investigatory
time
machines
obviously
at
least
as
to
government
created
ones
there
is
a
serious
tension
and
it
is
a
tension
that
goes
to
the
heart
of
privacy
s
motivations
can
we
fully
develop
as
human
beings
with
the
necessarily
divergent
ideas
and
willingness
to
express
them
that
a
thriving
democracy
requires
if
the
government
is
always
watching
no
of
course
in
even
the
most
totalitarian
regimes
there
have
proved
to
be
some
persons
who
exercise
unpopular
autonomy
but
then
truly
pervasive
technology
like
we
have
today
has
never
before
been
available
and
more
importantly
as
ruth
gavison
explains
even
if
we
grant
that
privacy
may
not
be
a
necessary
condition
for
autonomy
for
all
it
is
enough
to
justify
it
as
a
value
that
most
people
may
require
it
we
are
not
all
giants
and
societies
should
enable
all
not
only
the
exceptional
to
seek
moral
autonomy
n
an
ideal
democracy
requires
thoughtful
participation
from
far
more
than
just
a
few
thus
there
is
good
reason
to
be
extremely
skeptical
of
any
government
mandated
time
machines
and
outside
of
the
particular
instances
in
which
they
have
historically
been
used
e
g
banking
pharmaceuticals
and
hotels
we
might
do
best
to
forbid
them
whether
constitutionally
or
otherwise
indeed
it
might
be
wise
to
reconsider
even
those
we
have
historically
permitted
the
supreme
court
in
patel
struck
down
a
year
old
reporting
ordinance
n
but
at
the
very
least
a
drone
hovering
high
overhead
that
records
all
public
movements
seems
problematic
as
do
mammoth
databases
of
digital
information
that
can
later
be
searched
on
the
other
hand
broad
based
surveillance
does
have
benefits
more
inclusive
surveillance
benefits
from
a
genuine
check
in
the
political
process
and
can
more
evenly
distribute
the
costs
and
provide
superior
accountability
n
so
is
it
possible
to
have
our
cake
and
eat
it
too
if
there
are
sufficiently
robust
access
use
and
disclosure
limitations
can
they
ever
ameliorate
the
very
serious
privacy
concerns
i
first
address
whether
such
use
restrictions
could
be
found
within
the
fourth
amendment
and
then
turn
to
the
wisdom
of
their
adoption
in
the
very
limited
context
of
police
body
cameras
iii
fourth
amendment
use
restrictions
and
police
body
cameras
in
a
prescient
article
from
harold
krent
argued
that
whatever
definitions
of
search
and
seizure
are
required
to
make
it
happen
the
uses
to
which
law
enforcement
can
put
lawfully
acquired
information
should
be
governed
by
the
fourth
amendment
s
reasonableness
requirement
n
according
to
krent
rapidly
developing
technology
has
thrust
the
use
issue
to
the
forefront
what
the
government
does
with
information
may
now
threaten
privacy
more
than
the
collection
itself
n
the
ganias
second
circuit
panel
adopted
such
a
use
restriction
even
if
it
was
permissible
for
investigators
to
retain
the
nonresponsive
computer
data
for
such
a
long
period
it
was
not
permissible
to
search
through
that
data
to
use
that
data
in
a
new
investigation
even
pursuant
to
a
newly
obtained
search
warrant
n
although
it
is
not
clear
that
krent
would
agree
with
this
particular
use
limitation
n
he
recognized
that
generally
such
limits
are
conducive
to
the
control
theory
of
information
privacy
each
different
use
of
the
data
interferes
with
a
person
s
ability
to
control
for
what
purposes
information
about
her
is
utilized
n
neither
the
ganias
panel
nor
krent
argued
that
use
restrictions
should
be
the
sole
fourth
amendment
restrictions
the
original
law
enforcement
acquisition
remains
subject
to
traditional
restraints
for
example
merely
agreeing
to
limit
use
would
of
course
not
itself
justify
compulsory
copying
of
ganias
hard
drives
but
there
might
be
circumstances
when
it
is
impossible
to
get
the
desired
law
enforcement
safety
benefit
without
completely
abandoning
front
end
acquisition
restraints
as
with
broad
scale
panvasive
drone
surveillance
or
with
broad
scale
panvasive
internet
surveillance
for
malware
n
in
each
instance
assuming
complete
automation
the
key
privacy
harm
seems
to
occur
only
upon
human
viewing
or
use
of
course
this
does
not
mean
the
sole
privacy
harm
occurs
upon
use
if
human
programmed
algorithms
are
making
decisions
based
upon
content
that
seems
a
relevant
use
regardless
of
the
lack
of
direct
human
observation
n
and
as
described
above
knowing
that
all
of
our
movements
online
or
off
will
be
recorded
for
potential
later
perusal
can
very
meaningfully
chill
those
actions
jeremy
bentham
long
ago
realized
that
constant
observation
was
not
necessary
in
his
panopticon
merely
its
potential
was
sufficient
to
achieve
the
same
results
n
thus
european
courts
have
recently
rejected
requirements
that
internet
service
providers
retain
information
for
defined
periods
of
time
n
so
we
should
be
extremely
cautious
in
accepting
ex
post
use
and
dissemination
controls
as
a
substitute
for
as
opposed
to
a
supplement
to
front
end
acquisition
controls
but
as
part
of
this
calculus
we
should
recognize
the
benefits
of
broad
access
including
its
more
uniform
distribution
and
thus
greater
political
accountability
as
i
argued
some
ten
years
ago
whether
the
issue
is
dna
databanking
or
a
thermal
scan
of
homes
or
a
millimeter
wave
scan
of
persons
as
now
takes
place
at
airports
advanced
notice
and
broad
and
uniform
applicability
trigger
the
protections
of
the
political
process
in
a
way
that
most
contemporary
policing
does
not
and
this
should
factor
into
fourth
amendment
reasonableness
n
in
this
i
was
building
upon
the
arguments
of
william
stuntz
n
and
the
supreme
court
s
school
drug
testing
cases
n
christopher
slobogin
has
recently
developed
the
concept
into
a
more
rich
theory
of
representative
democracy
relying
upon
the
constitutional
scholarship
of
john
hart
ely
that
would
provide
judicial
review
even
where
the
government
activity
does
not
constitute
a
fourth
amendment
search
or
seizure
n
but
again
whatever
the
benefits
of
even
a
well
functioning
political
process
there
are
strong
reasons
to
be
cautious
as
justice
sandra
day
o
connor
argued
in
personally
rejecting
the
court
s
permissive
regime
of
drug
testing
for
student
athletes
we
have
a
strong
tradition
against
general
warrants
and
blanket
searches
because
they
can
involve
thousands
or
millions
of
searches
pose
a
greater
threat
to
liberty
than
do
suspicion
based
ones
which
affect
one
person
at
a
time
n
nonetheless
it
would
be
just
as
wrong
to
ignore
the
fairness
benefit
of
broad
applicability
as
it
would
to
think
a
misery
loves
company
conception
would
be
ideal
across
the
board
the
latter
of
which
would
adopt
wholesale
the
hated
general
warrants
of
our
founding
period
n
it
seems
there
might
be
limited
relatively
narrow
circumstances
in
which
we
should
embrace
solely
use
restrictions
and
i
submit
that
one
of
them
might
be
for
law
enforcement
body
cameras
of
course
perhaps
this
is
an
unfairly
easy
case
because
in
order
for
the
camera
to
capture
anything
the
law
enforcement
officer
should
already
be
lawfully
present
a
criterion
that
brings
its
own
sometimes
significant
front
end
restrictions
but
such
recording
nonetheless
creates
time
machines
and
lots
of
them
there
are
almost
a
million
law
enforcement
officers
in
the
united
states
n
with
officers
on
duty
at
all
times
watching
over
mostly
innocent
behavior
as
well
as
some
criminal
if
every
one
records
his
or
her
entire
shift
that
is
a
staggering
amount
of
data
those
recordings
will
psychologically
affect
the
officers
and
not
only
in
the
sense
of
promoting
good
behavior
as
discussed
above
nobody
does
well
to
be
under
constant
surveillance
though
interestingly
to
many
thousands
of
americans
working
in
retail
and
other
industries
it
is
probably
already
their
daily
reality
albeit
without
accompanying
audio
and
these
workers
might
have
little
to
no
promises
regarding
ex
post
use
and
dissemination
nor
is
it
the
case
that
these
recordings
will
merely
duplicate
what
officers
could
themselves
personally
explain
instead
high
quality
cameras
would
record
all
sorts
of
events
and
details
never
noticed
by
the
officers
and
potentially
permanently
store
them
for
later
high
tech
perusal
e
g
zoom
in
and
slow
down
n
moreover
for
things
an
officer
does
notice
which
will
include
highly
traumatic
events
the
digital
record
will
remain
forever
pristine
whereas
memories
quickly
degrade
and
even
fade
entirely
n
such
cameras
would
record
not
only
events
taking
place
in
public
but
instead
would
record
everywhere
officers
go
including
the
interiors
of
our
homes
and
therefore
potentially
under
every
bed
and
into
every
drawer
so
even
if
officer
presence
already
has
an
access
and
thus
acquisition
limitation
it
would
not
necessarily
follow
that
nothing
more
should
be
required
for
the
further
intrusion
of
recording
n
however
these
panvasive
qualities
of
officer
recording
also
make
for
some
of
its
benefits
as
long
as
there
have
been
police
we
have
had
to
rely
not
only
upon
their
perceptions
of
what
they
observe
but
upon
their
memories
of
those
perceptions
both
perception
and
memory
are
fallible
and
recollection
thereof
subject
to
falsification
of
course
we
have
done
what
we
can
because
memory
dissipates
quickly
it
is
helpful
when
police
contemporaneously
record
their
perceptions
and
hence
we
value
the
ubiquitous
police
report
which
also
freezes
the
account
making
later
fabrication
more
difficult
with
the
advent
of
readily
mobile
photography
police
could
better
preserve
those
observations
deemed
sufficiently
important
and
photography
of
crime
scenes
thus
became
routine
n
with
the
advent
of
tape
recording
certain
police
citizen
interactions
were
recorded
n
and
with
the
advent
of
videotaping
we
became
accustomed
to
its
benefits
in
certain
contexts
such
as
video
recordings
of
traffic
stops
via
cameras
fixed
in
police
vehicles
but
when
that
videotaping
made
it
to
the
interior
of
the
home
it
caused
concern
a
concern
that
reached
the
supreme
court
in
in
the
case
of
wilson
v
layne
n
as
part
of
operation
gunsmoke
united
states
marshals
were
working
with
local
maryland
police
to
apprehend
dangerous
criminals
including
one
dominic
wilson
n
unfortunately
the
address
in
police
files
was
that
of
wilson
s
parents
so
when
police
entered
the
home
to
execute
an
arrest
warrant
accompanied
by
invited
representatives
of
the
media
what
they
found
was
dominic
s
father
roused
from
bed
and
dressed
only
in
briefs
and
dominic
s
mother
in
a
nightgown
n
before
police
were
made
aware
of
or
at
least
were
convinced
of
their
mistake
they
forcibly
subdued
the
elder
mr
wilson
at
gunpoint
while
a
photographer
from
the
washington
post
took
photographs
n
the
court
unanimously
held
that
the
officers
violated
the
fourth
amendment
by
bringing
representatives
of
the
media
into
a
home
entered
pursuant
to
a
warrant
n
however
the
court
acknowledged
government
interests
that
could
be
furthered
by
law
enforcement
s
own
recording
accurately
publicizing
efforts
to
combat
crime
furthering
education
and
deterrence
deterring
and
detecting
police
abuse
protecting
the
safety
of
officers
and
preserving
evidence
n
thus
it
might
be
reasonable
for
police
officers
to
themselves
videotape
home
entries
n
the
benefits
the
court
proffered
are
real
and
can
be
significant
as
for
evidence
preservation
recording
can
preserve
evidence
without
requiring
its
physical
removal
n
preserve
evidence
that
would
otherwise
be
destroyed
by
investigatory
or
non
investigatory
government
actions
or
simply
by
the
passage
of
time
n
and
preserve
evidence
in
its
most
pristine
form
allowing
a
judge
or
juror
to
view
it
herself
n
one
could
imagine
recordings
being
used
to
routinely
decide
such
contested
issues
as
whether
a
person
consented
to
an
entry
or
search
and
if
so
the
scope
of
that
consent
whether
a
reasonable
officer
would
have
believed
a
person
to
be
in
need
of
immediate
assistance
whether
there
was
a
fair
probability
that
evidence
would
be
imminently
destroyed
whether
police
exceeded
the
authorization
of
a
warrant
or
whether
an
officer
reasonably
believed
deadly
force
was
justified
n
to
be
sure
no
single
video
is
perfect
as
the
camera
perspective
can
itself
suggest
a
cognitive
frame
and
thereby
affect
these
myriad
determinations
n
but
it
is
far
better
than
without
in
the
straightforward
words
of
the
alaska
supreme
court
in
the
context
of
recording
custodial
interrogations
a
recording
will
help
trial
and
appellate
courts
to
ascertain
the
truth
n
thus
preservation
has
secondary
benefits
including
in
deterring
and
detecting
police
abuse
there
are
ample
recorded
examples
from
detectives
playing
wii
bowling
during
a
home
search
n
to
accident
investigators
doing
a
little
walt
disney
to
protect
a
cop
who
rear
ended
another
vehicle
n
the
most
prominent
recent
examples
might
be
the
shootings
of
walter
scott
and
samuel
dubose
each
of
which
resulted
in
murder
charges
against
the
police
officer
n
it
seems
self
evident
that
video
would
deter
and
where
that
fails
detect
abuse
an
inference
supported
by
police
recording
in
rialto
california
in
the
first
year
of
body
camera
recording
complaints
against
officers
fell
by
and
use
of
force
by
officers
fell
by
almost
n
thus
in
judge
shira
a
scheindlin
s
order
holding
unconstitutional
the
new
york
police
department
s
stop
and
frisk
tactics
she
required
a
trial
program
of
officer
body
cameras
n
to
be
most
effective
that
video
must
record
all
police
citizen
interaction
lest
officers
only
turn
it
on
when
it
serves
their
purposes
n
and
be
tamper
resistant
n
and
when
it
comes
to
deterring
and
detecting
abuse
turnabout
is
fair
play
recording
can
shield
police
against
false
allegations
of
abuse
as
well
as
deter
or
at
least
detect
poor
citizen
decisions
perhaps
including
some
that
caused
those
previously
unrecorded
use
of
force
incidents
so
given
the
myriad
benefits
of
tamper
resistant
always
on
officer
recording
where
always
on
includes
cameras
with
a
significant
typically
overwritten
buffer
meant
to
become
permanent
when
triggered
by
an
officer
citizen
interaction
it
seems
such
recording
is
worth
the
privacy
cost
but
this
merely
means
police
should
record
it
remains
to
be
determined
or
should
remain
to
be
determined
what
can
be
done
with
those
recordings
which
of
course
preserve
immense
amounts
of
otherwise
ephemeral
irrelevant
information
like
the
takedown
of
an
innocent
man
in
his
bedclothes
in
wilson
v
layne
the
mere
preservation
of
that
information
is
a
meaningful
harm
if
nothing
else
because
the
relevant
parties
know
there
is
always
a
risk
of
its
further
consumption
and
dissemination
n
and
thus
recording
can
also
harm
law
enforcement
interests
if
it
deters
citizen
cooperation
and
assistance
where
persons
fear
criminal
reprisal
thus
as
an
administrative
matter
in
police
department
guidelines
as
a
legislative
matter
and
i
would
argue
as
a
matter
of
fourth
amendment
and
state
constitutional
analog
reasonableness
there
should
be
use
and
disclosure
limitations
on
that
data
these
would
include
security
from
unauthorized
access
need
to
know
limitations
audit
logs
and
destruction
schedules
n
for
example
viewing
the
footage
of
a
home
search
should
at
least
sometimes
itself
constitute
a
fourth
amendment
search
just
like
perusing
a
seized
computer
reentering
the
home
after
completion
of
the
search
would
of
course
require
a
new
warrant
n
and
just
as
a
search
of
a
seized
hard
drive
yields
previously
unknown
information
viewing
of
video
will
yield
information
not
noticed
by
officers
and
given
video
enhancement
capabilities
information
not
previously
noticeable
moreover
the
resource
and
legal
restraints
are
far
different
when
any
number
of
officers
can
view
video
in
their
offices
than
when
those
officers
are
on
the
scene
executing
a
search
warrant
governed
by
the
constraints
of
the
fourth
amendment
potentially
including
a
judicial
warrant
thus
just
as
courts
have
begun
to
recognize
that
digital
is
different
in
other
contexts
courts
should
here
recognize
a
meaningful
difference
in
kind
despite
law
enforcement
officers
traditionally
being
permitted
to
re
examine
physical
items
in
their
possession
the
over
seizure
inherent
in
the
recording
merits
a
different
result
so
understood
in
the
limited
context
of
police
body
cameras
the
benefits
of
complete
recording
seem
to
outweigh
the
costs
and
therefore
this
is
a
government
time
machine
that
i
would
permit
subject
only
to
meaningful
access
use
and
dissemination
controls
this
of
course
leaves
for
future
work
the
development
of
a
taxonomy
as
to
when
acquisition
restrictions
are
more
or
less
important
and
what
should
be
the
constitutional
and
statutory
rules
and
administrative
best
practices
but
it
provides
a
critical
perspective
as
we
approach
these
decisions
seeing
them
for
what
they
are
fourth
amendment
time
machines
conclusion
we
are
in
the
midst
of
dramatic
techno
social
change
in
the
words
of
christena
nippert
eng
it
s
as
if
a
distinct
cultural
climate
change
is
underway
the
ocean
has
risen
shrinking
our
islands
of
privacy
and
even
submerging
many
of
them
altogether
like
atlantis
perhaps
some
private
spaces
and
times
and
matters
are
fading
into
the
realm
of
folklore
even
legend
their
very
existence
destined
to
rest
one
day
on
the
unsubstantiated
claims
of
prior
generations
n
the
ability
of
technology
for
the
first
time
to
feasibly
record
and
store
most
all
behavior
both
online
and
off
is
certainly
a
tectonic
shift
it
seriously
threatens
privacy
and
thus
all
of
privacy
s
myriad
individual
and
societal
benefits
of
course
any
such
shift
can
be
exaggerated
and
in
some
sense
little
is
ever
new
in
with
the
advent
of
the
portable
camera
a
newspaper
bemoaned
that
this
season
there
is
something
at
the
seaside
worse
than
sharks
it
is
the
amateur
photographer
n
yet
we
somehow
made
it
through
sufficient
privacy
intact
laws
have
long
required
that
certain
records
be
retained
and
businesses
have
long
retained
far
more
than
what
the
laws
require
nonetheless
differences
in
scope
at
some
point
become
differences
in
kind
and
i
believe
there
is
utility
in
recognizing
today
s
digital
records
for
what
they
are
investigative
time
machines
and
openly
confronting
whether
their
benefits
justify
their
costs
where
they
do
we
should
utilize
access
use
and
dissemination
restrictions
for
our
privacy
and
in
those
instances
in
which
only
a
panvasive
time
machine
will
do
and
in
which
its
benefits
still
outweigh
its
costs
we
can
rely
solely
upon
those
ex
post
restrictions
n
but
these
time
machines
are
fraught
with
great
danger
to
our
humanity
and
to
our
democracy
and
thus
should
be
approached
with
a
healthy
if
not
vigorous
distrust
thus
in
this
article
i
have
taken
only
a
baby
step
recommending
a
use
restriction
regime
for
police
officer
body
cameras
recognizing
that
officer
presence
builds
in
acquisition
restraints
legislatures
should
provide
frameworks
for
these
recordings
requiring
reasonable
guarantees
of
secure
storage
and
appropriately
restricting
and
disciplining
errant
access
use
and
dissemination
n
if
those
restrictions
ultimately
prove
unworkable
or
insufficient
in
this
limited
context
then
we
will
have
learned
that
they
certainly
cannot
alone
be
trusted

other
spheres

we
note
first
that
whether
congress
has
considered

authorized
a
program
such
as
this
one
is
not
irrelevant
to
its
constitutionality
the
endorsement

provides
some
degree
of
comfort
in
the

of
concerns
about
the
reasonableness
of
the

s
assertions
of
the
necessity
of

collection
the
legislative
process
has
considerable
advantages
a
congressional
judgment
as
to
what
is
reasonable
under
current
circumstances
would
carry
weight
at
least
with
us
and
we
assume
with
the
supreme
court
as
well
in

whether
the
availability
of

the

and
the
ability
of
the

that

previously
have
overwhelmed
its
capacity
to
make

from
the

it
is
almost
possible
to
watch
the
steady
tide
of
technology
seeping
into
the
briefing
rooms
and
patrol
cars
of
american
law
enforcement
agencies
the
devices
and
technologies
that
may
have
once
started
as
benign
civilian
conveniences
have
transformed
into
powerful
tools
that
enable
agencies
to
pinpoint
their
resources
prevent
crime
and
cast
a
wider
net
for
wrongdoers
the
exponential
escalation
of
mobile
computing
and
analytics
has
given
officers
intelligence
on

go
and
greatly
improved
their
chances
of
being
in
the
right
place
at
the
right
time
while
these
tools
come
with
profound
benefits
to
the
men
and
women
behind
the
badges
and
the
communities
they
serve
there
are
ramifications
that
ripple
far
into
the
public
space
as
well
as
considerations
that
must
be
made
to
prevent
misuse
and
infringement
on
civil
rights
but
we
still
seem
far
from
the
broad
stroke
reports
of
many
in
the
mainstream
media
who
might
tell
you
that
cops
everywhere
can
peer
into
your
life
with
the
click
of
a
mouse
or
a
well
placed
drone
at
least
at
the
local
level
despite
some
of
these
overblown
stories
of
advanced
surveillance
capabilities
many
in
local
law
enforcement
would
tell
you
that
funding
for
boots
on
the
ground
will
almost
always
win
out
over
bids
for
the
latest
nsa
style
tech
even
if
smaller
agencies
want
it
they
probably
can
t
afford
it
this
is
not
to

there
aren
t
those
with
a
spy
style
kit
they
can
t
or
won
t
talk
about
these
methods
tend
to
encourage
public
distrust
and
suspicion
but
we

cover
that
a

later
on
despite
the
gloomy
and
often
mischaracterized
capabilities
of
police
powers
in
the
u

and
the
tools
they
use
daily
a
wider
look

the

how
important

s
p

on
a
tuesday
in
june
in
santa
cruz
calif
and
the
squad
car
radio
echoes
off
with
chatter
about
a
strong
arm
robbery
near
the
rail
bridge
that
connects
the
popular
boardwalk
with
a
nearby
beachfront
neighborhood
the
suspect
a
woman
with
a
backpack
has
taken
another
woman
s
belongings
by
force
and
was
last
seen
making
her
way
toward
the
network
of
vacation
homes
and
beachgoers
enjoying
the
sunny
afternoon
but
santa

police
officers
are
already
nearby
and
move
in
to
track
the
perpetrator
within
moments
of
the
first
report
there
s
nothing
random
about
their
presence
in
the
area
what
on
the
outside
might
look
like
blind
luck
or
coincidence
is
actually
part
of
a
predictive
system
the
department
has
been
perfecting
with
the
help
of
academic
partners
turned
businessmen
since
and
this
is
not
someone
sitting
in
a
room
with
a
crystal
ball
or
tarot
cards
trying
to
pinpoint
the
next
crime
this
is
the
intersection
of
advanced
probabilistic
algorithms
and
community
policing
it
s
appropriately
called
predpol
short
for
predictive
policing
crime
data
fed
into
the
predpol
system
provides
officers
with
different
zones
for
four
types
of
crime
auto
theft
vehicle
burglary
burglary
and
gang
related
activity
at
the
start
of
each
shift
each
zone
covers
an
area
of
square
feet
in
a
city
where
tourism
can
double
the
population
in
a
single
night
the
deputy
chief
said
maximizing
the
efficacy
of
his
department
was
a
no
brainer
the
technological
edge
provided
by
the
advanced
software
would
help
to
close
the
gap
between
what
was
at
the
time
increasing
crime
and
staffing
limitations
time
is
a
zero
sum
game
i
only
have
the
number
of
officers
times
the
number
of
hours
that
they
re
working
to
address
crime
issues
in
the
city
if
now
all
of
a
sudden
a
chunk
of
our
time
is
dealing
with
radio
calls
for
service
that
greatly
reduces
my
proactive
policing
time
the
only
way
to
increase
that
is
you
either
lower
the
demand
or
you
get
more
officers
to
dilute
or
diffuse
the
calls
for
service
so
you
have
more
proactive
time
said
deputy
chief
steve
clark
i
couldn
t
afford
more
officers
so
i
had
to
get
smarter
about
how
we
were
going
to
deal
with
our
limited
time
resources
despite
giving
officers
a
substantial
leg
up
when
it
comes
to
patrolling
the
city
clark
said
the
system
still
requires
them
to
interact
with
the
community
and
walk
the
beat
as
it
were
they
cannot
and
do
not
rely
solely
on
the
system
s
predictions
to
do
their
jobs
they
still
patrol
the
city
as
any
cop
would
but
they
re
looking
for
any
indication
that
the
predictions
were
correct
however
effective
the
system
might
be
in
predicting
crime
clark
said
the
job
of
policing
is
more
than
simply
following
the
data
you
can
t
become
too
reliant
on
these
things
the
officers
have
to
continue
to
sharpen
their
saws
as
far
as
their
instincts
their
training
their
experience
their
instincts
those
things
that
we
spend
a
lot
of
money
to
teach
them
and
train
them
those
years
of
experience
he
said
public
safety
is
a
discipline
or
a
field
if
you
will
that
you
can
never
lose

human
element
in
clark
demonstrates
different
aspects
of
santa
cruz
s
predictive
policing
system
photo
by
eyragon
eidam
from
clark
s
perspective
the
platform
does
more
than
just
point
cops
in
the
right
direction
it
also
removes
the
potential
for
race
and
income
based
biases
so
often
a
concern
in
policing
the
predictive
platform
doesn
t
see
race
financial
status
or
any
of
the
other
indicators
that
often
lead
to
the
perception
of
police
profiling
all
predpol
sees
are
the
reports
of
crimes
that
have
occurred
which
are
then
translated
into
where
they
are
likely
to
occur
next
there
s
nothing
in
there
about
demographics
clark
said
whether
it
be
the
population
type
or
monetary
demographics
these
are
actual
crime
reports
and
that
s
what
it
makes
its
predictions
from
halfway
across
the
country
in
eden
prairie
minn
a
town
of
about
people
predictive
policing
has
taken
on
a
slightly
different
form
officers
rely
on
a
dedicated
analyst
for
up
to
the
moment
intelligence
on
their
patrols
the
public
safety
system
may
not
rely
on
advanced
probabilities
and
mapping
but
rather
law
enforcement
analyst
ryan
kapaun
who
tracks
each
crime
and
translates
it
into
usable
intelligence
for
the
department
which
averages
calls
for
service
a
year
using
fairly
simple
tools
like
the
microsoft
office
suite
and
ibm
s
analyst
s
notebook
kapaun
funnels
officers
suspect
descriptions
potential
patterns
and
anything
else
that
may
help
stop
or
catch
a
criminal
to
just
map
every
burglary
for
me
doesn
t
tell
me
a
lot
because
it
doesn
t
tell
me
that
those
burglaries
are
linked
so
one
might
be
an
overnight
garage
burglary
and
one
might
be
a
front
door
kicked
in
burglary
during
the
day
while
people
are
at
work
he
said
what
i
m
most
interested
in
is
not
aggregating
and
mapping
all
of
the
burglaries
what
i
want
to
know
is
what
are
the
anomalies
what
doesn
t
fit
what
are
the
burglaries
as
an
example
that
aren
t
fitting
the
other
burglaries
the
concept
took
time
to
catch
on
with
his
badge
wielding
colleagues
according
to
the
analyst
but
now
kapaun
s
work
represents
one
more
tool
in
each
officer
s
belt
that
can

them

everyone
is

they
might
not
either
be
aware
of
it
or
understand
it
and
if
you
think
of
it
a

has
a

they
re

it
s

figuring
out
how

he
said
i
think
a

end
up

just
say
burglaries
are
up
percent
from
this

over
last

does
that
mean

kapaun
said

program
s
successes
have

looking

it
and
potentially

has
exploded

fingerprinting
and

law

the

program
has
given
new

tools
to

state

local
law

and
has
stoked
the
flames
of
critics
who
believe
the

is
little
more
than
a
way
to
catalog
people
the
guilty
the
innocent
and
those
somewhere
in
the
middle
but
the
program
seems
to
be
the
next
logical
step
in
a
national
process
where
fingerprints
and
photographs
don
t
always
tell
the
whole
story
of
a
person
s
criminal
past
the
larger
program
which
extends
its
database
services
to
participating
state
and
local
agencies
relies
on
a
growing
index
of
finger
and
palm
prints
as
well
as
facial
and
iris
scans
to
identify
persons
of
interest
in
san
diego
the
city
s
police
department
sdpd
employs
facial
recognition
equipment
to
identify
people
its
officers
come
in
contact
with
for
example
if
an
individual
does
not
produce
an
id
during
a
traffic
stop
facial
recognition
could
close
the
information
gap
for
the
officer
according
to
officer
steve
thorn
the
sdpd
facial
recognition
program
coordinator
around
facial
scanners
have
served
the
department
well
since
the
city
first
signed
on
with
the
automated
regional
justice
information
system
a
larger
regional
law
enforcement
collective
officers
use
the
devices
to
assist
in
the
identification
of
individuals
lawfully
detained
or
arrested
when
those
persons
are
unwilling
or
unable
to
provide
identity
a
typical
situation
would
be
when
officers
contact
an
individual
for
a
crime
the
crime
could
be
minimal
in
nature
such
as
littering
or
jay
walking
or
more
severe
such
as
battery
or
theft
he
said
if
the
individual
has
no
identification
on
them
or
would
not
provide
their
name
the
officers
could
use
the
device
to
verify
their
identity
and
issue
a
citation
in
the
field
versus
having
to
transport
the
individual
to
a
police
station
and
take
fingerprints
which
could
be
very
time
consuming
but
the
usefulness
of
the
tools
extends
far
beyond
identifying
criminals
thorn
said
officers
also
use
the
department
s
or
so
scanners
to
work
with
the
homeless
community
and
identify
potential
missing
persons
i
have
spoken
to
a
number
of
officers
who
use
the
device
regularly
they
all
say
the
device
works
very
well
saves
time
and
helps
prevent
misidentification
the
device
is
extremely
useful
for
officers
assigned
to
the
quality
of
life
team
and
homeless
outreach
team
both
teams
are
a
resource
to
the
homeless
population
but
also
take
enforcement
action
as
necessary
a
vast
majority
of
homeless
peoples
have
no
identification
in
their
possession
and
the
device
enables
the
officers
to
make
quick
identification
and
take
appropriate
action
for
critics
programs
like
these
represent
a
way
to
capture
and
store
permanent
vital
information
about
civilians
with
little
oversight
most
recently
the
next
generation
identification
program
took
fire
from
critics
when
the
fbi
petitioned
to
exempt
it
from
federal
privacy
regulations
which
critics
say
would
prevent
the
misuse
and
abuse
of
data
in
a
u
s
government
accountability
office
report
published
in
may
the
agency
pointed
to
gaps
in
the
fbi
s
processes
and
recommended
steps
the
top
domestic
law
enforcement
agency
could
take
to
improve
the
program
s
accuracy
and
transparency
video
anytime

police
video
is
not
a
new
concept
by
any
stretch
of
the
imagination
what
started
as
the
occasional
camera
capturing
a
liquor
store
or
bank
robbery
has
grown
into
cameras
being
installed
on
seemingly
every
street
corner
in
the
past
few
years
law
enforcement
agencies
across
the
country
have
started
equipping
officers
with
body
cameras
to
document
interactions
with
citizens
the
prevalence
of
video
and
its
societal
benefits
are
the
reason
that
researchers
at
purdue
university
are
working
on
the
cam
a
cloud
based
platform
that
links
publicly
available
cameras
through
a
single
easily
accessible
portal
despite
how
popular
reports
may
have
painted
the
research
to
this
point
the
team
scoffs
at
the
idea
that
it
s
a
way
for
police
to
peer
into
the
lives
of
unsuspecting
americans
yung
hsiang
lu
leads
the
team
behind
cam
from
his
perspective
as
a
technologist
the
system
has
applications
in
law
enforcement
environments
but
it
doesn
t
give
them
anything
sensitive
we
do
not
use
any
data
that
requests
passwords
and
furthermore
we
actually
take
reasonable
efforts
to
exclude
any
camera
we
think
may
look
at
a
private
space
he
said
most
of
the
cameras
we
have
in
our
system
come
from
departments
of
transportation
of
different
governments
different
states
different
cities
for
obvious
reasons
because
our
research
is
about
data
management
it
is
not
about
looking
at
whether
you
are
sitting
on
your
sofa
or
not

the

to
log

collected
from
around
the

which
can
be
watched
in

or

lu
said
the
analyzable
data
from
the
platform
could
ultimately
help
in
a
number
of
sectors
including
transportation
planning
the
problem
facing
the
system
is
the
fragmented
sources
of
the

feeds
lu
said
engineers
have
had
to
work
around
the
multitude
of
camera
systems
to
adapt
them
to
a
singularly
accessible
platform
the
larger
challenge
of
video
is
inextricably
linked
to
big
data
and
has
unsurprisingly
been
the
focus
of
researchers
around
the
world
while
the
platform
may
not
equate
to
the
next
big
surveillance
tool
there
are
undeniable
benefits
for
police

and
the
communities
they
serve

analytics
for

control
and
interoperability
environments
in
conjunction
with
the
department
of
homeland
security
s
centers
of
excellence
and
said
the
video
platform
has
sparked
the
interest
of
some
in
the
larger
law
enforcement
environment
who
see
more
potential
applications
one
of
the
things
that
i
see
as
a
great
potential
for
this
also
is
in
the
emergency
response
and
disaster
response
fields
he
said
basically
a
tornado
comes
through
or
hurricane
comes
through
you
re
trying
to
do
assessment
of
damage
and
where
your
resources
should
be
allocated
being
able
to
pull
up
that
information
through
this
sort
of
system
is
a
good
way
to
crowdsource
the
information
instead
of
having
to
wait
until
people
upload
photos
or
look
through
twitter
images
or
snapchat
information
and
things
like
that
but
the
tool
comes
with
the
need
for
the
inclusion
of
best
practices
ebert
added
while
it
may
not
be
peering
into
the
living
rooms
of
everyday
citizens
he
likens
it
to
how
local
agencies
address
the
collection
of
information
on
publicly
available
social
media
platforms
i
think
a
similar
set
of
guidelines
for
these
type
of
cameras
would
be
very
appropriate
depending
on
your
current
interpretation
of
the
laws
the
view
is
that
all
of
the
information
that
people
put
out
on
social
media
they
re
making
publicly
available
if
they
don
t
have
privacy
settings
turned
on
so
there
is
no
violation
of
privacy
that
s
the
perception
but
the
question
is
have
the
laws
caught
up
with
what
the
public
expects
the
evolution
of
data
analytics
and
collection
and
now
to
the
stuff
agencies
seem
a
bit
shy
about
the
stingray
made
recent
national
news
as
information
slowly
trickled
out
that
the
u
s
justice
department
had
provided
local
agencies
with
the
funds
to
purchase
so
called
cell
site
simulators
the
devices
are
designed
to
intercept
cellular
communications
access
the
data
within
them
and
track
locations
but
as
quickly
as
the
technology
made
its
way
to
the
headlines
legislation
began
to
consider
the
implications
of
what
many
considered
to
be
the
possibility
of
mass
surveillance
by
local
agencies
states
like
illinois
and
nebraska
began
to
propose
legislation
to
strip
agencies
of
their
simulators
and
bar
them
from
buying
new
ones
but
this
isn
t
the
only
kind
of
tech
that
has
some
people
concerned
the
los
angeles
police
department
declined
interview
requests
about
its
use
of
a
software
platform
produced
by
a
company
called
palantir
which
also
won
t
discuss
its
work
with
law
enforcement
agencies
on
the
upside
the
department
talked
about
the
product
and
its
potential
for
a
company
testimonial
so
we
do
have
a
small
idea
about
what
it
is
capable
of
even
if
it
s
just
the
stuff
the
company
needs
to
sell
it
to
other
departments
while
the
lack
of
transparency
might
seem
like
a
cause
for
concern
for
residents
the
system
appears
to
be
little
more
than
an
advanced
data
analytics
platform
geared
toward
law
enforcement
applications
basically
palantir
s
platform
uses
available
data
sources
to
make
sense
of
all
of
the
noise
that
is
out
there
according
to
police
chief
charlie
beck
in
a
testimonial
for
years
we
ve
had
stovepipe
systems
that
have
a
lot
of
information
but
don
t
talk
to
each
other
and
don
t
compare
that
information
and
palantir
allows
us
to
do
that
he
added
while
details
are
limited
as
of
a
few
years
ago
the
company
was
gaining
momentum
in
palantir
founder
alex
karp
told
techcrunch
that
while
he
could
not
disclose
how
many
government
contracts
the
company
had
he
did
say
that
doubling
his
staff
would
help
it
meet
demand
by
pulling
untapped
or
underutilized
data
sets
into
the
investigative
process
officers
are
now
able
to
piece

mr

a

in

went

before
it
is
looking
at
the

the
launch
in

of

crime
center
a
central
location
from
which
officers
could
monitor
all
their
existing
surveillance
technologies
pods
included
the
idea
is
that
consolidating
information
about
criminal
activity
from
stalking
complaints
to
potential
lone
wolf
terrorist
attacks
would
make
law
enforcement
more
effective
at
investigating
and
perhaps
preventing
some
incidents
the
process
would
also
promote
accountability
and
transparency
at
a
time
of
rising
tension
between
police
and
the
black
community
providing
evidence
of
both
police
and
suspect
behavior
during
tense
encounters
proponents
say
but
the
technology
raises
big
privacy
issues
already
concerned
about
pods
privacy
advocates
are
concerned
by
the
prospect
of
centralizing
law
enforcement
data
especially
in
a
post
world
where
data
is
being
shared
more
widely
across
federal
state
and
local
lines
the
technology
is
already
causing
a
populist
backlash
the
theory
of
policing
has
changed
says
rebecca
lonergan
a
university
of
southern
california
law
professor
who
spent
years
prosecuting
public
corruption
and
national
security
cases
for
the
united
states
attorney
s
office
in
los
angeles
there
s
an
understanding
now
that
we
really
need
to
centralize
all
of
our
information
protection
for
large
gatherings
mcphail
is
usually
off
on
fridays
but
he
clocked
in
the
day
after
micah
xavier
johnson
shot
and
killed
five
police
officers
in
dallas
last
month
that
same
day
mcphail
explained
how
the
city
s
new
crime
center
would
help
prevent
future
tragedies
in
large
public
gatherings
the
department
is
planning
to
install
new
cameras
at
the
city
s
golden
center
arena
the
crime
center
itself
will
have
banks
of
state
of
the
art
screens
showing
live
high
definition
video
feeds
of
major
traffic
and
transportation
sites
as
well
as
trained
personnel
who
can
provide
real
time
information
to
officers
in
the
field
and
use
data
analysis
tools
to
interpret
any
data
being
collected
it
s
not
a
replacement
for
old
fashioned
police
work
mcphail
says
but
this
is
kind
of
like
a
natural
progression
of
how
we
do
business
the
questions
we
would
ask
it
s
like
the
first
bread
crumb
along
a
trail
where
at
least
our
investigators
know
where
to
start
looking
it
s
called
predictive
policing
and
law
enforcement
agencies
in
other
cities
are
already
making
it
happen
in
new
york
city
home
to
the
oldest
and
arguably
most
sophisticated
real
time
crime
center
in
the
country
police
can
use
surveillance
and
data
analysis
technology
to
identify
suspected
criminals
or
terrorists
based
on
anything
from
a
birthmark
to
a
limp
the
idea
is
that
people
who
have
a
record
get
their
identifying
marks
loaded
into
a
database
so
if
police
need
to
identify
someone
they
see
they
can
type
in
the
visible
characteristics
and
then
get
that
person
s
name
and
information
with
terrorism
it
s
so
hard
to
find
those
few
radicals
that
really
are
serious
about
it
says
professor
lonergan
at
usc
the
only
way
you
find
them
is
by
doing
the
kind
of
data
collection
and
data
mining
that
we
re
talking
about
the
technology
can
also
be
used
for
more
routine
policing
such
as
addressing
stalking
claims
if
complainants
have
a
license
plate
number
and
are
able
to
give
at
least
three
places
where
they
might
have
seen
the
stalker
the
pod
system
can
be
queried
to
see
if
the
vehicle
was
there
mcphail
says
now
i
might
have
a
stronger
case
to
substantiate
a
stalking
claim
in
advance
of
something
potentially
much
more
serious
happening
to
our
victim
he
says
and
it
has
been
used
to
that
effect
more
policing
not
the
answer
for
some
privacy
and
civil
liberties
advocates
such
predictive
strategies
in
routine
police
work
is
a
problem
not
a
solution
there
s
a
shift
in
the
primary
modality
of
policing
where
it
s
not
just
the
old
investigating
methods
being
employed
but
preemptive
policing
based
on
hunches
says
hamid
khan
a
coordinator
with
the
stop
lapd
spying
coalition
an
alliance
of
community
groups
that
aims
to
prevent
undue
surveillance
of
marginalized
communities
in
los
angeles
it
s
become
part
of
a
larger
architecture
of
surveillance
he
and
other
critics
say
that
sort
of
predictive
policing
reinforces
racial
profiling
and
violates
civil
liberties
with
little
accountability
on
the
part
of
the
officers
who
employ
such
methods
worse
the
strategy
fails
to
address
the
underlying
reasons
for
which
people
often
commit
crimes
t
he
deepest
flaw
in
the
logic
of
predictive
policing
is
the
assumption
that
what
the
model
predicts
is
the
need
for
policing
as
opposed
to
the
need
for
any
other
less
coercive
social
tools
to
deal
with
the
trauma
of
economic
distress
family
dislocation
mental
illness
environmental
stress
and
racial
discrimination
that
often
masquerade
as
criminal
behavior

aderson

a
professor
of

at
howard
university
in
washington
in
an
op
ed
for
the
new
york
times
law
enforcement
should
stay
out
of
the
surveillance
and
data
collection
business
critics
say
at
least
until
lawmakers
are
able
to
develop
clear
policies
that
regulate
their
use
technology
can
be
liberating
or
it
can
be
a
tool
for
control

yet
a
recent
report
from

suggests
that
some
departments
continue
to
struggle
with
privacy
concerns
months
after
making
body
cameras
a
requirement
for
officers
in
dallas
for
example
officers
don
t
need
to
inform
residents
they
are
recording
as
long
as
they
are
in
a
private
residence
in
an
official
capacity
and
in
baltimore
homes
are
treated
the
same
as
any
other
property
though
officers
have
discretion
not
to
record
in
sensitive
circumstances
according
to
the
report
some
drivers
are
staging
their
own
protests
snapping
up
anticamera
license
plate
covers
even

that
keep

new
county
law
a
couple
of
interstates
down
from
sacramento
santa
clara
county
passed
an
ordinance
that
tries
to
address
these
concerns
the
first
of
its
kind
at
the
county
level
it
requires
the
sheriff
s
department
and
the
district
attorney
s
office
to
inform
the
board
of
supervisors
and
the
public
before
they
purchase
any
new
technology
they
also
have
to
lay
out
any
privacy
and
due
process
implications
of
the
devices
develop
a
set
of
policies
that
would
regulate
their
use
and
submit
an
annual
report
on
the
technology
s
use
to
the
board
this
notion
that
we
have
to
choose
between
public
safety
and
privacy
protection
is
wholly
false
says
joe
simitian
a
county
supervisor
and
former
california
state
senator
we
can
protect
the
public
and
respect
their
privacy
and
due
process
rights
at
the
same
time
privacy
advocates
have
praised
the
ordinance
what
protects
privacy
is
a
straightforward
explanation
of
what
we
ve
got
what
we
re
using
when
we
re
going
to
use
it
and
what
the

are
says

that
aims

defend

freedom

the
santa

county
ordinance
does
just
that
she
says
and
should
be
raised
as
a
model
for
other
local
legislatures
to
look
into
limiting

where
three
small
domed
cameras
jut
out
from
a
beige
metal
box
marked
with
the

of
the
sacramento

department
sacramento
does
not
have
anything
in
the
books
resembling
santa
clara
county
s
new
ordinance
but
mcphail
points
out
that
all
three
cameras
face
only
the
streets
avoiding
even
the
businesses
that
line
the
two
main
streets
the
department
also
works

from
the
pods
is
stored
in
a
third

database
and
is
accessible
to

for
up
to
two
years
he
says
that
for
his
city
at
least
residents
have
little
to
worry
about
it
s
not
as
if
there
s
somebody
sitting
here
waiting
for
a
particular
person
to
walk
by
everyday
and
using
the
cameras
as
some
means
to
follow
people
or
monitor
their
daily
lives
that
s
not
what
it
s
for
he
says
we
don
t
have
time
for
that
people
do
value
their
privacy
he
adds
even
police
officers
value
that
when
i

of

that

but
he
says
i
think
there
s
also
a
recognition
of
the
value
that
this
can
add
in
terms
of
us
having
a
positive
impact
on

of

in

cardiff

the

this

researchers
said
in

of

there
is
a
big

between

it
is
a

it

said
brian
levin
executive

san

s

on

the
problem
is
the
correlation

there
are
many
different

levin
whohastrackedboth

also
noted
that
some
hate
groups
don

advertise
their
work
on

local
tensions
may
arise
to
fly
and
be
absent
from
social

he
said
some
segments
of
the
community
shun
social

so
examining
social

as
a
predictor
can
be
a
bit
like
having
one
screwdriver
and
sometimes
it
doesn
t
work
predictive

already
is
in
use
at
the
los

police
department
and
other
agencies
the
lapd
uses
a
predictive

algorithm
to
deploy
officers
to
locations
where
prior
crime
patterns
strongly
suggest
similar
crimes
may
occur
as
crime
during
the
last
two
decades
has
dropped
dramatically
across
the
nation
and
los

police
commanders
are
increasingly
looking
for
any
edge
they
can
get
in
cutting
crime
l
a

is
particularly
useful
because
a
huge
volume

produces
massive

the
advantage
over

techniques
is
incremental
at
best
the
notion
of
crime
forecasting
dates
back
to
when
sociologist
clifford
r
shaw
of
the
university
of
chicago
and
criminologist
henry
d
mckay
of
chicago
s
institute
for
juvenile
research
wrote
a
book
exploring
the
persistence
of
juvenile
crime
in
specific
neighborhoods
scientists
have
experimented
with
using
statistical
and
geospatial
analyses
to
determine
crime
risk
levels
ever
since
in
the
s
the
national
institute
of
justice
nij
and
others
embraced
geographic
information
system
tools
for
mapping
crime
data
and
researchers
began
using
everything
from
basic
regression
analysis
to
cutting
edge
mathematical
models
to
forecast
when
and
where
the
next
outbreak
might
occur
but
until
recently
the
limits
of
computing
power
and
storage
prevented
them
from
using
large
data
sets
in

then
police
departments
were
catching
up
in

making

possibility
rather

a

another
technique
that
the

is
neighbourhood

this

then
brief
the
police
chief
with
the
new
system
the
police
would
be
able
to
identify
gangs
in
specific
areas
on
a
real
time
basis
for
instance
to
curb
chain
snatching
cases
the
cops
could
ascertain
information
about
specific
locations
prone
to
such
incidents
and
take
preventive
measures
the
tactic
already
in
use
in
the
west
was
a
part
of
a
project
called
enterprise
information
integration
solution
ei
s
this
system
put
petabytes
of
information
from
more
than
a
dozen
crime
databases
at
the
fingertips
of
the
police
using
this
data
the
cops
implemented
their
crime
forecast
plan
to
predict
when
and
where
criminals
could
strike
the
software
would
analyse
police
data
for
patterns
and
compare
them
with
information
from
jails
courts
and
other
crime
fighting
agencies
the
cops
would
have
access
to
data
on
not
only
the
suspects
but
also
likely
victims
another
technique
that
the
police
are
likely
to
put
into
use
is
neighbourhood
analysis
this
would
help
the
sleuths
understand
crime
events
and
the
circumstances
behind
them
in
a
small
area
on
the
basis
of
the
previous
record
cases
will
be
classified
into
multiple
categories
to
understand
what
types
of
crime
a
particular
area
was
prone
to
and
the
measures
needed
thereof
another
technique
called
proximity
analysis
would
provide
information
about
criminals
victims
witnesses
and
people
who
are
or
were
within
a
certain
distance
of
the
crime
scene
by
analysing
demographic
and
social
trends
investigators
would
be
able
to
understand
changes
that
had
taken
place
in
an
area

february
good
evening
everyone
and
thank
you
to
bobby
chesney
and
the
teams
at
the
strauss
center
and
ut
law
for
having
me
here
and
for
organizing
an
exceptional
day
of
panels
i
m
admittedly
at
a
bit
of
a
loss
to
find
myself
here
at
my
alma
mater
the
university
of
texas
nominally
keynoting
lecturing
to
a
room
filled
with
so
many
of
the
people
i
have
worked
with
or
against
over
the
past
fifteen
years
there
are
mentors
here
mentees
colleagues
from
my
former
organizations
friends
frenemies
esteemed
opponents
i
ve
litigated
against
it
s
an
incredible
group
which
leaves
me
incredibly
humbled
and
more
than
a
little
freaked
out
if
this
were
some
public
keynote
with
a
bunch
of
civilians
i
could
just
do
my
usual
song
and
dance
on
the
issue
of
the
moment
most
likely
encryption
and
going
dark
n
repeating
arguments
you
ve
all
heard
before
n
and
that
would
be
that
but
i
owe
you
guys
something
more
than
that
some
grand
holistic
theory
of
everything
that
pulls
together
all
the
threads
from
today
s
panels
or
some
deeply
personal
and
idiosyncratic
take
that
gets
to
the
meat
of
why
i
do
what
i
do
i
foolishly
will
try
to
do
a
little
bit
of
both
tonight
and
will
probably
fail
to
do
either
one
effectively
but
success
or
failure
i
hope
the
next
minutes
will
provide
some
light
entertainment
and
some
minor
food
for
thought
to
complement
your
dinners
i
m
going
to
talk
about
the
path
that
started
for
me
here
at
ut
and
brought
me
to
this
work
perhaps
prompting
you
to
stop
and
reflect
a
bit
on
how
you
got
here
and
i
m
going
to
talk
about
where
i
think
we
are
now
as
a
community
and
about
where
i
think
we
are
going
amongst
other
things
this
talk
will
be
a
bit
of
a
love
letter
to
and
a
friendly
argument
with
the
electronic
frontier
foundation
eff
n
the
organization
where
i
spent
most
of
my
career
and
that
basically
raised
me
and
as
will
be
no
surprise
to
anyone
here
who
knows
me
well
it
s
also
going
to
address
one
of
my
great
passions
science
fiction
and
how
it
can
be
used
as
a
tool
to
help
us
think
about
today
s
problems
yep
science
fiction
get
used
to
it
non
nerds
the
topic
of
science
fiction
came
up
just
a
couple
of
weeks
ago
at
another
cybersecurity
event
the
hewlett
foundation
s
cybersecurity
grantees
meeting
in
los
angeles
n
there
thanks
to
the
foundation
s
president
larry
kramer
and
its
cybersecurity
program
officer
eli
sugarman
i
was
lucky
enough
to
meet
walter
parkes
the
screenwriter
of
wargames
and
sneakers
and
the
producer
of
minority
report
amongst
many
other
hit
movies
n
if
you
want
a
good
example
of
the
feedback
loop
between
fiction
and
especially
science
fiction
and
real
world
tech
and
policy
you
can
t
get
much
better
than
walter
since
wargames
inspired
the
computer
fraud
and
abuse
act
that
our
panelists
were
arguing
about
earlier
n
sneakers
inspired
countless
security
engineers
and
hackers
and
spooks
to
do
what
they
do
n
and
the
movie
version
of
minority
report
is
probably
the
second
most
cited
fictional
work
in
policy
discourse
about
surveillance
and
privacy
and
an
inspiration
for
a
lot
of
modern
interface
design
to
boot
n
what
s
the
first
most
cited
work
i
think
we
all
know
the
answer
but
we
ll
get
to
that
walter
being
from
hollywood
is
all
about
story
beginning
middle
and
end
strong
protagonists
with
clear
conflicts
and
relatable
goals
and
right
now
he
d
tell
me
to
stop
with
all
the
throat
clearing
and
begin
the
beginning
so
here
s
where
it
starts
for
me
fade
in
on
the
ut
campus
spring
of
my
freshman
year
it
was
easily
one
of
the
happiest
years
of
my
life
coming
from
southern
louisiana
a
place
where
progressive
bookish
sci
fi
nerds
who
don
t
like
football
didn
t
really
fit
in
i
finally
felt
like
i
was
home
and
my
only
job
was
reading
and
thinking
and
writing
for
no
other
purpose
than
to
explore
a
freedom
for
which
i
thank
plan
ii
ut
s
incredible
liberal
arts
honors
program
it
was
then
that
i
was
put
on
the
path
that
led
me
here
today
though
i
didn
t
know
it
at
the
time
i
expected
i
d
just
end
up
an
english
professor
until
that
spring
of
which
changed
the
course
of
my
life
and
it
wouldn
t
have
happened
without
science
fiction
it
s
a
truism
at
this
point
that
science
fiction
often
predicts
or
inspires
real
world
developments
whether
it
s
famous
sci
fi
author
arthur
c
clarke
coming
up
with
the
idea
of
communications
satellites
in
the
s
n
or
sadly
less
famous
sci
fi
author
john
brunner
predicting
computer
worms
in
the
s
n
or
william
gibson
in
his
early
s
cyberpunk
classic
neurohd
mancer
coining
the
term
cyberspace
long
before
any
of
us
were
exposed
to
the
modern
internet
n
and
if
you
don
t
know
what
cyberpunk
is
well
you
re
in
luck
because
year
old
me
would
be
super
excited
to
tell
you
all
about
it
right
now
because
he
s
totally
a
huge
fan
the
cyberpunk
science
fiction
of
the
s
and
s
tossed
out
the
spaceships
and
aliens
and
shiny
exciting
far
futures
of
previous
generations
to
look
closer
to
home
painting
a
dark
dystopian
picture
of
a
globally
networked
near
future
where
multinational
corporations
were
as
powerful
as
states
states
looked
a
lot
more
like
corporations
and
ordinary
peoples
lives
were
dictated
by
transnational
networks
of
data
and
capital
far
beyond
their
control
or
comprehension
n
but
the
prototypical
hacker
protagonist
that
anti
establishment
hero
was
not
like
those
ordinary
people
only
he
unfortunately
it
was
almost
always
a
he
could
get
behind
the
data
and
make
the
technology
work
for
him
and
turn
the
tables
on
the
powerful
indeed
the
hacker
protagonist
had
become
such
an
established
trope
by
the
early
s
that
neal
stephenson
s
cyberpunk
classic
snow
crash
which
came
out
in
the
fall
of
my
freshman
year
had
a
hacker
protagonist
jokingly
named
hiro
protaganist
n
the
teenage
me
just
gobbled
this
stuff
up
so
too
did
several
of
the
original
founders
of
eff
which
was
being
born
just
as
i
was
finishing
high
school
frankly
if
you
want
to
understand
why
eff
was
founded
who
its
constituency
is
and
why
its
culture
is
what
it
is
now
if
you
want
to
understand
the
birth
of
the
digital
rights
movement
in
the
us
really
it
very
much
helps
to
have
read
the
cyberpunk
fiction
of
the
s
and
s
indeed
eff
s
tag
line
for
its
recent
anniversary
wears
the
organization
s
science
fictional
origin
on
its
sleeve
that
slogan
eff
fighting
dystopia
for
years
but
i
digress
and
walter
parkes
is
getting
impatient
suffice
to
say
cyberpunk
left
me
well
primed
when
four
things
happened
to
set
me
on
the
path
that
brought
me
here
the
first
thing
was
simply
this
i
got
on
the
internet
for
the
very
first
time
to
use
email
for
the
very
first
time
and
coming
fresh
off
of
gibson
s
cyberspace
and
stephenson
s
metaverse
it
kind
of
blew
my
mind
second
i
read
and
was
inspired
by
the
hacker
crackdown
a
non
fiction
book
by
science
fiction
writer
and
austinite
bruce
sterling
n
it
was
all
about
the
emerging
hacker
subculture
the
secret
service
s
overreaching
response
to
it
including
the
seizure
of
all
the
computers
at
austin
based
steve
jackson
games
since
they
hosted
a
bbs
to
which
someone
had
posted
some
proprietary
at
t
documents
and
about
the
foundation
of
eff
which
was
initially
created
to
raise
the
money
and
find
the
lawyers
to
fight
for
steve
jackson
games
to
get
its
computers
back
reading
the
hacker
crackdown
was
kind
of
like
reading
one
of
the
cyberpunk
novels
that
sterling
and
gibson
and
stephenson
were
writing
at
the
time
but
it
was
real
and
just
to
tie
it
all
up
in
a
nice
bow
one
of
steve
jackson
s
most
popular
role
playing
games
at
the
time
inspired
by
those
same
novels
was
called
cyberpunk
that
book
well
blew
my
mind
third
thing
being
a
fan
of
bruce
sterling
i
also
picked
up
the
first
issue
of
wired
magazine
since
he
was
on
the
cover
n
and
then
its
second
issue
that
second
issue
had
on
the
cover
the
so
called
cypherpunks
including
one
of
the
founders
of
eff
who
were
fighting
the
first
round
of
the
original
crypto
wars
n
again
note
the
eff
cyberpunk
connection
those
magazines
which
i
distinctly
remember
buying
at
the
ut
student
union
not
far
from
here
illustrated
in
a
way
that
i
hadn
t
quite
realized
before
that
many
of
the
technologies
i
d
been
reading
about
in
science
fiction
were
real
or
very
close
to
it
and
it
blew
my
mind
after
that
fourth
and
finally
my
computer
nerd
dorm
neighbors
who
are
still
some
of
my
best
friends
showed
me
the
liberal
arts
wussie
who
s
primary
understanding
of
technology
came
from
reading
sci
fi
this
funny
new
computer
program
it
was
called
mosaic
the
very
first
web
browser
netscape
s
predecessor
and
the
first
concrete
glimpse
of
what
the
next
twenty
years
would
look
like
n
it
yes
that
s
right
blew
mind
as
an
english
major
my
first
response
was
wow
i
would
love
to
see
a
hypertext
edition
of
james
joyce
s
ulysses
i
was
big
on
joyce
at
the
time
my
second
response
though
was
i
don
t
want
to
be
an
english
professor
i
want
to
help
build
this
i
want
to
help
defend
it
and
grow
it
and
if
you
d
told
me
then
that
i
d
actually
end
up
doing
that
by
working
for
nearly
a
decade
at
the
eff
in
san
francisco
and
would
eventually
end
up
running
a
whole
new
digital
rights
shop
in
washington
dc
fighting
for
a
more
open
and
secure
internet
called
the
open
technology
institute
n
i
would
have
slapped
you
in
the
face
and
called
you
liar
for
getting
my
hopes
up
yet
here
we
are
flash
forward
to
now
twenty
odd
years
later
and
in
a
lot
of
ways
we
re
navigating
the
cyberpunk
future
that
was
predicted
in
the
s
although
with
some
unanticipated
bright
spots
see
the
fall
of
the
soviet
union
which
loomed
large
as
a
state
power
in
s
cyberpunk
n
some
tragic
curveballs
see
and
some
technological
shifts
that
we
didn
t
predict
see
the
rise
of
the
smartphone
but
again
walter
is
nagging
me
what
s
the
story
kevin
these
nice
people
want
to
know
who
are
the
protagonists
and
what
s
the
conflict
cut
to
the
chase
and
i
ll
do
that
though
it
s
not
a
chase
it
s
a
race
it
s
a
race
against
two
futures
two
dystopias
and
the
protagonists
of
this
tale
of
two
dystopias
are
us
here
in
this
room
and
everyone
else
in
our
community
that
is
trying
to
preserve
the
security
of
the
internet
one
of
the
dystopias
is
from
a
science
fiction
that
you
all
know
it
s
which
i
pointed
to
earlier
as
the
most
cited
fiction
in
privacy
policy
circles
n
was
also
cited
by
walter
parkes
in
la
as
a
great
example
of
how
narrative
can
take
a
set
of
complex
ideas
and
simplify
them
package
them
and
create
a
powerful
shorthand
that
everyone
understands
big
brother
has
become
our
go
to
signifier
when
warning
of
a
technology
enabled
surveillance
society
and
it
is
still
a
relevant
warning
as
we
re
looking
down
the
barrel
of
the
kind
of
totalitarian
surveillance
dystopia
that
portrays
but
updated
from
a
telescreen
centric
to
an
internet
centric
mode
a
world
where
all
of
the
public
expression
and
private
communication
flowing
over
the
internet
can
easily
be
monitored
and
manipulated
and
made
to
serve
the
interests
of
the
state
we
see
the
most
virulent
strains
of
this
future
already
reaching
into
our
present
especially
in
russia
and
china
whose
governments
are
wholly
unapologetic
in
trying
to
turn
the
internet
into
the
most
powerful
tool
of
social
control
ever
devised
n
we
see
a
more
friendly
velvet
gloved
brave
new
world
ish
n
version
of
that
future
infiltrating
the
west
as
intelligence
services
have
begun
to
live
on
the
internet
backbone
and
mass
surveillance
has
replaced
targeted
surveillance
and
many
are
left
wondering
where
our
dreams
in
the
s
of
the
internet
as
an
open
frontier
have
gone
n
imagine
here
a
footnote
to
either
jennifer
granick
s
great
keynote
at
black
hat
last
year
the
end
of
the
internet
dream
n
and
or
the
less
apt
but
still
hilarious
dream
of
the
s
sketch
from
the
comedy
show
portlandia
n
both
of
which
i
recommend
wholeheartedly
or
to
reference
another
much
beloved
science
fiction
after
several
decades
of
mostly
unconstrained
growth
of
the
global
open
internet
the
empire
is
striking
back
states
are
acting
in
some
cases
very
aggressively
to
reassert
their
digital
sovereignty
in
contrast
to
the
other
second
dystopia
is
one
that
none
of
you
have
ever
heard
of
from
a
science
fiction
book
that
none
of
you
have
read
though
it
and
the
other
books
in
the
trilogy
of
which
it
is
a
part
are
available
for
free
online
if
you
google
for
them
n
it
s
called
the
maelstrom
by
peter
watts
n
one
of
my
favorite
sci
fi
novelists
writing
today
what
is
the
maelstrom
you
ask
well
imagine
today
s
internet
with
all
its
emergent
insecurities
all
the
spooks
and
spies
and
hackers
and
criminals
and
state
attackers
and
botnets
and
phishing
scams
and
mass
data
breaches
and
backdoors
and
bad
guys
imagine
all
the
ugly
trends
outlined
in
profeshd
sor
ron
deibert
s
black
code
n
a
harrowing
portrait
of
the
modern
internet
that
i
highly
recommend
and
then
multiply
them
by
a
imagine
us
building
new
layer
upon
new
layer
over
the
chaotic
crumbling
foundation
that
is
the
internet
continually
trying
to
make
it
more
secure
and
continually
failing
as
the
botnets
we
talked
about
in
today
s
panel
grow
and
multiply
into
a
pervasive
infestation
of
self
evolving
automated
agents
an
electronic
war
of
all
against
all
red
in
tooth
and
claw
a
digital
state
of
nature
imagine
the
internet
as
a
failed
state
where
no
one
wants
to
go
but
where
everyone
has
to
live
because
we
ve
built
our
entire
society
on
top
of
it
that
is
the
maelstrom
and
those
are
our
two
dystopias
versus
the
maelstrom
order
vs
chaos
the
scylla
and
charybdis
that
we
as
a
community
need
to
navigate
because
none
of
us
want
either
of
those
futures
sure
some
of
us
fall
a
bit
more
on
the
order
side
or
the
chaos
side
or
as
dahlia
lithwick
put
it
in
one
of
her
more
popular
columns
some
of
us
are
order
muppets
and
some
of
us
are
chaos
muppets
n
google
it
but
i
know
that
my
oft
time
opponents
in
government
ultimately
don
t
want
to
live
in
the
liberty
eroding
any
more
than
i
want
to
live
in
the
anarchic
chaos
of
the
maelstrom
where
no
one
is
safe
and
we
need
to
work
together
to
plot
a
course
that
avoids
those
futures
or
even
worse
a
combination
of
those
futures
where
the
totalitarian
states
of
ride
atop
the
maelstrom
and
the
only
choice
left
to
anyone
if
they
have
a
choice
at
all
is
to
be
left
in
the
utter
chaos
outside
the
walls
of
the
state
or
to
embrace
big
brother
it
s
that
result
that
i
actually
fear
the
most
so
i
look
at
the
landscape
as
many
of
you
do
and
try
to
figure
out
how
to
move
the
right
levers
to
avoid
those
futures
but
every
lever
you
can
move
makes
another
lever
move
in
the
other
direction
for
every
action
there
s
an
equal
and
opposite
reaction
indeed
many
of
those
actions
and
reactions
are
things
that
have
been
in
the
news
and
that
we
have
been
talking
about
in
our
panels
just
in
the
past
few
days
take
for
example
a
company
like
facebook
turning
on
https
for
all
of
its
traffic
that
encryption
prevents
foreign
countries
like
say
the
uk
just
in
the
news
today
on
this
issue
from
sniffing
their
citizens
facebook
messages
as
they
pass
through
the
territory
to
and
from
us
servers
n
that
in
turn
prompts
athd
tempts
by
those
countries
to
either
regulate
against
encryption
or
demand
that
the
data
be
stored
locally
or
try
to
apply
their
laws
outside
of
their
territory
to
demand
the
handover
of
data
stored
in
the
us
backed
by
the
threat
of
throwing
facebook
execs
in
jail
if
they
ever
visit
or
consider
the
example
of
users
turning
to
end
to
end
encrypted
apps
like
imessage
or
whatsapp
which
prompts
demands
that
the
companies
not
offer
such
encryption
or
build
a
backdoor
into
it
and
also
prompts
government
stockpiling
of
vulnerabilities
to
hack
into
the
phones
as
an
alternative
to
wiretapping
pushback
on
one
issue
leads
to
more
pushback
on
another
issue
back
and
forth
tit
for
tat
a
never
ending
whack
a
mole
n
so
how
do
we
respond
well
we
discussed
one
of
the
current
strategies
during
yesterday
s
dinner
panel
the
idea
of
letting
off
steam
and
trying
to
give
the
governments
more
of
the
data
they
say
they
need
in
the
least
harmful
ways
to
avoid
the
most
harmful
ways
last
night
we
discussed
the
example
of
trying
to
come
up
with
a
new
framework
for
cross
border
data
transfers
if
we
can
come
up
with
a
way
for
google
or
facebook
or
whoever
to
voluntarily
hand
over
data
to
the
uk
in
a
way
that
is
consistent
with
human
rights
and
perhaps
even
raises
standards
the
thinking
goes
then
we
can
help
head
off
bad
things
like
data
localization
or
anti
encryption
mandates
or
american
internet
execs
getting
thrown
in
jail
some
privacy
minded
technologists
and
advocates
have
similarly
argued
that
if
we
can
just
routinize
and
standardize
government
hacking
under
clear
and
protective
standards
i
mean
they
are
doing
it
already
anyway
right
just
under
weak
unclear
secret
standards
then
we
can
head
off
bad
anti
encryption
policies
n
that
s
the
thinking
anyway
and
i
have
to
admit
that
i
m
very
sympathetic
to
this
approach
i
m
one
of
the
people
trying
to
figure
out
what
that
reasonable
compromise
might
be
on
cross
border
data
transfers
n
i
m
one
of
those
people
who
without
endorsing
the
idea
of
government
hacking
wants
to
expose
the
practice
to
real
regulation
and
ensure
that
it
is
included
in
the
calculus
as
we
continue
to
have
this
never
ending
going
dark
debate
n
i
m
scared
we
won
t
make
any
progress
and
will
continue
to
lose
ground
on
these
issues
if
we
re
not
willing
to
have
those
sorts
of
conversations
i
m
scared
we
ll
fail
to
protect
the
technologies
that
we
need
to
protect
ourselves
that
said
i
ll
also
admit
that
i
have
some
serious
concerns
about
this
approach
because
i
fear
the
governments
will
be
not
be
placated
by
our
concessions
i
think
we
may
let
off
steam
by
conceding
in
one
area
yet
still
fail
to
reduce
the
pressure
elsewhere
the
cross
border
issue
is
a
good
example
we
re
willing
to
compromise
to
arrive
at
a
human
rights
respecting
solution
when
it
comes
to
accessing
stored
content
in
criminal
investigations
and
yet
it
s
clear
from
today
s
story
in
the
washington
post
that
the
uk
s
priority
is
a
wiretapping
solution
for
its
national
security
investigations
n
the
privacy
advocates
that
are
willing
to
engage
in
the
cross
border
data
discussion
are
doing
it
because
we
re
concerned
about
the
alternative
of
forced
data
localization
and
yet
data
localization
very
well
may
happen
anyway
due
to
that
national
security
wiretapping
need
that
we
re
unwilling
to
address
or
due
to
an
ultimate
failure
of
the
eu
data
protection
safe
harbor
that
allows
us
companies
to
take
in
european
data
or
due
to
a
variety
of
factors
we
can
t
necessarily
predict
similarly
we
may
end
up
legitimizing
government
hacking
through
our
attempts
to
expose
and
regulate
it
while
still
not
achieving
the
goal
of
getting
law
enforcement
to
stop
pushing
for
limits
on
encryption
this
is
why
many
of
my
friends
and
mentors
including
folks
in
this
room
like
aclu
s
chris
soghoian
or
my
fellow
eff
alum
jennifer
granick
would
say
don
t
compromise
just
fight
it
just
fight
it
all
fight
on
every
front
and
don
t
give
any
ground
that
s
basically
the
way
i
was
raised
at
eff
and
they
do
have
a
point
why
should
we
be
working
to
give
governments
more
access
to
data
when
the
overall
trend
is
in
the
direction
of
a
golden
age
of
surveillance
where
the
information
they
don
t
have
access
to
is
just
a
small
portion
of
a
massive
amount
of
communications
data
that
didn
t
even
exist
twenty
years
ago
and
that
they
can
now
easily
obtain
why
should
we
be
the
reasonable
compromisers
when
the
state
s
appetite
for
data
is
essentially
unquenchable
because
the
operating
theory
in
law
enforcement
and
intelligence
seems
to
be
that
every
scrap
of
data
that
exists
or
will
exist
should
be
technically
accessible
to
them
at
any
time
that
they
have
a
natural
right
to
it
even
though
until
very
recently
nearly
the
entire
mass
of
human
communication
was
always
outside
of
their
reach
hell
electronic
eavesdropping
of
any
sort
was
an
incredibly
rare
oddity
until
the
back
half
of
the
last
century
n
and
yet
now
we
are
asked
to
build
our
entire
world
around
the
idea
of
guaranteed
government
access
to
all
of
our
private
communications
and
records
screw
them
is
what
they
would
say
and
i
hear
them
and
i
know
where
they
are
coming
from
just
fight
it
was
where
i
was
as
a
younger
man
as
a
litigator
being
young
and
being
a
litigator
makes
it
easy
to
see
the
world
in
such
blacks
and
whites
and
it
may
be
where
i
end
up
as
an
older
man
assuming
i
ve
tired
of
the
horse
trading
and
compromise
and
shifting
alliances
of
the
policy
game
and
have
lost
faith
that
the
rules
of
law
and
reason
can
actually
restrain
the
powerful
but
right
now
i
will
do
whatever
i
can
to
protect
the
right
to
encrypt
above
all
others
even
if
that
means
compromising
on
some
other
things
even
if
pushing
them
back
on
that
front
means
they
push
us
back
on
other
fronts
because
here
s
the
nub
only
encryption
helps
us
avoid
both
dystopias
only
encryption
it
protects
us
both
from
the
maelstrom
of
an
insecure
internet
and
the
of
an
unconstrained
state
that
can
see
into
every
nook
and
cranny
it
offers
the
middle
way
between
order
and
chaos
the
middle
way
between
security
of
the
state
and
security
from
the
state
and
right
now
that
s
where
i
m
pointing
all
my
guns
right
down
the
middle
in
defense
of
crypto
and
maybe
i
will
tire
of
the
middle
at
some
point
maybe
i
will
finally
get
sick
of
participating
in
discussions
about
cross
border
data
exchange
and
government
hacking
that
make
the
just
fight
it
all
side
of
me
worry
but
right
now
it
s
where
i
m
standing
and
i
invite
you
to
join
me
there
perhaps
you
d
prefer
not
maybe
your
mileage
may
vary
and
your
calculus
may
be
different
and
i
ll
just
have
to
keep
having
all
of
these
arguments
both
with
the
people
who
i
m
fighting
and
with
the
people
who
think
i
m
not
fighting
hard
enough
but
it
s
late
and
it
s
been
a
long
day
so
let
s
not
argue
about
it
now
walter
is
telling
me
that
this
story
has
climaxed
and
it
s
about
time
to
wrap
things
up
but
before
i
let
you
go
let
me
offer
two
closing
thoughts
that
might
be
useful
in
your
thinking
of
our
future
inspired
by
two
science
fiction
novels
about
the
future
of
our
thinking
the
first
is
a
newer
sci
fi
novel
called
nexus
by
ramez
naam
n
naam
is
an
interesting
character
he
spent
years
at
microsoft
leading
teams
developing
internet
explorer
and
outlook
and
their
search
engine
bing
but
really
wanted
to
be
a
sci
fi
writer
n
nexus
is
his
first
book
and
although
it
s
maybe
not
the
most
literary
novel
it
reads
like
an
airport
techno
thriller
on
sci
fi
steroids
it
s
premise
is
a
nice
take
on
an
old
idea
the
hybridization
of
man
and
machine
the
titular
technology
nexus
is
essentially
a
nano
technological
drug
that
integrates
with
your
brain
and
internet
enables
it
allowing
amongst
other
things
for
people
to
silently
communicate
with
each
other
to
share
complex
skills
and
masses
of
knowledge
in
an
instant
and
even
create
group
minds
just
like
you
can
network
computers
it
s
pretty
far
out
but
it
s
not
totally
nuts
in
fact
naam
has
some
fascinating
afterwords
in
the
book
and
its
sequels
laying
out
the
current
state
of
brain
computer
interface
research
n
and
there
s
a
lot
of
surprising
things
happening
in
labs
right
now
such
as
paralyzed
people
moving
robot
limbs
using
their
thoughts
n
blind
people
whose
vision
has
been
restored
by
inputting
electrical
signals
directly
into
their
visual
cortices
n
fmri
brain
scanners
that
read
what
a
person
is
seeing
and
can
reconstruct
the
video
n
and
brain
damaged
rats
whose
memories
have
been
restored
with
computer
chips
implanted
in
the
hippocampus
whose
memories
can
be
recorded
and
replayed
in
their
brains
at
any
time
n
just
last
week
i
read
a
story
about
researchers
using
electrodes
to
monitor
a
person
s
brain
and
then
matching
that
data
against
data
collected
from
previous
brains
to
figure
out
in
near
real
time
what
the
person
is
looking
at
n
and
then
there
is
perhaps
my
favorite
brain
research
story
about
the
two
university
of
washington
researchers
who
in
cooperatively
played
a
video
game
by
networking
their
freaking
brains
n
one
researcher
could
see
a
video
game
display
but
had
no
controls
while
the
other
had
the
controls
but
no
display
when
the
one
with
the
controls
wanted
to
shoot
an
eeg
cap
on
his
skull
would
transmit
a
signal
across
campus
where
a
magnetic
stimulator
on
the
other
researcher
s
head
would
send
a
targeted
pulse
through
his
motor
cortex
and
cause
his
finger
to
twitch
and
hit
the
fire
button
amazing
right
i
know
it
s
still
a
far
cry
from
having
internet
enabled
brains
but
that
kind
of
technology
is
foreseeable
perhaps
even
inevitable
so
one
science
fictional
thought
experiment
for
you
to
consider
while
you
finish
your
dessert
how
would
you
approach
cybersecurity
policy
if
the
things
we
were
securing
were
our
brains
and
the
data
we
were
securing
were
our
thoughts
how
would
you
feel
about
not
being
able
to
encrypt
the
private
thoughts
that
you
share
with
your
family
how
would
you
feel
about
the
possibility
of
a
government
secretly
implanting
malware
in
your
brain
sure
you
can
say
that
the
whole
idea
is
just
science
fiction
nonsense
but
like
all
good
science
fiction
it
s
a
metaphor
that
speaks
to
us
about
how
we
live
today
regardless
of
whether
you
think
our
brains
will
ever
literally
merge
with
computers
in
a
way
they
already
have
as
the
unanimous
supreme
court
recently
recognized
in
riley
v
california
our
mobile
devices
now
house
an
absolutely
enormous
amounts
private
thoughts
images
and
information
amounts
of
data
we
couldn
t
even
conceive
of
a
generation
ago
n
every
day
these
devices
are
looking
more
and
more
like
our
outboard
brains
at
what
point
does
that
change
how
we
treat
them
as
a
policy
matter
that
s
closing
thought
number
one
the
second
and
final
closing
thought
was
inspired
by
charlie
stross
accelerando
n
perhaps
my
favorite
sci
fi
novel
of
the
aughts
and
certainly
the
one
with
the
most
crazy
new
ideas
per
square
inch
in
that
book
several
characters
have
an
entertaining
debate
one
that
we
could
also
have
ourselves
right
now
about
whether
or
not
the
singularity
has
already
happened
if
you
re
not
familiar
with
the
singularity
a
term
bandied
about
by
ai
researchers
and
sci
fi
nerds
alike
it
s
the
name
for
the
hockey
stick
part
of
the
curve
in
our
technological
growth
where
the
exponential
progress
of
moore
s
law
hits
a
point
of
accelerating
acceleration
and
the
capacity
of
our
computing
power
begins
to
exceed
our
own
grasp
and
starts
improving
on
itself
and
beyond
that
point
we
are
supplanted
by
thinking
machines
that
we
can
t
even
comprehend
and
we
are
unable
to
predict
anything
anymore
because
what
s
going
to
happen
next
is
so
far
beyond
our
ken
n
some
people
jokingly
call
this
the
rapture
of
the
nerds
no
seriously
this
is
a
thing
a
thing
that
some
of
the
architects
of
our
digital
lives
including
some
people
who
make
big
decisions
at
google
take
very
seriously
and
just
as
you
need
to
understand
cyberpunk
to
understand
the
origin
of
american
digital
rights
groups
you
kind
of
need
to
understand
the
singularity
if
you
truly
want
to
grok
n
silicon
valley
s
weirdo
strain
of
technolibertarian
utopianism
but
anyway
back
to
accelerando
these
people
in
the
book
are
wondering
seriously
arguing
at
length
about
whether
they
re
post
singularity
and
the
joke
is
this
they
are
having
this
argument
on
a
laser
propelled
spaceship
the
size
of
a
can
of
soup
on
its
way
to
the
next
star
system
and
the
reason
they
are
able
to
be
having
that
argument
on
that
spaceship
is
because
they
aren
t
people
at
all
they
are
the
digitally
uploaded
brains
of
people
kind
of
a
crazy
idea
right
but
there
s
a
real
truth
inside
the
crazy
and
it
s
this
you
can
t
tell
when
you
re
in
it
when
you
re
in
it
we
ve
learned
to
take
so
much
of
our
technology
for
granted
and
so
quickly
that
if
a
time
traveler
from
even
just
ten
years
ago
visited
us
they
d
be
totally
disoriented
by
it
and
if
we
went
back
even
ten
years
we
d
be
kind
of
helpless
without
it
stross
joke
is
the
sci
fi
version
of
an
older
joke
that
was
central
to
a
great
commencement
speech
by
not
quite
science
fiction
author
david
foster
wallace
entitled
this
is
water
n
you
should
google
that
too
it
s
great
the
joke
is
two
young
fish
are
swimming
one
day
when
an
older
fish
passes
by
and
says
how
s
the
water
after
the
old
fish
passes
one
fish
turns
to
the
other
and
asks
him
what
the
hell
is
water
we
have
told
ourselves
so
many
times
that
we
re
in
the
midst
of
an
epochal
shift
in
the
nature
of
human
society
and
its
relationship
to
technology
that
we
ve
forgotten
how
true
it
is
this
is
water
we
are
in
it
right
now
and
it
s
very
easy
to
look
at
these
seismic
shifts
and
feel
powerless
in
the
face
of
them
but
it
s
actually
the
opposite
we
are
only
at
the
beginning
of
this
new
era
still
in
the
early
days
of
what
we
currently
call
the
internet
and
complex
systems
are
very
sensitive
to
initial
conditions
that
s
what
people
mean
when
they
talk
about
the
butterfly
effect
the
decisions
we
make
now
matter
more
than
we
know
we
are
the
butterflies
or
let
me
put
it
another
way
the
nsa
has
this
acronym
nobus
it
stands
for
nobody
but
us
and
it
refers
to
software
vulnerabilities
that
the
nsa
thinks
only
the
nsa
will
ever
discover
and
exploit
n
i
think
it
s
a
profoundly
flawed
concept
n
as
demonstrated
at
s
chaos
computer
congress
when
jake
appelbaum
did
a
keynote
on
the
snowden
docs
laying
out
the
nsa
s
catalog
of
exploits
and
the
vulnerability
that
one
of
those
exploits
relied
on
had
been
the
subject
of
a
research
presentation
just
the
day
before
n
someone
other
than
us
had
found
it
but
we
don
t
need
to
argue
about
nobus
right
now
right
now
i
m
using
the
phrase
nobody
but
us
in
a
very
different
way
right
now
what
i
m
here
to
say
is
that
nobody
but
us
is
going
to
set
the
initial
conditions
for
the
future
of
the
internet
nobody
but
us
those
of
us
in
this
room
and
our
communities
outside
of
this
room
and
our
opponents
who
want
to
abuse
the
internet
to
control
us
or
steal
from
us
or
attack
us
is
going
to
determine
which
science
fictional
future
we
re
going
to
live
in
whether
it
looks
like
the
maelstrom
or
big
brother
or
both
or
neither
nobody
but
us
is
going
to
create
the
future
that
we
want
we
are
the
butterflies
this
is
water
it
s
up
to
us
all

chaos

covington
s
evolution
into
a
killer
encapsulates
a
trend
driving
gun
violence
around
the
country
increasingly
people
are
shooting
to
kill
criminals
are
stockpiling
higher
caliber
guns
many
with
extended
magazines
that
hold
more
than
bullets
police
and
hospitals
are
seeing
a
growing
number
of
victims
who
have
been
shot
in
the
head
or
shot
repeatedly
and
trauma
doctors
are
finding
it
more
difficult
to
save
gunshot
victims
in
many
places
if
you
get
shot
you
are
more
likely
to
die
than
ever
before
in
baltimore
one
of
every
three
people
struck
by
gunfire
dies
up
from
one
death
in
every
four
shootings
the
previous
decade
it
ranks
as
one
of
the
most
lethal
of
america
s
largest
cities
according
to
a
baltimore
sun
analysis
two
other
cities
washington
and
new
orleans
shared
the
brutal
distinction
of
one
in
three
shootings
ending
in
a
homicide
in
like
baltimore
several
cities
have
seen
the
death
grip
tighten
in
chicago
one
in
people
died
after
being
shot
in
now
one
in
six
perishes
last
year
the
odds
for
gunshot
victims
worsened
in
at
least
of
the
nation
s
largest
cities
the
sun
found
the
baltimore
sun
undertook
a
yearlong
investigation
into
this
rarely
studied
phenomenon
documenting
patterns
of
lethality
based
on
hundreds
of
crime
statistics
hospital
data
and
gun
trace
reports
as
well
as
interviews
with
police
chiefs
homicide
detectives
criminologists
medical
experts
community
activists
victims
of
gun
violence
and
the
perpetrators
themselves
researchers
said
lethality
is
a
significant
part
of
the
homicide
equation
with
implications
for
policing
public
health
and
trauma
care
but
in
depth
study
has
been
hampered
by
a
paucity
of
statistics
historically
gun
violence
research
in
the
u
s
has
been
inhibited
by
a
lack
of
federal
funding
and
data
many
police
departments
only
track
what
they
are
required
to
report
to
the
fbi
which
doesn
t
include
how
often
people
survive
shootings
where
on
the
body
people
are
shot
and
how
many
times
that
leaves
a
focus
on
body
counts
and
homicide
rates
which
can
be
traced
back
nearly
a
century
while
the
nation
s
overall
violent
crime
rate
declined
starting
in
the
s
a
city
s
homicide
rate
typically
fluctuates
sometimes
significantly
leaving
criminologists
to
puzzle
over
the
causes
behind
spikes
and
dips
just
five
years
ago
baltimore
public
officials
were
celebrating
a
drop
in
the
annual
homicide
count
below
this
year
that
marker
was
crossed
in
august
the
latest
crime
wave
in
a
number
of
cities
baltimore
chicago
milwaukee
and
washington
to
name
a
few
has
prompted
deeper
soul
searching
deteriorating
police
community
relations
have
been
blamed
for
a
sharp
increase
in
shootings
and
homicides
as
have
gang
conflicts
and
entrenched
societal
ills
such
as
segregation
poverty
and
joblessness
but
one
often
overlooked
trend
has
been
consistent
over
the
years
the
sun
analysis
found
lethal
force
has
become
more
so
in
baltimore
where
there
were
nearly
shootings
last
year
a
one
in
four
lethality
rate
means
about
victims
die
a
one
in
three
rate
means
more
than
people
die
so
even
if
shootings
subside
the
number
of
gun
deaths
remains
elevated
on
the
streets
particularly
in
poor
black
neighborhoods
residents
are
witnessing
increasingly
deadly
tactics
more
shooters
are
aiming
for
the
head
and
firing
multiple
rounds
into
victims
the
number
of
fatal
head
shots
in
the
city
rose
steadily
from
about
percent
two
decades
ago
to
percent
last
year
meanwhile
the
number
of
cadavers
with
or
more
bullets
more
than
doubled
in
the
past
decade
according
to
the
maryland
medical
examiner
s
office
which
tallied
the
bullet
wounds
at
the
request
of
the
sun
now
roughly
two
thirds
of
city
homicide
victims
are
either
shot
in
the
head
or
multiple
times
many
suffer
both
fates
guns
have
also
become
more
deadly
as
the
weapon
of
choice
for
criminals
and
then
law
enforcement
shifted
from
the
revolver
to
the
semiautomatic
pistol
which
can
fire
more
bullets
without
reloading
nationally
the
number
of
mm
and
caliber
guns
taken
off
the
streets
surged
during
the
past
four
years
as
seizures
of
less
powerful
caliber
guns
remained
relatively
flat
in
maryland
seizures
of
mm
handguns
overtook
caliber
guns
for
the
first
time
last
year
most
were
recovered
from
baltimore
s
streets
where
the
saying
goes
buy
every
gun
that
comes
through
don
t
let
it
be
the
gun
that
kills
you
many
of
the
guns
are
equipped
with
extended
magazines
allowing
a
shooter
to
fire
from
a
distance
and
walk
down
a
victim
continuously
firing
the
sale
of
extendos
with
more
than
rounds
is
banned
in
maryland
where
they
are
prized
in
street
cultures

and
into

as
a
reminder
of
the
firepower
out
there
law

officials
across
the
country

they
ve
observed
insidious
circumstances
that
are

justice
and
contract
killers
gang
rules
that
codify
when
violence
should
be
used
and
street
rules
limiting
violence
against

being
ignored
the
criminals
are
more
brazen
said
baltimore
police
maj
donald
bauer
who
leads
the
homicide
unit
while
shooters
motives
vary
experts
and
those
caught
in
the
crossfire
note
a
ruthlessness
on
the
streets
where
criminals
with
more
sophisticated
weaponry
aren
t
just
using
guns
to
intimidate
rivals
or
rob
they
are
using
them
to
take
people
out
with
greater
success
in
baltimore
and
other
cities
with
a
deeply
entrenched
no
snitching
ethos
the
emphasis
is
on
leaving
behind
no
witnesses
and
no
one
to
retaliate
it
s
very
common
for
someone
to
walk
up
and
empty
a
pistol
at
close
range
said
criminologist
david
m
kennedy
describing
the
extreme
hold
that
gangs
and
drug
crews
have
in
cities
like
baltimore
washington
and
new
orleans
it
s
going
in
with
a
heightened
intent
to
actually
kill
you
those
same
criminals
have
honed
strategies
to
keep
weapons
at
the
ready
guns
are
stashed
in
trash
cans
hung
from
gutter
grates
by
string
and
stashed
in
other
nooks
where
they
can
be
quickly
recovered
when
needed
covington
says
he
kept
part
of
his
arsenal
under
an
apartment
complex
s
washing
machine
or
people
serve
as
human
holsters
carrying
guns
for
felons
according
to
milwaukee
police
chief
edward
a
flynn
and
in
baltimore
hit
men
for
hire
have
become
fixtures
on
the
streets
police
recently
began
tracking
the
so
called
grand
club
an
organized
gang
of
hit
men
willing
to
kill
for
that
price
and
prosecutors
say
that
s
double
the
typical
fee
covington
became
a
contract
killer
but
also
says
he
killed
out
of
friendship
for
free
if
a
woman
approached
him
about
taking
out
her
rapist
or
her
child
s
molester
not
even
decades
of
advancements
in
trauma
medicine
can
stem
the
carnage
even
as
patients
with
major
injuries
from
other
assaults
and
car
accidents
have
seen
their
chances
improve
dramatically
gunshot
victims
have
watched
their
chances
of
survival
plummet
studies
by
hospitals
and
trauma
centers
across
the
country
including
baltimore
s
top
ranked
medical
systems
have
documented
this
contrarian
trend
we
feel
this
represents
a
true
change
in
violence
intensity
researchers
with
the
johns
hopkins
medical
institutions
concluded
a
decade
ago
doctors
say
it
has
gotten
worse
since
then
this
has
left
communities
nationwide
reeling
with
violence
concentrated
in
traumatized
neighborhoods
where
mothers
are
forming
support
groups
not
only
to
help
each
other
cope
but
in
a
desperate
search
for
ways
to
stop
the
killing
a
nationwide
network
of
grief
is
starting
to
take
shape
with
more
support
groups
banding
together
and
becoming
politically
active
we
re
all
facing
similar
dynamics
said
corneilius
scott
who
volunteers
as
executive
director
of

of

sons
and

united
in
baltimore
there
s
a
lot
of
concern
and
not
many
answers
at
the
group
s
meetings
parents
are
talking
about
sensitizing
young
men
to
the
effects
of
violence
they
believe
and
social
science
is
finding
that
their
boys
need
to
be
taught
empathy
lest
they
become
trapped
in
a
cycle
repeatedly
exposed
to
violence
and
becoming
more
likely
to
commit
it
more

bigger
bullets
rodney
chase
sensed
trouble
when
three
young
men
approached
him
on
gay
street
in
baltimore
but
he
didn
t
run
saying
he
s
not
the
kind
to
back
down
from
anyone
one
of
the
men
pulled
a
gun
they
wanted
his
nfl
starter
jacket
his
wallet
anything
of
value
as
chase
took
off
his
jacket
one
of
the
men
tried
to
yank
it
off
and
chase
instinctively
hit
him
the
gunman
fired
into
chase
s
belly
and
chase
felt
as
if
hot
grease
had
been
thrown
at
him
a
woman
nearby
screamed
and
called
an
ambulance
he
underwent
surgery
doctors
put
a
screen
under
his
skin
to
hold
in
his
organs
he
wasn
t
discharged
for
nearly
two
months
that
was
more
than
two
decades
ago
had
he
been
shot
today
with
the
kinds
of
guns
prevalent
on
baltimore
s
streets
he
believes
he
d
be
dead

it
was

recently

slicing
down
the

his

i
m
grateful
for
that
if
it
was
bigger
i
d
be
done
he
knows
baltimore
s
streets
because
that
s
where
he
s
spent
most
of
his
life
he
was
a
drug
addict
living
in
an
abandoned
house
when
he
was
seriously
injured
in
a
knife
attack
and
ended
up
at
the
university
of
maryland
shock
trauma
center
nearly
a
year
ago
he
also
was
admitted
into
a
hospital
program
that
connects
patients
with
social
services
in
hopes
of
reducing
the
recidivism
of
violence
i
call
it
clip
city
chase
said
of
baltimore
and
the
proliferation
of
guns
what
they
got
now
they
re
death
dealers
and
it
s
not
hard
to
get
em
gun
production
in
the
u
s
set
a
blistering
pace
beginning
in
through
the
latest
years
for
which
data
is
available
doubling
and
sometimes
tripling
the
annual
manufacturing
reported
in
the
previous
years
moreover
guns
sold
now
are
more
powerful
higher
caliber
weapons
that
come
with
larger
magazines
and
discharge
bullets
with
more
force
all
of
these
factors
over
the
last
several
decades
have
progressed
said
jay
wachtel
a
year
agent
of
the
bureau
of
alcohol
tobacco
firearms
and
explosives
who
lectures
at
california
state
university
fullerton
that
has
led
to
what
he
called
an
incredible
increase
in
the
lethality
of
guns
even
an
inexperienced
shooter
wachtel
said
can
do
a
lot
of
damage
with
a
high
caliber
semiautomatic
gun
you
don
t
need
to
be
a
very
good
shot
because
any
organs
nearby
are
going
to
be
pulverized
he
said
eventually
many
of
the
newer
models
end
up
on
the
streets
despite
laws
aimed
at
keeping
guns
out
of
the
hands
of
felons
law
enforcement
officials
nationwide
say
they
have
noticed
an
increase
in
the
quality
of
guns
wielded
by
criminals
all
the
cheap
guns
made
in
the
s
have
either
quit
functioning
or
have
been
recovered
by

said
los

homicide
detective
john

the
protagonist
in
the
best
selling
book
ghettoside
who
has
closed
nearly
all
of
the
homicide
cases
he
s
handled
they
seem
to
all
be
expensive
and
high
quality
now
in
milwaukee
police
are
tracking
this
trend
a
decade
ago
the
top
guns
seized
by
police
were
a
gauge
shotgun
and
pistols
that
cost
less
than
with
standard
eight
bullet
magazines
this
year
the
most
seized
guns
were
caliber
and
mm
handguns
that
cost
more
than
and
come
with
magazines
that
hold
nine
to
bullets
flynn
milwaukee
s
police
chief
said
most
of
the
guns
used
in
crime
nearly
percent
are
bought
not
stolen
he
blamed
straw
purchases
in
which
people
purchase
guns
for
others
who
wouldn
t
pass
a
background
check
the
gun
of
choice
of
street
offenders
has
shifted
over
time
to
higher
quality
higher
caliber
of
semiautomatic
pistols
said
kennedy
the
criminologist
who
directs
the
national
network
for
safe
communities
a
project
of
the
john
jay
college
of
criminal
justice
in

city
since
those
are
the
guns
that
gangs
and
drug

offenders
are
more
likely
to
have
they
re
more
likely
to
kill
somebody
he
said
in
baltimore
gun
seizures
this
year
have
already
surpassed
last
year
s
total
by
more
than
percent
the
once
ubiquitous
saturday
night
specials
cheaply
made
or
caliber
handguns
that
were
banned
for
a
time
in

are
no
longer
as
prevalent
now
mm
guns
are
the
top
gun
seized
by
police
and
a
glock
caliber
was
most
often
used
in
crimes
last

those

are
capable
of
firing
a

nearly
twice

for
when

this

they
make
up
a

but
take
part
in
an
outsized
share
of
the

in
the
first
three
months
of
this
year
about
three
quarters
of

were
already
on

a

people
land

in

said
brandford
who

two

in

these

stay
in
these

they
really
don

travel
very
far
and
the
opportunity
to
get
close
and
do
some
damage
is
prevalent
in
some
of
these
neighborhoods
police
say
a
common
tactic
shooters
use
to
gain
proximity
is
to
work
with
an
accomplice
who
knows
the
target
the
accomplice
lures
the
target
to
an
area
putting
the
person
at

on

that

because

good

he
said
even
police
officers
who
train
and
are
certified
miss
their
targets
more
than
they
hit
them
one
study
put
the
average
hit
rate
for
officers
at
less
than
percent
if
you
re
close
enough
to
a
target
you
could
close
your

and
pull
the
trigger
myers
said
he
estimated
that
range
is
within
three
yards
then
he
said
you
will
hit
your
target
shooters
are
also
reaching
for
high
caliber
guns
with
large
magazines
to
ensure
they
hit
their
mark
according
to
advocates
working
to
stem
the
violence
in
some
neighborhoods
friends
or
drug
crews
pool
money
to
buy
guns
and
they
become
shared
weapons
on
a
given
street
corner
chris
wilson
said
shooters
prefer
long
magazines
as
well
as
hollow
point
bullets
which
expand
upon
impact
causing
greater
tissue
damage
and
blood
loss
the
extendos
which
carry
more
bullets
have
become
an
obsession
in
street
culture
he
said
when
you
get
a
gun
you
got
to
put
an
extended
on
it
you
got
to
that
s
policy
you
got
to

he

in

than
a

shootouts
he
was

former
baltimore
deputy
police
commissioner
jerry
rodriguez
who
spent
the
last
few
years
of
his
law
enforcement
career
in
baltimore
after
more
than
years
with
the
los
angeles
police
department
said
he
was
struck
by
the
level
of
determination
among
killers
in
baltimore
he
noted
the
high
number
of
head
shots
i
think
there
s
a
meaning
behind
that
i
think
there
s
a
purpose
behind
that
he
said
it
s
sending
a
message
but
it
s
also
making
sure
the
outcome
is
what
they
want
rodriguez
who
works
for
a
company
developing
technological
solutions
for
police
departments
said
he
found
a
much
more
personal
type
of
killing
in
baltimore
a
city
of
square
miles
compared
to
los
angeles
which
sprawls
over
square
miles
but
even
on
the
west
coast
police
have
noted
a
shift
in
shooting
dynamics
in
los
angeles
gangs
in
the
s
often
carried
out
drive
by
shootings
which
could
be
indiscriminate
and
ineffective
if
the
intent
was
to
kill
someone
in
particular
in
the
last
decade
police
said
they
ve
been
getting
out
of
the
car
you
want
to
kill
em
not
wing
em
said
lapd
homicide
detective
chris
barling
describing
the
mentality
of
shooters
police
also
note
an
almost
cavalier
attitude
among
killers
in
baltimore
a
gunman
caught
on
video
burst
into
a
barbershop
in
and
pulled
the
trigger
but
his
weapon
jammed
so
he
briefly
took
a
step
back
fixed
it
and
took
aim
again
a
gunman
who
had
just
shot
a
man
in
the
head
late
last
year
did
a
three
point
turn
in
his
car
with
a
nonchalance
noted
by
davis
the
police
commissioner
who
said
he
took
his
time
and
drove
away
like
it
was
nobody
s
business
covington
who
said
in
a
series
of
jailhouse
interviews
with
the
sun
that
he
killed
or
people
and
helped
in
a
couple
of
other
hits
explained
that
he
believes
the
majority
of
them
deserved
to
die
they
were
drug
dealers
criminals
people
just
like
me
he
said
he
does
say
that
he
wishes
he
hadn
t
targeted
one
young
victim
a
teenager
but
generally
speaking
i
never
really
think
about
it
he
said
hit
men
for
hire
in
the
murphy

public
housing
project
in
west
baltimore
which
has
since
been
demolished
covington
grew
up
on
the
floor
above
solothal
itchy
man
thomas
one
of
the
city
s
most
notorious
hit
men
covington
said
he
regularly
saw
people
shot
beaten
killed
he
was
or
when
he
saw
a
man
he
only
knew
as
country
dave
shot
to
death
at
the
corner
of
west
lafayette
and
argyle
avenues
dave
had
been
a
friend
who
gave
kids
in
the
neighborhood
dollars
to
buy
snacks
at
the
corner
market
but
covington
didn
t
turn
away
from
the
streets
despite
dreams
of
becoming
a
boxer
or
an
orioles
baseball
player
like
cal
ripken
jr
instead
he
sized
up
one
of
two
paths
available
to
him
and
other
teens
in
his
neighborhood
drug
dealing
or
becoming
a
cowboy
someone
who
robs
drug
dealers
he
chose
cowboy
covington
now
and
incarcerated
in
westover
md
can
t
recall
whether
the
man
shot
on
his
first
shooting
caper
survived
but
said
he
could
have
gone
to
jail
for
his
involvement
as
a
teen
his
neighborhood
fame
grew
i
had
grown
men
scared
of
me
and
as
a
man
he
shifted
from
random
violence
to
targeted
murderousness
he
was
paid
to
kill
he
once
charged
as
much
as
he
says
but
that
was
a
package
deal
he
says
that
he
has
worked
in
maryland
virginia
west
virginia
and
ohio
covington
declined
to
give
details
about
many
of
his
crimes
baltimore
police
have
suspected
his
involvement
in
six
to
homicide
cases
he
pleaded
guilty
to
one
homicide
in
baltimore
county
he
also
pleaded
guilty
to
his
role
in
two
other
homicides
in
the
city
but
received
no
additional
time
in
exchange
for
his
testimony
against
a
co
defendant
he
has
been
acquitted
in
another
homicide
and
in
one
shooting
he
was
the
guy
that
would
kill
people
for
money
plain
and
simple
that
s
how
he
made
a
living
said
baltimore
homicide
detective
frank
miller
adding
that
covington
was
part
of
a
clique
of
gunmen
who
took
murder
for
hire
contracts
and
robbed
drug
dealers
there
s
been
several
guys
over
the
years
that
we
ve
encountered
that
was
their
thing
covington
joined
the
black
guerrilla
family
and
intimidated
witnesses
for
the
gang
he
said
inmates
held
on
homicide
charges
would
call
and
ask
him
to
visit
witnesses
in
their
cases
being
a
friend
i
take
friendship
very
seriously
he
would
oblige
sometimes
he
didn
t
have
to
say
a
word
he
would
smell
their
fear
see
the
sweat
rolling
down
faces
other
times
he
had
to
say
some
pretty
hard
and
nasty
words
to
make
them
think
twice
about
testifying
i
don
t
want
to
say
witness
tampering
but
in
hindsight
it
s
sort
of
what
it
was
covington
said
the
baltimore
police
department
has
long
struggled
with
closing
homicide
cases
because
investigations
are
often
stymied
by
a
lack
of
cooperation
from
witnesses
so
far
this
year
police
have
only
closed
percent
of
homicide
cases
as
a
killer
covington
says
he
took
steps
to
evade
capture
he
wore
a
ski
mask
and
gloves
unless
he
planned
to
shoot
a
victim
when
they
were
alone
in
the
woods
or
in
a
house
he
knew
they
wouldn
t
survive
to
identify
him
he
lured
victims
to
him
so
that
he
could
control
the
environment
covington
who
now
says
he
wants
to
help
young
people
avoid
the
life
he
chose
was
part
of
an
insidious
underground
world
of
hit
men
for
hire
in
baltimore
police
say
these
shooters
commit
an
outsized
number
of
homicides
in
the
city
they
embody
an
intent
to
kill
that
s
ingrained
in
the
city
s
street
culture
in
some
cases
federal
authorities
suspect
a
single
hit
man
in
more
than
homicides
going
back
decades
in
recent
months
police
said
they
have
been
tracking
the
grand
club
an
organization
of
hit
men
officers
said
they
learned
about
the
club
from
confidential
informants
but
didn
t
want
to
jeopardize
investigations
by
releasing
more
information
it
s
not
hard
to
shop
around
for
a
murder
for
hire
said
assistant
u
s
attorney
jim
warwick
who
has
prosecuted
a
number
of
hit
men
in
the
city
they
will
do
it
very
quickly
with
no
thought
involved
they
just
need
the
money
the
weapon
preferably
a
photograph
of
the
person
if
they
don
t
know
the
person
and
where
the
person
can
be
found
the
typical
fee
for
a
hit
in
baltimore
is
which
may
be
split
between
trusted
accomplices
and
subcontracted
shooters
the
hit
man
may
call
into
action
warwick
said
some
hit
men
have
grown
savvy
over
the
years
and
begun
to
recruit
younger
violent
and
cold
blooded
individuals
to
do
the
job
for
them
he
said
they
are
hired
to
settle
an
outstanding
drug
debt
to
kill
a
woman
owed
child
support
or
to
get
back
at
someone
who
was
perceived
to
be
disrespectful
they
typically
aim
for
the
head
or
fire
into
their
victims
repeatedly
warwick
said
witnesses
are
considered
collateral
damage
the
hit
man
will
kill
whoever
is
with
the
target
as
well
warwick
said
they
re
expected
to
finish
the
job

with
its
sprawling
connections
to
victims
shooters
and
the
bgf
to
be
her
life
s
work
taylor
said
they
are
suspected
in
connection
with
four
to
five
dozen
shootings
often
working
in
tandem
to
lure
victims
and
then
ambush
them
fenner

jones
lawyer

denied
that
his

and

were
hit
men
he
said
they
were
broke
he
questioned
whether

they
committed
multiple
murders

he
hasn
t
seen
it
both

said
miller
who
investigated
covington
pat
brown
a
criminal
profiler
in
maryland
said
shooters
often
develop
an
attachment
disorder
during
troubled
childhoods
so
that
they
have
difficulty
forming
long
term
relationships
and
often
fail
to
develop
a
conscience
they
often
witness
death
and
violence
becoming
numb
to
it
it
becomes
a
survival
of
the
fittest
and
you
lose
empathy
for
others
brown
said
they
see
people
as
tools
objects
and
things
baltimore
streets
breed
this
kind
of
mindset
she
said
it
has
gotten
out
of
control
with
the
lawlessness
and
hopelessness
at
age
hunter
witnessed
a
man
shot
in
the

hunter
would

schneider
says
this
is
already
happening
to
varying
degrees
in
american
cities
and
places
such
as
vancouver

trial
policing
as
an
apparatus
is
going
to
be
much
more
mediated
and
it
s
going
to
be
much
more
community
oriented
than
it
currently
is
through

through

schneider
says

the

between

the

they

has
already
expanded
beyond

ritesh
kotak
a
police
consultant
for
agencies
in
canada
and
overseas
said
tools
such
as
social
media
have
created
space
for
the
co
creating
of
public
safety
with
new
and
convenient
avenues
to
report
crimes
and
follow
police
data
shared
over
the

that
s
where
it
s
headed
with
next
generation
that
s
where
it
s
headed
with
the
ability
to
see
something
and
communicate
right
through
our
smartphones
with

kotak
said
data
is
the
currency
of
the
future
with
an
open
data
mentality
and
deeper
engagement
through
social

kotak
added
police

engender
trust

the

they

can
also
be
used
for
more
futuristic
means
ryan
prox
a
special
constable
with
the
vancouver
police
department
is
one
of
the
pre
eminent
experts
in
the
emerging
field
of
predictive
policing
prox
prefers
to
call
it
crime
forecasting
in
which
police
forces
use
complex
computer
programs
that
churn
through
mountains
of
data
to
try
and
predict
when
and
where
future
crimes
will
occur
this
has
yet
to
catch
on
in
full
force
in
canada
but
police
in
cities
such
as
los
angeles
and
miami
have
signed
on
to
predictive
programs
designed
by
companies
such
as
predpol
prox
explains
predpol
uses
three
data
points
time
place
and
type
of
crime
to
draw
up
boundaries
in
which
crimes
are
most
likely
to
occur
then
local
police
patrol
these
areas
in
the
hopes
of
catching
the
bad
guys
prox
cautions
however
that
little
independent
scientific
research
has
been
done
on
these
programs
in
the
u
s
and
suggests
they
may
not
be
as
accurate
as
their
makers
claim
that
s
why
he
s
spearheading
a
six
month
predictive
policing
pilot
project
in
vancouver
which
began
feb
that
uses
an
intricate
software
program
designed
by
a
team
of
mathematicians
and
geospatial
engineers
the
program
sifts
through
crime
data
as
far
back
as
march
including
the
time
place
and
nature
of
an
offence
prox
says
but
it
also
considers
non
crime
factors
such
as
neighbourhood
income
area
traffic
density
locations
of
illicit
graffiti
and
even
wind
speed
to
forecast
the
probability
of
a
future
crime
being
committed
in
the
coming
hours
within
a
metre
radius
of
a
given
location
plainclothes
cops
will
be
dispatched
to
monitor
these
areas
with
uniformed
officers
on
standby
to
make
an
arrest
in
the
event
that
a
crime
is
witnessed
prox
says
tests
have
already
shown
a
to
per
cent
accuracy
rate
for
some
property
crimes
such
as
break
and
enters
which
are
easiest
to
predict
because
they
re
high
frequency
and
often
involve
repeat
offenders
prox
says
the
more
police
use
the
program
the
more
data
they
have
and
the
more
accurate
officials
hope
it
can
become
it
sounds
really
sci
fi
goofy
he
laughs
but
they
basically
call
it
an
artificial
learning
neural
network
that
s
the
mathematical
model
the
endgame
of
such
programs
prox
says
is
maximum
police
efficiency
in
an
era
of
ballooning
police
budgets
now
more
than
billion
a
year
in
toronto
for
example
that
could
be
a
welcome
prospect
but
critics
point
to
controversial
information
gathering
programs
such
as
carding
in
toronto
which
many
argue
disproportionately
target
visible
minorities
to
rely
on
such
practices
to
fuel
computer
software
programs
that
dictate
how
cops
are
deployed
could
entrench
existing
police
biases
schneider
says
are
we
going
to
then
be
criminalizing
certain
people
certain
segments
of
the
population
who
are
the
police
going
to
be
looking
at
he
asks
prox
acknowledges
this
is
a
legitimate
concern
but
says
the
vancouver
police
program
only
considers
data
from
crime
reports
and
other
objective
factors
it
s
generated
by
the
public
rather
than
fuelled
by
the
cops
themselves
others
have
brought
forward
concerns
about
how
predictive
policing
will
affect
individual
rights
brenda
mcphail
director
of
the
canadian
civil
liberties
association
s
privacy
technology
and
surveillance
project
says
the
main
worry
is
that
the
types
of
data
currently
used
to
forecast
crime
will
expand
to
include
more
personal
information
social
media
posts
online
purchase
histories
travel
bookings
or
location
data
from
public
wi
fi
use
this
could
not
only
invade
individual
privacy
it
could
erode
the
presumption
of
innocence
mcphail
adds
citing
court
decisions
in
canada
and
the
u
s
that
have
suggested
it
is
disproportionate
to
comb
through
data
of
many
individuals
to
find
a
single
criminal
the
concern
is
that
it
is
the
thin
edge
of
a
wedge
she
says
before
any
such
programs
are
implemented
we
as
a
society
need
to
compare
the
benefits
with
the
costs
particularly
the
costs
to
our
rights
and
civil
liberties
we
need
to
consider
the
risks
such
worries
go
beyond
crime
forecasting
programs
some
point
to
privacy
issues
in
the
face
of
intensifying
means
of
surveillance
such
as
the
extensive
camera
networks
that
are
used
by
police
in
fresno
calif
where
police
can
monitor
live
feeds
throughout

center
david
lyon
a
queen
s
university
sociologist
and
head
of
the
school
s
surveillance
studies
centre
has
argued
that
people
s
lives
are
being
watched
to
the
point
that
it
already
makes
sense
to
label

western
countries
surveillance
societies
lyon
is
coauthor
of
a
book
on
the
subject
in
which
he
and
his
colleagues
argue
we
re
at
a
historic
turning
point
for
the
expansion
of
surveillance
measures
developments
with
obvious
consequences
for
privacy
and
state
power
much
of
this
can
be
viewed
as
part
of
a
social
shift
toward
a
so
called
safety
state
where
more
and
more
government
policies
and
police
actions
are
justified
through
fear
of
danger
says
charles
raab
a
political
science
professor
at
the
university
of
edinburgh
as
long
as
there
are
some
plausible
reasons
to
think
we
live
in
exceptionally
dangerous
times
such
as
terrorist
attacks
in
big
cities
there
will
be
public
fears
and
demands
for
more
security
and
safety
says
raab
other
values
such
as
equality
fairness
and
the
exercise
of
rights
and
liberties
are
constrained
by
the
imperative
to
make
everything
safe
and
secure
this
isn
t
inevitable
raab
says
but
with
terrorism
and
climate
change
dominating
the
media
and
politicians
routinely
emphasizing
this
danger
in
their
quests
for
votes
safety
will
continue
to
be
a
top
social
priority
and
that
probably
means
the
police
of
tomorrow
will
find
ways
to
use
our
data
and
train
cameras
on
us
in
an

was
unintentional
but
similar
errors
have
emerged
in
nikon
s
camera
software
which
misread
images
of
asian
people
as
blinking
and
in
hewlett
packard
s
web
camera
software
which
had
difficulty
recognizing
people
with
dark
skin
tones
this
is
fundamentally
a
data
problem
algorithms
learn
by
being
fed
certain
images
often
chosen
by
engineers
and
the
system
builds
a
model
of
the
world
based
on
those
images
if
a
system
is
trained
on
photos
of
people
who
are
overwhelmingly
white
it
will
have
a
harder
time
recognizing
nonwhite
faces
a
very
serious
example
was
revealed
in
an
investigation
published
last
month
by
propublica
it
found
that
widely
used
software
that
assessed
the
risk
of
recidivism
in
criminals
was
twice
as
likely
to
mistakenly
flag
black
defendants
as
being
at
a
higher
risk
of
committing
future
crimes
it
was
also
twice
as
likely
to
incorrectly
flag
white
defendants
as
low
risk
the
reason
those
predictions
are
so
skewed
is
still
unknown
because
the
company
responsible
for
these
algorithms
keeps
its
formulas
secret
it
s
proprietary
information
judges
do
rely
on
machine
driven
risk
assessments
in
different
ways
some
may
even
discount
them
entirely
but
there
is
little
they
can
do
to
understand
the
logic
behind
them
police
departments
across
the
united
states
are
also
deploying
data
driven
risk
assessment
tools
in
predictive
policing
crime
prevention
efforts
in
many
cities
including
new
york
los
angeles
chicago
and
miami
software
analyses
of
large
sets
of
historical
crime
data
are
used
to
forecast
where
crime
hot
spots
are
most
likely
to
emerge
the
police
are
then
directed
to
those
areas
at
the
very
least
this
software
risks
perpetuating
an
already
vicious
cycle
in
which
the
police
increase
their
presence
in
the
same
places
they
are
already
policing
or
overpolicing
thus
ensuring
that
more
arrests
come
from
those
areas
in
the
united
states
this
could
result
in
more
surveillance
in
traditionally
poorer
nonwhite
neighborhoods
while
wealthy
whiter
neighborhoods
are
scrutinized
even
less
predictive
programs
are
only
as
good
as
the
data
they
are
trained
on
and
that
data
has
a
complex
history
histories
of
discrimination
can
live
on
in
digital
platforms
and
if
they
go
unquestioned
they
become
part
of
the
logic
of
everyday
algorithmic
systems
another
scandal
emerged
recently
when
it
was
revealed
that
amazon
s
same
day
delivery
service
was
unavailable
for
zip
codes
in
predominantly
black
neighborhoods
the
areas
overlooked
were
remarkably
similar
to
those
affected
by
mortgage
redlining
in
the
mid
th
century
amazon
promised
to
redress
the
gaps
but
it
reminds
us
how
systemic
inequality
can
haunt
machine
intelligence
and
then
there
s
gender
discrimination
last
july
computer
scientists
at
carnegie
mellon
university
found
that
women
were
less
likely
than
men
to
be
shown
ads
on
google
for
highly
paid
jobs
the
complexity
of
how
search
engines
show
ads
to
internet
users
makes
it
hard
to
say
why
this
happened
whether
the
advertisers
preferred
showing
the
ads
to
men
or
the
outcome
was
an
unintended
consequence
of
the
algorithms
involved
regardless
algorithmic
flaws
aren
t
easily
discoverable
how
would
a
woman
know
to
apply
for
a
job
she
never
saw
advertised
how
might
a
black
community
learn
that
it
were
being
overpoliced
by
software
we
need
to
be
vigilant
about
how
we
design
and
train
these
machine
learning
systems
or
we
will
see
ingrained
forms
of
bias
built
into
the
artificial
intelligence
of
the
future
like
all
technologies
before
it
artificial
intelligence
will
reflect
the
values
of
its
creators
so
inclusivity
matters
from
who
designs
it
to
who
sits
on
the
company
boards
and
which
ethical
perspectives
are
included
otherwise
we
risk
constructing
machine
intelligence
that
mirrors
a
narrow
and
privileged
vision
of
society
with
its
old
familiar
biases
and
stereotypes
if
we
look
at
how
systems
can
be
discriminatory
now
we
will
be
much
better
placed
to
design
fairer
artificial
intelligence
but
that
requires
far
more
accountability
from
the
tech
community
governments
and
public
institutions
can
do
their
part
as
well
as
they
invest
in
predictive
technologies
they
need
to
commit
to
fairness
and
due
process
while
machine
learning
technology
can
offer
unexpected
insights
and
new
forms
of
convenience
we
must
address
the
current
implications
for
communities
that
have
less
power
for
those
who
aren
t
dominant
in
elite
silicon
valley
circles
currently
the
loudest
voices
debating
the
potential
dangers
of
superintelligence
are
affluent
white
men
and
perhaps
for
them
the
biggest
threat
is
the
rise
of
an
artificially
intelligent
apex
predator
but
for
those
who
already
face
marginalization
or

policing
the

on
which

has
been
widely
researched

performs

in

the
commercial
version
dubbed
brain

is
dogged
by
claims
that
its

a
harvard

neuroscientist
has
oversold
it
and
even
if

legal

are
worried
that

the

in

relatively
uncontroversial
with

that
has
chalked
up
over
a

the

it

from

some

say
catch
lies
with
an
accuracy
little

because

whether

not
rely

really
took
off
with
the
release
of
a
study
that
had

students

jihadist
for
a

the

were
asked
to
hatch
a
mock

plot
by
selecting
one
of
four
dates
in
july
one
of
four
locations
in

and
one
of
four
types
of
bomb
then
jot
it
all
down
in

they
were
later
shown

and
varieties
of
terror
attack
on
a
computer
and
when
july
houston
and
bomb
appeared
among
them
the
p
spikes
were
big
enough
to
nab
all
culprits
but
while
the
results
were
promising
they
didn
t
provide
the
fine
grained
detail
needed
to
foil
an
actual
terror
strike
however
professor
peter
rosenfeld
from
the
department
of
psychology
at
northwestern
university
a
co
author
on
the
study
says
recent
research
shows
a
related
technique
called
searching
cit
might
narrow
things
down
if
for
example
authorities
know
houston
is
the
target
they
could
show
suspects
a
map
of
the
city
divide
it
into
quadrants
then
sequentially
ask
if
the
attack
were
planned
in
each
when
they
recognise
the
quadrant
they
ll
show
the
biggest
p
then
you
take
that
quadrant
and
break
it
down
into
quadrants
and
so
on
until
you
get
it
down
to
a
specific
neighbourhood
says
rosenfeld
who
has
been
studying
this
field
for
decades
but
there
s
a
further
obstacle
to
its
adoption
by
justice
departments
if
p
results
are
to
be
admitted
as
evidence
in
a
us
court
they
must
satisfy
the
daubert
standard
which
demands
not
just
scientific
credibility
in
the
lab
but
also
a
known
error
rate
in
the
field
after
years
of
arm
twisting
rosenfeld
is
on
the
cusp
of
running
a
study
at
a
major
united
states
airport
that
will
step
baggage
handlers
off
the
line
and
ask
them
to
load
pistols
into
a
distinctive
suitcase
aviation
authorities
have
been
understandably
reluctant
to
take
part
then
they
ll
use
the
p
to
see
if
the
suitcase
presented
on
a
computer
screen
with
a
duffle
bag
attache
case

and
other
assorted

spike
law
enforcement
agencies
will
be
watching
the
results
intently
as
the
pressure
mounts
to
thwart
terrorism
at
the
planning
stage
fuelled
by
the
recent
attacks
in
paris
brussels
and
lahore
and
tougher
australian
terror
laws
are
likely
to
impel
police
deeper
into
the
world
of
pre
crime
and
this
emerging
technology
it
is
already
an
offence
to
plan
or
prepare
for
a
terrorist
act
even
if
the
act
never
happens
and
legislation
passed
by
the
nsw
government
in
may
extends
the
time
a
suspected
terrorist
can
be
held
without
charge
from
four
to
days
with
the
approval
of
a
judge
each
state
and
territory
has
separate
laws
allowing
police
to
hold
terror
suspects
for
up
to
days
under
a
preventative
detention
order
pdo
but
the
february
review
of
commonwealth
counter

laws
recommends
ditching
the
requirement
that
any

be
deemed
imminent
likely
to
happen
within
days
before
a
pdo
can
be
issued
in
this
new
world
of
preventive

prospect
of
a
little
scientific
help

tantalising
enter
brain
fingerprinting
a
variant
of
the
p
test
called
p
mermer
that
swaps
bathing
caps
for
sleek
headsets
and
has
been
commercially
available
in
australia
for
months
through
the
biometrics
company
fingerscan
fingerscan
general
manager
peter
ives
says
brain
fingerprinting
has
been
demonstrated
to
the
nsw
and
queensland
police
forces
and
to
agencies
involved
with
counter
terrorism
but
without
their
consent
he
is
not
prepared
to
comment
on
their
responses
the
p
mermer
patent
holder
is
dr
larry
farwell
a
harvard
graduate
with
a
doctorate
in
biological
psychology
who
was
nominated
by
time
magazine
in
as
one
of
innovators
who
may
be
the
picassos
or
the
einsteins
of
the
st
century
like
rosenfeld
farwell
has
researched
in
the
field
for
decades
but
farwell
s
p
mermer
has
made
it
into
the
courtroom
in
a
cold
case
where
a
suspected
murderer
was
ultimately
convicted
and
in
a
separate
case
where
a
person
wrongly
convicted
of
murder
was
exonerated
however
the
degree
to
which
p
mermer
evidence
was
relied
upon
and
whether
it
was
definitively
ruled
admissible
is
unclear
and
farwell
s
version
of
the
p
test
has
its
detractors
who
dispute
that
the
p
mermer
differs
sufficiently
from
the
standard
test
to
warrant
claims
of
near
infallibility
a
article
in
cognitive
neurodynamics
criticised
small
sample
sizes
and
a
paucity
of
peer
review
in
studies
cited
by
farwell
to
support
his
claim
that
brain
fingerprinting
is
per
cent
accurate
those
authors
said
farwell
s
finding
of
per
cent
accuracy
stands
in
sharp
contrast
with
the
available
literature
and
concluded
he
was
misleading
and
misrepresents
the
scientific
status
of
brain
fingerprinting
technology
farwell
vigorously
rejected
those
charges
in
the
same
journal
and
in
an
email
to
fairfax
media
says
peer
reviewed
published
research
at
the
fbi
cia
and
us
navy
has
shown
that
all
studies
that
meet
the
brain
fingerprinting
scientific
standards
have
produced
less
than
per
cent
error
rate
in
fact
per

error
rate
per

accuracy
but
while
the
role
of
p
in

or
pre

fighting
awaits
the
due
diligence
of
authorities
other
technologies
are
firming
in
the
race
to

dr
jesse
rissman
assistant
professor
at
the
integrative

for

and
memory
at
the
university
of
california
los
angeles
published
a
study
in
april
that
used
mri
scans
to
similarly
detect
recognition
of
recent
events
participants
wore
a
small
digital
camera
around
the
neck
that
was
programmed
to
snap
thousands
of
shots
of
everyday
life
for
three
weeks
studying
eating
out
hiking
and
sports
there
was
an

for

at

end
subjects
were
put
in
an

and
shown
their
own
snapshots
interspersed
with
photos
from
the
lives
of
other
participants
as
people
twigged
to
their
own
life
shots
the
mri
lit
up
with
a
distinctive
neural
signature
of
recognition
that
was
accurate
to
near
perfection
some
might
take
results
like
ours
to
indicate
that
mri
scans
could
soon
be
used
as
a
forensic
tool
to
detect
whether
any
individual
including
people
who
might
be
engaged
in
criminal
think
of

it

rissman
says
indeed
us
company
no

mri
claims
its
brain
scan
technology
is
able
to
objectively
measure
intent
prior
knowledge
and
deception
with
an
accuracy
of
per

rissman
is
cautious
however
pointing
out
that
canny
folk
can
forge
a
neural
signature
of
non
recognition
if
so
inclined
he
co
authored
a
study
that
got
subjects
to
game
the
system
when
looking
at
photos
of
faces
they
recognised
by
training
their
attention
on
the
picture
s
technical
features
such
as
the
exposure
lighting
and
line
edges
the
mri
brain
signature
of
recognition
was
duly
wiped
leaving
the
door
ajar
for
shrewd
operators
to
evade
the
test
in
the
real
world
just
as
people
can
deceive
existing
lie
detectors
but
smoothing
technical
glitches
might
not
be
the
biggest
challenge
for
predictive
policing
lucia
zedner
co
author
of
the
book
preventive
justice
and
professor
in
the
law
faculties
of
the
university
of
oxford
and
unsw
argues
that
crime
detection
with
this
type
of
technology
may
threaten
the
very
tenets
of
our
criminal
justice
system
she
says
the
law
has
recognised
various
incarnations
of
pre
crime
for
some
time
attempts
incitement
and
conspiracy
to
commit
a
crime
are
all
offences
even
if
the
crime
never
happens
nonetheless
she
says
these
each
involve
a
clear
act
of
planning
but
some
terrorism
laws
shift
the
offence
to
the
earlier
fuzzier
pre
crime
phase
of
preparation
with
the
aim
of
heading
off
terrorism
further
up
the
field
while
p
cannot
measure
intent
or
ascribe
guilt
on
its
own
it
is
conceivable
that
preparation
might
one
day
be
inferred
from
brain
data
such
as
a
p
spike
of
recognition
to
an
ied
how
to
guide
but
zedner
has
a
big
problem
with
any
scenario
that
criminalises
thoughts
alone

nonetheless
she
says
these
each
involve

some

shift
the

to

policing
the

on

has
been
widely
researched
and
performs
well
in

the
commercial
version
dubbed
brain

is
dogged
by
claims
that
its

creator
a

neuroscientist
has
oversold
it
and
even
if

legal

are
worried
that

on
the

s
findings
could
threaten
the
very

of

the
basic
technique
is
in

relatively
uncontroversial
with
a
scientific
pedigree
that
has
chalked
up
over
a
thousand
peer

articles
the
p
concealed

test
uses
eeg
to
measure
brain

with
headgear
reminiscent
of
one
of

floral

it

roughly

later
in

of

fears
of

and
the
difficulty
of

lone
wolves
and
covertly
radicalised

it
s
not
hard
to
see
why
p
has
law
enforcement
all
a
quiver
say
john
or
jane
doe
has
been
scrolling

titled
how

is
invited

at

plod

plod
could
apply
the

sit
doe
in

of
a

show
him
or
her
the
terror
title
among
irrelevant
others
such
as
how
to
avoid
huge
ships
or
why
cats
paint
unless
doe
has
very
niche
literary
tastes
the
ied
guide
should
provoke
a
distinctive
peak
the
p
test
differs
from
traditional
question
and
answer
lie
detection
in
that
it
doesn
t
rely
on
the
fight
or
flight
nervous
system
to
moisten
palms
and
quicken
pulses
signs
some
experts
say
catch
lies
with
an
accuracy
little
better
than
chance
and
because
eeg
independently
detects
whether
a
suspect
recognises
dubious
material
p
does
not
rely
on
reluctant
people
answering
questions
they
would
rather
not
answer
but
its
potential
as
a
conduit
to
the
nefarious
plans
of
would
be
terrorists
really
took
off
with
the
release
of
a
study
that
had
psychology
students
turn
jihadist
for
a
day
the
faux
insurgents
were
asked
to
hatch
a
mock

plot
by
selecting
one
of
four
dates
in
july
one
of
four
locations
in
houston
and
one
of
four
types
of
bomb
then
jot
it
all
down
in
a

to
their

they
were

a

us
cities
and
varieties
of
terror
attack
on

computer
and
when
july
houston
and
bomb
appeared
among
them
the
p
spikes
were
big
enough
to
nab
all
culprits
but
while
the
results
were
promising
they
didn
t
provide
the
fine
grained
detail
needed
to
foil
an
actual
terror
strike
however
professor
peter
rosenfeld
from
the
department
of
psychology
at
northwestern
university
a
co
author
on
the
study
says
recent
research
shows
a
related
technique
called
searching
cit
might
narrow
things
down
if
for
example
authorities
know
houston
is
the
target
they
could
show
suspects
a
map
of
the
city
divide
it
into
quadrants
then
sequentially
ask
if
the
attack
were
planned
in
each
when
they
recognise
the
quadrant
they
ll
show
the
biggest
p
then
you
take
that
quadrant
and
break
it
down
into
quadrants
and
so
on
until
you
get
it
down
to
a
specific
neighbourhood
says
rosenfeld
but
there
s
a
further
obstacle
to
its
adoption
by
justice
departments
if
p
results
are
to
be
admitted
as
evidence
in
a
us
court
they
must
satisfy
the
daubert
standard
which
demands
not
just
scientific
credibility
in
the
lab
but
also
a
known
error
rate
in
the
field
after
years
of
arm
twisting
rosenfeld
is
on
the
cusp
of
running
a
study
at
a
major
united
states
airport
that
will
step
baggage
handlers
off
the
line
and
ask
them
to
load
pistols
into
a
distinctive
suitcase
aviation
authorities
have
been
understandably
reluctant
to
take
part
then
they
ll
use
the
p
to
see
if
the
suitcase
presented
on
a

screen
with
a
duffle
bag
attach

law

agencies
will
be
watching
the
results
intently
as
the
pressure
mounts
to
thwart
terrorism
at
the
planning
stage
fuelled
by
the
recent
attacks
in
paris
brussels
and
lahore
and
tougher
australian
terror
laws
are
likely
to
impel
police
deeper
into
the
world
of
pre

and
this
emerging
technology
it
is
already
an
offence
to
plan
or
prepare
for
a
terrorist
act
even
if
the
act
never
happens
and
legislation
passed
by
the
nsw
government
in

extends
the
time
a

can
be
held
without

from
four
to
days
with
the
approval
of
a
judge
each

has
separate

allowing

to

for
up

but
the
february
review
of

ditching
the
requirement
that

to
happen
within

before

be
issued
in
this
new
world
of

of

tantalising
enter
brain
fingerprinting
a
variant
of
the
p
test
called
p
mermer
that
swaps

for

has
been
commercially
available
in

for
months
through
the
biometrics
company
fingerscan
fingerscan
s
general
manager
peter
ives
says
brain
fingerprinting
has
been
demonstrated
to
the
nsw
and
queensland
police
forces
and
to
agencies
involved
with
counter
terrorism
but
without
those
agencies
consent
he
is
not
prepared
to
comment
on
their
responses
the
p
mermer
patent
holder
is
dr
larry
farwell
a
harvard
graduate
with
a
doctorate
in
biological
psychology
who
was
nominated
by

in
as
one
of
innovators
who
may
be
the
picassos
or
the
einsteins
of
the
st
century
like
rosenfeld
farwell
has
researched
in
the
field
for
decades
but
farwell
s
p
mermer
has
made
it
into
the
courtroom
in
a
cold
case
where
a
suspected
murderer
was
ultimately
convicted
and
in
a
separate
case
where
a
person
wrongly
convicted
of
murder
was
exonerated
however
the
degree
to
which
p
mermer
evidence
was
relied
upon
and
whether
it
was
definitively
ruled
admissible
is
unclear
and
farwell
s
version
of
the
test
has
its
detractors
who
dispute
that
his
p
mermer
differs
sufficiently
from
the
standard
test
a
article
in
cognitive
neurodynamics
criticised
small
sample
sizes
and
a
paucity
of
peer
review
in
studies
cited
by
farwell
to
support
his
claim
brain
fingerprinting
is
per
cent
accurate
those
authors
said
farwell
s
finding
of
per
cent
accuracy
stands
in
contrast
with
the
available
literature
and
concluded
he
was
misleading
and
misrepresents
the
scientific
status
of
brain
fingerprinting
technology
farwell
rejected
those
charges
in
the
same
journal
and
in
an
email
to
fairfax
media
says
peer
reviewed
published
research
at
the
fbi
cia
and
us
navy
has
shown
that
all
studies
that
meet
the
brain
fingerprinting
scientific
standards
have
produced
less
than

but
while
the
role

recognised
various
incarnations
of
pre
crime
for
some
time
attempts
incitement
and
conspiracy
to
commit
a
crime
are
all
offences
even
if
the
crime
never
happens
nonetheless
she
says
these
each
involve
an
act
of
planning
but
some
terrorism
laws
shift
the
offence
to
the
earlier
fuzzier
pre
crime
phase
of
preparation
with
the
aim
of
heading
off
terrorism
further
up
the
field
while
p
cannot
measure
intent
or
ascribe
guilt
on
its
own
it
is
conceivable
that
preparation
might
one
day
be
inferred
from
brain
data
such
as
a
p
spike
of
recognition
when

but
zedner
has
a
big
problem
with
any
scenario
that
criminalises
thoughts
alone
where
is
the
harm
i
can
sit
in
my
office
and
think
evil
thoughts
about
people
all
i
like
but
providing
i
do
nothing
about
those
thoughts
there
is
no
harm
says
zedner
and
to
that
extent
the
harm
principle
which
underpins
the
whole
basis
of
criminalisation
is
not
satisfied
the
harm
comes
says
zedner
only
when
the
intent
is
communicated
think
a
text
to
a
terrorist
colleague
with
a
link
to
the
ied
guide
and
then
the
law
has
its
guilty
act
upon
which
criminal
proceedings
might
proceed
she
concedes
however
that
colleagues
argue
the
legal
emphasis
on
communicating
evil
intent
is
not
just
because
spreading
the
word
makes
harm
more
likely
it
has
also
until
now
been
the
only
way
of

a

policing
the

on

has
been
widely
researched
and
performs

in

the

dubbed

dogged
by
claims
that

a

has
oversold

even

legal

worried
that

s

the

is
in

relatively
uncontroversial
with

that
has
chalked
up
over
a

the

uses

with

reminiscent
of
one

later
in

of

of

and
the
difficulty
of

lone

and
covertly

it
s
not
hard
to
see
why
p

all
a
quiver

the

among

or
why

unless

has
very
niche
literary

the

guide
should
provoke
a
distinctive
peak
the
p
test
differs
from
traditional
question
and
answer
lie
detection
in
that
it
doesn
t
rely
on
the
fight
or
flight
nervous
system
to
moisten
palms
and
quicken
pulses
signs
some
experts
say
catch
lies
with
an
accuracy
little
better
than
chance
and
because
eeg
independently
detects
whether
a
suspect
recognises
dubious
material
p
does
not
rely
on
reluctant
people
answering
questions
they
would
rather
not
answer
but
its
potential
as
a
conduit
to
the
nefarious
plans
of
would
be

really
took
off
with
the
release
of
a
study
that
had

students
turn
jihadist
for
a

the

were
asked
to
hatch
a

by
selecting
one
of
four
dates
in

one
of
four
locations
in

one
of

then

it
all
down

when

houston

appeared
among
them
the
p
spikes
were
big
enough
to
nab
all
culprits
but
while
the
results
were
promising
they
didn
t
provide
the
fine
grained
detail
needed
to
foil
an
actual
terror
strike
however
professor
peter
rosenfeld
from
the
department
of
psychology
at
northwestern
university
a
co
author
on
the
study
says
recent
research
shows
a
related
technique
called
searching
cit
might
narrow
things
down
if
for
example
authorities
know
houston
is
the
target
they
could
show
suspects
a
map
of
the
city
divide
it
into
quadrants
then
sequentially
ask
if
the
attack
were
planned
in
each
when
they
recognise
the
quadrant
they
ll
show
the
biggest
p
then
you
take
that
quadrant
and
break
it
down
into
quadrants
and
so
on
until
you
get
it
down
to
a
specific
neighbourhood
says
rosenfeld
but
there
s
a
further
obstacle
to
its
adoption
by
justice
departments
if
p
results
are
to
be
admitted
as
evidence
in
a
us
court
they
must
satisfy
the
daubert
standard
which
demands
not
just
scientific
credibility
in
the
lab
but
also
a
known
error
rate
in
the
field
after
years
of
arm
twisting
rosenfeld
is
on
the
cusp
of
running
a
study
at
a
major
united
states
airport
that
will
step
baggage
handlers
off
the
line
and
ask
them
to
load
pistols
into
a
distinctive
suitcase
aviation
authorities
have
been
understandably
reluctant
to
take
part
then
they
ll
use
the
p
to
see
if
the
suitcase
presented
on
a
computer
screen
with
a
duffle

attach

and
other

generates

spike
law
enforcement
agencies
will
be
watching
the
results
intently
as
the
pressure
mounts
to
thwart
terrorism
at
the
planning
stage
fuelled
by
the
recent
attacks
in
paris
brussels
and
lahore
and
tougher
australian
terror
laws
are
likely
to
impel
police
deeper
into
the
world
of
pre

and
this
emerging
technology
it
is
already
an
offence
to
plan
or
prepare
for
a
terrorist
act
even
if
the
act
never
happens
and
legislation
passed
by
the
nsw
government
in
may
extends
the
time
a
suspected

can
be
held
without

from
four
to

with
the
approval
of
a

each

the

of

ditching
the

that

to

a
variant
of
the

called

brain
fingerprinting
has
been
demonstrated
to
the
new
south
wales
and
queensland
police
forces
and
to
agencies
involved
with
counter
terrorism
but
without
those
agencies
consent
he
is
not
prepared
to
comment
on
their
responses
the
p
mermer
patent
holder
is
dr
larry
farwell
a
harvard

with
a
doctorate
in
biological
psychology
who
was
nominated
by

who
may
be
the
picassos
or
the
einsteins
of
the
st
century
like
rosenfeld
farwell
has
researched
in
the
field
for
decades
but
farwell
s
p
mermer
has
made
it
into
the
courtroom
in
a
cold
case
where
a
suspected
murderer
was
ultimately
convicted
and
in
a
separate
case
where
a
person
wrongly
convicted
of
murder
was
exonerated
however
the
degree
to
which
p
mermer
evidence
was
relied
upon
and
whether
it
was
definitively
ruled
admissible
is
unclear
and
farwell
s
version
of
the
test
has
its
detractors
who
dispute
that
his
p
mermer
differs
sufficiently
from
the
standard
test
a
article
in
cognitive
neurodynamics
criticised
small
sample
sizes
and
a
paucity
of
peer
review
in
studies
cited
by
farwell
to
support
his
claim
brain
fingerprinting
is
per
cent
accurate
those
authors
said
farwell
s
finding
of
per
cent
accuracy
stands
in
contrast
with
the
available
literature
and
concluded
he
was
misleading
and
misrepresents
the
scientific
status
of
brain
fingerprinting
technology
farwell
rejected
those
charges
in
the
same
journal
and
in
an
email
to
the
sunday
age
says
peer
reviewed
published
research
at
the
fbi
cia
and

navy
has
shown
that

while
the

the

rissman
is
cautious
however
pointing
out
that

if
so
inclined
he

ajar

co
author
of
the
book

in
the

faculties
of
the

and
unsw
argues
that
crime
detection
with
this
type
of
technology
may
threaten
the
very
tenets
of
our
criminal
justice
system
she
points
out
that
the
law
has
recognised
various
incarnations
of
pre
crime
for
some
time
attempts
incitement
and
conspiracy
to
commit
a
crime
are
all
offences
even
if
the
crime
never
happens
nonetheless
she
says
these
each
involve
an
act
of
planning
but
some
terrorism
laws
shift
the
offence
to
the
earlier
fuzzier
pre
crime
phase
of
preparation
with
the
aim
of
heading
off
terrorism
further
up
the
field
while
p
cannot
measure
intent
or
ascribe
guilt
on
its
own
it
is
conceivable
that
preparation
might
one
day
be
inferred
from
brain
data
such
as
a
p
spike
of
recognition
when
show
an
ied
how
to

but
zedner
has
a
big
problem
with
any
scenario
that
criminalises
thoughts
alone
where
is
the
harm
i
can
sit
in
my
office
and
think
evil
thoughts
about
people
all
i
like
but
providing
i
do
nothing
about
those
thoughts
there
is
no
harm
says
zedner
and
to
that
extent
the
harm
principle
which
underpins
the
whole
basis
of
criminalisation
is
not
satisfied
the
harm
comes
says
zedner
only
when
the
intent
is
communicated
think
a
text
to
a
terrorist
colleague
with
a
link
to
the
ied
guide
and
then
the
law
has
its
guilty
act
upon
which
criminal
proceedings
might
proceed
she
concedes
however
that
colleagues
argue
the
legal
emphasis
on
communicating
evil
intent
is
not
just
because
spreading
the
word
makes
harm
more
likely
it
has
also

our
world
is
increasingly
shaped
by
biased
algorithms
that
have
been
built
with
little
oversight
according
to
some
prominent
voices
in
the
tech
world
artificial
intelligence
presents
a
looming
existential
threat
to
humanity
warnings
by
luminaries
like
elon
musk
and
nick
bostrom
about
the
singularity
when
machines
become
smarter
than
humans
have
attracted
millions
of
dollars
and
spawned
a
multitude
of
conferences
but
this
hand
wringing
is
a
distraction
from
the
very
real
problems
with
artificial
intelligence
today
which
may
already
be
exacerbating
inequality
in
the
workplace
at
home
and
in
our
legal
and
judicial
systems
sexism
racism
and
other
forms
of
discrimination
are
being
built
into
the
machine
learning
algorithms
that
underlie
the
technology
behind
many
intelligent
systems
that
shape
how
we
are
categorized
and
advertised
to
take
a
small
example
from
last
year
users
discovered
that
google
s
photo
app
which
applies
automatic
labels
to
pictures
in
digital
photo
albums
was
classifying
images
of
black
people
as
gorillas
google
apologized
it
was
unintentional
but
similar
errors
have
emerged
in
nikon
s
camera
software
which
misread
images
of
asian
people
as
blinking
and
in
hewlett
packard
s
web
camera
software
which
had
difficulty
recognizingpeople
with
dark
skin
tones
this
is
fundamentally
a
data
problem
algorithms
learn
by
being
fed
certain
images
often
chosen
by
engineers
and
the
system
builds
a
model
of
the
world
based
on
those
images
if
a
system
is
trained
on
photos
of
people
who
are
overwhelmingly
white
it
will
have
a
harder
time
recognizing
nonwhite
faces
a
very
serious
example
was
revealed
in
an
investigation
published
last
monthby
propublica
it
found
that
widely
used
software
that
assessed
the
risk
of
recidivism
in
criminals
was
twice
as
likely
to
mistakenly
flag
black
defendants
as
being
at
a
higher
risk
of
committing
future
crimes
it
was
also
twice
as
likely
to
incorrectly
flag
white
defendants
as
low
risk
the
reason
those
predictions
are
so
skewed
is
still
unknown
because
the
company
responsible
for
these
algorithms
keeps
its
formulas
secret
it
s
proprietary
information
judges
do
rely
on
machine
driven
risk
assessments
in
different
ways
some
may
even
discount
them
entirely
but
there
is
little
they
can
do
to
understand
the
logic
behind
them
police
departments
across
the
united
states
are
also
deploying
data
driven
risk
assessment
tools
in
predictive
policing
crime
prevention
efforts
in
many
cities
including
new
york
los
angeles
chicago
and
miami
software
analyses
of
large
sets
of
historical
crime
data
are
used
to
forecastwhere
crime
hot
spots
are
most
likely
to
emerge
the
police
are
then
directed
to
those
areas
at
the
very
least
this
software
risks
perpetuating
an
already
vicious
cycle
in
which
the
police
increase
their
presence
in
the
same
places
they
are
already
policing
or
overpolicing
thus
ensuring
that
more
arrests
come
from
those
areas
in
the
united
states
this
could
result
in
more
surveillance
in
traditionally
poorer
nonwhite
neighborhoods
while
wealthy
whiter
neighborhoods
are
scrutinized
even
less
predictive
programs
are
only
as
good
as
the
data
they
are
trained
on
and
that
data
has
a
complex
history
histories
of
discrimination
can
live
on
in
digital
platforms
and
if
they
go
unquestioned
they
become
part
of
the
logic
of
everyday
algorithmic
systems
another
scandal
emerged
recently
when
it
was
revealed
that
amazon
s
same
day
delivery
service
was
unavailable
for
zip
codes
in
predominantly
black
neighborhoods
the
areas
overlooked
were
remarkably
similar
to
those
affected
by
mortgage
redlining
in
the
mid
th
century
amazon
promised
to
redress
the
gaps
but
it
reminds
us
how
systemic
inequality
can
haunt
machine
intelligence
and
then
there
s
gender
discrimination
last
july
computer
scientists
at
carnegie
mellon
university
found
that
women
were
less
likely
than
men
to
be
shown
ads
on
google
for
highly
paid
jobs
the
complexity
of
how
search
engines
show
ads
to
internet
users
makes
it
hard
to
say
why
this
happened
whether
the
advertisers
preferred
showing
the
ads
to
men
or
the
outcome
was
an
unintended
consequence
of
the
algorithms
involved
regardless
algorithmic
flaws
aren
t
easily
discoverable
how
would
a
woman
know
to
apply
for
a
job
she
never
saw
advertised
how
might
a
black
community
learn
that
it
were
being
overpoliced
by
software
we
need
to
be
vigilant
about
how
we
design
and
train
these
machine
learning
systems
or
we
will
see
ingrained
forms
of
bias
built
into
the
artificial
intelligence
of
the
future
like
all
technologies
before
it
artificial
intelligence
will
reflect
the
values
of
its
creators
so
inclusivity
matters
from
who
designs
it
to
who
sits
on
the
company
boards
and
which
ethical
perspectives
are
included
otherwise
we
risk
constructing
machine
intelligence
that
mirrors
a
narrow
and
privileged
vision
of
society
with
its
old
familiar
biases
and
stereotypes
if
we
look
at
how
systems
can
be
discriminatory
now
we
will
be
much
better
placed
to
design
fairer
artificial
intelligence
but
that
requires
far
more
accountability
from
the
tech
community
governments
and
public
institutions
can
do
their
part
as
well
as
they
invest
in
predictive
technologies
they
need
to
commit
to
fairness
and
due
process
while
machine
learning
technology
can
offer
unexpected
insights
and
new
forms
of
convenience
we
must
address
the
current
implications
for
communities
that
have
less
power
for
those
who
aren
t
dominant
in
elite
silicon
valley
circles
currently
the
loudest
voices
debating
the
potential
dangers
of
superintelligence
are
affluent
white
men
and
perhaps
for
them
the
biggest
threat
is
the
rise
of
an
artificially
intelligent
apex
predator
but
for
those
who
already
face
marginalization

bias

the
international
association
of
privacy
professionals
has
issued
the
following
news
release
i
have
to
be
honest
with
you
i
ve
been
working
as
a
journalist
in
the
privacy
space
for
the
last
six
years
and
privacy
never
really
mattered
that
much
to
me
when
i
first
understood
via
snowden
that
the
u
s
government
was
collecting
data
on
all
of
us
i
didn
t
knee
jerk
freak
out
i
thought
about
what
i
do
online
the
kinds
of
data
that
likely
generates
about
me
and
what
kind
of
surveillance
that
probably
meant
as
a
result
i
can
t
say
i
was
ever
in
the
if
you
re
not
doing
anything
wrong
you
ve
got
nothing
to
hide
camp
but
i
also
wasn
t
arms
up
in
the
air
outraged
that
some
corporation
potentially
handed
my
data
over
to
the
police
no
i
didn
t
love
the
idea
that
the
feds
maybe
knew
i
d
once
googled
is
a
yam
different
from
a
sweet
potato
but
it
didn
t
keep
me
up
at
night
as
a
journalist
it
s
kind
of
my
job
not
to
freak
out
i
m
to
strip
the
emotion
from
the
subject
and
report
on
the
facts
so
i
ve
spent
most
of
my
time
nonplussed
at
the
headlines
whether
i
m
writing
them
or
someone
else
is
but
then
i
went
to
an
event
at
georgetown

last
week
called
the
color
of
surveillance
and
the
hair
on
my
arms
stood
up
straight
for
about
eight
continuous
hours
i
d
missed
it
completely
i
d
missed
the
entire
reason
privacy
isn
t
just
a
concern
for
those
of
us
logged
into
ashley
madison
or
those
of
us
researching
something
more
nefarious
than
the
difference
between
starches
i
missed
that
it
should
matter
to
me
because
there
are
people
for
whom
it
has
to
matter
by
virtue
of
their
socioeconomic
or
racial
status
and
while
i
have
the
luxury
by
virtue
of
my
own
socioeconomic
status
and
race
of
ignoring
reality
and
letting
this
not
be
my
problem
that
s
not
how
wrongs
are
righted
never
has
been
there

kanye

chasing

around

damn
club
they
even
make
me
show
id
to
get
inside
a
sam
s
club
i
never
really
understood
why
that
particular
lyric
of
all
the
powerful
rap
lines
i
ve
ever
heard
has
stayed
with
me
for
so
long
but
sitting
at
georgetown
last
week
and
hearing
speakers
many
of
them
african
american
and
or
muslim
themselves
describe
the
realities
on
the
ground
i
realized
it
s
exactly
that
kind
surveillance
showing
id
to
get
into
sam
s
club
that
seems
so
absurd
but
which
persists
in
much
more
dangerous
contexts
than
just
retail
stores
like
sam
s
last
week
i
finally
saw
surveillance
not
as
something
mildly
offensive
to
my
own
sense
of
civil
liberties
but
as
a
tool
of
institutional
racism
it
suddenly
became
clear
to
me
and
i
m
so
embarrassed
it
didn
t
prior
that
the
people
most
stripped
of
their
privacy
rights
in
this
surveillance
age
are
the
people
who
are
the
most
vulnerable
i
m
white
and
grew
up
in
middle
class
portland
maine
and
i
really
hadn
t
had
a
front
row
seat
to
the
kind
of
experiences
i
m
talking
about
here
but
the
powerful
surveilling
the
powerless
is
nothing
new
it
existed
even
in
the
earliest
days
of
slavery
surveillance
and
power
have
long
been
closely
linked
to
institutional
racism
from
slave
owners
branding
their
slaves
so
they
couldn
t
move
freely
and
privately
around
to
planation
owners
building
homes
tall
enough
to
surveill
the
entire
plantation
slavery
may
have
been
abolished
but
now
we
see
racism
and
oppression
in
a
new
power
structure
in
which
the
powerful
hold
the
data
on
the
less
powerful
and
in
that
way
control
a
whole
lot
of
things
including
access
to
services
freedom
of
movement
and
most
egregiously
dignity
here
s
one
example
khiara
bridges
is
a
professor
at
boston
university
who
studied
pregnant
women
applying
to
medicaid
all
of
them
poor
most
of
them
of
color
her
research
has
found
a
system
fundamentally
flawed
by
design
in
which
women
relying
on
government
assistance
to
have
a
child
were
required
before
ever
seeing
a
health
practitioner
to
be
informationally
canvassed
via
coerced
consultations
that
ask
the
kinds
of
degrading
questions
white
privately
insured
women
would
never
be
asked
at
a
healthcare
facility
these
women
are
routinely
drilled
on
whether
they
ve
missed
prenatal
care
appointments
whether
the
pregnancy
was
planned
or
accidental
whether
they
ve
ever
abused
controlled
substances
been
domestically
abused
been
homeless
and
if
they
say
yes
more
information
is
gathered
that
information
is
then
funneled
to
other
state
bureaucracies
including
immigration
customs
enforcement
or
even
criminal
justice
in
order
to
continue
their
medicaid
care
the
women
are
then
tracked
and
surveilled
in
demeaning
ways
which
bridges
calls
the
poverty
of
privacy
rights
and
because
poor
people
are
seen
as
social
problems
they
re
situated
inside
a
tight
government
net
where
they
can
be
patrolled
harassed
and
controlled
as
deemed
necessary
after
all
where
are
they
going
to
go
for
medical
care
if
not
government
assistance
that
s
the
trade
off
you
want
our
help
we
ll
use
your
data
how
we
see
fit
or
for
further
evidence
we
can
look
to
black
men
it
doesn
t
take
much
research
to
find
a
startling
number
of
examples
of
police
harassment
according
to
research
presented
by
hamid
khan
of
the
stop
lapd
spying
coalition
percent
of
suspicious
activity
reports
in
los
angeles
are
written
on
blacks
even
though
they
make
up
less
than
percent
of
the
total
population
besides
arrests
khan
reported
there
are
more
covert
surveillance
methods
employed
in
which
housing
authorities
are
forging
partnerships
with
police
to
track
movements
of
residents
government
subsidized
cell
phones
are
distributed
and
their
gps
chips
used
to
track
and
in
recent
years
police
are
instituting
wartime
counter
insurgency
tactics
used
to
smoke
out
terrorist
cells
in
iraq
and
afghanistan
to
surveil
black
low
socioeconomic
status
men
think
about
walking
around
your
own
neighborhood
and
having
policemen
watching
your
every
move
suspiciously
waiting
for
a
reason
to
pull
you
aside
for
a
chat
we
ve
all
heard
the
foucault
reference
a
million
times
but
it
s
relevant
here
too
being
watched
changes
how
you
move
how
you
think
forget
about
locking
up
black
men
the
way
they
are
harassed
and
stalked
creates
as
foucault
described
it
the
prison
of
the
mind
and
that
kind
of
policing
is
something
black
men
in
many
neighborhoods
experience
every
day
and
now
other
communities
of
color
or
ethnicity
are
affected
as
well
if
you
ve
watched
the
news
once
since
you
understand
what
s
happening
to
muslim
communities
and
technology
is
only
making
surveillance
easier
between
facial
recognition
technology
algorithms
used
for
predictive
policing
and
most
recently
stingrays
the
watching
done
by
the
human
eye
historically
will
be
and
already
is
being
done
faster
easier
cheaper
and
en
masse
georgetown
s
alvaro
bedoya
said
that
to
him
privacy
is
black
kids
being
able
to
make
mistakes
without
the
law
watching
their
every
move
i
like
that
that
s
the
way
i
grew
up
i
made
mistakes
in
my
neighborhood
all
the
time
in
public
but
in
my
public
there
was
even
still
some
privacy
or
at
least
obscurity
and
i
was
allowed
to
get
smarter
more
mature
from
those
mistakes
rather
than
be
forever
marked
by
them
as
always
we
re
keeping
the
vulnerable
vulnerable
asserting
power
just
because
we
can
because
he
who
owns
the
data
who
makes
decisions
on
who
has
access
to
what
based
on
that
data
holds
the
power
and
that
s
why
privacy
pros
in
this
context
are
so
important
there
s
been
a
lot
of
talk
lately
about
the
need
to
continue
making
ethics
based
decisions
and
not
just
compliance
based
decisions
and
i
can
t
think
of
a
context
more
worthy
than
the
restoration
of
human
dignity
for
everyone
as
privacy
pros
you
get
to
make
decisions
that
have
real
impacts
on
people
s
lives
though
it
may
sometimes
seem
more
abstract
than
that
decisions
like
should
we
even
collect
this
data
to
begin
with
if
we
do
who
might
own
it
someday
and
it
may
seem
absurd
that
these
questions
are
related
to
social
injustice
and
an
imbalance
of
power
but
guess
what
they
really
are
maybe

when

perpetuates
institutional
racism
length
words
dateline
lahore
washington
the
international
association
of
privacy
professionals
has
issued
the
following
news
release
i
have
to
be
honest
with
you
i
ve
been
working
as
a
journalist
in
the
privacy
space
for
the
last
six
years
and
privacy
never
really
mattered
that
much
to
me
when
i
first
understood
via
snowden
that
the
u
s
government
was
collecting
data
on
all
of
us
i
didn
t
knee
jerk
freak
out
i
thought
about
what
i
do
online
the
kinds
of
data
that
likely
generates
about
me
and
what
kind
of
surveillance
that
probably
meant
as
a
result
i
can
t
say
i
was
ever
in
the
if
you
re
not
doing
anything
wrong
you
ve
got
nothing
to
hide
camp
but
i
also
wasn
t
arms
up
in
the
air
outraged
that
some
corporation
potentially
handed
my
data
over
to
the
police
no
i
didn
t
love
the
idea
that
the
feds
maybe
knew
i
d
once
googled
is
a
yam
different
from
a
sweet
potato
but
it
didn
t
keep
me
up
at
night
as
a
journalist
it
s
kind
of
my
job
not
to
freak
out
i
m
to
strip
the
emotion
from
the
subject
and
report
on
the
facts
so
i
ve
spent
most
of
my
time
nonplussed
at
the
headlines
whether
i
m
writing
them
or
someone
else
is
but
then
i
went
to
an
event
at
georgetown
law
last
week
called
the
color
of
surveillance
and
the
hair
on
my
arms
stood
up
straight
for
about
eight
continuous
hours
i
d
missed
it
completely
i
d
missed
the
entire
reason
privacy
isn
t
just
a
concern
for
those
of
us
logged
into
ashley
madison
or
those
of
us
researching
something
more
nefarious
than
the
difference
between
starches
i
missed
that
it
should
matter
to
me
because
there
are
people
for
whom
it
has
to
matter
by
virtue
of
their
socioeconomic
or
racial
status
and
while
i
have
the
luxury
by
virtue
of
my
own
socioeconomic
status
and
race
of
ignoring
reality
and
letting
this
not
be
my
problem
that
s
not
how
wrongs
are
righted
never
has
been
there
s
this
kanye
west
lyric
that
s
been
chasing
me
around
since
i
first
heard
it
west
wrote
in
racism
s
still
alive
they
just
be
concealing
it
but
i
know
they
don
t
want
me
in
the
damn
club
they
even
make
me
show
id
to
get
inside
a
sam
s
club
i
never
really
understood

that

a
reduced
sentence
but
is
the
right
question
to
be
asking
in
this
moment
really
how
to
balance
professional
judgment
and
a
predictive
instrument
or
even
how
these
algorithms
or
tools
are
inaccurate
and
racially
profile
instead
perhaps
we
should
be
asking
why
there
is
such
a
profound
silence
surrounding
the
elephant
in
the
room
the
structural
problems
in
society
that
drive
harm
even
if
burgess
was
right
that
predictability
is
feasible
what
meanings
are
drawn
from
these
relationships
if
reoffending
can
be
predicted
why
is
the
problem
the
person
why
not
the
wider
environment
that
shapes
our
life
pathways
and
why
wouldn
t
we
conclude
as
harcourt
writes
in
against
prediction
that
there
is
a
problem
with
prisons
punishment
or
the
lack
of
reentry
programs
and
why
wouldn
t
predictability
then
motivate
an
examination
of
the
root
of
these
institutions
rather
than
a
push
to
seek
more
reform
take
the
turn
to
predictive
policing
los
angeles
already
spends
percent
of
its
general
funds
on
its
police
department
says
garcia
with
an
inability
to
acknowledge
and
address
racial
bias
within
its
force
continued
histories
of
corruption
and
a
long
list
of
lethal
actions
against
unarmed
residents
why
isn
t
the
conclusion
to
shrink
policing
in
la
rather
than
produce
new
and
expensive
predictive
tools
that
according
to
a
rand
study
don
t
work
similarly
cities
pay
to
expand
facilities
to
monitor
those
with
convictions
for
sex
offenses
including
civil
commitment
institutions
despite
the
fact
that
research
has
demonstrated
that
registries
and
an
array
of
other
punitive
responses
have
neither
protected
children
nor
ended
sexual
violence
if
our
goal
is
to
end
or
reduce
sexual
violence
why
not
focus
and
support
proven
preventative
measures
including
meaningful
sex
education
and
non
stigmatizing
mental
health
care
why
not
focus
on
ending
patriarchy
for
many
this
leap
for
now
is
too
much
the
lives
and
the
rights
of
those
with
convictions
for
sex
offenses
like
lieberman
and
jones
are
seen
as
necessary
collateral
damage
in
the
wider
march
toward
greater
public
safety
or
perhaps
exceptions
to
reform
practices
that
on
the
whole
will
work
for
others
but
as
risk
assessment
in
our
political
moment
gains
a
measure
of
mainstream
scrutiny
another
story
could
emerge
perhaps
the
focus
on
the
supposedly
incorrigible
nature
of
people
convicted
of
sex
offenses
and
the
assumption
that
given
the
gravity
of
their
acts
many
require
indefinite
detention
deftly
masks
our
collective
reality
just
like
prisons
maybe
big
data
can
t
make
us
safe
in
fact
it
might
make
things
worse
meanwhile
despite
all
these
scores
and
diagnoses
smith
can
t
predict
her
son
s
future
with
no
money
for
a
private
lawyer
she
does
the
best
she
can
she
visits
and
calls
and
tries
to
stay
informed
about
both
what
is
happening
at
rushville
and
how
jones
is
doing
she
is
pleased
about
the
small
things
her
daughter
who
is
now
years
old
and
therefore
no
longer
a
risk
according
to
rushville
can
finally
visit
her
brother
but
for
those
in
indefinite
confinement
and
their
families
the
future
is
a
question
mark
and
with
big
data
in
charge
the
answer
is
often
limitless
incarceration
