the

lacey
is

before

said
michael
vicencia
presiding
judge
at
the
gov
george
deukmejian
courthouse
in
long
beach
noting
priority
is
given
to
pending
cases
that
have
been
reclassified
from
felonies
to
misdemeanors
it
could
take
three
to
six
months
to
wade
through
the
pending
matters
vicencia
said
we
re
shifting
resources
misdemeanor
courts
are
typically
our
busiest
after
pending
cases
are
heard
the
court
will
move
on
to
reviewing
cases
of
current
inmates
and
those
who
have
already
completed
their
prison
sentences
city
court
officials
are
working
in
tandem
with
lacey
so
that
enough
resources
are
available
to
address
the
influx
of
misdemeanor
cases
vicencia
said
the
process
however
presents
a
particular
difficulty
in
the
face
of
years
of
staff
and
budget
cuts
said
haubert
adding
he
has
seen
his
staff
of
deputy
prosecutors
cut
by
a
third
additional
cases
are
likely
to
stretch
our
resources
even
further
than
they
should
be
stretched
he
said
ultimately
haubert
fears
that
the
proposition
will
result
in
the
same
criminals
moving
in
and
out
of
the
system
repeatedly
i
would
like
to
see
more
alternative
sentencing
programs
for
those
with
mental
illness
but
there
needs
to
be
some
consequences
for
violent
or
habitual
criminals
he
said
i
need
to
take
a
wait
and
see
approach
and
see
if
society
realizes
the
benefits
that
have
been
promised
we
all
have
to
hope
and
pray
that
it
accomplishes

the
supreme

in

has
restricted

of

to
search
cellphones
to
attach
gps
devices
to
cars
and
to
bring

now
it
will
rule
on
the
privacy

of
something
more
mundane
but
potentially
incriminating

the

agreed
monday
to

the

challenge
to
a
federal
appeals
court
decision
that
struck
down
a
law
giving
police
unrestricted

to

the
city
had
used
the
ordinance
to
investigate
crimes
such
as
drug
dealing
and
prostitution
and
it
had
been
upheld
by
a
federal

court

in
the
most
recent
case
involving

the

ruled
in
an

written
by

john
roberts
that
police
must
get
a
warrant
before
searching
a

in

is
whether

must
first
submit
their

before
rifling

several

yang
executive

cssa
is
deeply
sad
for

in
the
chines
community
he
recalled
ji
is
a
nice
chinese
young
man
and
very
hard
working
student
cssa
claimed
that
usc
should
take
responsibility
for
not
providing
necessary
security
in
off
campus
area
in
the
summer
yang
introduced
to
china
daily
in
the
interview
that
off
campus
patrol
is
not
on
duty
in
summer
break
in
usc
yang
believed
this
is
the
main
reason
why
ji
lost
the
opportunity
to
ask
for
help
as
soon
as
attacked
yang
also
introduced
that
the
ground
floor
security
was
off

too
yang
said
as
a
student
how
used
to
take
one
year
course
in
ee
program
and
still
a
friend
of
many
ee
students
at
usc
he
is
very
concerned
that
the
safety
of
ee
students
are
put
at
edge
because
the
fact
that
lots
of
projects
they
have
are
have
to
be
done
on
school
s
computer
me
myself
and
many
of
my
friends
in
this
program
often
have
to
study
in
lab
until
o
clock
in
the
morning
yang
said
another
problem
is
one
of
ee
s
core
courses
is
only
offered
in
summer
many
chinese
students
as
well
other
other
international
students
have
to
stay
to
take
that
course
when
security
is
not
guaranteed
cssa
is
now
requesting
usc
to
bring
back
the
off
campus
patrol
as
yang
said
ccsa
also
told
china
daily
that
chinese
international
students
are
often
described
rich
people
or
the
second
generation
of
the
rich
class
in
china
most
of
us
are
from
ordinary
families
and
we
come
to
us
for
education
like
many
other
international
students
almost
everymonth
there
is
rubbery
around
usc
area
and
victims
so
often
fall
in
chinese
young
said

hedding
law
firm
offers
its
expertise
to
deal
with
domestic
violence
cases
length
words
crime
is
punishable
by
law
in
every
country
the
united
states
is
one
of
those
countries
where
law
and
regulation
is
maintained
with
utmost
rigour
the
hedding
law
firm
has
been
playing
its
humble
part
in
the
domain
of
judiciary
its
current
head
is
ronald
hedding
who
is
a
renowned
criminal
attorney
in
los
angeles
he
has
expertise
and
experience
in
various
criminal
domains
thus
his
firm
has
specialist
attorneys
to
represent
clients
in
different
cases
at
the
court
of
law
the
firm
has
lawyers
who
can
represent
clients
in
the
superior
court
too
every
los
angeles
criminal
lawyer
in
the
hedding
law
firm
is
qualified
and
has
ample
experience
of
dealing
in
wide
array
of
criminal
cases
the
law
firm
has
earned
many
accolades
and
honours
for
its
services
in
the
criminal
defence
domain
the
central
idea
of
the
firm
is
to
maintain
the
differentiation
between
crime
by
choice
and
crime
due
to
circumstance
people
often
find
themselves
caught
amid
legal
battle
due
to
lack
of
awareness
about
a
particular
criminal
law
at
times
they
are
forced
by
circumstance
to
commit
inappropriate
things
but
they
hate
it
and
do
not
intend
to
repeat
such
people
may
commit
crime
but
they
are
not
hazardous
to
the
society
and
only
an
experienced
los
angeles
criminal
attorney
can
establish
that
in
the
court
of
law
so
it
is
very
important
to
seek
for
a
criminal
defence
advocate
as
soon
as
any
legal
trouble
is
sensed
the
hedding
law
firm
has
combined
experience
of
years
in
the
domain
of
representing
clients
in
the
court
of
law
it
deals
in
various
cases
including
domestic
violence
which
happens
to
be
on
the
rise
federal
crimes
juvenile
crimes
drug
crimes
and
domestic
violence
are
all
different
forms
of
crime
and
the
strategy
to
proceed
in
either
of
those
varies
so
the
hedding
law
firm
has
extended
its
service
to
provide
the
advice
to
follow
when
searching
for
a
lawyer
the
distinction
with
domestic
violence
cases
is
that
the
prosecution
cannot
be
averted
or
evaded
by
the
request
of
the
spouse
the
case
goes
into
the
hands
of
special
prosecuting
agencies
thus
the
need
for
assistance
from
legal
experts
becomes
inevitable
the
hedding
law
firm
is
the
best
agency
to
find
a
good
domestic
violence
lawyer
in
los
angeles
since
its
establishment
more
than
decades
ago
the
firm
has
been
dealing
with
domestic
violence
cases
regularly
not
many
law
firms
match
the
understanding
of
the
complexities
of
such
cases
that
the
hedding
law
firm

have
the
backing
of
new

s
top
cop
ny
police
commissioner
bill
bratton
told
premier
campbell
newman
yesterday
to
go
for
it
when
it
comes
to
his
bikie
crackdown
including
the
vlad
laws
modelled
on
the
rico
legislation
rolled
out
in
the
us
to
crack
down
on
the
mafia
and
bikie
gangs
there
the
way
it
has
been
described
to
me
in
terms
of
what
those
bikie
gangs
engage
in
they
are
effectively
organised
crime
activities
he
said
rico
certainly
has
helped
us
in
the
us
to
deal
with
not
only
in
this
city
the
mafia
the
five
families
that
once
ruled
in
this
city
but
with
many
other
types
of
activity
in
los
angeles
when
i
was
chief
of
police
there
we
used
rico
type
activities
we
used
gang
injunctions
to
effectively
control
the
gangs
that
we
dealt
with
there
and
we
use
many
of
those
same
tactics
here
to
deal
with
operational
gangs
and
mr
bratton
said
it
was
working
crime
has
gone
down
every
year
for
the
last
years
and
it
is
down
again
this
year
he
said
our
homicides
as
of
today
are
down
per
cent
this
year
our
shootings
are
down
almost
per
cent
overall
crime
is
down
going
into
the
th
year
mr
newman
said
he
took
a
lot
away
from
his
briefing
we
clearly
haven
t
had
the
same
challenges
with
crime
that
cities
like
new
york
and
los
angeles
have
had
but
the
alcohol
fuelled
violence
and
the
criminal
motorcycle
gang
issue
are
the
issues
that
we
must
solve
he
said
i
think
one
of
the
big
things
the
commissioner
said
to
me
today
is
the
importance
of
the
community
deciding
that
they
want
to
do
something
like
this
so
the
strategy
the
plan
that
the
government
releases
in
the
next
three
weeks
we
are
essentially
going
to
be
asking
the

if

correctly
the

for

ending

would
have
been

s
incumbent
upon
me
to
ask
the
inspector
general
to
use
his
abilities
and
powers
to
gather
more
information
so
the
misclassifications
so
the
errors
stop
even
if
there
are
answers

it

important
that
we
go
deeper

we

soboroff
said
he
was
also
concerned
about
another

involving
the
correct

solved
the
daily
news
reported
last

that
the

has
refused
to
release
information
that
would
show
whether
or
not
they
solved
hundreds
of
murders
after
officials
initially
offered
to
present
those
records
lapd
chief
charlie
beck
has
said
the

solved
many
more
murders
than
it
reported
to
federal

state

comdr
andrew
smith
said
the
department
was
never
going
to
be
perfect
when
it
came
to
keeping
statistics
on
crimes
saying
there
are
always
errors
in
miscoding
and
reporting
smith
said
the
findings
do
not
affect
the
overall
crime
declines
the
city
has
seen
in
the
last
eleven
years
this
is
a
coding
problem
and
a
statistical
problem
not
a
putting
people
in
jail
problem
smith
said
according
to
the
lapd
s
web
page
on
compstat
however
accurate
and
timely
intelligence
or
information
is
absolutely
essential
in
effectively
responding
to
any
problem
or
crisis
the
statistics
are
also
used
in
measuring
the
department
s
performance
the
newspaper
reports
and
lapd
s
own
audit
have
prompted
the
department
to
provide
additional
training
to
personnel
in
the
field
who
are
entering
crime
data
into
the
system
as
well
as
supervisors
who
review
those
reports
smith
said
anyone
found
to
be
manipulating
or
falsifying
crime
data
is
seen
as
committing
major
misconduct
and
would
be
subject
to
severe
discipline

gangs
engage
in
they
are
effectively
organised
crime
activities
mr
bratton
said
rico
certainly
has
helped
us
in
the
united
states
to
deal
with
not
only
in
this
city
the
mafia
the
five
families
that
once
ruled
in
this
city
but
with
many
other
types
of
activity
in
los
angeles
when
i
was
chief
of
police
there
we
used
rico
type
activities
we
used
gang
injunctions
to
effectively
control
the
gangs
that
we
dealt
with
there
and
we
use
many
of
those
same
tactics
here
to
deal
with
operational
gangs
which
are
called
crews
in
new
york
city
and
he
said
that
it
was
working
crime
has
gone
down
every
year
for
the
last
years
and
it
is
down
again
this
year
mr
bratton
said
our
homicides
as
of
today
are
down
per
cent
this
year
our
shootings
are
down
almost
per
cent
overall
crime
is
down
going
into
the
th
year
mr
bratton
who
helped
clean
up
new
york
s
streets
alongside
mayor
rudy
giuliani
yesterday
also
gave
mr
newman
advice
on
his
plans
to
mirror
his
famous
broken
window
policing
policy
the
idea
is
that
if
you
take
care
of
the
little
things
while
they
re
still
little
you
can
keep
them
from
growing
into
major
things
mr
bratton
said
we
pay
a
lot
of
attention
to
graffiti
issues
aggressive
begging
and
street
prostitution
street
narcotics
dealing
public
drinking
and
i
ve
practised
that
in
boston
new
york
now
twice
los
angeles
and
over
cities
that
i
have
consulted
for
and
it
works
mr
newman
said
he
would
take
much
away
from
his
briefing
we
clearly
haven
t
had
the
same
challenges
with
crime
that
cities
like
new
york
and
los
angeles
have
had
mr
newman
said
but
the
alcohol
fuelled
violence
and
the
criminal
motorcycle
gang
issue
are
the
issues
that
we
must
solve

the

some

said
an

was

after
the

were

in

combed
through

in

a

swooped

was
responsible
for
causing

after

thompson
said
an

into
a

was
ongoing
with
the

claiming
as
much
as
in
damage
was
caused
on
the
narcotics
arrest
he
initially
said
the
drug
found
on
the
premises
was
cocaine
but
his
department
later
backtracked
on
that
statement
nothing
is
confirmed
another
spokeswoman
for
the
sheriff
s
department
sergeant
carmen
arballo
told
afp
it
s
a
controlled
substance
but
we
don
t
know
if
it
s
cocaine
we
won
t
know
until
it
s
gone
to
a
lab
and
been
tested
another
sheriff
s
spokesman
told
the
los

times
it
could
be
a
form
of
ecstasy
thompson
said
the
drugs
found
at
bieber
s
property
were
in
plain
view
of
the
deputies
when
they
were
looking
for
the
evidence
celebrity
news
website
tmz
which
generally
has
solid
sources
said
the
man
arrested
was
rapper
lil
za
one
of
bieber
s
close
friends
bieber
who
was
in
the
home
during
the
raid
had
been
neither
arrested
nor
exonerated
in
connection
with
the
vandalism
case
thompson
said
he
added
that
the
pop
star
was
not
connected
to
the
drugs
seizure
beyond
the
fact
that
the
gentleman
was
staying
at
his
residence
officials
however
dismissed
suggestions
that
the
nature
of
the
alleged
vandalism
was
trivial
a
felony
crime
is
a
felony
crime
the
damage
was
from
the
eggs
thompson
said
the
felony
comes
from
the
amount
of
the
damage
and
this
residence
sustained
a
great
amount
of
damage
that
easily
achieve
the
felony
vandalism
section
i
get
that
the
eggs
don
t
seem
that
significant
but
it
does
rise
to
the
level
of
a
felony
there
s
an
extensive
amount
of
damage
and
i
and
the
sheriff
s
department
take
that
very
seriously
the
los

sheriff
s
department
earlier
confirmed
they
had
served
a
warrant
at
bieber
s
home
over
the
egg
throwing
allegations
the
purpose
of
the
search
warrant
is
to
seek
video
surveillance
or
other
possible
evidence
in
the
vandalism
that
occurred
on
january
the
vandalism
damage
is
estimated
by
the
homeowner
to
be
approximately
a
statement
said
the
warrant
followed
a
complaint
from
a
neighbour
of
bieber
that
the
star
had
hurled
raw
eggs
at
his
home
last
week
the
case
was
first
classified
as
a
possible
misdemeanour
offence
however
officials
said
on
tuesday
it
was
now
being
probed
as
a
more
serious
felony
offence
because
the
damage
to
property
exceeded
it
is
not
known
what
prompted
the
alleged
egg
attack
but
if
bieber
is
eventually
charged
and
convicted
with
vandalism
he
could
be
facing
jail
time
