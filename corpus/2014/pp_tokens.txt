introduction
the
age
of
big
data
has
come
to
policing
in
chicago
police
officers
are
paying
particular
attention
to
members
of
a
heat
list
those
identified
by
a
risk
analysis
as
most
likely
to
be
involved
in
future
violence
n
in
charlotte
north
carolina
the
police
have
compiled
foreclosure
data
to
generate
a
map
of
high
risk
areas
that
are
likely
to
be
hit
by
crime
n
in
new
york
city
the
n
y
p
d
has
partnered
with
microsoft
to
employ
a
domain
awareness
system
that
collects
and
links
information
from
sources
like
cctvs
license
plate
readers
radiation
sensors
and
informational
databases
n
in
santa
cruz
california
the
police
have
reported
a
dramatic
reduction
in
burglaries
after
relying
upon
computer
algorithms
that
predict
where
new
burglaries
are
likely
to
occur
n
the
department
of
homeland
security
has
applied
computer
analytics
to
twitter
feeds
to
find
words
like
pipe
bomb
plume
and
listeria
n
big
data
has
begun
to
transform
government
in
fields
as
diverse
as
public
health
transportation
management
and
scientific
research
n
the
analysis
of
what
were
once
unimaginable
quantities
of
digitized
data
is
likely
to
introduce
dramatic
changes
to
a
profession
which
as
late
as
involved
little
more
than
an
able
bodied
man
who
was
given
a
hickory
club
a
whistle
and
a
key
to
a
call
box
n
real
time
access
to
and
analysis
of
vast
quantities
of
information
found
in
criminal
records
police
databases
and
surveillance
data
may
alter
policing
n
in
the
same
way
that
big
data
has
revolutionized
areas
as
diverse
as
presidential
elections
n
internet
commerce
n
and
language
translation
n
some
have
even
heralded
big
data
s
potential
to
change
our
assumptions
about
social
relationships
government
scientific
study
and
even
knowledge
itself
n
in
the
private
sector
retailers
have
harnessed
big
data
to
produce
some
seemingly
trivial
but
surprising
changes
to
their
practices
n
a
much
discussed
example
stems
from
target
s
extensive
use
of
data
analytics
to
identify
certain
purchases
such
as
supplements
commonly
taken
during
pregnancy
to
know
whether
a
customer
is
pregnant
without
the
woman
disclosing
the
pregnancy
herself
n
for
a
retailer
pregnancy
is
a
prime
opportunity
to
target
a
consumer
when
shopping
habits
change
and
expand
an
irate
father
allegedly
complained
to
target
that
his
daughter
was
unfairly
targeted
as
a
pregnant
woman
with
coupons
only
to
discover
to
his
chagrin
that
target
was
better
informed
than
he
was
n
similarly
walmart
through
its
computerized
retail
tracking
has
discovered
that
strawberry
pop
tarts
and
beer
sell
as
briskly
as
flashlights
when
hurricanes
are
forecast
these
products
were
quickly
shipped
to
florida
walmart
stores
in
the
path
of
hurricane
frances
in
n
yet
unlike
the
data
crunching
performed
by
target
walmart
or
amazon
the
introduction
of
big
data
to
police
work
raises
new
and
significant
challenges
to
the
regulatory
framework
that
governs
conventional
policing
from
one
perspective
the
fourth
amendment
has
proven
remarkably
flexible
over
time
constitutional
law
has
governed
ordinary
policing
whether
the
crimes
involved
bootlegging
n
numbers
running
n
marijuana
farming
n
or
cell
phones
n
as
the
sophistication
of
criminals
has
increased
so
too
have
the
tools
of
the
police
in
the
twentieth
century
perhaps
no
two
tools
have
been
as
revolutionary
to
modern
policing
as
the
two
way
radio
and
the
patrol
car
n
in
this
century
big
data
in
a
variety
of
forms
may
bring
the
next
dramatic
change
to
police
investigations
one
researcher
has
concluded
that
it
will
soon
be
technologically
possible
and
affordable
for
government
to
record
everything
anyone
says
or
does
n
how
well
will
the
fourth
amendment
s
rules
pertaining
to
unreasonable
searches
and
seizures
adapt
to
the
uses
of
big
data
scholars
have
widely
discussed
the
shortcomings
of
applying
fourth
amendment
doctrines
once
adequate
for
a
world
of
electronic
beepers
physical
wiretaps
and
binocular
surveillance
to
rapidly
changing
technologies
n
but
big
data
may
magnify
these
concerns
considerably
this
article
identifies
three
uses
of
big
data
that
hint
at
the
future
of
policing
and
the
questions
these
tools
raise
about
conventional
fourth
amendment
analysis
two
of
these
examples
predictive
policing
and
mass
surveillance
systems
have
already
been
adopted
by
a
small
number
of
police
departments
around
the
country
a
third
example
the
potential
use
of
dna
databank
samples
presents
an
untapped
source
of
big
data
analysis
whether
any
of
these
three
examples
of
big
data
policing
attract
more
widespread
adoption
by
the
police
is
yet
unknown
but
it
likely
that
the
prospect
of
being
able
to
analyze
large
amounts
of
information
quickly
and
cheaply
will
prove
to
be
attractive
while
seemingly
quite
distinct
these
three
uses
of
big
data
suggest
the
need
to
draw
new
fourth
amendment
lines
now
that
the
government
has
the
capability
and
desire
to
collect
and
manipulate
large
amounts
of
digitized
information
i
the
rise
of
big
data
what
is
big
data
while
not
everyone
agrees
on
a
single
definition
of
big
data
most
agree
that
the
term
refers
to
the
application
of
artificial
intelligence
to
the
vast
amount
of
digitized
data
now
available
n
from
this
basic
definition
a
few
observations
emerge
about
what
is
distinct
and
significant
about
big
data
n
first
big
data
alerts
us
to
the
sheer
amount
of
information
that
is
being
produced
rapidly
every
year
in
digital
form
n
the
turn
towards
digitized
information
has
been
rapid
and
dramatic
as
recently
as
the
year
only
a
quarter
of
the
world
s
stored
information
was
digital
the
majority
of
it
was
on
film
paper
magnetic
tapes
and
other
similar
non
digital
media
n
today
the
opposite
is
true
nearly
all
of
the
world
s
stored
information
is
digital

digital
information
continues
to
grow
at
a
rapid
pace
according
to
ibm
ninety
percent
of
the
world
s
data
has
been
generated
in
the
past
two
years
n
the
executive
chairman
of
google
has
claimed
that
we
now
create
as
much
information
in
two
days
as
we
did
from
the
beginning
of
human
civilization
to
n
some
have
suggested
that
we
may
run
out
of
ways
to
quantify
numerically
the
amount
of
data
generated
n
nearly
every
piece
of
information
today
is
capable
of
digitization
and
storage
including
internet
searches
retail
purchases
facebook
posts
cellphone
calls
highway
toll
usage
and
every
last
word
in
books
n
cheap
small
and
sophisticated
sensors
and
tracking
devices
have
been
built
into
every
sort
of

and

n
the
city
of
santander
spain
is
a
prototype
of
the
coming
smart
city
with
sensors
buried
underground
that
measure
everything
from
air
pollution
to
free
parking
spaces
n
the
resulting
data
doesn
t
disappear
it
ends
up
in
data
barns
that
store
the
ever
growing
amount
of
information

decided
in
to
archive
every
public
tweet

billion
tweets
and
counting
in
january
n
second
because
the
term
also
refers
to
the
artificial
intelligence
applied
to
these
huge
data
sets
the
big
data
phenomenon
also
suggests
a
change
in
the
way
we
understand
our
world
if
conventional
scientific
research
begins
with
a
hypothesis
or
question
that
then
shapes
the
collection
of
the
relevant
data
the
big
data
phenomenon
turns
such
conventions
upside
down
because
data
is
being
collected
and
stored
all
of
the
time
research
questions
do
not
have
to
shape
or
limit
data
collection
at
all
n
researchers
need
not
limit
themselves
to
data
sampling
either
big
data
permits
the
study
of
a
phenomenon
where
the
set
is
nearly
everything
that
is
possible
to
study
another
way
of
stating
that
we
are
approaching
n
all
n
the
existence
of
these
massive
data
sets
permits
sifting
and
resifting
of
the
information
therein
for
multiple
purposes
n
thus
the
library
of
congress
s
continuous
collection
of
tweets
has
interested
researchers
with
questions
as
diverse
as
the
role
of
public
responses
to
smoking
ads
changes
in
investor
sentiments
and
real
time
hurricane
analysis
n
such
massive
quantities
of
information
also
suggest
that
the
very
kinds
of
questions
posed
by
researchers
will
be
different
in
the
big
data
context
with
so
much
data
available
viktor
mayer
schonberger
and
kenneth
cukier
argue
that
two
conventions
of
traditional
research
a
working
hypothesis
and
the
search
for
causality
are
no
longer
necessary
given
the
insights
that
can
be
derived
from
correlations
found
in
big
data
n
the
existence
of
huge
amounts
of
data
permits
research
into
correlations
that
don
t
require
an
underlying
hypothesis
for
instance
google
s
mathematical
models
have
identified
the
forty
five
search
terms
e
g
medicine
for
cough
and
fever
most
strongly
identified
with
historical
flu
data
n
the
resulting
google
flu
trends
has
proven
to
be
remarkably
accurate
in
matching
the
historical
surveillance
data
collected
by
the
centers
for
disease
control
n
thus
we
can
predict
new
outbreaks
of
the
flu
simply
by
identifying
correlations
between
google
search
terms
and
the
spread
of
seasonal
flu
n
these
predictions
are
useful
in
their
predictive
value
even
though
they
provide
no
causal
explanation
much
in
the
same
way
that
amazon
s
algorithms
can
predict
that
you
might
like
a
product
based
on
its
analysis
without
caring
why
n
a
key
contribution
of
big
data
is
the
ability
to
find
useful
correlations
within
data
sets
not
capable
of
analysis
by
ordinary
human
assessment
ii
use
of
big
data
in
policing
across
the
country
some
police
departments
have
taken
notice
that
they
stand
to
benefit
from
big
data
while
the
use
of
big
data
in
the
private
sector
has
raised
concerns
about
consumer
privacy
its
use
by
the
police
raises
even
bigger
questions
about
the
limits
of
using
data
to
justify
surveillance
investigation
and
detention
by
the
police
this
section
discusses
three
of
the
most
important
developments
in
use
of
big
data
by
the
police
crime
prediction
mass
surveillance
and
dna
databanks
a
crime
prediction
predictive
policing
perhaps
the
most
visible
use
of
big
data
by
police
departments
thus
far
has
been
predictive
policing
the
application
of
computer
modeling
to
historical
crime
data
to
predict
future
criminal
activity
n
while
the
police
have
long
tried
to
find
patterns
of
criminal
activity
on
which
to
focus
their
resources
n
predictive
policing
permits
the
police
to
harness
thousands
of
data
points
to
forecast
where
crime
is
likely
to
happen
the
most
basic
models
rely
on
past
crimes
but
data
sources
can
include
factors
as
variable
as
payday
schedules
seasonal
variation
liquor
store
locations
and
potential
escape
routes
n
what
is
new
about
predictive
policing
is
not
the
use
of
quantitative
data
n
in
the
s
the
n
y
p
d
ushered
in
an
era
of
intelligence
based
policing
n
under
commissioner
bill
bratton
the
n
y
p
d
introduced
the
now
famous
compstat
system
n
weekly
meetings
at
the
n
y
p
d
headquarters
at
which
a
revolving
group
of
commanding
officers
around
the
city
gave
accountings
of
themselves
for
the
recent
crime
data
collected
in
their
precinct
n
by
evaluating
performance
by
the
rise
or
fall
of
crime
data
within
their
precincts
compstat
meetings
forced
accountability
upon
commanding
officers
such
data
driven
policing
spread
to
other
departments
around
the
united
states
when
crime
rates
began
to
fall
dramatically
within
new
york
city
n
a
result
the
police
attributed
to
its
reliance
upon
compstat
along
with
the
adoption
of
broken
windows
policing
n
and
aggressive
stop
and
frisk
tactics
n
compstat
and
similar
programs
inspired
by
it
rely
on
the
collection
of
crime
statistics
to
inform
police
decision
making
n
the
innovation
of
predictive
policing
is
the
application
of
artificial
intelligence
to
such
large
data
sets
compstat
relied
heavily
on
the
collection
and
display
of
past
crime
data
predictive
policing
applies
computer
analysis
to
similar
information
the
identification
of
future
geographic
places
likely
to
be
targeted
by
criminals
has
attracted
the
most
attention
these
predictive
models
all
rely
on
well
established
observations
about
the
spatial
distribution
of
criminal
behavior
crime
is
not
found
randomly
across
a
city
but
rather
tends
to
fall
within
limited
and
often
very
small
areas
n
crime
tends
to
be
lumpy
for
instance
researchers
found
that
over
a
fourteen
year
period
about
fifty
percent
of
the
crime
in
seattle
was
limited
to
percent
of
the
city
s
street
segments
n
based
upon
this
connection
between
crime
and
place
computer
models
adopt
different
approaches
towards
the
prediction
of
crime
for
instance
the
santa
cruz
police
department
uses
software
that
assumes
that
crime
patterns
follow
a
pattern
similar
to
earthquake
aftershocks
n
the
software
applies
a
computer
algorithm
to
a
database
representing
five
years
worth
of
crime
data
including
crime
time
location
and
type
to
assess
the
likelihood
of
future
crime
occurring
in
the
geographic
areas
within
the
city
narrowed
to
squares
measured
by
feet
figure
a
n
prior
to
each
shift
santa
cruz
police
officers
receive
information
identifying
such
squares
with
the
highest
probability
of
crime
and
are
encouraged
though
not
required
to
provide
greater
attention
to
these
areas
n
after
its
experimental
introduction
in
the
santa
cruz
police
department
reported
a
significant
drop
in
burglaries
when
compared
to
a
period
prior
to
the
adoption
of
predictive
policing
n
similar
experiments
relying
upon
this
software
are
being
conducted
by
the
police
in
los
angeles
and
seattle
n
see
figure
a
in
original
figure
a
predictive
policing
map
n
other
approaches
may
consider
additional
factors
other
than
the
timing
and
location
of
past
crimes
risk
terrain
theory
for
example
looks
at
the
social
physical
and
behavioral
factors
that
make
it
more
likely
certain
areas
will
be
targeted
by
crime
n
the
resulting
risk
terrain
map
which
gives
each
factor
its
own
mapping
layer
is
a
composite
map
that
assigns
a
risk
assessment
for
all
of
the
factors
associated
with
criminal
activity
n
for
example
police
in
morris
county
new
jersey
use
five
factors
for
their
risk
terrain
modeling
past
burglaries
the
residential
location
of
individuals
recently
arrested
for
property
crimes
the
proximity
to
major
highways
the
geographic
concentration
of
young
men
and
the
location
of
apartment
complexes
and
hotels
n
morris
county
police
attribute
significant
drops
in
violent
and
property
crime
to
a
reliance
on
risk
terrain
modeling
n
a
second
type
of
predictive
technology
focuses
on
the
application
of
algorithms
to
social
media
in
order
to
identify
likely
criminality
based
on
the
role
an
individual
plays
within
a
social
network
n
this
social
network
analysis
n
begins
with
the
assumption
that
social
networks
undergird
many
crimes
an
illegal
drug
dealing
network
may
loosely
follow
the
hierarchical
structure
of
a
legitimate
business
with
suppliers
distributors
buyers
and
financiers
n
indeed
this
type
of
analysis
has
its
roots
in
the
military
study
of
insurgent
groups
abroad
n
the
algorithms
used
in
social
network
software
can
help
police
visualize
the
density
of
connections
an
individual
has
within
a
social
network
these
connections
might
take
the
form
of
exchanges
communications
family
ties
participation
in
crimes
or
affiliations
with
an
organization
n
see
figure
b
in
original
figure
b
hypothetical
social
network
analysis
n
when
used
by
a
police
department
social
network
analysis
might
be
used
to
identify
a
central
node
a
person
with
a
high
degree
of
connectivity
within
the
network
figure
b
n
while
traditional
police
work
might
easily
identify
leaders
within
a
criminal
organization
social
network
analysis
can
identify
those
with
influence
or
those
who
transmit
information
within
the
group

another

while
the

will
be
required
to

a

the
reliance
of
states
upon
arrestee

appears
to
be
following
a
similar
path
in

today
twenty
eight

how
do

raise
big
data
questions
first
the
emerging
and
controversial
use
of

is
in
fact
a
big
data
issue
based
on
the
assumption
that
close
relatives
share
more
genetic
information
than
unrelated
individuals
familial
searches
are
searches
of

databases
that
look
for
profiles
that
only
partially
match
the
thirteen
str
markers

on
a

profile
n
such
a
search
might
take
place
for
instance
if
a
codis
search
yields
no
identical
match
n
familial
searches
take
advantage
of
the
big
data
set
that
is
codis
the
capability
to
search
millions
of
individual
dna
profiles
n
additional
testing
on
dna
samples
may
be
necessary
to
confirm
potential
matches
n
similar
to
other
uses
of
big
data
a
familial
search
repurposes
genetic
data
collected
for
another
reason
identical
matches
n
critics
of
familial
searches
have
focused
on
issues
of
privacy
and
equity
including
the
concern
that
familial
searches
will
draw
disproportionate
attention
to
racial
and
ethnic
minorities
who
may
be
unfairly
targeted
for
genetic
surveillance
n
yet
if
we
think
of
familial
searches
as
big
data
problems
we
might
also
make
some
useful
connections
to
other
areas
in
which
data
is
being
amassed
in
large
quantities
for
one
purpose
and
later
used
for
another
for
instance
policies
on
familial
searches
might
follow
principles
of
informational
privacy
used
in
other
database
contexts
including
limited
later
analysis
to
the
specific
original
purpose
for
which
the
information
was
collected

this
potential
for
repurposing
is
not

familial

at

time
most

justifications
for

the

however
change
one
day
as

these

areas
raise
new
questions
about
how
best
to
regulate
the
use
of

by
the

in

they
arise
from
three
characteristics
of

the
use
of
artificial
intelligence
the
scale
of

storage
and
the
repurposing
of

data
this
section
considers
some
of
the
difficult
questions
that
judges
and
lawmakers
will
face
a
human
judgment
and
police
suspicion
while
popular
accounts
misleadingly
suggest
that
predictive
policing
involves
police
decision
making
controlled
by
computers
n
even
partial
reliance
on
artificial

does
raise
important
fourth
amendment
questions
police
are
using
predictive
policing
software
to
direct
them
to
places
where
they
believe
there
is
a
high
likelihood
of
criminal
activity
having
been
directed
there
by
computer
analysis
the
police
must
then
determine
whether
any
persons
located
there
warrant
further
investigation
what
role
should
artificial
intelligence
and
human
judgment
play
in
fourth
amendment
individualized
suspicion
at
a
minimum
ordinary
investigative
detentions
by
the
police
require
reasonable
suspicion
n
based
on
a
totality
of
the
circumstances
n
the
supreme
court
s
decisions
have
permitted
the
police
to
formulate
reasonable
suspicion
based
not
only
on
their
own
personal
observations
but
also
on
other
information
including
fellow
officers
n
tips
even
anonymous
ones
n
and
sometimes
even
on
determinations
that
particular
geographic
locations
may
be
labeled
as
high
crime
areas
n
in
particular
tips
relied
upon
by
the
police
must
be
sufficiently
particularized
to
an
individual
in
some
part
predictive
of
future
activity
and
corroborated
by
the
observation
of
the
police
themselves
n
the
question
here
is
whether
predictive
software
based
on
historical
crime
data
is
similar
to
other
uses
of
third
party
information
that
have
already
been
held
to
support
a
reasonable
suspicion
determination
n
imagine
that
such
software
directs
the
police
to
a
city
block
to
look
for
property
crime
and
they
observe
activity
that
by
itself
may
not
appear
obviously
suspicious
such
as
carrying
a
duffel
bag
or
peering
in
windows
n
a
probabilistic
determination
is
not
exactly
like
an
informant
s
tip
particularly
since
predictive
software
provides
assessments
about
geographic
areas
and
not
persons
n
nevertheless
a
court
might
analogize
computerized
predictions
to
informant
based
predictions
about
specific
places
such
as
drug
houses
and
hourly
motels
to
add
to
the
reasonable
suspicion
assessment
n
while
likely
not
sufficient
on
its
own
to
provide
justification
for
a
stop
because
of
its
lack
of
specificity
with
regard
to
persons
such
predictions
could
form
the
basis
of
police
observation
and
corroboration
n
so
long
as
predictive
software
is
not
the
sole
justification
used
by
police
courts
are
likely
to
accept
its
place
within
the
reasonable
suspicion
analysis
if
for
instance
courts
were
to
borrow
assessments
of
credibility
and
veracity
from
the
informant
context
n
predictive
software
may
provide
more
justification
than
an
anonymous
informant
the
assumptions
and
inputs
of
such
software
after
all
are
capable
of
verification
n
indeed
to
the
extent
that
the
supreme
court
has
emphasized
that
the
reasonable
suspicion
determination
is
to
be
objective
n
reliance
on
a
computer
analysis
of
crime
data
is
arguably
more
objective
than
an
inference
made
by
an
officer
or
a
tip
provided
by
a
third
party
software
with
a
demonstrated
history
of
successfully
predicting
high
crime
areas
based
on
verifiable
crime
data
is
likely
to
be
a
highly
persuasive
factor
in
the
reasonable
suspicion
formulation
indeed
predictive
software
may
remove
some
of
the
problems
raised
by
the
types
of
information
used
informants
particularly
anonymous
ones
can
have
questionable
motivations
in
aiding
the
police
n
in
addition
most
courts
are
highly
deferential
to
generalized
police
judgments
of
what
constitutes
a
high
crime
area
n
software
that
eliminates
undesirable
biases
and
requires
quantitative
precision
can
introduce
more
fairness
into
the
police
decision
making
process
n
some
caveats
remain
however
first
no
predictive
policing
program
is
entirely
objective
the
basic
building
blocks
of
a
predictive
software
program
necessarily
involve
human
discretion
n
the
assumptions
underlying
any
method
of
crime
prediction
rely
upon
the
decision
to
choose
one
model
of
risk
prediction
over
another
the
data
used
to
build
the
models
will
depend
on
discretionary
judgments
about
the
types
of
crimes
used
for
prediction
and
the
type
of
information
used
to
predict
those
crimes
should
a
police
department
focus
on
burglaries
and
if
so
how
are
burglaries
to
be
measured
for
example
reliance
on
arrest
rates
is
surely
problematic
n
because
arrests
themselves
are
discretionary
decisions
that
if
used
as
the
basis
to
justify
more
attention
may
simply
reinforce
unjustified
police
stereotypes
that
certain
neighborhoods
need
heavier
police
attention
n
second
prediction
models
might
nudge
police
judgments
in
favor
of
investigative
detention
in
borderline
cases
because
the
police
rely
too
heavily
on
probabilistic
information
n
if
for
example
a
predictive
model
directs
the
police
to
look
at
a
particular
block
for
burglaries
then
it
may
encourage
the
police
to
see
suspicious
behavior
when
there
may
be
none
n
the
danger
here
is
that
an
overreliance
on
the
objectivity
of
prediction
which
is
in
fact
an
informed
probabilistic
guess
will
be
determinative
rather
than
a
supplement
to
independent
assessments
by
the
police
b
privacy
and
surveillance
big
data
what
we
do
in
public
can
be
seen
by
anyone
and
therefore
we
generally
cannot
claim
those
activities
are
private
that
intuition
is
embodied
in
the
katz
reasonable
expectation
of
privacy
test
to
determine
whether
the
fourth
amendment
applies
to
police
activity
at
all
n
but
does
assuming
the
risk
of
police
surveillance
mean
something
different
when
the
police
have
mass
surveillance
capabilities
computer
enhanced
mass
surveillance
systems
would
seem
to
be
the
latest
example
of
the
increasing
sophistication
of
police
technologies
to
monitor
public
activity
decades
of
police
reliance
upon
cctv
cameras
electronic
beepers
listening
devices
surveillance
aircraft
and
other
similar
sense
enhancements
have
prompted
concerns
that
these
measures
have
significantly
eroded
any
social
sense
of
privacy
individuals
have
in
public
n
indeed
the
supreme
court
has
emphasized
in
a
number
of
cases
that
our
public
activities
movements
and
even
our
literal
physical
characteristics
visible
to
the
public
lack
fourth
amendment
protection
n
moreover
a
line
of
supreme
court
cases
suggests
that
any
scientific
enhancement
of
the
senses
used
by
the
police
to
watch
activity
falls
outside
of
the
fourth
amendment
s
protections
if
the
activity
takes
place
in
public
n
thus
the
supreme
court
concluded
in
united
states
v
knotts
that
police
use
of
an
electronic
beeper
to
follow
a
suspect
surreptitiously
did
not
constitute
a
fourth
amendment
search
n
the
premise
underlying
such
a
conclusion
is
that
if
the
police
could
themselves
pursue
a
suspect
over
the
same
public
roads
then
so
too
could
an
electronic
beeper
concealed
within
a
container
given
to
the
unwitting
suspect
n
the
surveillance
capacities
of
the
police
today
however
far
exceed
even
what
armies
of
police
officers
could
accomplish
without
access
to
big
data
n
that
difference
should
alter
the
absence
of
fourth
amendment
protections
indeed
several
justices
have
recently
indicated
concerns
about
the
big
data
surveillance
capacities
of
the
police
n
for
example
in
united
states
v
jones
n
regarding
the
twenty
eight
day
gps
tracking
of
a
single
suspect
n
five
justices
expressed
concerns
that
long
term
police
surveillance
even
of
a
person
s
public
movements
might
constitute
a
fourth
amendment
search
n
the
premise
here
sometimes
referred
to
as
the
mosaic
theory
is
that
the
danger
to
fourth
amendment
privacy
lies
in
the
aggregation
of
discrete
bits
of
data
even
if
each
piece
standing
alone
would
not
be
subjected
to
constitutional
protections
n
indeed
the
majority
in
knotts
acknowledged
that
dragnet
type
law
enforcement
practices
such
as
twenty
four
hour
surveillance
of
any
citizen
of
this
country
might
raise
a
fourth
amendment
problem
while
the
use
of
a
beeper
did
not
n
not
only
is
the
quantity
of
information
collected
in
the
big
data
context
far
greater
the
very
nature
of
surveillance
itself
is
different
if
conventional
surveillance
involves
the
intentional
tracking
of
one
or
a
few
suspects
by
actual
police
officers
what
happens
when
a
person
emerges
as
a
surveillance
target
as
a
result
of
a
computer
analysis
in
the
traditional
surveillance
context
the
police
have
not
been
constrained
by
the
fourth
amendment
so
long
as
their
investigations
neither
interfered
with
an
individual
s
movements
nor
ranged
beyond
public
spaces
n
as
the
supreme
court
has
observed
there
is
no
constitutional
right
to
be
free
from
police
investigation
n
but
this
surveillance
discretion
may
mean
something
different
in
the
big
data
context
the
intentional
surveillance
of
targeted
individuals
is
not
equivalent
to
the
perpetual
indiscriminate
data
collection
n
of
entire
populations
while
both
approaches
involve
watching
by
the
government
a
program
like
the
n
y
p
d
s
total
domain
awareness
system
differs
from
traditional
surveillance
enough
to
warrant
a
different
approach
n
the
very
quality
of
public
life
may
be
different
when
government
watches
everyone
surreptitiously
and
stores
all
of
the
resulting
information
n
practical
barriers
have
long
served
to
protect
individual
privacy
by
forcing
the
police
to
selectively
apply
their
resources
and
interests
n
but
those
barriers
have
now
largely
eroded
n
the
ability
of
government
to
record
store
and
analyze
nearly
everything
we
do
is
now
becoming
technologically
possible
and
affordable
n
by
it
will
cost
just
two
cents
to
store
all
of
the
audio
data
generated
by
the
average
person
in
one
year
storing
a
year
s
worth
of
a
person
s
movements
generated
by
their
cellphone
will
cost
next
to
nothing
n
these
expanded
capabilities
raise
the
possibility
of
a
surveillance
time
machine
the
capacity
of
the
government
to
identify
a
person
of
interest
and
then
search
retrospectively
through
all
of
the
data
that
has
been
stored
and
collected
about
that
person
n
while
some
people
have
already
changed
their
personal
habits
to
avoid
this
mass
surveillance
many
likely
have
not
n
the
longstanding
doctrines
declaring
that
we
lack
any
fourth
amendment
protections
in
the
public
sphere
should
not
hold
its
traditional
force
once
the
police
deploy
the
tools
of
big
data
n
knowing
exposure
suggests
a
degree
of
control
over
one
s
information
that
is
lacking
when
the
government
is
capable
of
recording
and
storing
every
small
detail
in
perpetuity
n
thus
the
traditional
assumptions
about
fourth
amendment
protections
in
public
spaces
absent
statutory
protections
from
congress
call
out
for
reexamination
and
doctrinal
adaptation
c
repurposing
information
google
s
reuse
of
search
terms
to
identify
flu
outbreaks
represents
an
upending
of
a
core
research
convention
formulate
a
hypothesis
first
and
then
collect
the
appropriate
data
n
with
big
data
we
can
collect
nearly
all
the
data
first
and
apply
the
questions
later
n
indeed
the
data
can
be
analyzed
in
multiple
ways
at
multiple
times
n
it
is
this
repurposing
or
resifting
of
data
that
has
led
to
some
of
big
data
s
unexpected
insights
like
google
s
flu
analysis
when
it
is
the
police
who
sift
through
the
data
however
the
fourth
amendment
is
ill
suited
to
this
particular
relationship
of
data
collection
and
analysis
the
fourth
amendment
is
primarily
interested
in
the
legitimacy
of
how
information
is
acquired
n
if
the
acquisition
is
permissible
how
the
police
use
that
information
thereafter
is
generally
not
subject
to
an
additional
fourth
amendment
challenge
n
this
suggests
that
once
legitimately
within
the
government
s
possession
information
can
be
repurposed
and
reanalyzed
without
any
additional
fourth
amendment
justification
n
in
the
case
of
genetic
information
courts
have
been
generally
dismissive
of
claims
that
individuals
have
any
fourth
amendment
claims
to
dna
samples
once
lawfully
acquired
by
the
police
but
used
for
investigative
purposes
unrelated
to
the
original
justification
for
the
sample
s
collection
n
is
a
secondary
analysis
of
an
individual
s
dna
sample
to
find
a
familial
match
sufficiently
similar
to
an
analysis
to
find
whether
that
same
individual
is
responsible
for
another
crime
are
there
other
sorts
of
information
to
be
derived
from
dna
samples
that
ought
to
require
distinct
fourth
amendment
justifications
repurposing
a
dna
sample
to
look
for
information
regarding
someone
other
than
the
source
of
the
sample
raises
sufficient
privacy
concerns
that
some
further
government
justifications
may
be
necessary
n
such
a
search
does
more
than
identify
again
the
source
of
the
dna
sample
in
a
subsequent
police
investigation
n
the
government
s
ability
to
reanalyze
information
of
any
sort
in
the
age
of
big
data
calls
out
for
a
new
approach
what
courts
could
do
is
shift
the
focus
of
the
fourth
amendment
from
data
collection
to
a
more
rigorous
scrutiny
of
its
intended
uses
by
the
government
n
indeed
harold
krent
proposed
nearly
twenty
years
ago
that
the
repurposing
of
information
by
the
government
obtained
at
an
earlier
time
could
be
deemed
unreasonable
for
fourth
amendment
purposes
n
professor
krent
suggested
for
instance
that
courts
might
consider
whether
the
seizure
of
a
person
s
information
would
have
been
reasonable
had
the
government
articulated
the
later
use
initially
n
the
closer
the
government
s
secondary
purpose
is
to
its
original
purpose
at
the
time
of
acquisition
the
more
likely
it
should
be
that
the
government
could
use
the
data
without
further
justification
the
case
for
fourth
amendment
protections
regarding
repurposed
information
is
stronger
still
should
the
government
one
day
be
interested
in
gleaning
information
from
dna
samples
other
than
matching
profiles
to
crime
scene
samples
here
the
supreme
court
has
hinted
at
a
willingness
to
reassess
the
balance
of
privacy
and
government
utility
at
some
future
date
in
maryland
v
king
n
in
which
the
court
upheld
the
compulsory
collection
of
dna
from
arrestees
n
justice
kennedy
suggested
that
if
in
the
future
police
analyze
dna
samples
to
determine
other
information
that
case
would
present
additional
privacy
concerns
not
present
here
n
the
resolution
by
the
court
regarding
such
a
dispute
may
well
turn
however
on
the
purposes
claimed
by
the
government
to
mine
that
information
in
king
the
court
was
willing
to
permit
defendant
s
cheek
swab
and
the
subsequently
generated
dna
profile
without
individualized
suspicion
because
the
police
were
permitted
to
find
out
king
s
identity
a
term
broad
enough
to
encompass
any
other
crimes
king
had
committed
n
for
now
however
the
court
has
left
open
the
possibility
that
it
may
give
greater
scrutiny
to
some
sorts
of
repurposing
that
plus
the
existing
statutory
protections
on
access
and
disclosure
may
allay
the
concerns
of
many
n
yet
it
would
be
overly
optimistic
to
ignore
two
developments
in
the
other
direction
the
trend
of
fourth
amendment
law
away
from
protection
in
these
secondary
searches
and
the
court
s
recent
expansion
of
what
the
government
may
do
for
purposes
of
identification
when
it
comes
to
genetic
information
n
d
beyond
the
fourth
amendment
apart
from
the
fourth
amendment
challenges
raised
by
big
data
policing
an
uncritical
embrace
of
these
new
technologies
raises
other
concerns
beyond
regulating
the
police
whether
practical
or
abstract
these
concerns
will
be
easily
swept
aside
by
departments
eager
to
be
part
of
the
next
technological
wave
in
policing
first
many
of
these
new
technologies
have
been
developed
by
private
companies
whose
motivations
and
concerns
may
not
always
be
consonant
with
those
of
a
public
police
department
for
instance
ibm
has
spent
billions
acquiring
data
analytics
companies
in
order
to
develop
and
market
predictive
tools
to
the
police
n
although
predpol
was
initially
developed
by
academics
it
is
now
a
for
profit
company
n
similarly
microsoft
and
the
n
y
p
d
will
profit
from
every
new
police
department
that
adopts
a
total
domain
awareness
system
n
future
interest
in
the
further
analysis
of
dna
samples
will
also
benefit
some
private
laboratories
second
the
introduction
of
new
big
data
technologies
requires
attention
not
only
to
appropriate
regulation
but
also
to
questions
about
how
well
these
privately
developed
tools
actually
help
to
reduce
crime
new
technologies
possess
understandable
appeal
for
departments
seeking
innovative
crime
fighting
strategies
new
strategies
lend
themselves
toward
positive
media
attention
in
a
way
that
a
poorly
attended
community
meeting
in
a
church
basement
does
not
n
yet
for
profit
purveyors
of
big
data
products
may
not
provide
the
best
objective
assessment
of
their
products
the
desirability
of
these
new
technologies
should
not
steer
attention
away
from
questions
about
how
well
they
reduce
crime
and
conserve
limited
public
resources
compared
to
traditional
methods
a
final
concern
is
much
more
fundamental
the
reliance
on
big
data
by
the
police
also
poses
the
risk
that
the
very
definition
of
policing
may
be
changing
the
promise
of
big
data
is
a
vision
of
policing
that
is
driven
and
assessed
by
quantitative
measurements
indeed
those
police
chiefs
that
have
already
embraced
big
data
tout
the
potential
to
rely
on
numbers
when
budgets
for
police
departments
are
shrinking
n
the
problem
however
is
that
a
technocratic
solution
to
crime
is
not
the
only
objective
of
democratic
policing
n
reducing
crime
is
not
the
only
job
of
the
police
policing
as
an
institution
has
never
been
amenable
to
a
single
objective
n
and
indeed
over
time
its
aims
have
shifted
n
what
is
clear
however
is
that
democratic
policing
aims
at
more
than
mere
crime
control
and
at
its
core
relies
on
skills
that
do
not
always
lend
themselves
to
statistical
analysis
no
amount
of
data
driven
policing
is
likely
to
assuage
communities
soured
by
long
histories
of
tension
with
the
police
nor
will
demonstrations
of
little
red
boxes
on
a
smartphone
necessarily
justify
to
a
community
the
need
for
a
heavy
handed
police
presence
conclusion
the
use
of
big
data
is
likely
to
become
an
ordinary
aspect
of
policing
the
application
of
artificial
intelligence
to
crime
data
promises
immediate
and
tangible
benefits
we
can
gain
some
real
insights
about
how
to
direct
police
resources
efficiently
and
effectively
in
ways
that
intuition
tradition
and
limited
information
have
been
unavailing
at
the
same
time
the
reliance
upon
artificial
intelligence
and
the
collection
of
vast
amounts
of
information
poses
some
special
challenges
in
the
policing
context
courts
and
legislatures
will
need
to
think
of
fourth
amendment

new

introduction
over
the
last
decade
police
departments
have
begun
to
employ
predictive
crime
software
pcs
as
a
tool
designed
to
reduce
crime
by
forecasting
the
likely
locations
of
future
crimes
and
enabling
efficient
resource
allocation
this
software
uses
complex
algorithms
and
regression
models
to
identify
hotspots
or
large
regions
of
increased
criminal
activity
a
number
of
software
companies
such
as
ibm
predpol
and
aseva
develop
this
software
specifically
for
police
departments
this
paper
begins
by
giving
a
brief
history
of
how
data
has
influenced
police
action
in
recent
decades
and
how
police
have
come
to
use
modern
predictive
policing
it
then
proceeds
to
discuss
the
relevant
constitutional
issues
surrounding
stops
and
reasonable
suspicion
n
by
characterizing
areas
of
criminal
activity
this
software
directly
raises
the
issue
of
high
crime
areas
hca
within
the
context
of
fourth
amendment
analysis
n
the
fourth
amendment
provides
the
right
of
the
people
to
be
secure
in
their
persons
houses
papers
and
effects
against
unreasonable
searches
and
seizures
n
in
in
terry
v
ohio
n
the
supreme
court
held
that
an
officer
is
permitted
to
briefly
detain
an
individual
without
violating
his
fourth
amendment
rights
when
he
observes
unusual
conduct
which
leads
him
reasonably
to
conclude
in
light
of
his
experience
that
criminal
activity
may
be
afoot
n
stops
conducted
on
this
basis
have
become
known
as
terry
stops
in
illinois
v
wardlow
n
the
court
relaxed
the
standards
for
determining
reasonable
suspicion
within
hcas
n
this
holding
permits
an
officer
to
find
sufficient
reasonable
suspicion
to
conduct
a
stop
when
a
suspect
flees
upon
sight
of
that
officer
n
more
generally
wardlow
suggests
that

wardlow
challenged
the

the
grounds
that
the

the
reasonable
suspicion
necessary
to
conduct
the

the
illinois

conclusion
that

that
sudden
flight

not
create
a
reasonable
suspicion

the
court
explained
although

the
right
to
approach
individuals

ask
questions
the
individual
has
no
obligation
to
respond
the
person
may
decline
to
answer

simply
go
on
his
or
her
way

the
refusal
to
respond
alone
does
not
provide
a
legitimate
basis
for
an
investigative
stop
flight
may
simply
be
an
exercise
of
this
right
to
go
on
one
s
way

thus
could
not
constitute
reasonable
suspicion
justifying
a
terry

upon
the
reasoning

characteristics

suspicious

the

may
include

considerations

that

unprovoked
flight

flight

its

nature

agreed
that

however
the
illinois

court
found
that
officers
stopped

outside

that
court
held
the
high

area
should
be
a
sufficiently
localized
and
identifiable
location
to
pass
constitutional
muster

the
illinois
supreme

reversed
this
finding

that
the
reviewing

upholding
the
illinois

the
united

supreme
court
held
that
an
officer

personal
judgment
based
on
his
experience
rather
than
empirical
evidence
is
sufficient
to
characterize
the
area
as
a
hca

bases

the
court
in
wardlow
rejected
the
proposed
per
se
rule
argued
by
wardlow
the
fact
that
a
person
flees
upon
seeing
the
police
can
never
by
itself
be
sufficient
to
justify
a
temporary
investigative
stop
n
it
also
rejected
the
government
s
proposed
per
se
rule
that
flight
is
necessarily
indicative
of
ongoing
criminal
activity
n
wardlow
attempted
to
strike
a
balance
between
these
rules
by
modifying
the
degree
of
suspicion
that
attaches
to
a
person
s
flight
and
the
range
of
commonsense
conclusions
that
an
officer
may
reach
respecting
the
motives
behind
that
flight
n
for
example
in
a
low
crime
area
officers
might
view
flight
as
an
effort
to
catch
a
bus
where
as
in
a
high
crime
area
they
might
view
a
fleeing
person
as
someone
in
possession
of
contraband
n
thus
when
within
a
hca
an
officer
may
reasonably
suspect
a
sufficient
probability
of
criminal
activity
to
conduct
a
stop
from
behavior
otherwise
viewed
as
innocent

boosting
the
probability
of
criminal
activity

how
these
characteristics
are
established

in
united

v
montero
camargo
n
the
ninth
circuit
rejected
the
notion
that
an
officer
s
subjective
beliefs
of
a
person
s
race
and
location
may
constitute
a
relevant
or
appropriate
factor
to
consider

that

should
examine
with
care
the
specific
data
underlying
any
assertion
of
a
hca

finding
that
a
hca
can
justify
an
otherwise
illegal
stop
the
majority
further
instructed
district
courts
to
carefully
examine
the
testimony
of
police
officers
in
cases
such
as
this
and
make
a
fair
and
forthright
evaluation
of
the
evidence
they
offer

in
united

v
bonner
n
the
third
circuit
also
sought
empirical
determination
of
hcas
the
arresting
officer
in
bonner
justified
his
arrest
based
on
reasonable
suspicion
by
characterizing
the
relevant
area
as
a
high
narcotics
trafficking
area
n
the
government
defended
this
position
with
evidence
indicating
that
an
average
of
arrests
were
made
per
week
near
the
place
of
the
stop
and
the
majority
of
these
were
for
misdemeanor
or
summary
offenses

and
a
newspaper
article
describing
the
location
as
within
a
high
crime
area
n
the
district
court
rejected
the
government
s
argument
after
finding
that
the
crime
rate
failed
to
characterize
the
area
as
a
hca
given
its
large
population

while
the
third
circuit
reversed
the
district
court
on
grounds
other
than
the
hca
issue
judge
smith
in
his
concurrence
discussed
the
evidentiary
standard
required
to
appropriately
characterize
an
area
as
a
hca

specifically
he
stated
that
the
government
must
prove
the
existence
of
objective
criteria
for
what
constitutes
a
high
crime
area
and
that
the
stop
occurred
in
such
an
area
or
rather
the
government
is
required
to
prove
that
officers
effecting
the
stop
had
a
reasonable
articulable
basis
to
believe
that
they
were
in
a
high
crime
area
n
similarly
in
united
states
v
wright
n
the
first
circuit
held
that
the
finding
of
a
hca
generally
entails
an
examination
of
the
nexus
between
the
type
of
crime
most
prevalent
or
common
in
the
area
and
the
type
of
crime
suspected
in
the
instant
case
within
the
limited
geographic
boundaries
of
the
area

neighborhood

that
is
a
temporal
proximity
must
exist
between
evidence
of
heightened
criminal
activity

the
date

the
attempts
of
these
district
and
circuit
courts
to
establish
a
quantifiable
framework
for
delineating
hcas
the
wardlow
court
specifically
stated
that
courts
do
not
have
available
empirical
studies
dealing
with
inferences
drawn
from
suspicious
behavior
and
we
cannot
reasonably
demand
scientific
certainty
from
judges

law
enforcement
officers
where
none
exists
n
wardlow
held
that
courts
should
defer
to
an
officer
s
determination
as
to
reasonable
suspicion
based
on
his
or
her
commonsense
judgments
and
inferences
about
human
behavior
n
as
described
above
crime
analysts
necessarily
exercise
a
high
degree
of
discretion
when
deciding
how
to
geographically
represent
regions
of
increased
criminal
activity
n
the
analyst
is
capable
of
tailoring
these
regions
to
tightly
conform
to
crime
incidents
or
link
distant
incidents
to
characterize
larger
regions
n
in
wardlow
by
some
mechanism
independent
of
the
arresting
officer
the
chicago
police
department
identified
certain
areas
within
the
city
s
eleventh
district
d
as
hcas
n
the
officers
stopped
wardlow
while
on
their
way
to
an
area
within
d
known
for
high
narcotics
traffic
n
admittedly
the
officers
had
not
yet
reached
the
area
of
known
criminal
activity
n
however
the
court
permitted
the
officer
to
rely
on
the
nature
of
that
area
to
color
the
character
of
wardlow
s
location
based
upon
the
officer
s
experience
in
investigating
areas
in
which
narcotics
were
sold
it
was
common
for
there
to
be
weapons
in
the
near
vicinity
n
therefore
once
a
crime
analyst
identifies
a
hotspot
or
a
hca
and
transmits
that
information
to
the
street
level
officer
courts
should
defer
to
his
subjective
rationalizations
and
conclusions
drawn
from
his
experience
n
the
supreme
court
has
permitted
officers
to
consider
information
from
sources
such
as
informants
in
their
reasonable
suspicion
analysis
wardlow
cited
adams
v
williams
n
where
a
police
officer
relied
on
an
informant
s
tip
in
conducting
a
terry
like
stop
n
in
illinois
v
gates
aguilar
v
texas
n
and
spinelli
v
united

n
the
supreme
court
dealt
with
police
informants
ability
to
provide
qualitatively
sufficient
information
for
a
neutral
detached
magistrate
to
find
probable
cause
until
gates
courts
applied
a
two
prong
test
outlined
in
aguilar
and
spinelli
to
determine
whether
an
informant
s
tip
provides
sufficient
predictive
value
to
establish
probable
cause
and
whether
an
informant
s
tips
can
just
like
hcas
give
suspicious
color
to
the
otherwise
innocent
behavior
contained
in
a
suspect
s
police
report
n
the
pre
gates
test
required
revealing
the
informant
s
basis
of
knowledge
and
providing
sufficient
facts
to
establish
either
the
informant
s
veracity
or
the
reliability
of
the
informant
s
report
n
thus
in
accordance
with
this
test
warrant
applications
necessarily
contain
additional
corroborating
information
to
allow
the
magistrate
to
independently
judge
the
validity
of
the
informant
s
allegation
an
affiant
officer
swearing
upon
its
reliability
would
fail
to
provide
sufficient
ground
for
a
magistrate
to
find
the
allegations
reliable
n
even
if
partially
corroborated
the
magistrate
must
find
the
tip
independently
trustworthy
when
standing
alone
from
the
other
allegations
contained
in
the
application
n
the
informant
must
also
provide
a
sufficient
statement
of
the
underlying
circumstances
from
which
the
informer
derived
his
allegations
and
be
able
to
explain
why
his
statements
are
reliable
n
thus
even
if
an
informant
s
tip
corroborates
other
information
contained
in
the
warrant
application
it
would
fail
to
ripen
into
a
judgment
that
a
crime
was
probably
being
committed
and
provide
a
basis
for
probable
cause
n
however
the
spinelli
majority
held
that
when
incapable
of
explaining
how
the
information
was
gathered
it
is
especially
important
that
the
tip
describe
the
accused
s
criminal
activity
in
sufficient
detail
that
the
magistrate
may
know
that
he
is
relying
on
something
more
substantial
than
a
casual
rumor
circulating
in
the
underworld
or
an
accusation
based
merely
on
an
individual
s
general
reputation
n
justice
white
criticized
the
majority
s
conclusion
that
draper
v
united
states
n
provided
the
proper
benchmark
of
detail
sufficient
for
probable
cause
n
in
draper
the
informant
reported
that
draper
would
arrive
in
denver
on
a
train
from
chicago
on
one
of
two
days
supplied
a
fairly
detailed
physical
description
predicted
that
he
would
be
wearing
a
light
colored
raincoat
brown
slacks
and
black
shoes
would
be
walking
real
fast
and
that
he
would
be
carrying
a
quantity
of
heroin
n
while
the
descriptive
facts
reinforced
the
honesty
of
the
informant
and
were
verified
by
the
officers
at
the
train
station
they
could
have
been
obtained
from
others
and
the
presence
of
narcotics
may
have
been
merely
inferred
from
circumstances
which
a
magistrate
would
find
unacceptable
n
thus
justice
white
rejected
the
majority
s
suggestion
that
when
an
informant
is
right
about
some
things
he
is
more
probably
right
about
other
facts
usually
the
critical
unverified
facts
n
despite
justice
white
s
concerns
the
gates
court
adopted
a
totality
of
circumstances
test
that
dispatched
with
spinelli
s
veracity
prong
n
under
gates
informants
need
not
provide
the
basis
for
their
information
when
they
have
proven
highly
reliable
in
the
past
or
when
corroboration
through
other
sources
of
information
reduced
the
chances
of
a
reckless
or
prevaricating
tale
of
a
highly
detailed
anonymous
tip
n
the
majority
explained
that
probable
cause
does
not
demand
the
certainty
we
associate
with
formal
trials
because
a
court
may
find
a
fair
probability
of
the
information
s
validity
sufficient
through
investigative
corroboration
n
adams
is
particularly
relevant
to
pcs
because
it
deals
with
the
degree
of
information
that
an
officer
might
receive
that
is
insufficient
to
provide
probable
cause
yet
sufficient
to
find
reasonable
suspicion
n
this
case
occurred
pre
gates
and
was
thus
subjected
to
the
higher
aguilar
spinelli
standard
as
a
result
it
would
survive
the
gates
standard
in
adams
a
known
informant
informed
an
officer
that
an
individual
seated
in
a
nearby
vehicle
was
carrying
narcotics
and
had
a
gun
at
his
waist
n
the
officer
then
approached
the
vehicle
tapped
on
the
car
window
and
asked
the
occupant
to
open
the
door
n
when
the
occupant
rolled
down
the
window
the
officer
reached
into
the
car
and
removed
a
fully
loaded
revolver
from
his
waistband
n
while
the
gun
was
not
initially
visible
to
the
officer
outside
the
car
it
was
in
the
precise
location
indicated
by
the
informant
n
the
plaintiff
challenged
the
legitimacy
of
the
search
and
seizure
of
his
weapon
under
terry
for
lacking
a
reliable
informant
or
some
corroboration
of
the
tip
n
the
court
explained
that
an
officer
is
not
prohibited
from
investigating
possible
criminal
behavior
in
the
absence
of
probable
cause
and
that
the
fourth
amendment
does
not
require
a
policeman
who
lacks
the
precise
level
of
information
necessary
for
probable
cause
to
arrest
to
simply
shrug
his
shoulders
and
allow
a
crime
to
occur
or
a
criminal
to
escape
n
thus
even
if
an
informant
s
unverified
tip
may
have
been
insufficient
for
a
narcotics
arrest
or
search
warrant
the
information
may
carry
enough
indicia
of
reliability
to
justify
the
officer
s
forcible
stop
n
the
fact
that
the
officer
knew
the
informant
provided
a
sufficient
indicia
of
reliability
but
informants
tips
like
all
other
clues
and
evidence
vary
greatly
in
their
value
and
reliability
n
as
a
result
some
tips
might
require
further
investigation
whereas
others
such
as
when
a
victim
is
on
the
street
seeking
immediate
police
aid
and
provides
a
description
may
warrant
a
more
immediate
police
response
n
officers
may
reasonably

the

trial
court

make
factual
findings
about
whether

crime
analysts
to
expand
the
size
of
their
geographical
projections
to
ensure
a
level
of
objectivity
municipal
councils
should
establish
procedures
to
verify
the
accuracy
of
collected
information
specifically
identifying
individual
procedures
to
correct
inaccurate
information
and
clearly
articulated
standards
for
setting
thresholds
regarding
the
geographic
influence
of
crime
incidents
and
crime
clusters
crime
analysts
should
avoid
designating
large
segments
of
cities
as
hcas
without
an
objective
basis
municipalities
should
require
crime
analysts
to
follow
procedural
standards
before
transmitting
data
directly
to
street
level
officers
by
indicating
the
basis
for
providing
such
information
for
example
crime
analysts
might
transmit
that
there
were
burglaries
in
the
last
hours
at
locations
a
b
c
n
to
an
officer
analysts
should
accompany
this
type
of
data
with
explanatory
information
to
prevent
the
officer
from
increasing
his
suspicion
of
all
individuals
within
the
area
in
other
words
crime
analysts
should
avoid
providing
data
that
leads
to
global
characterizations
independent
pcs
departments
should
also
enforce
mechanisms
that
ensure
the
quality
of
their
data
in
terms
of
censoring
and
relevance
generally
censoring
suggests
an
underreporting
of
crime
data
that
would
lead
to
a
failure
of
recognizing
areas
of
increased
criminal
activity
n
however
some
censoring
is
required
to
ensure
that
the
data
accurately
reflects
existing
crime
patterns
n
for
example
if
an
analyst
applies
a
region
s
burglary
data
from
the
past
five
years
the
resulting
map
might
characterize
the
entire
region
as
high
in
burglary
while
this
might
serve
a
policy
to
crack
down
on
crime
throughout
the
region
it
comes
at
the
expense
of
fourth
amendment
protections
recognizing
these
failures
mayor
de
blasio
has
considered
appointing
an
independent
monitor
to
mitigate
police
violations
n
in
sum
cities
should
remove
crime
analysts
from
the
police
command
structure
and
place
them
within
independent
agencies
that
have
been
structured
to
ensure
objective
analysis
conclusion
a
growing
number
of
municipalities
have
adopted
pcs
as
a
tool
designed
to
efficiently
allocate
resources
by
identifying
areas
of
heightened
criminal
activity
this
software
uses
regression
analysis
to
forecast
the
probable
location
of
future
criminal
activity
n
these
regression
formulas
consider
past
criminal
activity
weather
and
traffic
patterns
holiday
and
payday
information
and
rely
on
certain
behavioral
theories
to
produce
these
forecasts
n
the
software
can
identify
areas
of
probable
criminal
activity
as
large
as
a
borough
or
as
specific
as
a
feet
by
feet
area
n
cities
that
have
implemented
this
software
claim
that
it
has
successfully
reduced
both
crime
and
costs
n
however
the
experience
over
the
last
decade
most
apparent
in
new
york
city
suggests
that
this
software
has
worked
to
erode
the
public
s
fourth
amendment
protection
from
unreasonable
stops
and
searches
terry
permits
officers
to
stop
individuals
without
violating
their
fourth
amendments
rights
when
able
to
articulate
something
more
than
an
inchoate
and
unparticularized
suspicion
or
hunch
n
i
e
a
particularized
and
objective
basis
for
suspecting
legal
wrongdoing
n
adams
and
wardlow
permit
officers
to
consider
the
character
of
an
area
among
the
relevant
contextual
considerations
in
a
terry
analysis
n
adams
explained
that
the
information
an
officer
receives
from
a
known
source
can
influence
his
perception
of
the
area
around
him
n
under
wardlow
conduct
with
both
innocent
and
guilty
explanations
such
as
flight
can
be
characterized
as
suspicious
within
a
hca
whereas
outside
of
these
areas
such
conduct
must
be
viewed
as
innocent
n
pcs
serves
as
a
type
of
known
informant
and
provides
officers
with
the
requisite
minimal
level
of
objective
justification
to
conduct
a
terry
stop
pcs
analysts
exert
a
substantial
degree
of
control
over
the
evidentiary
production
the
particularized
and
objective
basis
for
conducting
a
terry
stop
whenever
they
transmit
hotspot
or
hca
information
to
an
officer
in
many
cities
mayors
appoint
the
police
chiefs
and
commissioners
n
these
officers
carry
out
the
mayor
s
political
and
policy
objectives
by
reallocating
their
police
department
s
resources
n
this
might
lead
those
crime
analysts
existing
within
such
police
departments
to
increase
or
reduce
the
size
and
number
of
hcas
depending
on
the
department
s
overall
objects
n
as
a
result
the
information
they
provide
to
street
level
officers
may
lack
an
objective
basis
of
factual
support
for
example
crime
analysts
might
exaggerate
the
number
of
hotspots
or
geographic
size
of
hcas
in
order
to
serve
political
and
policy
objectives
n
furthermore
while
circuit
courts
have
asked
government
prosecutors
to
evidence
hcas
with
empirical
analysis
wardlow
rejects
this
line
of
inquiry
focusing
instead
on
the
officer
s
common
sense
judgments
and
inference
about
human
behavior
n
the
supreme
court
also
rejected
the
notion
of
submitting
the
various
elements
of
the
officer
s
reasonable
suspicion
to
varying
evidentiary
standards
n
as
a
result
challenges
to
terry
stops
within
hcas
for
lack
of
empirical
evidence
tend
to
fail
because
wardlow
instructs
courts
to
focus
their
review
on
the
officer
s
judgment
due
to
this
evidentiary
barrier
municipalities
should
structure
the
implementation
of
pcs
such
that
the
hca
identification
process
preserves
individuals
fourth
amendment
rights
before
the
police
conduct
terry
stops
to
do
so
this
comment
recommends
that
municipalities
transfer
the
crime
analysts
operating
pcs
out
of
the
police
command
structure
into
an
independent
department
or
agency
within
this
framework
police
departments
would
request
or
regularly
receive
unbiased
data
and
geographic
mapping
from
the
independent
pcs
departments
this
arrangement
works
to
prevent
the
type
of
borough
sized
hca
classifications
seen
in
new
york
that
arise
when
officers
use
their
own
experience
to
inflate
the
geographic
area
of
a
hca
identified
by
crime
analysts
in
wardlow
the
officer
stopped
the
suspect
on
his
way
to
a
hca
that
had
been
identified
by
a
mechanism
independent
of
the
officer
s
experience
based
on
that
hca
the
officer
applied
his
own
experience
to
characterize
the
surrounding
region
as
a
hca
n
his
characterization
combined
with
the
suspect
s
flight
justified
the
resulting
terry
stop
the
independent
pcs
department
should
transmit
crime
data
and
mapping
to
officers
with
narrowly
tailored
geographic
zones
within
an
independent
agency
crime
analysts
can
provide
objective
analysis
and
narrowly
tailored
hotspots
that
will
mitigate
this
expansion
effect
and
ultimately
reduce

olmsted
said
the

they

also

as

he

to

to

i
don

i
believe
it
s
been
best
by
poor

poor

he
said
choose
wisely
levenson
the
criminal

professor
said
the
new

must
meet
stringent
criteria
i
think
integrity
is
key
she
said
it
should
be
somebody
who
s
experienced
in
law
enforcement
and
who
has
the
confidence
of
law

personnel
he
should
be
a
good

politically
savvy
and
with
a
great
deal
of
courage
to
take
on
the
different
issues
that
confront
the
county
from
homeland
security
to
modern
approaches
toward

even
inmate

and
penal
reform
she
added
if
a
candidate
were
to
win
the
majority
of
votes
on

the
county
board
of

could
remove
interim
sheriff
john

and
appoint
the
sheriff
elect
to
lead
the
department
immediately
if
no
candidate
exceeds
percent
the
top
two
would
face
a
runoff
election
on
nov
and
the
winner
would
be
sworn
in
dec
if
voters
choose
poorly
the
consequences
can
be
costly
literally
county
taxpayers
paid
about
million
last

on
the

of

american

legal

said
i
believe
most

would
rather
spend
that
on
new
parks
a
better
health
care
system
et
cetera
than
jury
verdicts
and
settlements
for
sheriff
s
department
malfeasance
he
added
if
voters
make
a
mistake
they
may
have
to
live
with
it
for
a
long
long
time
there
are
no
term
limits
on
a
sheriff
even
though
incumbents
are
up
for
re
election
every
four
years
they
have
virtually
insurmountable
advantages
over
challengers
to
be
viable
candidates
would

county
from
the
los

basin
to
the
san
fernando
san
gabriel
santa
clarita
and

valleys
and
even
catalina

the
sheriff
s
department
was
created
in
back
when
los

was
the

and
deputies
rode
in

there

stressed
a

is
vital
to

until
there
s
new

and
an
ongoing
independent
civilian
eye
similar
to

that
never
moves

away
from

we
re
going

some
of

repeat
themselves
she

the

however
blamed

for

trusted

apples

what
happened
to
this

olmsted
said
the

set

they

i
cannot

destroy

already
have
he

senior

lou

is
a
former

who
also
volunteered
in
the
lasd
as
a

deputy
sheriff
for
four

and
holds
a

he
plans
to

fighting
by
using
computer
statistics

and
to
install
additional

even
in

to

i
don
t
believe
the

has
been
beset
by
corruption
or

i
believe
it
s
been
best
by
poor
management
poor

he
said
choose
wisely
levenson
the
criminal
law
professor
said
the
new
sheriff
must
meet
stringent
criteria
i
think
integrity
is
key
she
said
it
should
be
somebody
who
s
experienced
in
law
enforcement
and
who
has
the
confidence
of
law
enforcement
personnel
he
should
be
a
good
manager
politically
savvy
and
with
a
great
deal
of
courage
to
take
on
the
different
issues
that
confront
the
county
from
homeland
security
to
modern
approaches
toward
law
enforcement
even
inmate
rehabilitation
and
penal
reform
she
added
if
a
candidate
were
to
win
the
majority
of
votes
on
june
the
county
board
of
supervisors
could
remove
interim
sheriff
john
scott
and
appoint
the
sheriff
elect
to
lead
the
department
immediately
if
no
candidate
exceeds
percent
the
top
two
would
face
a
runoff
election
on
nov
and
the
winner
would
be
sworn
in
dec
if
voters
choose
poorly
the
consequences
can
be
costly
literally
county
taxpayers
paid
about
million
last
year
in
settlements
and
jury
verdicts
for
illegal
behavior
on
the
part
of
the

american
civil

union
legal
director
peter

said
i
believe
most

would
rather
spend
that
on
new
parks
a
better
health
care
system
et
cetera
than
jury
verdicts
and
settlements
for
sheriff
s
department
malfeasance
he
added
if
voters
make
a
mistake
they
may
have
to
live
with
it
for
a
long
long
time
there
are
no
term
limits
on
a
sheriff
even
though
incumbents
are
up
for
re
election
every
four
years
they
have
virtually
insurmountable
advantages
over
challengers
to
be
viable
candidates

county
from
the
los

basin
to
the
san
fernando
san
gabriel
santa
clarita
and

valleys
and
even

the
sheriff
s
department
was
created
in
back
when
los

was
the
wild
west
and
deputies
rode
in
posses
and
yet
baca

using

and
to

even

to

i
don

levenson
the

said
the

must
meet
stringent

i
think
integrity
is
key
she
said
it
should
be
somebody
who
s
experienced
in

and
who
has
the
confidence
of
law

personnel
he
should
be
a

politically
savvy
and
with
a
great
deal
of
courage
to
take
on
the
different
issues
that
confront
the
county
from
homeland
security
to
modern
approaches
toward
law
enforcement
even
inmate
rehabilitation
and
penal
reform
she
added
if
a
candidate
were
to
win
the
majority
of
votes
on

the
county
board
of
supervisors
could
remove
interim
sheriff
john
scott
and
appoint
the
sheriff
elect
to
lead
the
department
immediately
if
no
candidate
exceeds

the
top
two
would
face
a
runoff
election
on
nov
and
the
winner
would
be
sworn
in
dec
if
voters
choose
poorly
the
consequences
can
be
costly
literally
county
taxpayers
paid
about
million
last
year
in

and
jury
verdicts
for
illegal
behavior
on
the
part
of
the

american
civil

legal

said
i
believe
most

would
rather
spend
that
on
new
parks
a
better
health
care
system
et
cetera
than
jury
verdicts
and
settlements
for
sheriff
s
department
malfeasance
he
added
if
voters
make
a
mistake
they
may
have
to
live
with
it
for
a
long
long
time
there
are
no
term
limits
on
a
sheriff
even
though
incumbents
are
up
for
re
election
every
four
years
they
have
virtually
insurmountable
advantages
over
challengers
to
be
viable
candidates

from

mcdonnell
said
i

no

that
could
cloud
that
and
i

been
involved
in
the
transformation
of

that
had
issues
i
sat
on

citizens
commission
on

violence
and
got
an
education
on
what
was
wrong
and
what
needed
to
be
done
in

throughout

he
added

training
the

however
blamed
tanaka
for
some
of
the
abuses
at

citing
evidence

he
urged

to
be
aggressive
and
function
right

stressed
a

is
vital
to

s
new

an

similar
to

that
never

away
from

we
re

of

repeat

she

it

the

james

in

having
spent
the
bulk
of
his

at

where
he
was
second
in

to
former

william

now
chief
of

mcdonnell
has
what

the

i

mcdonnell
said
i
have
no
relationships
within
the
organization
that
could
cloud
that
and
i
ve
been
involved
in
the
transformation
of
two
police
departments
that
had
issues
i
sat
on
the
citizens
commission
on
jail
violence
and
got
an
education
on
what
was
wrong
and
what
needed
to
be
done
in

throughout

he

m
the

who

the

he
said
the
position

too
important
for

the
job
training
the
commission
however
blamed
tanaka
for
some
of
the
abuses
at

citing
evidence
that
he
urged

to
be
aggressive
and
function
right
on

work
in

rogers
believes

trusted
the

saying
the

bad
apples
were

they

he
said
it
also
means
responding

quickly
ensuring

what
happened
to
this

olmsted
said
the

set
the

they
created
a

where
rogue

he

vowed

i
cannot
sit

destroy

they
already
have
he

is
a

also
volunteered
in

lasd
as
a
reserve
deputy

for

and
holds

he
plans
to

fighting
by
using
computer

and
to
install

even
in

to
increase

i
don
t
believe
the

has
been
beset
by

i
believe
it
s
been
best
by
poor

poor

he
said
choose
wisely
levenson
the
criminal

professor
said
the
new

must
meet
stringent
criteria
i
think
integrity
is
key
she
said
it
should
be
somebody
who
s
experienced
in
law
enforcement
and
who
has
the
confidence
of
law

personnel
he
should
be
a
good

politically
savvy
and
with
a
great
deal
of
courage
to
take
on
the
different
issues
that
confront
the
county
from
homeland
security
to
modern
approaches
toward

even
inmate

reform
she
added
if
a
candidate
were
to
win
the
majority
of

on

the
county
board
of

could
remove
interim
sheriff
john

and
appoint
the
sheriff
elect
to
lead
the
department
immediately
if
no

exceeds

the
top
two
would
face
a
runoff
election
on

and
the
winner
would
be
sworn
in
dec
if
voters
choose
poorly
the
consequences
can
be
costly
literally
county
taxpayers
paid
about

last

in

for

on

of

american

legal

said
i
believe
most

would
rather
spend
that
on
new

a
better
health
care
system
et

than
jury
verdicts
and
settlements
for
sheriff
s
department
malfeasance
he
added
if
voters
make
a
mistake
they
may
have
to
live
with
it
for
a
long
long
time
there
are
no
term
limits
on
a
sheriff
even
though
incumbents
are
up
for
re

every
four
years
they
have
virtually
insurmountable
advantages
over
challengers
to
be

from

to
the
san

san

the
sheriff

was
created
in
back
when
los

was
the

and
deputies
rode
in

and
yet
baca

its

peter

the
june
election
will
force
a
rare
changing
of
the
guard
at
the
los

county
sheriff
s
department
and
voters
are
charged
with
choosing
the
candidate
who
would
not
only
lead
the
troubled
law
enforcement
agency
into
the
future
but
restore
public
trust
the
recent
barrage
of
scandals
everything
from
favoritism
in

to
obstruction
of
justice
that
ended
former

may
have

this

said
this
is
an
opportunity
for
the
people
of
the
county
to
shape
one
of
the
most
crucial
departments
serving
them
the
sheriff

frankly
does
a
lot
more
than
any
other

that

she
added
people
would
be
surprised
at
how
much
the
work
of
the
sheriff

touches
their

on

our

the

shaped
like

been
tarnished
by

reforms
are

but
miriam

executive
director
of
the
blue

citizen
s
commission
on

violence
stressed
a
new
sheriff
is
vital
to
restoring
the
confidence
of
the
community
unless
and
until
there
s
new
leadership
and
an
ongoing
independent
civilian
eye
similar
to
the
ccjv
that
never
moves
the
spotlight
away
from
the
department
we
re
going
to
see
some
of
these
negative
cycles
repeat
themselves
she
warned
the
reforms
are
a
work
in
progress
agreed
supervisor
zev
yaroslavsky
it
ll
be
up
to
the
next
sheriff
to
implement
the
changes
the
candidates
james
mcdonnell
is
the
only
department
outsider
in
the
race
having
spent
the
bulk
of
his
career
at
the
los

police
department
where
he
was
second
in
command
to
former
chief
william
bratton
now
chief
of
the
long
beach
police
department
mcdonnell
has
what
is
arguably
the
most
impressive
list
of
endorsements
including
those
of
state
attorney
general
kamala
harris
county
district
attorney
jackie
lacey
and
supervisors
don
knabe
and
yaroslavsky
i
d
bring
in
a
fresh
perspective
as
an
outsider
mcdonnell
said
i
have
no
relationships
within
the
organization
that
could
cloud
that
and
i
ve
been
involved
in
the
transformation
of
two
police
departments
that
had
issues
i
sat
on
the
citizens
commission
on
jail
violence
and
got
an
education
on
what
was
wrong
and
what
needed
to
be
done
in
the
jails
and
throughout
the
lasd
he
added
gardena
mayor
paul
tanaka
was
once
baca
s
second
in

until
they
had
a
bitter
falling
out
the

also
a
certified
public
accountant
and
served
as
the
department
s
budget
manager
as
a
year
veteran
of

i
m
the
only
candidate
who
has
the
institutional
knowledge
that
is
critical
for
restoring
trust
and
credibility
to
the
organization
he
said
the
position
of
sheriff
is
too
big
and
too
important
for
on
the
job
training
the
commission
however
blamed
tanaka
for
some
of
the
abuses
at
the
jails
citing
evidence
that
he
urged
deputies
to
be
aggressive
and
function
right
on
the
edge
of
the
line
or
work
in
the
gray
area
somewhere
between
what
is
legal
and
not

is
currently
in
charge
of
budget
and
personnel
while
assistant
sheriff
james
hellmold
directs
the
patrol
and
detective
divisions
rogers
believes
baca
trusted
the
wrong
people
saying
the
problem
is
bad
apples
were
given
too
much
authority
they
were
not
qualified
and
they
seriously
abused
that
authority
he
added
that
is
unacceptable
and
i
will
bring
reforms
hellmold
advocates
fulfilling
the
department
s
core
functions
while
embracing
new
technologies
public
safety
simply
means
continuing
the
lowest
crime
levels
in
more
than
years
he
said
it
also
means
responding
to
calls
for
service
quickly
ensuring
emergency
preparedness
and
school
safety
and
modernizing
the
sheriff
s
department
to
deal
with
the
rising
cybercrime
and

theft
retired
sheriff
s
commander
robert
olmsted
touts
himself
as
the
whistleblower
who
alerted
the
fbi
about
the
misconduct
at
the
jails
it
s
shameful
what
happened
to
this
great
department
olmsted
said
the
leaders
set
the
tone
and
they
created
a
culture
where
rogue
deputies
and
the
command
staff
violated
the
law
and
their
sacred
oath
retired
sheriff
s
lieutenant
patrick
gomez
ran
against
baca
in
and
he
once
sued
the
department
for
denying
him
promotions
and
harassing
his
family
supposedly
because
he
challenged
baca
he
ended
up
winning
a
nearly
million
payout
gomez
vowed
to
correct
the
failings
of
the
previous
leadership
and
urged
voters
to
reject
candidates
who
had
been
in
baca
s
inner
circle
i
cannot
sit
back
and
let
them
destroy
the
department
any
more
than
they
already
have
he
said
los

police
department
senior
detective
supervisor
lou
vince
is
a
former
marine
who
also
volunteered
in
the
lasd
as
a
reserve
deputy
sheriff
for
four
years
and
holds
a
master
s
degree
in
criminology
he
plans
to
enhance
crime
fighting
by
using
computer
statistics
and
predictive
policing
and
to
install
additional
cameras
even
in
patrol
cars
to
increase
transparency
i
don
t
believe
the
sheriff
s
department
has
been
beset
by
corruption
or
scandal
i
believe
it
s
been
best
by
poor
management
poor
leadership
he
said
choose
wisely
levenson
the
criminal
law
professor
said
the
new
sheriff
must
meet
stringent
criteria
i
think
integrity
is
key
she
said
it
should
be
somebody
who
s
experienced
in
law
enforcement
and
who
has
the
confidence
of
law
enforcement
personnel
he
should
be
a
good
manager
politically
savvy
and
with
a
great
deal
of
courage
to
take
on
the
different
issues
that
confront
the
county
from
homeland
security
to
modern
approaches
toward
law
enforcement
even
inmate
rehabilitation
and
penal
reform
she
added
if
a
candidate
were
to
win
the
majority
of
votes
on
june
the
county
board
of
supervisors
could
remove
interim
sheriff
john
scott
and
appoint
the
sheriff
elect
to
lead
the
department
immediately
if
no
candidate
exceeds
percent
the
top
two
would
face
a
runoff
election
on
nov
and
the
winner
would
be
sworn
in
dec
if
voters
choose
poorly
the
consequences
can
be
costly
literally
county
taxpayers
paid
about
million
last
year
in
settlements
and
jury
verdicts
for
illegal
behavior
on
the
part
of
the
sheriff
s
department
american
civil
liberties
union
legal
director
peter
eliasberg
said
i
believe
most
taxpayers
would
rather
spend
that
on
new
parks
a
better
healthcare
system
et
cetera
than
jury
verdicts
and
settlements
for
sheriff
s
department
malfeasance
he
added
if
voters
make
a
mistake
they
may
have
to
live
with
it
for
a
long
long
time
there
are
no
term
limits
on
a
sheriff
even
though
incumbents
are
up
for
re
election
every
four
years
they
have
virtually
insurmountable
advantages
over
challengers
to
be
viable
candidates

apples

public

he

it
also

responding

quickly
ensuring

it

what

to

olmsted
said
the

set

they
created

where
rogue

retired

vowed

urged

i
cannot
sit

in

as

i
don

i

by

he

levenson
the
criminal

said
the

must
meet
stringent

i
think

is

she
said
it
should
be
somebody
who
s
experienced
in
law
enforcement
and
who
has
the
confidence
of

personnel
he
should
be
a
good

politically
savvy
and
with
a
great
deal
of
courage
to
take
on
the
different
issues
that
confront
the
county
from
homeland
security
to
modern
approaches
toward

even
inmate

she
added
if
a

were
to
win
the

of

on

the
county
board

could
remove

elect
to

immediately
if
no

exceeds

the
top
two
would
face

election
on

and
the
winner
would
be
sworn
in

if
voters
choose
poorly
the
consequences
can
be
costly
literally
county
taxpayers
paid
about

last

in

for
illegal

on
the
part
of
the

american

legal

peter

said
i
believe
most

would
rather
spend
that
on
new
parks
a
better
healthcare
system
et

than
jury
verdicts
and
settlements
for
sheriff
s
department
malfeasance
he
added
if
voters
make
a
mistake
they
may
have
to
live
with
it
for
a
long
long
time
there
are
no
term
limits
on
a
sheriff
even
though
incumbents
are
up
for
re

every
four
years
they
have
virtually
insurmountable
advantages
over
challengers
to
be

the

will

changing
of
the

at

are

into

but
restore

the

everything

that

this

the

frankly
does
a

more
than

she

at
how
much
the

of

touches

our

miriam

stressed
a

is
vital
to

unless

until
there
s
new
leadership
and
an
ongoing
independent
civilian
eye
similar
to
the

that
never
moves
the
spotlight
away
from
the

we
re
going
to
see
some
of
these
negative
cycles
repeat
themselves
she
warned
the

michael

released
moneyball
n
a
book
describing
how
billy
beane
the
general
manager
of
major
league
baseball
s
oakland
athletics
used
what
was
then
considered
massive
amounts
of
statistical
data
to
predict
the
future
performance
of
baseball
players
beane
built
a
winning
ballelub
by
collecting
promising
players
identified
by
his
statistical
models
who
had
been
passed
over
by
other
teams
these
players
then
went
on
to
overachieve
at
a
startling
rate
beane
succeeded
by
replacing
the
traditional
method
of
evaluating
baseball
talent
being
used
by
most
major
league
clubs
with
something
new
in
the
traditional
method
older
experienced
baseball
men
scouted
players
watching
the
players
perform
and
using
their
accumulated
wisdom
and
judgment
to
identify
those
players
who
they
believed
would
succeed
into
the
future
these
scouts
were
indeed
the
qualitative
experts
of
baseball
at
the
time
but
beane
saw
the
value
in
analyzing
past
performance
data
in
a
more
sophisticated
and
rigorous
way
to
dramatically
improve
the
building
of
a
baseball
team
by
more
accurately
predicting
the
future
performance
of
players
than
scouts
ever
could

the
sentencing
reform
movement
of
the
s
and
s
replaced
the
rehabilitative
model
of
sentencing
that
had
been
in
place
from
the
earliest
days
of
the
republic
with
a
new
sentencing
framework
based
on
truth
in
sentencing
and
the
idea
that
a
criminal
sentence
should
largely
be
based
on
the
crime
committed
the
foundation
of
the
new
system
was
the
belief
that
reducing
reoffending
was
not
a
task
worth
pursuing
that
nothing
worked
to
change
offending
behavior
and
that
excessive
discretion
in
charging
sentencing
and
parole
decisions
had
led
to
unwarranted
disparities
and
discriminatory
impacts
on
the
poor
and
people
of
color
it
was
thought
that
certainty
in
sentencing
certainty
in
the
imposition
of
a
particular
sentence
for
a
particular
crime
and
certainty
in
the
time
to
be
served
for
a
sentence
imposed
would
simultaneously
improve
public
safety
by
deterring
new
criminality
and
also
increase
fairness
in
sentencing
by
reducing
unwarranted
sentencing
disparities
this
new
determinate
system
of
sentencing
did
not
depend
largely
on
predicting
future
behavior
for
sentences
were
based
primarily
on
the
offender
s
past
criminal
conduct
the
sentencing
reform
movement
not
only
brought
with
it
a
new
framework
for
sentencing
but
also
led
as
we
and
many
others
have
documented
to
an
extraordinary
increase
in
the
use
of
incarceration
the
attorney
general
has
written
and
spoken
regularly
about
the
increase
in
the
nation
s
prison
population
over
the
last
three
decades
and
why
in
particular
it
is
imperative
that
we
control
federal
prison
spending
the
commission
s
recent
vote
to
reset
guideline
offense
levels
for
drug
trafficking
offenses
is
an
important
step
to
meeting
that
imperative
we
continue
to
work
with
congress
and
the
commission
to
find
ways
to
adequately
control
the
federal
prison
population
while
simultaneously
ensuring
public
safety
we
have
also
previously
noted
how
the
increase
in
the
prison
population
led
to
an
explosion
in
the
number
of
people
returning

attorney

and
also
a

alternative
to

in
certain

the
deployment
of

information

in
furtherance
of
reentry
can
improve
risk
and
needs
assessments
but
also
has
the
potential
to
do
far
more
for
example
we
believe
that
properly
deployed
analytics
and
information
technology
more
generally
can
provide
early
warnings
when
an
offender
is
straying
from
her
reentry
plan
they
can
enable
faster
responses
from
probation
officers
to
get
an
offender
back
on
track
they
can
provide
more
effective
delivery
of
needed
services
the
real
time
awareness
to
let
probation
officers
know
what
s
happening
on
the
ground
moment
by
moment
and
real
time
feedback
comparing
what
s
happening
relative
to
what
was
intended
effective
service
delivery
combined
with
swift
certain
and
fair
responses
to
misconduct
the
keys
to
successful
corrections
can
be
greatly
facilitated
by
these
technologies
and
analytics
we
think
the
role
effectiveness
and
efficiency
of
community
corrections
and
individual
probation
officers
could
be
dramatically
reengineered
with
the
use
of
varied
technologies
and
analytical
tools
and
that
recidivism
rates
can
be
brought
down
on
the
same
scale
that
violent
crime
has
been
reduced
over
the
last
two
decades
linking
diverse
datasets
deploying
analytics
and
applying
advances
in
knowledge
of
human
behavior
we
believe
will
all
be
part
of
that
reengineering
as
former
new
jersey
attorney
general
anne
milgram
stated
the
returns
for
better
applying
technology
in
criminal
justice
extend
far
beyond
reducing
crime
or
costs
to
something
that
government
officials
are
sworn
to
uphold
justice
n
the
research
and
development
around
this
potential
transformation
is
something
the
sentencing
commission
is
in
a
unique
position
to
accomplish
and

it
is
something

first
most
current

and
in

the
pcra
which
is
specifically
mentioned
in

legislation
determine
risk
levels
based
on
static
historical
offender
characteristics
such
as
education
level
employment
history
family
circumstances
and
demographic
information
we
think
basing
criminal
sentences
and
particularly
imprisonment
terms
primarily
on
such
data
rather
than
the
crime
committed
and
surrounding
circumstances
is
a
dangerous
concept
that
will
become
much
more
concerning
over
time
as
other
far
reaching
sociological
and
personal
information
unrelated
to
the

at

are
incorporated

tools
th
is
phenomenon
ultimately
raises
constitutional
questions
because
of
the
use
of
group
based
characteristics
and
suspect
classifications
in
the
analytics
criminal
accountability
should
be
primarily
about
prior
bad
acts
proven
by
the
government
before
a
court
of
law
and
not
some
future
bad
behavior
predicted
to
occur
by
a
risk
assessment
instrument
second
experience
and
analysis
of
current
risk
assessment
tools
demonstrate
that
utilizing
such
tools
for
determining
prison
sentences
to
be
served
will
have
a
disparate
and
adverse
impact
on
offenders
from
poor
communities
already
struggling
with
many
social
ills
the
touchstone
of
our
justice
system
is
equal
justice
and
we
think
sentences
based
excessively
on
risk
assessment
instruments
will
likely
undermine
this
principle
third
use
of
risk
assessments
to
determine
sentences
erodes
certainty
in
sentencing
thus
diminishing
the
deterrent
value
of
a
strong
consistent
sentencing
system
that
is
seen
by
the
community
as
fair
and
tough
our
brothers
and
sisters
in
the
defense
and
research
communities
have
repeatedly
cited
research
to
the
commission
about
the
value
and
efficacy
of
certainty
of
apprehension
and
certainty
of
punishment
in
deterring
crime
swift
certain
and
fair
sanctions
are
what
work
to
deter
crime
both
individually
and
across
society
we
know
that
certainty
in
sentencing
certainty
in
the
imposition
of
a
particular
sentence
for
a
particular
crime
and
certainty
in
the
time
to
be
served
for
a
sentence
imposed
simultaneously
improves
public
safety
and
reduces
unwarranted
sentencing
disparities
we
are
concerned
that
excessive
reliance
on
risk
tools
will
greatly
undermine
what
has
been
achieved
around
certainty
of
sentencing
in
the
federal
system
determining
imprisonment
terms
should
be
primarily
about
accountability
for
past
criminal
behavior
while
any
effective
sentencing
and
corrections
policy
will
take
account
of
future
behavior
to
some
extent
incapacitating
those
more
likely
to
recidivate
and
utilizing
effective
reentry
efforts
to
reduce
the
likelihood
of
recidivism
we
believe
the
length
of
imprisonment
terms
should
mostly
be
about
accounting
for
past
criminal
conduct
as
analytics
evolve
we
are
concerned
about
the
implications
of
sentencing
policy
moving
away
from
this
precept
we
think
the
sentencing
commission
s
agenda
should
include
the
study
of
risk
assessment
tools
and
their
various
uses
in
the
sentencing
and
corrections
reentry
processes
following
such
study
the
commission
should
issue
a
statement
of
policy
about
the
proper
role
of
these
instruments
in
the
federal
criminal

system
in
particular
as
analytical
tools
transform
risk

there
is
great
potential
for
their

also

we
remain
concerned
by
this
evolution
of
federal
sentencing
into
two
separate
practices
most
importantly
the
research
and
data
make
increasingly
clear
that
this
divide
leads
to
unwarranted
sentencing
disparities
more
and
more
studies
are
showing
that
a
defendant
s
sentence
will
be
significantly
influenced
by
the
judicial
assignment
of
the
case
and
the
particular
court
that
conducts
the
sentencing
n
this
is
quite
troubling
in
our
consideration
of
federal
sentencing
policy
we
begin
from
the
principle
that
offenders
who
commit
similar
offenses
and
have
comparable
criminal
histories
should
be
sentenced
similarly
this
was
the
foundational
principle
of
the
sentencing
reform
act

it

that
our

may
be
meeting

we
continue

over

the
current

structure
spurs
much
needless

this
is
not
surprising
given
that
the
guidelines
structure
was
developed
for
a
different
legal
framework
when
the
guideline
calculation
was
intended
to
be
the
last
word
for
most
cases
to
this
end
much
can
be
learned
from
state
sentencing
guideline
systems
there
has
been
significant
research
of
state
guideline
systems
n
as
we
have
stated
before
these
systems
by
and
large
differ
structurally
from
the
federal
sentencing
guidelines
in
that
they
have
simpler
sentencing
grids
fewer

less
complex
guideline
formulas
i
e
fewer
aggravating
and
mitigating
factors
embodied

for
litigators
to
fight
over
conventional
thinking
would
suggest
that
a
greater
numbers
of
cells
with
more
factors
embodied
in
rules
would
create
a
greater
number
of
sets
of
similarly
situated
offenders
and
result
in
a
greater
degree
of
sentencing
consistency
and
meaningful
differentiation
among
offenders
n
however
the
available
research
and
experience
suggest
that
greater
detail
in
the
sentencing
grid
and
sentencing
formulas
does
not
better
sort
offenders
into
more
meaningful
categories
for
purposes
of
sentencing
decisions
n
in
particular
our
experience
with
the
very
detailed
federal
guidelines
when
applied
through
the
legal
framework
created
by
booker
has
seen
quite
disparate
guideline
application
and
sentencing
outcomes
these
findings
should
guide
the
commission
in
its
work
evaluating
unwarranted
disparities
as
much
as
data
on
guideline
compliance
by
federal
judges
moreover
we
think
these
findings
along
with
many
other
factors
should
guide
the

domestic

victims
often
face
the
impossible
choice
between
physical

can
offer
some
protection
to
victims
but

justice
system

violations
can
have
drastic
financial
consequences
involving
the
state
is
likely
to
lead
to

that
would
ultimately
deprive

support
alimony
and

enforce

safety
this

context
in
which
victims
must
choose
between
physical

and
financial

and

introduction
we
co
taught
a
domestic
violence
clinic
at
yale
law
school
our
clinic
followed
a
holistic
model
in
which
the
clinic
students
represented
victims
of
domestic
violence
in
a
full
range
of
legal
problems
including
family
law
immigration
tort
actions
against
abusers
mortgage
foreclosure
consumer
landlord
tenant
public
benefits
and
tax
matters
we
found
that
many
of
our
clients
were
forced
to
balance
the
issue
of
physical
abuse
with
the
threat
of
severe
financial
stress
in
this
article
we
offer
a
case
study
in
which
our
client
largely
out
of
concern
for
her
children
s
economic
security
refused
to
enforce
civil
restraining
and
criminal
protective
orders
to
ensure
that
her
husband
would
be
able
to
work
and
support
the
family
this
situation
is
not
unique
many
of
our
clients
were
loath
to
enforce
existing
restraining
orders
or
protective
orders
fearing
that
enforcement
would
result
in
incarceration
of
the
abuser
which
would
interrupt
financial
support
these
pressures
were
particularly
severe
for
clients
with
minor
children
this
article
focuses
on
the
role
of
economic
security
in
a
domestic
violence
victim
s
decision
making
and
the
role
of
the
attorney
in
trying
to
assist
in
and
execute
the
domestic
violence
victim
client
s
decisions
we
concentrate
on
the
economic
pressures
that
make
it
difficult
to
leave
but
recognize
that
financial
matters
represent
one
piece
of
a
complicated
picture
we
are
concerned
with
isolating
any
single
factor
in
what
is
often
a
multi
faceted
decision
as
a
result
we
have
purposely
taken
a
wide
ranging
approach
in
examining
both
the
factors
that
lead
to
a
decision
to
stay
or
not
enforce
court
orders
as
well
as
the
role
of
the
lawyer
in
helping
to
effectuate
these
decisions
we
analyze
this
situation
through
the
lens
of
one
clinic
case
offering
the
perspectives
of
the
clinic
students
who
worked
on
the
case
and
discussing
what
limitations
if
any
there
are
to
representation
in
a
case
like
this
when
a
client
trades
safety
for
economic
stability
this
is
a
broad
analysis
and
we
appreciate
that
we
raise
more
questions
than
we
answer
but
we
are
looking
for
ways
to
better

representation
of

situations
and
we
have
not
found
the
answers
to
be
easily
forthcoming
in
part
i
we
discuss
our
client
barbara
s
situation
as
a
case
study
that
provides
a
context
in
which
to
examine
these
complex
issues
we
provide
background
about
barbara
s
case
along
with
the
perspectives
of
the
two
clinic
students
who
under
our
supervision
represented
barbara
and
identified
many
of
the
issues
relevant
to
this
article
in
a
contemporaneous
g
chat
instant
messaging
through
google
about
her
case
in
part
ii
we
provide
an
overview
of
the
problem
presented
by
barbara
s
situation
and
many
other
similar
situations
namely
what
limits
if
any
there
might
be
in
a
lawyer
s
representation
of
a
domestic
violence
victim
when
that
representation
may
increase
the
victim
s
risk
of
harm
or
circumvent
legal
processes
that
are
meant
to
protect
the
victim
we
look
at
issues
of
capacity
and
competence
and
when
a
lawyer
can
limit
or
withdraw
from
representation
under
the
model
rules
of
professional
conduct
part
iii
examines
how
financial
pressures
and
economic
dependency
cause
many
domestic
violence
victims
to
eschew
court
involvement
or
opt
out
of
the
criminal
justice
system
in
part
iv
we
discuss
other
reasons
why
victims
opt
out
of
court
protections
including
problems
with
the
criminal
justice
system
fear
of
retaliation
concerns
about
immigration
consequences
for
the
victim
or
the
abuser
and
love
for
and
attachment
to
the

lawyering
part
vi
explores
whether
domestic
violence
victims
rights
are
public
or
private
rights
part
vii
examines
the
predictability
of
domestic
violence
under
lethality
and
risk
assessment
instruments

questions
whether
these

lawyers
in

i
the
case
study
a
the
client
barbara
each
week
we
went
with
our
clinic
students
to
a
local
domestic
violence
advocacy
center
located
in
a
beautiful
old
victorian
house
in
a
nearby
neighborhood
in
new
haven
connecticut
we
interviewed
prospective
clients
at
a
dining
room
table
under
a
chandelier
in
what
had
once
been
an
upscale
dining
room
it
was
there
that
we
met
barbara
barbara
had
been
married
to
her
abuser
for
years
and
had
two
minor
children
ages
and
during
the
marriage
barbara
had
never
been
away
from
home
overnight
without
her
husband
tom
although
he
had
taken
several
trips
with
girlfriends
her
husband
was
extremely
controlling
she
was
not
permitted
to
work
or
learn
a
trade
he
owned
a
business
had
substantial
earnings
built
a
house
paid
all
the
bills
and
doled
out
household
money
in
modest
amounts
the
business
was
labor
intensive
and
was
entirely
dependent
on
his
ability
to
bid
on
public
contracts
and
perform
strenuous
physical
labor
if
he
did
not
work
the
income
stream
would
end
barbara
s
husband
beat
her
frequently
on
two
occasions
she
took
pictures
of
her
black
eyes
and
bruises
the
only
time
she
went
to
a
doctor
she
gave
a
false
account
of
the
cause
of
her
injuries
she
was
afraid
to
take
any
action
that
could
lead
to
her
husband
s
arrest
her
main
concerns
were
that
she
be
able
to
pay
the
mortgage
and
household
bills
and
continue
to
maintain
her
children
s
home
and
lifestyle
two
years
before
we
met
her
barbara
prepared
a
pro
se
divorce
complaint
connecticut
has
an
unusual
procedure
in
which
a
complaint
is
served
before
being
filed
with
the
court
when
barbara
served
her
husband
in
their
home
by
handing
him
a
copy
she
was
afraid
of
physical
violence
instead
he
looked
at
the
papers
tore
them
in
half
told
her
she
was
not
getting
a
divorce
and
left
the
house
she
felt
trapped
but
assumed
that
her
husband
was
correct
she
believed
there
was
no
way
she
could
pay
for
an
attorney
and
there
was
no
way
she
could
get
the
divorce
on
her
own
it
was
only
after
she
contacted
a
domestic
violence
hotline
that
she
learned
that
she
might
be
able
to
receive
free
legal
services
we
represented
barbara
for
three
years
obtaining
a
divorce
custody
alimony
child
support
and
a
property
settlement
during
that
period
the
only
time
she
was
inconsolable
was
when
her
husband
was
arrested
when
a
neighbor
reported
a
domestic
dispute
at
barbara
s
home
barbara
told
us
that
the
one
thing
she
could
not
allow
was
for
her
husband
to
go
to
jail
she
could
put
up
with
anything
so
long
as
she
could
provide
for
her
children
and
the
only
way
she
could
do
that
was
for
her
husband
to
keep
working
although
the
court
had
entered
restraining
orders
and
due
to
a
third
party
complaint
a
criminal
protective
order
barbara
refused
to
enforce
those
orders
n
in
a
remarkably
successful
multi
day
divorce
trial
the
court
awarded
barbara
over
of
her
husband
s
income
for
child
support
and
alimony
as
well
as
of
the
equity
in
the
marital
home
valued
at
connecticut
is
an
equitable
distribution
state
and
the
evidence
was
quite
compelling
and
was
a
major
factor
in
the
property
distribution
as
just
one
example
barbara
testified
that
one
morning
on
awakening
after
a
beating
the
night
before
she
was
exhilarated
when
she
looked
in
the
mirror
because
she
had
only
one
black
eye
when
she
expected
two
family
lawyers
reading
about
a
remarkably
successful
result
in
a
domestic
violence
case
will
probably
ask
then
what
happened
even
before
the
end
of
the
trial
we
knew
that
compliance
with
the
terms
of
the
judgment
was
unlikely
at
a
recess
during
the
last
day
of
the
trial
when
things
were
not
going
well
for
the
defendant
we
saw
him
huddled
with
his
brother
who
then
made
a
series
of
telephone
calls
they
conducted
their
business
openly
with
an
occasional
smirk
for
our
benefit
it
was
clear
that
they
were
planning
something
and
equally
clear
that
they
wanted
us
to
be
worried
about
it
when
our
client
got
home
most
of
her
furniture
was
missing
in
one
sense
we
were
relieved
that
the
plan
was
limited
to
possessions
but
we
filed
a
motion
for
contempt
the
next
morning
the
problem
was
resolved
when
the
older
son
then
drove
to
his
father
s
house
convinced
his
father
to
help
him
load
the
furniture
on
a
truck
and
brought
it
home
at
trial
the
judge
issued
a
new
restraining
order
on
her
own
motion
noting
that
this
was
the
first
time
in
her
twelve
years
on
the
bench
she
had
issued
a
restraining
order
without
an
application
an
earlier
restraining
order
had
expired
and
barbara
did
not
want
a
new
order
having
experienced
panic
when
her
husband
was
arrested
for
violating
the
order
tom
continued
his
attempts
to
control
barbara
he
violated
the
restraining
order
on
a
regular
basis
he
came
to
the
house
frequently
barbara
refused
to
take
any
action
to
enforce
the
order
he
failed
to
pay
alimony
and
child
support
and
we
were
in
court
on
contempt
motions
on
many
occasions
always
seeking
compliance
with
the
financial
orders
but
never
raising
the
restraining
order
violations
usually
he
showed
up
at
court
with
a
check
once
he
brought
forty
bills
eventually
the
court
scheduled
monthly
hearings
requiring
that
he
keep
current
on
payments
at
a
post
judgment
contempt
hearing
for
failure
to
pay
child
support
and
alimony
the
defendant
described
a
conversation
he
had
with
barbara
at
the
marital
home
noting
that
he
had
frequent
conversations
with
her
at
the
house
the
judge
was
livid
about
his
failure
to
comply
with
the
restraining
order
and
said
she
should
throw
him
in
jail
until
he
learned
the
meaning
of
a
court
order
the
judge
suggested
that
we
might
need
a
public
defender
for
the
unrepresented
defendant
a
sure
sign
that
she
was
considering
jail
time
we
expected
this
issue
to
arise
and
the
students
were
prepared
they
found
themselves
arguing
strenuously
and
effectively
that
the
court
should
issue
additional
monetary
sanctions
but
not
incarceration
we
had
warned
barbara
that
the
restraining
order
violations
were
likely
to
be
disclosed
barbara
remained
adamant
that
she
wanted
to
enforce
the
financial
orders
but
not
the
restraining
order
in
fact
the
mortgage
was
in
arrears
and
without
access
to
support
and
alimony
payments
a
mortgage
foreclosure
was
imminent
the
judge
expressed
fear
for
barbara
s
safety
a
fear
that
we
had
lived
with
for
over
two
years
with
constant
self
doubts
about
our
failure
to
enforce
the
restraining
and
protective
orders
we
had
discussed
this
as
a
class
and
as
a
litigation
team
we
had
the
benefit
of
consultation
with
a
psychologist
specializing
in
domestic
violence
issues
social
workers
who
consulted
with
barbara
victim
advocates
and
a
prosecutor
assigned
to
domestic
violence
prosecutions
in
the
end
the
students
and
the
authors
agreed
that
the
choice
was
the
client
s
not
ours
when
the
judge
raised
her
concerns
the
students
explained
and
advocated
for
the
client
s
position
the
judge
looked
surprised
and
took
a
recess
when
she
returned
to
the
bench
the
judge
allowed
the
defendant
to
remain
free
and
to
continue
working
the
defendant
continued
to
violate
the
restraining
and
protective
orders
and
barbara
continued
in
her
insistence
that
she
wanted
us
to
enforce
the
financial
orders
but
to
do
everything
we
could
to
keep
her
now
ex
husband
out
of
jail
ultimately
he
came
to
the
house
one
day
when
barbara
s
friend
was
visiting
when
the
friend
told
him
to
leave
tom
told
the
friend
to
mind
his
own
business
and
pushed
him
causing
him
to
crash
into
a
bookcase
and
hurt
his
shoulder
someone
called
the
police
they
came
and
the
defendant
was
arrested
after
a
lengthy
plea
bargain
he
pled
to
five
violations
of
restraining
orders
and
protective
orders
and
was
sentenced
to
four
years
imprisonment
b
the
students
perspective
mary
and
elizabeth
when
we
started
writing
this
article
we
contacted
mary
adkins
and
elizabeth
tulis
the
yale
law
school
students
who
represented
barbara
throughout
the
above
case
study
yale
law
school
permits
first
year
law
students
to
enroll
in
a
clinic
and
mary
met
barbara
at
an
outreach
site
a
few
weeks
into
the
spring
semester
of
her
first
year
of
law
school
elizabeth
worked
in
the
yale
clinic
during
the
summer
between
her
first
and
second
years
of
law
school
and
as
part
of
her
responsibilities
represented
barbara
throughout
the
summer
both
mary
and
elizabeth
continued
to
represent
barbara
throughout
their
second
and
third
years
of
law
school
we
appreciate
the
luxury
of
having
the
same
students
work
with
a
client
for
over
two
years
but
we
do
not
think
that
changes
the
issues
after
an
initial
discussion
about
this
article
elizabeth
offered
an
extraordinary
g
chat
that
she
had
with
mary
during
the
representation
the
content
has
been
edited
slightly
for
length
but
the
words
are
entirely
our
students
while
this
paper
is
about
a
lawyering
problem
and
not
about
clinical
pedagogy
our
case
study
did
arise
in
the
context
of
a
domestic
violence
clinic
and
as
the
conversation
shows
the
students
were
conscious
of
and
concerned
with
our
client
s
refusal
to
enforce
orders
and
it
brings
to
life
in
real
time
the
difficult
issues
with
which
we
were
all
struggling
the
clinical
setting
adds
a
dimension
to
the
lawyering
skills
involved
and
we
think
it
is
helpful
to
consider
the
real
time
concerns
of
the
students
mary
tom
husband
comes
over
a
lot
according
to
joe
barbara
s
friend
joe
was
like
he
has
to
go
to
jail
to
get
his
attention
elizabeth
joe
saw
him
come
over
was
barbara
there
when
tom
came
over
mary
yes
and
she
hid
upstairs
he
has
a
key
elizabeth
tom
came
in
the
house
did
barbara
get
the
locks
changed
mary
yes
but
it
doesn
t
matter
i
don
t
think
he
has
the
order
yet
whether
or
not
barbara
wants
tom
to
go
to
jail
something
has
to
change
in
the
way
she
s
been
dealing
with
this
or
else
tom
simply
won
t
stop
he
won
t
stop
elizabeth
i
wonder
if
we
could
ask
for
financial
sanctions
barbara
really
might
need
to
get
used
to
the
idea
of
him
being
in
jail
for
a
while
we
re
just
no
longer
in
a
place
where
we
can
use
this
to
get
assets
divided
etc
mary
i
think
the
judge
is
smart
and
caring
elizabeth
but
even
the
judge
is
going
to
lose
patience
at
some
point
and
be
like
if
he
keeps
doing
these
things
and
she
wants
him
to
stop
he
needs
to
face
the
consequences
i
just
feel
like
in
this
case
i
am
really
walking
a
line
between
serving
what
barbara
wants
and
giving
her
good
legal
advice
honest
legal
advice
about
what
her
options
are
and
good
practical
advice
responsible
advice
about
what
i
think
she
should
do
legally
mary
i
think
we
ve
told
her
what
she
has
to
do
legally
she
s
not
doing
it
elizabeth
i
feel
like
there
s
a
certain
point
in
this
case
though
where
i
can
t
honestly
be
asking
for
a
tro
temporary
restraining
order
n
that
she
won
t
enforce
or
there
s
not
anything
i
can
do
if
she
won
t
enforce
it
by
not
allowing
us
to
report
violations
we
re
not
serving
her
interests
at
least
if
we
think
that
subjective
assessments
of
interest
in
cases
like
barbara
s
are
not
all
there
is
if
barbara
thinks
that
everything
would
be
fine
if
she
took
tom
back
that
that
was
what
she
wanted
would
we
be
serving
her
interest
by
facilitating
that
or
by
say
transferring
property
to
tom
i
don
t
know
i
guess
i
ve
just
been
feeling
really
frustrated
to
some
extent
with
barbara
herself
mary
i
mean
i
think
this
is
the
fundamental
question
in
dv
work
right
mary
but
what
she
s
asking
from
us
in
this
particular
kind
of
instance
is
not
action
but
inaction
not
pushing
the
violation
in
front
of
the
court
which
is
a
passive
kind
of
facilitating
i
realize
but
it
s
more
palatable
to
me
elizabeth
it
s
making
tom
think
she
won
t
enforce
it
just
feels
very
hypocritical
when
our
whole
case
was
premised
on
he
s
so
abusive
and
he
needs
to
be
away
from
her
mary
i
know
i
asked
her
today
if
she
felt
scared
of
him
and
she
said
no
not
right
now
i
said
well
he
has
the
key
to
the
house
you
know
he
s
going
to
change
his
tune
at
any
point
and
he
could
hurt
you
elizabeth
and
if
at
some
future
point
she
does
want
to
enforce
and
report
him
say
coming
to
the
house
he
ll
go
to
court
and
say
she
s
just
mad
at
me
for
something
else
i
ve
been
coming
to
the
house
all
the
time
and
she
hasn
t
complained
the
judge
told
barbara
not
to
have
contact
with
him
at
the
hearing
mary
i
m
not
sure
she
would
have
told
me
today
except
joe
was
there
and
he
said
it
elizabeth
i
just
feel
weird
going
to
the
judge
and
asking
her
to
enforce
child
support
say
but
refusing
to
bring
up
the
other
contempt
it
suggests
that
barbara
like
tom
is
being
selective
in
her
respect
for
the
orders
i
know
that
s
not
exactly
what
it
is
but
it
doesn
t
feel
right
to
me
when
we
put
on
such
a
dramatic
dv
case
and
emphasized
that
this
was
about
getting
him
out
of
her
life
to
tolerate
him
staying
in
it
in
such
blatant
ways
ethically
not
legally
ethically
just
ethically
it
is
getting
to
me
mary
she
s
legitimately
scared
about
his
incarceration
i
mean
scared
for
legit
reasons
elizabeth
but
she
s
not
being
particularly
respectful
towards
the
legal
orders
mary
well
right
but
they
are
orders
that
she
asked
for
elizabeth
or
to
the
legal
framework
her
case
assumed
when
we
decided
to
present
dv
evidence
at
trial
and
asked
the
judge
to
rule
on
it
it
would
be
different
if
we
had
not
gotten
all
those
financial
orders
etc
on
the
basis
of
the
dv
mary
because
those
aren
t
the
priorities
in
her
life
she
s
thinking
about
her
priorities
which
i
think
are
reasonable
to
a
certain
extent
elizabeth
but
tom
s
violation
of
the
ro
restraining
order
is
a
criminal
act
maybe
that
s
part
of
the
reason
this
is
bothering
me
because
literally
legally
by
imposing
the
ro
barbara
was
involving
the
state
and
making
it
the
state
s
interest
too
mary
well
she
certainly
picks
and
chooses
elizabeth
i
guess
maybe
i
ve
just
sort
of
internalized
the
basic
premise
of
the
civil
criminal
distinction
which
is
that
once
you
enter
the
criminal
law
system
it
s
not
just
the
interest
of
the
victim
but
of
society
that
is
at
issue
going
into
the
system
you
marshal
the
resources
of
the
state
to
protect
you
but
you
also
cede
some
control
of
the
case
to
the
state
mary
i
think
you
really
hit
the
nail
on
the
head
when
you
told
her
that
she
can
t
have
someone
to
keep
mowing
the
lawn
but
not
beating
her
up
her
lifestyle
will
change
i
don
t
think
she
s
accepted
that
elizabeth
i
know
like
she
says
she
s
trying
to
but
i
feel
like
she
s
saying
that

ii
the
problem
capacity
competence
and
limiting
or
withdrawing
from
representation
a
the
problem
our
case
study
raises
several
issues
what
does
client
centered
lawyering
mean
in
such
a
context
it
is
easy
to
say
that
we
take
direction
from
the
client
but
does
it
matter
that
the
client
is
placing
herself
in
danger
of
serious
harm
or
death
not
to
mention
using
our
services
to
facilitate
an
ongoing
violation
of
court
orders
the
question
of
the
limits
of
a
lawyer
s
advocacy
on
behalf
of
a
domestic
violence
victim
has
gone
largely
unexamined
lawyers
who
work
with
domestic
violence
victims
regularly
represent
clients
who
continue
to
be
subjected
to
physical
and
sexual
violence
these
clients
might
still
be
in
a
relationship
with
the
abuser
or
may
have
intended
or
undesired
contact
with
the
abuser
the
abuser
continues
to
perpetrate
abuse
and
the
victim
based
on
the
abuser
s
prior
conduct
knows
that
she
is
likely
to
suffer
further
abuse
the
lawyer
often
knows
of
the
ongoing
abusive
conduct
although
the
client
does
not
always
disclose
this
information
n
the
ongoing
abuse
can
range
greatly
in
its
severity
from
minor
pushing
to
lethal
violence
we
ask
if
there
is
a
point
at
which
a
lawyer
should
or
can
reconsider
his
or
her
role
in
representing
the
client
especially
when
the
lawyer
s
advocacy
increases
the
likelihood
of
the
client
s
exposure
to
violence
we
are
particularly
concerned
with
the
lawyer
s
limits
if
any
when
the
client
is
making
decisions
that
put
her
at
risk
of
harm
for
the
purposes
of
this
article
we
are
thinking
about
the
lawyer
s
boundaries
arising
in
two
related
categories
when
advocacy
facilitates
contact
with
the
abuser
that
might
subject
the
victim
to
risk
of
further
violence
and
when
the
client
requests
that
the
lawyer
assist
in
circumventing
legal
processes
meant
to
provide
safety
to
the
victim
first
there
might
be
a
level
or
risk
of
violence
to
which
the
client
is
exposing
herself
that
would
cause
a
lawyer
to
reconsider
representation
of
the
client
most
domestic
violence
attorneys
are
accustomed
to
representing
clients
who
experience
ongoing
low
or
mid
level
violence
a
typical
domestic
violence
caseload
often
also
includes
some
ongoing
high
level
violence
is
there
a
level
of
risked
harm
at
which
the
lawyer
can
question
whether
the
client
s
directions
accurately
represent
her
interests
does
the
lawyer
pause
when
the
abuser
uses
or
poses
the
risk
of
extreme
violence
or
potentially
lethal
violence
and
the
lawyer
s
services
are
helping
to
facilitate
contact
between
the
parties
or
does
the
lawyer
continue
advocacy
regardless
of
the
risk
to
the
client
we
are
concerned
when
the
client
is
voluntarily
exposing
herself
to
a
high
risk
of
harm
but
it
is
not
clear
how
we
should
best
inform
our
decision
about
representation
when
the
risk
arises
in
our
case
study
we
knew
that
barbara
had
ongoing
contact
with
tom
although
barbara
was
rarely
forthcoming
about
the
type
and
frequency
of
the
contact
given
the
history
of
violence
in
the
relationship
we
were
constantly
concerned
about
barbara
s
safety
but
we
continued
to
proceed
on
barbara
s
directions
second
the
lawyer
might
reconsider
representation
when
the
client
requests
that
her
attorney
attempt
to
circumvent
or
even
obstruct
legal
processes
that
are
meant
to
protect
the
client
the
client
might
ask
that
the
attorney
conceal
the
abuser
s
conduct
from
the
court
to
purposely
avoid
remedies
meant
to
protect
the
client
she
may
ask
that
the
attorney
not
disclose
the
abuser
s
violation
of
court
orders
she
may
request
that
the
attorney
advocate
against
civil
court
protections
like
issuance
of
a
restraining
order
or
criminal
court
protections
like
prosecution
that
are
meant
to
provide
safety
to
the
victim
the
issue
presented
by
our
case
study
arises
when
the
client
asks
the
lawyer
to
advocate
that
the
perpetrator
not
be
prosecuted
for
an
incident
of
domestic
violence
or
violating
a
restraining
or
a
protective
order
even
when
the
failure
to
prosecute
will
almost
certainly
allow
for
additional
violence
a
lawyer
might
refuse
to
provide
certain
types
of
advocacy
when
that
advocacy
is
likely
to
bring
the
client
harm
we
examine
the
circumstances
that
create
sufficient
concern
for
the
attorney
such
that
she
might
establish
a
boundary
in
the
representation
the
model
rules
of
professional
conduct
require
that
a
lawyer
shall
abide
by
a
client
s
decisions
concerning
the
objectives
of
representation
but
when
can
a
lawyer
deviate
from
a
client
s
direction
n
b
capacity
and
competence
one
exception
to
the
requirement
that
the
lawyer
abide
by
the
client
s
decisions
is
provided
under
rule
when
the
client
has
diminished
capacity
n
some
may
question
a
victim
s
capacity
or
competence
to
make
decisions
involving
exposure
to
harm
this
line
of
questioning
implicates
our
first
inquiry
above
namely
whether
there
is
a
level
or
risk
of
violence
to
which
the
client
is
exposing
herself
that
would
cause
a
lawyer
to
reconsider
representation
of
the
client
there
has
been
limited
discussion
of
the
capacity
and
competence
of
domestic
violence
victims
to
make
autonomous
rational
decisions
and
realize
those
decisions
n
society
treats
a
victim
s
decision
as
to
whether
to
leave
an
abusive
relationship
as
indicative
of
her
capacity
or
competence
n
some
might
perceive
that
a
victim
choosing
to
stay
with
an
abuser
or
have
contact
with
an
abuser
after
separation
indicates
clouded
judgment
while
competence
and
capacity
are
similar
and
often
used
interchangeably
n
they
are
distinct
concepts
competence
referring
to
legal
competence
means
a
legal
standard
relating
to
a
person
s
mental
ability
to
understand
problems
and
make
decisions
n
competency
is
required
in
order
to
complete
a
legal
task
n
to
be
competent
an
individual
s
capacities
or
functional
abilities
must
be
sufficient
for
the
legal
context
in
which
a
decision
is
being
made
n
capacity
on
the
other
hand
speaks
to
an
individual
s
level
of
psychological
functioning
n
psychological
or
psychiatric
evaluations
can
determine
an
individual
s
capacity
to
make
rational
decisions
understand
complex
concepts
or
understand
the
nature
and
effect
of
one
s
acts
n
some
have
argued
that
domestic
violence
victims
lack
competence
to
make
legal
decisions
consistent
with
their
values
and
priorities
if
they
are
afraid
of
their
abusers
n
this
alleged
incompetence
arguably
arises
as
duress
when
victim
decision
making
is
controlled
by
fear
of
the
abuser
and
desire
to
avoid
retaliation
n
because
of
this
duress
it
is
argued
that
the
victim
is
not
able
to
make
decisions
serving
her
own
best
interests
n
the
discussion
of
victims
ability
to
make
decisions
has
focused
more
on
capacity
rather
than
competence
rule
n
considers
the
messy
notion
of
diminished
capacity
the
comment
to
rule
which
requires
that
a
lawyer
shall
abide
by
a
client
s
decisions
concerning
the
objectives
of
representation
n
notes
that
rule
controls
in
a
case
in
which
the
client
appears
to
be
suffering
diminished
capacity
n
rule
a
states
that
capacity
may
be
diminished
because
of
minority
mental
impairment
or
for
some
other
reason
n
this
definition
is
very
broad
and
could
arguably
extend
to
some
victims
especially
given
the
catchall
phrase
for
some
other
reason
in
a
case
of
diminished
capacity
the
lawyer
may
take
reasonable
action
to
protect
the
client
rule
b
provides
that
when
the
lawyer
reasonably
believes
that
the
client
has
diminished
capacity

at
risk
of
substantial
physical
financial
or
other
harm
unless
action
is
taken
and
cannot
adequately
act
in
the
client
s
own
interest
the
lawyer
may
take
reasonably
necessary
protective
action
including
consulting
with
individuals
or
entities
that
have
the
ability
to
take
action
to
protect
the
client

appropriate
cases
seeking
the

n
professor
ruth
jones
asserts
that
some
domestic
violence
victims
should
be
appointed
legal
guardians
due
to
capacity
issues
n
for
jones
some
domestic
violence
victims
are
unable
to
act
on
their
own
and
require
an
intervention
that
permits
someone
else
to
act
on
their
behalf
to
protect
them
from
their
abusers
until
they
can
protect
themselves
n
she
argues
that
appointment
of
a
guardian
for
a
victim
may
be
necessary
when
the
abuse
has
deprived
the
victim
of
the
ability
to
exercise
independent
judgment
n
this
guardianship
would
remain
in
effect
until
the
abuser
s
control
of
the
victim
is
removed
and
a
victim
can
make
decisions
for
herself
n
the
guardian
could
obtain
public
benefits
and
obtain
and
enforce
a
restraining
order
on
the
victim
s
behalf
n
the
guardian
could
also
restrict
the
victim
s
contact
with
the
abuser
and
petition
the
court
to
remove
the
abuser
from
the
shared
residence
or
move
the
victim
into
separate
housing
n
the
desired
outcome
of
the
aggressive
intervention
of
a
guardianship
is
for
the
victim
to
decide
to
end
the
abusive
relationship
n
the
court
of
appeals
of
minnesota
addressed
the
capacity
of
a
domestic
violence
victim
in
a
conservatorship
case
where
the
victim
refused
to
seek
a
restraining
order
in
in
re
conservatorship
of
barbara
j
frarck
a
minnesota
appellate
court
upheld
the
lower
court
s
decision
to
appoint
a
conservator
for
a
domestic
violence
victim
due
to
incapacity
n
barbara
frarck
was
in
an
abusive
relationship
and
suffered
from
borderline
personality
disorder
n
the
court
wrote
that
despite
being
physically
abused
by
her
boyfriend
frarck
remains
involved
in
their
relationship
and
that
the
testimony
indicated
that
if
a
conservator
were
appointed
and
sought
a
restraining
order
frarck
could
be
protected
from
his
abuse
while
the
court
appointed
a
conservator
based
on
both
the
domestic
violence
and
frarck
s
mental
condition
the
court
focused
more
on
the
domestic
violence
in
concluding
that
a
conservatorship
was
appropriate
the
court
stated
that
frarck
s
continued
threats
to
move
in
with
her
boyfriend
despite
his
abusive
treatment
indicate
that
she
is
unable
to
make
rational
decisions
about
her
living
arrangements
n
the
court
went
on
to
state
without
a
conservator
there
is
no
legal
mechanism
to
stop
the
abuse
given
frarck
s
refusal
to
obtain
a
protective
order
n
this
focus
on
exiting
the
relationship
as
the
test
of
capacity
or
competency
n
is
highly
problematic
a
victim
s
decision
as
whether
to
remain
with
an
abuser
or
separate
cannot
be
the
test
of
whether
a
victim
is
acting
rationally
or
in
her
own
best
interests
n
victims
are
competent
rational
decision
makers
but
the
nature
of
abusive
relationships
limits
their
choices
their
options
are
narrowed
by
a
number
of
factors
including
conditions
of
the
relationship
economic
dependence
and
possible
consequences
for
violating
the
confines
of
the
relationship
as
established
by
the
abuser
absent
capacity
issues
unrelated
to
domestic
violence
we
believe
it
is
inappropriate
to
take
reasonably
necessary
protective
action

consulting
with
individuals
or
entities
that
have
the
ability
to
take
action
to

we
do
not
support
seeking

as
allowed
by
the
capacity

but
we
question
whether
there
might
be
some
circumstances
in
which
it
would
be
appropriate
to
set
a
boundary
on
representation
the
model
rules

not
particularly
helpful
in

from
the
general
rule

from
the

a

similarly
rule

to
seek
withdrawal

in
a
course
of

if

these
rules
relate
to
our
second
inquiry
into
the
problem
presented
by
our
case
study
namely
whether

the
lawyer
obligated
to
inform
the
court
of
the

violation

case
we
told
her
that

we
did
not

done

have
been
safer
at
the
expense
of
our
ignoring
our
client
s
directions
for
the
purpose
of
this
paper
rule
raises
a
more
salient
question
what
is
a
violation
of
the
rules
of
professional
conduct
or
other
law
n
rule
declining
or
terminating
representation
provides
that

where
representation
has
commenced
shall

of
a
client

will
result
in
a
violation
of
the
rules
of
professional
conduct

law

may
withdraw
from
representing
a
client
if
withdrawal
can
be
accomplished
without
material
adverse
effect
on
the
interests
of

n
rule
also
provides
that
a
lawyer
may
withdraw
if
the
client
insists
upon
taking
action
that
the
lawyer
considers
repugnant
or
with
which
the
lawyer
has
a
fundamental
disagreement
n
for
the
purposes
of
this
article
we
are
assuming
that
a
lawyer
who
does
not
wish
to
continue
to
represent
a
client
who
refuses
to
enforce
a
restraining
order
can
seek
to

b

decision
to

refusal
n
it
may
be
that
the
court
will
not
allow
withdrawal
that
situation
is
beyond
the
scope
of
this
article
one
scholar
has
suggested
that
in
some
situations
domestic
violence
lawyers
should
break
client
confidentiality
and
request
outside
intervention
from
law
enforcement
or
others
when
the
lawyer
assesses
that
a
victim
is
at
risk
of
harm

for

cites

that

the
extent
the
lawyer
reasonably
believes
necessary
to
prevent
reasonably
certain
death

bodily
harm

we
have
never
contemplated
going
this
far
outside
of
the
bounds
of
the
attorney
client
relationship

not

that
conclusion
however
says
little
more
than
reaffirming
our
commitment

it
does
not
answer
the
thornier
question
of

those
directions
place
the

jeopardy
in
no
way
are
we
suggesting
that
the
client
s
directions
are
not
rational
to
the
contrary
the
problem
is
accentuated
or
created
by
the
fact
that
the

are
quite
rational

the

predominant
role
in

this
is
not

financial
reasons
often
play

decision
about
whether
to
separate
from
an

seek
assistance
from
the
civil
or
criminal
justice
systems
when
a
victim
is
not
financially
independent
separation
or

can
be
almost
impossible
economic
dependency
is
commonly
cited
as
the
primary
reason
victims
do
not
separate
from

victims
can
be
thrown
into

devote
a
greater
amount
of
time
to
unpaid
domestic
labor
regardless
of
whether
it
is
a
choice
or
due

women
assume
financial
losses
by
taking
significantly
more

out
of
the
paid
labor
market
to
raise
children
and
by
performing
more
unpaid
domestic
chores
like
cooking

and
shopping
n
while
men
could
compensate
women
for
their
domestic

could
seek

men
s
abuse
of
female
intimate
partners
and
its
economic
consequences
n
domestic
violence
relationships
tend
to
follow
traditional
gender
roles
with
the
abuser
being
particularly
attached
to
his
male
privilege
n
an
abuser
is
likely
to
insist
that
his
female
partner
carry
most
of
the
responsibility
for
womanly
tasks
like
housekeeping
and
childcare
he
sees
himself
as
the
breadwinner
with
breadwinning
being
central
to
his
sense
of
masculinity
n
when
a
victim
seeks
to
challenge
these
gender
roles
the
abuser
uses
controlling
or
violent
behavior
to
protect
his
financial
dominance
reinforce
his
male
privilege
or
further
the
power
imbalance
in
the
relationship
abusers
commonly
prohibit
their
partners
from
pursuing
an
education
or
employment
and
usually
control
the
financial
resources
of
the
relationship

these
behaviors
are

in
domestic

relationships

can
play
a
complex
role
in
a

about
her
financial
ability

some
victims
will
accept
the
most
basic
of

n
regardless
separation
is
likely
to
force
a
victim
into
a
lower
quality

life
the
victim
may
have
to
move
to

desirable

she
may
lose

lose

means
that
the
victim
can
no

receive
financial
support
from
the

through
child
support
alimony
or
other
financial
contributions
the
victim
s
economic
dependence
on
the
abuser
often
makes
her
reluctant
to
prosecute
any
criminal
charges
n
victims
deliberate
whether
they
can
afford
to
prioritize
prosecution
over
other
more
immediate
concerns
such
as
food
employment
and
childcare
n
in
one
survey
of
prosecutors
defense
attorneys
judges
and
victim
advocates
the
overwhelming
reason
given
for
victims
reluctance
to
participate
in
the
criminal
system
was
the
financial
resources
of
the
victim
and
her
financial
dependence
on
the
abuser
n
one
prosecutor
estimated
that
victims
give
a
financial
reason
for
wanting
to
drop
the
charges
in
ninety
nine
percent
of
the
cases
another
prosecutor
estimated
that
victims
cite
financial
reasons
for
requesting
that
the
charges
be
dropped
in
fifty
percent
of
cases
n
within
the
litany
of
reasons
why
domestic
violence
victims
would
avoid
criminal
justice
interventions
financial
dependence
on
the
abuser
remains
the
primary
reason
that
victims
opt
out
n
research
reveals
the
significant
financial
impact
incarceration
has
on
families
regardless
of
the
reason
for
the
incarceration
as
early
as
families
of
incarcerated
individuals
were
found
to
have
suffered
financially
to
the
point
of
scarcely
being
able
to
eke
out
an
existence
n
today
any
parent
s
incarceration
creates
significant
economic
deprivation
to
families
n
this
deprivation
is
largely
due
to
the
loss
of
income
that
the
incarcerated
parent
may
have
provided
to
the
family
but
also
includes
lost
informal
contributions
like
child
care
social
support
and
the
purchase
of
toys
and
diapers
n
incarceration
can
compromise
the
well
being
of
family
members
and
require
family
members
to
make
sacrifices
custodial
parents
may
have
less
time
or
money
to
invest
in
their
children
n
they
may
be
required
to
take
on
additional
employment
which
results
in
increased
child
care
costs
older
children
may
be
required
to
leave
school
and
enter
the
job
market
to
supplement
household
income
n
in
addition
the
loss
of
a
parent
and
the
financial
difficulties
that
result
from
incarceration
can
cause
children
to
suffer
from
a
range
of
emotional
psychological
and
behavioral
problems
n
state
intervention
can
create
a
quagmire
that
pits
a
victim
s
interests
in
financial
security
against
her
interests
in
safety
thus
many
victims
are
put
in
the
position
of
choosing
between
financial
support
from
the
abuser
and
state
intervention
we
do
not
suggest
that
a
victim
is
truly
choosing
between
economic
security
and
physical
safety
the
choices
available
to
domestic
violence
victims
are
limited
and
complicated
by
coercion
the
threat
of
harm
and
imperfect
options
and
we
use
the
notion
of
choice
guardedly
our
case
study
offers
an
opportunity
to
examine
the
choice
of
financial
security
over
self
protection
when
reporting
domestic
violence
incidents
and
violations
of
restraining
and
protective
orders
would
negatively
impact
a
victim
s
financial
security
further
inquiry

opt
out
of

may
be
reluctant

drive
state

in

there
is
probable
cause
to
believe
that
domestic

are
necessary

not
serve

the
needs
of
individual
victims
and
even
replace
the
control
of
the

with
the
control
of
the
state
n
opponents
are
concerned
that
these
universally
applied
strategies
do
not
account
for
the
reasons
women
stay
in
abusive
relationships

ignore
superseding

a
decision
on

their
individual
needs

disempower

strip
them
of
their
autonomy
n
warrantless
arrest
in
domestic

cases
also
creates
situations
in
which
cases
may
be
pursued
against
victim
wishes
prior
to
the
domestic
violence
movement
s
legal
reform
efforts
n
the
typical
police
response
to
domestic
violence
was
to
tell
the
husband
or
boyfriend
to
take
a
walk
around
the
block
n
police
often
did
not
have
the
legal
authority
to
make
an
arrest
at
the
scene
of
a
domestic
violence
crime
n
that
era
has
ended
now
all
fifty
states
allow
an
officer
to
make
a
warrantless
arrest

the
officer
has
probable
cause
to
believe
that
an

has
committed
a
misdemeanor

if
a
domestic

controlling
factors

n
victims
are
often
emotionally
attached
to
their
abusers

sometimes
do
not
want
to
see
them
incarcerated
or
punished
these
emotions
can
lead
to
continuing
contact

a
relationship
with
the

victims
may
rationalize
the
abusers
behavior
attributing
it
to
substance
abuse
or
a
troubled
childhood
n
reporting
abusive
conduct

terminating
contact
with
the

may
require

to
give
up
a
fantasy

a
healthy
relationship

in

can
trump

as
one
prosecutor
stated
they
love

person
they
re
afraid
that
going
forward
will
break
up
their
relationship
and
most
of
the
time
they
don
t
want
to
break
up
n
it
is
from
within
this
morass
that
victims
ask
their
attorneys
to
advocate
or
not
advocate
on
their
behalf
or
to
pick
and
choose
from
possible
remedies
when
the
victim
is
faced
with
so
many
potential
negative
consequences
it
is
no
wonder
that
victims
ask
their
attorneys
to
help
them
avoid
state
intervention
even
when
their
safety
is
at
risk
the
lawyer
is
left
to
question
whether
she
should
engage
in
the
requested
advocacy
or
non
advocacy
and
if
it
is
ethically
or
morally
responsible
to
do
so
we
turn
to
the
issue

might
have

approach
to
litigation

over
time

centered
lawyering
has
increasingly
focused
on
treating
the
client
holistically
emphasizing
problem
solving
and
not
just
the
client
s
immediate
case
n
client
centered
lawyering
has
four
primary
components
it
draws
attention
to
the
critical
importance
of
non
legal
aspects
of
a
client
s
situation
it
places
the
lawyer
s
role
in
the
representation
within
limitations
set
by
a
sharply
circumscribed
view
of
the
lawyer
s
professional
expertise
it
insists
on
the
primacy
of
client
decision
making
and
it
places
a
high
value
on
the
lawyers
understanding
their
clients
perspectives
emotions
and
values
n
client
centered
lawyering
seeks
to
place
the
client
in
control
of
the
attorney
client
relationship
and
decision
making
client
centered
lawyering
is
a
model
that
puts
the
attorney
in
the
role
of
an
open
accepting
helper
and
leaves
both
priority
setting
and
decision
making
to
the
client
the
lawyer
helps
the
client
determine
what
is
best
for
him
in
light
of
his
own
priorities
n
in
client
centered
counseling
the
emphasis
is
on
achieving
the
greatest
client
satisfaction
n
this
model
represents
a
diversion
from
the
traditional
paternalistic
attorney
knows
best
role
that
many
attorneys
adopt
where
the
decision
making
is
based
upon
the
attorney
s
knowledge
priorities
and
beliefs
rather
than
the
client
s
interests
n
client
centered
lawyering
advocates
suggest
that
the
adversarial
legal
system
encourages
attorneys
to
make
choices
on
behalf
of
their
clients
that
are
strategically
wise
while
failing
to
recognize
the
client
s
interest
in
participating
in
decision
making
advocates
believe
the
traditional
approach
is
a
product
of
the
adversarial
legal
system
and
the
approach
toward
lawyering
that
was
taught
in
law
school
in
contrast
in
a
client
centered
lawyering
relationship
the
client
does
not
perceive
himself
as
and
is
not
an
instrument
to
be
manipulated
by
the
lawyer
n
a
client
of
a
client
centered
lawyer
directs
his
own
destiny
relying
on
the
lawyer
as
a
helper
and
as
a
guide
through
the
legal
labyrinths
n
this
model
emphasizes
autonomy
and
individual
growth
for
the
client
n
under
the
client
centered
model
mutual
trust
between
the
parties
will
empower
the
client
to
assume
the
dominant
role
of
decision
maker
and
the
attorney
can
adopt
a
more
passive
role
as
the
client
s
counselor
n
the
responsibility
and
ability
to
develop
mutual
trust
between
the
lawyer
and
client
rests
entirely
on
the
attorney
who
is
traditionally
seen
as
being
in
control
of
the
relationship
the
lawyer
should
place
himself
or
herself
in
the
client
s
position
attempting
to
understand
the
client
s
situation
and
emotions
n
a
client
centered
lawyer
helps
the
client
select
the
best
course
of
action
rather
than
merely
outlining
the
options
and
instructing
the
client
to
pick
the
path
of
his
choice
many
scholars
writing
about
client
centered
lawyering
use
the
term
holistic
to
describe
the
lawyer
s
role
within
this
model
n
the
lawyer
remains
neutral
and
serves
as
a
resource
to
the
client
during
his
decision
making
process
n
while
this
model
is
intended
to
allow
the
client
to
make
all
decisions
autonomously
involving
the
lawyer
only
when
necessary
some
scholars
believe
this
cannot
work
in
practice
n
one
critic
argues
that
the
differences
between
the
client
centered
and
traditional
models
are
nonexistent
when
applied
to
everyday
lawyering
the
client
centered
literature
fails
to
present
even
a
single
example
in
which
a
lawyer
sits
down
with
a
client
and
walks
through
alternative
case
theories
and
their
implications
for
the
case
and
client
in
this
respect
the
client
centered
approach
differs
little
from
the
traditional
approach
which
relegates
virtually
every
decision
about
case
theory
to
lawyers
n
other
critics
argue
that
clients
are
not
in
the
best
position
to
make
legal
decisions
instead
when
a
client
hires
you
he
demonstrates
tacit
willingness
for
you
to
make
lawyering
skills
decisions
free
from
consultation
with
them
n
the
difficulty
is
in
the
execution
professor
jane
stoever
writes
about
teaching
her
students
to
be
client
centered
and
client
empowering
advocates
who
provide
representation
that
enhances
both
a
survivors
safety
and
autonomy
n
implicit
in
client
centered
lawyering
is
that
the
client
may
reach
a
different
decision
than
the
lawyer
having
fostered
that
autonomy
what
do
we
do
when
autonomy
and
safety
diverge
professors

bryant
and
maria
arias
also
discuss
empowering
their
clinic
s
domestic
violence
clients
as
part
of
the
clinic
s
design
n
professors
bryant
and
arias
note
that
a
client
centered
approach
allows
the
students
to
see
patterns
of
oppression
and
recognize
the
uniqueness
of
each
client
s
situation
n
they
discuss
a
case
in
which
the
students
determined
that
the
client
wanted
to
file
court
papers
seeking
custody
and
a
restraining
order
which
the
students
prepared
but
the
client
missed
her
appointment
to
sign
the
papers
the
students
later
learned
through
a
social
worker
that
the
client
while
afraid
of
her
husband
was
not
ready
to
pursue
a
legal
remedy
n
professors
bryant
and
arias
note
that
the
clinic
s
client
empowerment
allows
the
client
to
participate
in
defining
what
a
lawyer
s
role
should
be
n
and
that
in
such
a
relationship
the
lawyer
s
role
changes
with
each
client
because
the
lawyer
alone
does
not
set
the
professional
boundaries
n
professor
michelle
jacobs
endorses
client
based
lawyering
as
a
good
model
for
students
but
states
that
a
major
weakness
is
the
failure
to
address
race
class
and
to
a
lesser
extent
gender
in
the
attorney
client
relationship
n
professor
jacobs
argues
that
the
purpose
of
client
centered
lawyering
as
a
model
is
to
return
the
client
to
the
centrality
of
the
lawyer
s
work
but
that
clients
particularly
clients
of
color
and
women
are
still
at
the
margins
of
the
relationship
n
she
reminds
us
that
everyone
including
lawyers
law
students
and
law
professors
have
preconceived
notions
rooted
in
our
cultural
background
n
in
the
domestic
violence
arena
our
preconceived
notions
often
center
on
our
difficulty
in
accepting
that
a
victim
of
domestic
violence
remains
with
her
abuser
a
great
deal
of
the
literature
on
domestic
violence
tries
to
answer
the
question
why
do
abused
women
stay
as
lawyers
we
translate
that
question
to
what
can
we
do
to
help
our
client
leave
as
professor
jacobs
points
out
only
when
we
see
the
client
s
reality
can
we
truly
work
with
the
client
in
a
collaborative
way
n
putting
aside
our
preconceived
notions
does
not
answer
our
question
of
limits
i
e
is
there
a
point
at
which
we
cannot
assist
the
client
in
relation
to
the
court
or
her
own
risky
behavior
but
it
does
move
us
further
down

road

on
the
definitional
difficulty
noting
that
belief
in
a
cause
and
a
desire
to
advance
that
cause
are
the
forces
that
drive
cause
lawyering
actions
for
cause
lawyers
but
how
does
one
determine
what
fits
within
the
rubric
n
ann
southworth
one
of
the
few
scholars
who
has
examined
the
right
s
response
to
the
historic
left
leaning
cause
lawyering
shows
that
the
cause
in
cause
lawyering
can
be
broad
indeed
and
virtually
every
progressive
cause
lawyer
now
has
a
conservative
counterpart
n
today
for
every
cause
we
can
be
confident
that
there
are
cause
lawyers
on
every
side
of
the
issue
cause
lawyering
in
the
field
of
domestic
violence
can
take
a
variety
of
approaches
karen
czapanskiy
notes
that
women
lawyers
and
law
professors
were
the
first
to
construct
the
issue
as
a
legal
problem
partly
as
a
consequence
of
the
identification
of
the
battering
of
women
as
an
issue
affecting
women
s
liberation
feminist
women
lawyers
were
instrumental
in
developing
the
theory
and
legal
regime
addressing
domestic
violence
issues
n
these
efforts
took
a
variety
of
forms
including
criminal
defense
n
family
law
in
both
legal
services
offices
n
and
private
practice
n
and
state
and
federal
legislative
efforts
to
establish
governmental
intervention
on
behalf
of
domestic
violence
victims
a
remarkably
successful
effort
resulting
in
restraining
order
statutes
and
other
protections
in
every
state
n
as
well
as
the
passage
of
the
violence
against
women
act
vawa
in
and
reauthorizations
in
and
n
still
today
s
domestic
violence
lawyers
may
agree
on
the
cause
but
not
necessarily
the
approach
twenty
years
after
professor
czapanskiy
emphasized
their
seminal
role
feminist
attorneys
still
play
a
major
role
in
representing
individual
clients
in
domestic
violence
cases
but
the
advocacy
community
is
split
into
those
who
support
and
those
who
oppose
mandatory
arrest
mandatory
arrest
and
no
drop
prosecutions
have
placed
prosecutors
in
a
more
prominent
role
as
deborah
epstein
has
noted
activists
have
focused
on
transforming
the
responses
of
police
prosecutors
and
the
courts
n
legal
reforms
include
warrantless
arrest
mandatory
arrest
no
drop
prosecutions
and
temporary
orders
with
substantial
implications
and
few
procedural
protections
n
donna
wills
a
veteran
family
violence
prosecutor
in
los
angeles
has
written
that
she
firmly
believes
that
an
aggressive
no
drop
and
no
dismissal
policy
is
the
enlightened
approach
to
domestic
violence
prosecutions
n
wills
approaches
domestic
violence
through
a
cause
lawyer
s
lens
stating
that
it
is
a
societal
problem
not
just
an
individual
or
private
problem
with
a
strong
state
interest
in
maintaining
public
safety
in
focusing
on
the
state
interest
wills
expands
the
protective
umbrella
to
include
children
as
secondary
victims
n
to
wills
and
other
supporters
of
mandatory
arrest
and
no
drop
policies
these
policies
prevent
batterers
from
controlling
the
justice
system
through
their
victims
n
under
this
approach
the
domestic
violence
victim
is
best
protected
by
having
no
power
with
decision
making
resting
with
the
state
in
the
form
of
the
police
and
prosecutor
as
wills
admits
there
is
no
evidence
that
mandatory
arrest
and
no
drop
policies
reduce
the
incidence
of
domestic
violence
n
betsy
tsai
a
domestic
violence
resource
coordinator
for
the
new
york
city
courts
notes
that
criminal
justice
system
employees
are
frustrated
and
embarrassed
by
their
inability
to
protect
victims
of
domestic
violence
and
suggests
that
the
court
system
should
look
toward
specialized
domestic
violence
courts
n
the
specialized
courts
incorporate
therapeutic
jurisprudence
a
multidisciplinary
effort
to
provide
comprehensive
services
n
therapeutic
jurisprudence
is
a
reaction
to
the
inevitable
mental
health
and
psychological
functioning
of
the
participants
in
the
legal
system
n
in
practice
a
therapeutic
approach
would
include
a
supportive
and
informative
environment
to
the
victim
victim
and
witness
advocates
police
training
more
careful
monitoring
of
defendant
compliance
with
court
orders
and
participation
in
intervention
programs
for
abusers
n
this
does
not
mean
that
the
victim
regains
control
of
the
decisions
that
so
dramatically
affect
her
life
in
many
jurisdictions
employing
a
therapeutic
jurisprudence
system
the
state
not
the
victim
controls

private

elizabeth

wrote
that
once
you
enter
the
criminal
law
system
it
s
not
just
the
interest
of
the
victim
but
of
society
that
is
at
issue
going
into
the
system
you
marshal
the
resources
of
the
state
to
protect
you
but
you
also
cede
some
control
of
the
case
to
the
state
mary
and
elizabeth
raise
the
question
of
whether
private
rights
become
public
once
a
victim
seeks
state
intervention
does
society
have
an
independent
interest
in
enforcing
the
restraining
order
courts
have
allowed
the
public
interest
to
transcend
private
choices
including
forced
feeding
in
prisons
n
and
forced
medical
care
to
children
even
in
the
face
of
religious
opposition
by
the
child
s
parents
n
the
commonality
in
these
cases
is
the
likelihood
of
harm
and
the
public
interest
in
preventing
that
harm
the
question
when
it
comes
to
domestic
violence
cases
is
the
extent
to
which
we
are
comfortable
predicting
future
violence
and
whether
or
not
our
conclusions
should
affect
our
representation
of
clients
who
are
at
risk
in
the
area
of
domestic
violence
the
rationale
behind
mandatory
arrest
policies
and
forced
testimony
combines
the
notions
of
many
of
the
themes
of
this
paper
including
a
patronizing
view
of
protecting
the
victim
from
her
inability
to
protect
herself
a
reformist
attitude
of
treating
all
cases
uniformly
the
criminalization
of
domestic
violence
and
the
transfer
of
decision
making
to
the
state
does
state
involvement
either
through
civil
or
criminal
process
turn
a
private
domestic
violence
matter
into
a
public
issue
as
we
discussed
earlier
several
courts
have
sanctioned
women
or
forced
them
to
testify
when
the
women
refused
to
cooperate
with
the
state
in
pursuing
domestic
violence
remedies
or
testifying
in
criminal
matters
implicit
in
these
decisions
is
a
belief
that
the
right
to
withdraw
from
civil
or
criminal
prosecution
has
been
supplanted
by
state
interests
to
get
a
sense
of
judicial
reasoning
in
domestic
violence
cases
it
helps
to
look
at
death
penalty
cases
where
the
issue
of
public
rights
trumping
the
private
attorney
client
relationship
has
arisen
prominently
in
a
connecticut
court
sentenced
michael
ross
to
death
after
he
confessed
to
murdering
eight
women
n
he
fought
execution
for
seventeen
years
but
ultimately
withdrew
all
appeals
and
requested
that
the
execution
go
forward
n
starting
a
new
proceeding
questioning
whether
a
defendant
can
rationally
and
competently
choose
to
die
and
whether
the
public
has
a
right
to
contest
an
execution
the
chief
public
defender
s
office
sought
to
intervene
in
ross
s
case
arguing
that
ross
was
trying
to
commit
judicial
state
assisted
suicide
an
argument
based
on
ross
s
alleged
incompetence
to
make
the
decision
to
consent
to
the
execution
n
ross
s
former
lawyer
the
office
of
the
public
defender
argued
that
ross
s
execution
would
make
executions
more
socially
and
politically
acceptable
an
issue
of
great
importance
to
the
public
defender
s
other
clients
facing
execution
n
the
public
defender
s
prediction
was
almost
certainly
factually
correct
but
this
is
not
how
attorneys
usually
act
rule
of
the
model
rules
of
professional
conduct
n
explicitly
prohibited
the
public
defender
from
representing
an
interest
adverse
to
ross
and
rule
explicitly
prohibited
using
information
obtained
during
representation
against
ross
s
interests
n
how
then
could
the
public
defender
use
its
knowledge
of
ross
s
mental
condition
as
the
basis
for
legal
actions
that
in
the
words
of
ross
s
subsequent
attorney
t
r
paulding
are
contrary
to
the
defendant
s
wishes
or
desires
n
the
answer
and
this
is
not
much
of
an
answer
is
that
some
issues
raise
public
as
well
as
private
rights
ross
understood
the
incongruous
nature
of
the
proceedings
stating
on
his
web
site
that
i
fully
support
their
position
and
efforts
to
bring
about
the
abolition
of
capital
punishment
in
this
state
but
i
do
have
a
problem
when
they
interfere
with
my
personal
decisions
to
resolve
this
case
in
a
manner
that
i
believe
will
harm
the
least
number
of
people
these
are
decisions
that
i
and
i
alone
must
make
n
ross
objected
to
the
actions
of
the
public
defender
stating
what
i
m
hoping
is
that
january
i
will
be
executed
i
just
don
t
understand
why
the
public
defenders
can
t
understand
that
i
mean
it
s
so
simple
and
it
s
my
damned
decision
n
ross
s
sister
and
father
each
filed
separate
next
friend
actions
his
sister
arguing
that
ross
was
not
mentally
competent
to
waive
his
rights
and
his
father
arguing
that
his
rights
were
being
violated
because
he
could
not
volunteer
to
be
executed
n
the
case
was
assigned
to
u
s
district
judge
robert
chatigny
who
raised
concerns
about
the
competency
claims
n
paulding
argued
that
ross
understood
the
appeals
process
was
knowledgeable
about
death
penalty
law
and
was
choosing
to
forego
appeals
n
he
stated
that
ross
had
made
a
logical
rational
decision
he
needed
a
voice
in
our
court
system
i
think
i
m
an
attorney
before
i
m
a
defense
attorney
i
think
your
duty
your
basic
duty
as
an
attorney
is
to
represent
your
client
n
judge
chatigny
tried
to
persuade
paulding
to
pursue
an
appeal
despite
ross
s
expressed
wishes
of
his
client
n
telling
him
what
you
are
doing
is
terribly
terribly
wrong
no
matter
how
well
motivated
you
are
you
have
a
client
whose
competence
is
in
serious
doubt
and
you
don
t
know
what
you
are
talking
about
n
that
failure
to
pursue
an
appeal
was
malpractice
n
and
threatening
to
go
after
paulding
s
license
to
practice
law
if
future
evidence
showed
that
ross
was
not
competent
n
paulding
got
the
message
and
filed
motions
for
another
competency
hearing
in
state
court
the
state
court
held
that
ross
was
mentally
competent
to
waive
future
appeals
and
proceed
to
his
execution
n
he
was
executed
on
may
n
in
the
new
jersey
supreme
court
considering
a
similar
question
explicitly
transformed
the
defendant
s
rights
into
a
public
question
holding
that
appeals
of
a
death
sentence
were
mandatory
and
could
not
be
waived
n
stating
that
the
public
interest
transcends
the
preferences
of
individual
defendants
n
like
ross
john
martini
requested
that
his
execution
proceed
as
scheduled
and
that
his
public
defender
not
pursue
post
conviction
relief
in
proceeding
with
a
post
conviction
review
the
court
noted
that
it
is
difficult
to
explain
why
a
murderer
who
has
admitted
his
guilt
and
had
his
conviction
and
sentence
of
death
affirmed
on
direct
appeal
should
not
be
granted
his
request
to
be
executed
immediately
for
some
no
explanation
may
be
necessary
for
others
no
explanation
will
suffice
for
those
who
wish
to
understand
we
explain
that
under
our
form
of
government
it
is
not
the
inmate
on
death
row
or
the
accused
who
determines
when
and
whether
the
state
shall
execute
a
prisoner
rather
the
law
itself
makes
that
determination
the
public
has
an
interest
in
the
reliability
and
integrity
of
a
death
sentencing
decision
that
transcends
the
preferences
of
individual
defendants
n
the
court
recognized
that
its
view
was
not
universal
we
acknowledge
that
other
jurisdictions
do
not
recognize
the
standing
of
one
such
as
the
public
defender
to
prosecute
a
post
conviction
relief
application
on
behalf
of
a
death
row
inmate
who
does
not
seek
their
assistance
it
is
a
natural
reaction
for
some
to
wish
to
be
rid
of
an
admitted
murderer
who
asks
to
be
executed
the
court
is
nonetheless
required
to
ensure
the
integrity
of
death
sentences
in
new
jersey
n
martini
changed
his
mind
and
requested
that
his
public
defender
pursue
any
available
remedies
n
he
was
subsequently
convicted
of
three
additional
murders
in
pennsylvania
and
arizona
n
on
july
the
new
jersey
supreme
court
upheld
martini
s
death
sentence
but
new
jersey
had
imposed
a
moratorium
on
the
death
penalty
six
months
earlier
n
martini
died
in
prison
in
n
are
public
rights
implicated
in
domestic
violence
cases
as
elizabeth
tulis
noted
when
a
victim
obtains
a
restraining
order
not
to
mention
a
protective
order
she
cedes
some
authority
to
the
state
do
we
as
lawyers
cede
a
part
of
our
relationship
with
our
clients
we
are
trained
as
lawyers
to
separate
ourselves
from
the
consequences
to
third
parties
of
our
representation
criminal
defense
attorneys
accept
that
they
are
representing
the
accused
not
the
victim
society
or
the
hypothetical
future
victim
attorneys
representing
a
parent
in
a
dependency
and
neglect
case
take
direction
from
the
parent
regardless
of
qualms
about
the
child
s
future
care
in
domestic
violence
cases
we
accept
that
there
are
valid
reasons
why
women
do
not
leave
the
abuser
and
that
additional
abuse
may
and
often
does
occur
during
the
representation
there
is
a
different
quality
to
a
case
in
which
a
client
is
using
the
lawyer
s
legal
services
to
avoid
a
court
order
meant
to
protect
her
is
there
a
point
at
which
this
becomes
a
public
right
enforceable
by
the
state
while
it
is
rare
victims
having
obtained
restraining
orders
have
been
charged
with
violating
those
orders
while
some
courts
have
struck
down
the
charges
against
the
victim
as
a
violation
of
the
due
process
clause
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
n
the
analogy
to
death
cases
may
be
useful
on
a
lethality
scale
but
falters
when
considering
the
competing
interests
of
the
victim
when
law
enforcement
intervenes
and
penalizes
the
victim
for
violating
a
restraining
order
against
her
abuser
the
focus
of
the
legal
system
shifts
from
the
abuser
to
the
victim
and
the
abuser
is
not
held
fully
accountable
n
the
victim
is
prosecuted
for
inviting
her
abuser
back
into
her
life
often
for
a
legitimate
purpose
such
as
to
discuss
childcare
or
request
financial
assistance
n
when
a
civil
restraining
order
can
be
enforced
against
either
party
the
purposes
of
the
restraining
order
system
are
undermined
victims
will
be
less
likely
to
report
abuse
for
fear
any
action
on
theirs
will
be
used
against
them
abusers
could
use
the
restraining
orders
as
continued
ploys
against
their
battered
victims
and
the
blame
for
the
abuse
shifts
from
the
batterer
to
the
battered
in
the
abstract
the
public
enforcement
of
restraining
orders
like
mandatory
arrest
policies
has
advantages
however
in
the
context
of
domestic
violence
the
public
s
interest
in
the
victim
s
well
being
is
not
so
black
and
white
the
enforcement
of
the
restraining
order
may
serve
the
public
good
of
protecting
the
victim
but
if
the
means
necessary
for
that
enforcement
further
victimizes
the
battered
woman
and
provides
a
disincentive
for
victims
to
report
abuse
at
all
then
we
need
to
question
whether
the
benefit
of
enhanced
enforcement
outweighs
the
inherent
value
of
client
based
decision
making
we
are
concerned
about
our
clients
safety
and
we
try
to
advise
them
as
best
we
can
but
we
are
not
in
the
business
of
predicting
future
harm
others
however
are
predicting
behavior
and
lethality
assessments
are
increasingly
a
part
of
law
enforcement
and
safety
planning
and
it
is
useful
to
take
a
look
at
this
field
vii
risk
and
lethality
assessment
and
the
predictability
of
violence
and
does
it
matter
legal
scholars
have
devoted
a
good
deal
of
effort
to
the
question
of
character
evidence
and
how
it
can
help
predict
behavior
much
of
the
discussion
starts
with
g
w
allport
a
psychologist
a
founder
of
trait
theory
allport
believed
that
traits
were
the
most
fundamental
building
blocks
of
personality
n
trait
theorists
believed
that
traits
were
stable
and
enduring
and
produced
generally
consistent
behavior
over
a
variety
of
situations
n
in
the
realm
of
trait
theory
a
person
who
lies
in
one
situation
will
lie
in
other
situations
a
person
who
is
violent
in
one
circumstance
will
likely
be
violent
in
other
circumstances
n
trait
theory
would
allow
us
to
predict
behavior
including
criminal
behavior
empirical
research
did
not
support
the
trait
theorists
n
walter
mischel
found
that
behavior
depends
on
stimulus
situations
and
is
specific
to
the
situation
response
patterns
even
in
highly
similar
situations
often
fail
to
be
strongly
related
n
however
between
and
mischel
along
with
his
colleague
yuichi
shoda
modified
his
views
on
character
traits
and
predictability
mischel
and
shoda
assert
that
we
can
develop
a
fuller
personality
profile
that
includes
a
variety
of
psychological
ingredients
one
that
could
successfully
predict
particularized
behavior
n
more
recently
professor
edward
imwinkelried
asserted
that
most
recent
studies
agree
that
predicting
behavior
based
on
interactions
between
character
traits
and
situations
is
more
accurate
than
predictions
based
on
either
traits
or
situations
n
since
legal
scholarship
on
predictability
revolves
around
the
admissibility
in
court
of
character
evidence
a
theory
more
accurate
is
different
from
more
likely
than
not
and
is
not
going
to
result
in
reconsidering
long
standing
rules
of
evidence
the
question
here
however
is
whether
predictability
should
inform
our
representation
of
vulnerable
clients
domestic
violence
is
a
subset
within
the
broader
category
of
violent
crime
many
people
including
members
of
congress
believe
that
crimes
of
sexual
violence
and
child
molestation
deserve
special
treatment
to
the
chagrin
of
many
judges
lawyers
and
scholars
congress
amended
the
federal
rules
of
evidence
to
allow
the
admission
of
past
similar
acts
in
criminal
cases
in
which
the
defendant
is
accused
of
sexual
assault
n
or
child
molestation
n
and
to
allow
the
admission
of
past
similar
actions
for
civil
actions
involving
sexual
assault
or
child
molestation
n
in
a
report
submitted
to
congress
in
the
judicial
conference
requested
that
congress
reconsider
rules
and
reporting
overwhelming
opposition
two
years
later
katharine
baker
wrote
that
advocates
of
rule
unabashedly
and
without
proof
suggest
that
rapists
are
more
likely
than
other
criminals
to
repeat
their
acts
the
evidence
that
we
have
is
to
the
contrary
n
according
to
studies
by
the
bureau
of
justice
statistics
recidivism
for
drug
offenses
larceny
theft
burglary
and
robbery
are
all
much
higher
than
rape
sexual
assault
and
child
molestation
in
fact
only
homicide
is
lower
n
that
did
not
deter
congress
or
the
state
legislatures
of
california
and
illinois
both
of
which
amended
their
rules
of
evidence
to
allow
prior
acts
of
domestic
violence

cases
in
which
the
victim
was
murdered
n

to
the

and

just
prior
to
the
scott
peterson
trial
which
culminated
in
a
conviction
the
history
of
predicting
criminal
behavior
is
at
best
a
cautionary
tale
the
ancient
greeks
including
aristotle
believed
in
physiognomy
the
ability
to
predict
human
character
by
physical
appearance
in
the
th
century
phrenologists
believed
they
could
predict

criminal
behavior

certain
bumps

considered
by
many
intellectuals
to
be
a
real

bram
stoker

refer
to

states
that

the

has
caught
up

on

findings
of

george

victims
ability
to
understand
their
situations
or
predict
their
risk
of
being

or
murdered
these
instruments
arise
from
the
belief
that
most
people
do
a
poor
job
of
evaluating
their
own
risk
for
negative
outcomes
n
some
researchers
believe
that
domestic
violence
victims
are
deficient
in
recognizing
danger
in
domestic
violence
relationships
n
others
believe
that
victims
cannot
predict
future
violence
even
with
the
aid
of
risk
assessment
instruments
because
there
is
no
real
way
to
predict
unpredictable
behavior
n
contrary
to
the
inherent
claims
of
the
various
risk
assessment
tools
victims
are
generally
the
best
predictors
of
their
own
risk
of
being
seriously
injured
n
victims
have
a
unique
ability
to
predict
the
violence
and
anticipate
the
degree
of
violence
n
studies
show
that
domestic
violence
victims
ratings
of
their
risk
of
future
violence
committed
by
an
intimate
partner
are
fairly
accurate
n
almost
sixty
five
of
domestic
violence
victims
accurately
predict
their
risk
of
reassault
n
victims
may
not
accurately
predict
lethal
violence
however
in
one
study
only
about
half
of
victims
of
intimate
partner
homicide
or
attempted
homicide
recognized
that
their
abusers
were
capable
of
killing
them
n
in
judging
risk
victims
use
different
factors
than
those
utilized
by
risk
assessment
tools
including
interpretations
of
the
abuser
s
moods
facial
expressions
speech
patterns
and
verbal
threats
n
they
also
rely
on
abuser
personality
traits
and
dynamic
factors
like
the
abuser
s
ability
to
find
the
victim
and
his
desire
for
revenge
n
these
factors
are
difficult
for
risk
assessment
tools
to
capture
victims
also
rely
on
some
of
the
same
factors
used
by
assessment
tools
to
predict
violence
including
the
status
of
the
relationship
the
history
of
violence
in
the
relationship
and
substance
use
n
some
of
the
instruments
primary
indicators
like
the
abuser
s
criminal
history
or
the
abuser
being
in
a
stepparent
role
play
almost
no
role
in
victim
prediction
n
in
fact
lethality
assessments
generally
incorporate
the
victim
s
own
assessment
of
risk
bolstering
the
effectiveness
of
the
instrument
for
example
the
first
risk
factor
listed
by
de
becker
who
developed
mosaic
is
the
woman
has
intuitive
feelings
that
she
is
at
risk
n
this
factor
is
the
only
one
to
appear
in
italics
adding
emphasis
to
its
importance
to
the
assessment
the
last
factor
is
his
wife
partner
fears
he
will
injure
or
kill
her
she
has
discussed
this
with
others
or
has
made
plans
to
be
carried
out
in
the
event
of
her
death
n
both
factors
support
the
importance
of
victim
prediction
in
risk
assessment
and
incorporates
victim
prediction
into
the
instrument
campbell
s
danger
assessment
also
incorporates
victim
risk
assessment
into
its
instrument
the
eighteenth
factor
in
the
danger
assessment
is
do
you
believe
he
is
capable
of
killing
you
n
research
shows
that
incorporating
the
victim
s
assessment
of
danger
improves
instrument
prediction
n
one
study
revealed
that
victims
perceptions
of
risk
were
better
at
predicting
reassault
than
the
k
sid
but
that
the
danger
assessment
was
more
accurate
at
predicting
lethal
violence
than
the
victims
themselves
n
the
research
concluded
that
women
s
perceptions
of
risk
are
a
reasonably
accurate
predictor
of
reassault
n
interestingly
the
study
found
that
a
victim
s
risk
was
to
some
extent
determined
by
the
victim
s
perception
of
the
risk
victims
who
were
at
greatest
risk
of
future
harm
were
those
who
felt
somewhat
safe
and
therefore
did
not
take
proactive
action
to
seek
safety
such
as
separating
from
the
abuser
or
safety
planning
n
victims
who
felt
safe
victims
who
felt
like
they
were
in
danger
and
victims
who
did
not
know
whether
they
were
at
risk
were
less
likely
to
be
reassaulted
because
there
was
less
risk
or
because
precautions
were
taken
n
it
is
not
our
purpose
to
opine
on
whether
mosaic
the
dvsi
or
any
other
instrument
should
be
used
to
predict
serious
or
lethal
intimate
partner
violence
nor
do
we
have
the
capacity
to
do
so
but
it
is
fair
to
assume
that
these
efforts
will
become
increasingly
sophisticated
and
the
implications
are
dramatic
the
notion
of
law
enforcement
profiling
as
a
preventative
tool
is
well
established
and
there
is
a
great
deal
of
literature
on
the
value
or
lack
thereof
of
profiling
our
question
is
different
even
assuming
that
the
perfect
profiling
tool
exists
does
it
affect
the
attorney
client
relationship
put
another
way
when
we
talk
about
the
attorney
client
relationship
particularly
in
the
context
of
client
centered
lawyering
we
take
for
granted
that
the
lawyer
takes
direction
from
the
competent
client
can
we
maintain
that
presumption
if
we
believe
mosaic
is
an
accurate
assessor
and
mosaic
tells
us
that
an
abuser
is
about
to
commit
one
of
america
s
most
predictable
murders
n
murder
can
be
the
ultimate
form
of
control
through
the
threat
of
murder
the
abuser
leverages
everything
the
victim
has
her
access
to
work
her
children

the
world
prior

violence

the
single
greatest
predictor

nine
percent

homicide
victims

n
without
using

or

assessment
tools
domestic
violence
attorneys
know
that
prior
domestic
violence
predicts
homicidal
possibilities
most
domestic
violence
attorneys
fear
that
the
next
news
item
about
domestic
violence
homicide
will
feature
one
of
their
clients
while
attorneys
should
be
concerned
about
the
potential
for
lethal
violence
against
their
clients
this
fear
must
be
subsumed
by
the
responsibilities
we
carry
in
our
professional
capacity
ultimately
the
lawyer
s
own
worries
about
her
role
or
responsibility
in
the
client
s
safety
must
give
way
to
the
client
s
interests
conclusion
we
approached
this
article
as
practicing
lawyers
and
clinical
teachers
looking
at
a
problem
that
domestic
violence
victims
and
their
lawyers
face
every
day
given
the
many
vagaries
of
the
rules
of
professional
responsibility
and
the
basic
agency
role
of
the
lawyer
it
is
not
surprising
that
our
own
discipline
offered
little
help
does
anything
else
matter
we
think
that
is
a
fair
question
in
writing
this
article
we
have
come
full
circle
the
project
started
with
a
post
hoc
reflection
of
our
actions
in
barbara
s
case
as
is
evident
from
the
paper
each
question
led
to
new
questions
some
of
which
were
unexpected
all
domestic
violence
practitioners
are
conscious
of
the
nightmare
scenario
inherent
in
their
cases
and
we
are
no
different
we
are
aware
that
barbara
s
case
could
have
turned
out
differently
that
is
a
sobering
thought
and
in
the
clinical
context
we
asked
ourselves
whether
students
should
be
put
into
the
position
of
being
in
the
front
lines
of
a
case
that
has
the
potential
to
be
so
devastating
in
the
end
we
came
back
to
where
we
started
while
we
do
not
discount
the
effect
of
a
positive
result
for
the
client
on
our
views
we
believe
strongly
that
our
commitment
to
our
client
included
the
trust
in
her
ability
and
judgment
to
make
the
decision
to
argue
that
her
husband
should
not
be
incarcerated
and
that
our
commitment
to
our
students
included
sharing
the
full
responsibilities
of
our
representation
in
making
the
latter
conclusion
we
are
informed
and
impressed
by
our
students
views
we
discussed
these
issues
with
them
and
as
is
evident
from
their
g
chat
they
discussed
the
issues
with
each
other
that
said
we
have
three
caveats
first
we
and
our
students
benefitted
from
a
multi
disciplinary
approach
which
included
classes
by
a
psychologist
and
social
workers
on
the
nature
of
domestic
violence
along
with
the
opportunity
to
consult
with
the
same
professionals
on
cases
we
encouraged
students
to
use
these
opportunities
to
talk
about
their
own
concerns
and
provided
the
opportunity
to
do
so
in
confidential
settings
this
is
not
a
luxury
we
think
it
is
a
critical
part
of
clinical
work
in
domestic
violence
second
we
cannot
underestimate
the
benefit
to
both
clients
and
students
of
having
students
working
on
the
same
case
for
at
least
two
semesters
with
the
opportunity
to
continue
longer
especially
for
the
purpose
of
continuing
with
an
existing
client
during
our
representation
of
barbara
our
students
prepared
filed
mediated
and
litigated
motions
and
the
trial
defended
an
appeal
prepared
and
filed
a
successful
petition
for
innocent
spouse
tax
relief
negotiated
forbearance
on
a
mortgage
foreclosure
negotiated
forbearance
and
obtained
a
court
ordered
title
transfer
on
an
automobile
talked
with
accountants
bankers
psychiatrists
social
workers
victim
advocates
court
mediators
and
lawyers
and
generally
lived
with
the
case
throughout
law
school
they
appeared
in
court
numerous
times
before
four
judges
and
by
the
time
the
graduated
were
greeted
warmly
in
the
courthouse
by
state
marshals
family
relations
advisors
and
court
clerks
as
barbara
mentioned
several
times
the
relationship
she
built
with
mary
and
elizabeth
provided
relief
at
times
of
stress
it
would
have
been
difficult
to
change
students
every
semester
third
as
professor
carey
has
written
elsewhere
n
we
continue
to
believe
in
the
need
to
provide
holistic
services
with
a
full
range
of
legal
services
we
believe
our
obligation
to
our
client
is
to
use
our
skills
to
try
to
solve
her
problems
and
our
obligation
to
our
students
is
to
teach
the
skills
necessary
to
make
that
effort
there
are
cases
that
conclude
with
the
granting
of
a
restraining
order
but
many
cases
involve
other
family
issues
as
well
as
collateral
legal
issues
arising
from
the
breakup
of
the
relationship
if
we
are
truly
committed
to
teaching
best
practices
we
need
to
be
willing
to
provide
the
highest
quality
services
in
the
case
of
domestic
violence
obtaining
a
restraining
order
without
resolving
child
custody
support
and
other
critical
family
issues
will
inevitably
leave
many
clients
at
a
loss
when
we
limit
our
representation
we
start
from
the
proposition
that
we
are
not
intending
to
resolve
the
client
s
problems
the
message
to
students
is
that
skills
are
enough
we
should
be
striving
for
higher
standards

introduction
rapid
technological
advancement
has
dramatically
expanded
the
warrantless
powers
of
government
to
obtain
information
about
individual
citizens
directly
from
the
private
domain
biometrics
technology
n
such
as
voice
recognition
hand
measurement
iris
and
retinal
imaging
and
facial
recognition
technology
frt
offers
enormous
potential
for
law
enforcement
and
national
security
but
it
comes
at
a
cost
although
much
of
the
american
public
is
complacent
with
government
monitoring
for
security
reasons
n
people
also
expect
to
go
about
daily
life
in
relative
obscurity
unidentifiable
to
others
they
do
not
already
know
do
not
care
to
know
or
are
not
required
to
know
so
long
as
they
abide
by
the
law
the
reality
is
quite
different
the
government
and
the
private
sector
have
the
capacity
for
surveillance
of
nearly
everyone
in
america
as
one
commentator
puts
it
soon
there
really
will
be
nowhere
to
run
and
nowhere
to
hide
short
of
living
in
a
cave
far
removed
from
technology
n
frt
is
a
major
contributor
to
the
spectre
of
an
orwellian
society
n
facebook
uses
it
to
identify
friends
from
uploaded
photos
which
are
permanently
affixed
in
cyberspace
n
and
accessible
to
the
government
n
federal
and
state
authorities
have
their
own
databases
of
images
collected
from
drivers
licenses
public
surveillance
cameras
unmanned
aerial
drones
and
tiny
recording
devices
attached
to
police
uniforms
n
currently
the
fbi
is
working
on
a
billion
effort
to
expand
its
fingerprint
identification
system
to
cross
reference
frt
and
other
biometric
data
against
a
vast
data
repository
that
includes
some
million
criminal
mug
shot
photos
n
with
frt
a
federal
agent
or
corporate
marketer
can
convert
any
number
of
these
facial
images
into
algorithms
associate
them
with
countless
other
bits
of
personal
data
accumulating
throughout
the
global
information
network
and
track
the
most
intimate
details
of
an
unsuspecting
person
s
daily
life
there
is
no
recognized
constitutional
theory
for
placing
boundaries
on
the
government
s
ability
to
engage
in
ubiquitous
monitoring
of
citizens
based
on
images
snapped
in
public
or
posted
online
the
supreme
court
has
made
clear
that
the
fourth
amendment
does
not
protect
what
a
person
knowingly
exposes
to
the
public
n
nor
does
it
cover
information
revealed
to
third
parties
n
thus
although
corporations
and
individual
citizens
generate
the
largest
storehouses
of
personal
data
today
the
government
through
its
subpoena
powers
contractual
agreements
and
public
access
to
online
data
can
effectively
bootstrap
private
information
into
its
own
domain
without
contending
with
the
constitution
as
a
consequence
technology
has
minimized
the
constitution
s
importance
as
a
mechanism
for
protecting
against
arbitrary
government
tracking
of
one
s
movements
habits
relationships
interests
and
thoughts
this
article
attempts
to
reassert
the
constitution
s
relevance
when
it
comes
to
surveillance
through
frt
and
related
technologies
in
two
ways
first
it
argues
for
recognition
of
anonymity
as
a
constitutional
value
that
is
both
implicit
in
the
court
s
fourth
amendment
jurisprudence
and
explicit
in
its
first
amendment
jurisprudence
second
it
suggests
that
a
shift
in
technology
s
intersection
with
data
from
analysis
of
static
bits
of
information
in
the
pre
digital
age
to
a
growing
respect
for
correlations
among
data
in
the
digital
age
warrants
a
fresh
look
at
fourth
amendment
doctrine
that
ex
cuses
surveillance
based
on
information
obtained
in
public
or
from
third
parties
n
frt
allows
users
to
correlate
numerical
faceprint
algorithms
with
other
data
points
to
create
new
information
relating
to
an
individual
s
past
present
and
future
life
n
constitutional
law
must
account
for
this
modern
capacity
to
manipulate
data
for
predictive
intelligence
to
this
end
the
article
derives
doctrinal
guidelines
for
grappling
with
technology
s
threat
to
the
constitutional
value
of
anonymity
from
a
reconciliation
of
the
fourth
and
first
amendment
law
bearing
on
the
issue
part
i
defines
anonymity
and
explains
that
respect
for
the
capacity
to
remain
physically
and
psychologically
unknown
to
the
government
traces
back
to
the
founding
with
the
advent
and
expansion
of
new
technologies
such
as
frt
the
ability
to
remain
anonymous
has
eroded
leading
to
a
litany
of
possible
harms
part
ii
reviews
the
existing
fourth
and
first
amendment
doctrine
that
is
available
to
stave
off
ubiquitous
government
surveillance
and
identifies
anonymity
as
a
constitutional
value
that
warrants
more
explicit
doctrinal
protection
although
the
fourth
amendment
has
been
construed
to
excise
surveillance
of
public
and
third
party
information
from
its
scope
the
court
s
recent
jurisprudence
indicates
a
growing
recognition
that
constitutional
doctrine
is
out
of
step
with
modern
surveillance
technologies
the
supreme
court
has
expressly
recognized
a
first
amendment
right
to
anonymous
speech
which
should
be
taken
into
account
in
assessing
the
constitutionality
of
government
surveillance
systems
under
the
fourth
amendment
this
part
accordingly
draws
a
distinction
between
cases
that
arose
in
the
pre
digital
age
in
which
content

be
reconciled
to
address
the

derive
new

is
exceedingly
intimate

otherwise
out

that
this
qualitative
shift
in

constitutionally
significant

iii

offers
guidelines
gleaned
from
the
intersection
of
first

fourth
amendment
jurisprudence
for
consideration
by
lower
courts
and
legislators
as
they
address
the
threat
of
limitless
surveillance
which
big

present
i
the
public
value
of
anonymity
in
a
commentator
observed
that
one

automated
society
might
look
upon
privacy
with
the
same
air
of
amused
nostalgia
we
now
reserve
for
say
elaborate
eighteenth
century
drawing
room
manners
n
numerous
modern
scholars
have
similarly
declared
that
privacy
is
in
peril
distress
or
danger
n
much
has
been
written
about
the
need
to
adapt
fourth
amendment
law
to
accommodate
modern
infringements
on
privacy
interests
n
as
this
part
explains
frt
focuses
particular
attention
on
one
aspect
of
privacy
the
ability
to
manage
and
retain
one
s
anonymity
this
part
defines
anonymity
and
attempts
to
place
it
in
some
historical
context
although
american
colonists
lived
under
the
constant
gaze
of
their
communities
they
abhorred
the
officious
prying
of
british
authorities
they
also
robustly
engaged
in
anonymous
speech
this
part
goes
on
to
describe
modern
day
frt
and
the
threat
it
poses
to
privacy
in
the
twenty
first
century
in
short
technology
has
put
in
jeopardy
a
value
that
most
americans
take
for
granted
the
ability
to
carry
on
largely
incognito
if
we
so
choose
a
anonymity
defined
privacy
is
a
vague
notion
that
means
different
things
to
different
people
in
various
contexts
n
scholars
have
painstakingly
developed
taxonomies
for
privacy
parsing
its
subcomponents
in
an
effort
to
develop
a
more
accurate
vocabulary
for
debate
and
analysis
n
two
conceptions
of
privacy
are
particularly
accessible
to
most
laypeople
n
informational
privacy
is
the
interest
in
avoiding
disclosure
of
personal
matters
and
controlling
one
s
own
personal
information
which
the
supreme
court
has
suggested
is
constitutionally
protected
when
gathered
and
held
by
the
government
n
today
the
term
often
relates
to
information
stored
on
computer
systems
such
as
medical
records
financial
data
criminal
records
political
records
business
related
information
and
online
data
n
physical
privacy
has
traditionally
been
equated
with
the
protection
of
one
s
person
or
physical
space
such
as
a
home
or
vehicle
violations
of
physical
privacy
can
trigger
fourth
amendment
and
or
common
law
scrutiny
n
people
intrinsically
appreciate
the
need
for
legal
limits
on
the
ability
of
the
government
and
others
to
invade
one
s
home
or
body
absent
consent
related
to
both
informational
and
physical
privacy
but
less
salient
in
the
collective
mind
of
the
public
is
the
concept
of
anonymity
the
state
of
hiding
in
plain
sight
from
the
government
so
long
as
one
abides
by
the
rule
of
law
anonymity
is
the
freedom
from
being
identified
and
tracked
by
name
while
going
through
the
motions
of
daily
life
including
physical
movement
in
private
and
public
spaces
the
transaction
of
business
online
and
the
maintenance
of
personal
and
professional
relationships
habits
and
beliefs
however
unpopular
or
repugnant
n
anonymity
enables
one
to
re
main
undifferentiated
in
public
in
literal
terms
it
means
nameless

as
justice
sotomayor
suggested
in
united
states
v
jones
n
the
everyday
occurrences
for
which
anonymity
is
appreciated

little
imagination

conjure
trips

the
psychiatrist

access

s
physical
whereabouts
anonymity
shelters
private
information
about

s
thoughts

plans
for
the
future

it
fosters
the
capacity
to
control
or
limit
access
to
one
s
intimate
relationships
or
aspects
of
life
n
and
accordingly
to
exclude
others
from
the
very
consciousness
of
the
mind
n
in
the
late
eighteenth
century
philosopher
jeremy
bentham
famously
unveiled
his
panopticon
design
for
institutional
buildings
which
contained
a
central
tower
surrounded
by
a
perimeter
of
backlit
cells
from
which
inmates
could
not
see
their
surveyors
n
bentham
described
the
design
as
a
new
mode
of
obtaining
power
of
mind
over
mind
as
a
single
guard
could
theoretically
control
all
of
the
prisoners
simultaneously
n
as
french
philosopher
michel
foucault
later
explained
the
prisoners
would
internalize
the
presumption
that
they
are
being
watched
and
modify
their
behavior
to
comply
with
expectations
n
rendering
the
guards
virtually
superfluous
legal
theorists
who
have
studied
the
panopticon
effect
posit
that
anonymity
in
public
promotes
freedom
of
action
and
an
open
society
while
a
lack
of
public
anonymity
promotes
conformity
and
an
oppressive
society
n
in
which
majoritarian
authority
will
coerce
citizens
into
silence
or
acquiescence
n
although
bentham
never
built
his
panopticon
the
association
of
privacy
with
anonymity
from
the
government
later
appeared
in
the
writings
of
samuel
warren
and
louis
brandeis
who
in
recognized
the
right
to
be
let
alone
n
as
an
important
definitional
component
of
privacy
and
one
that
has
since
become
the
foundation
of
privacy
law
in
the
united
states
n
in
the
twentieth
century
professor
william
prosser
similarly
identified
intrusions
upon
a
person
s
seclusion
or
solitude
as
a
distinct
kind
of
privacy
invasion
against
which
the
law
should
provide
protection
n
social
science
research
suggests
that
contemporary
americans
view
the
ability
to
move
about
in
public
or
online
without
being
tracked
as
an
important
aspect
of
privacy
n
surveys
indicate
that
internet
users
perceive
an
invasion
of
privacy
when
their
web
surfing
information
is
collected
and
shared
with
other
parties
n
people
especially
want
to
maintain
a
meaningful
degree
of
independence
from
the
government
when
it
comes
to
personal
thoughts
and
communications
with
others
even
before
online
technology
took
hold
survey
respondents
ranked
the
monitoring
of
phone
calls
for
thirty
days
and
the
reading
of
a
personal
diary
as
more
intrusive
than
the
government
s
withdrawal
of
blood
n
an
area
of
particular
public
concern
is
video
surveillance
which
may
arouse
fears
of
rigid
and
arbitrary
law
en
forcement
by
an
omniscient
state
n
national
surveys
and
focus
groups
indicate
that
the
threat
of
misuse
of
biometric
identifiers
is
a
point
of
concern
and
an
obstacle
to
social
acceptance
of
such
technologies
n
this
attitude
is
reflected
in
survey
participants
relative
distaste
for
the
use
of
biometric
identification
systems
in
public
events
like
a
professional
football
game
which
was
viewed
as
a
transgression
of
anonymity
and
decisional
autonomy
without
sufficient
policy
justification
or
assurance
that
the
identification
could
be
carried
out
with
accuracy
and
reliability
n
people
appear
to
be
more
willing
to
tolerate
privacy
intrusions
where
the
government
s
use
of
their
personal
information
would
foster
their
own

performed

against

terrorist
watch
list

checks

that

nonetheless
something
that

generally
take
for

recede

walking
down

awareness

a
consequence
the
public
is
unable
to
meaningfully
perform
a

calculus
regarding
the
government
s
use

forms

in

difficult
for

age

routinely
provide

perceived
benefit

ease

not
even
conceive
of

what
many
americans
fail
to
appreciate
is
that
technology
has
put
society
on
a
trajectory
whereby
even

kept
private
and
even
if
the
law
continues
to
protect
against
disclosures

categories

will
soon
become
a
relic
of
history
n
b
anonymity
historically
personal
privacy
was
hard
to
come
by
in
colonial
america
n
colonial
travelers
shared
beds
with
strangers
due
to
the
practical
necessity
of
the
warmth
and
protection
of
a
small
group

the
lack
of
ceilings
in
early
homes

gawking
from
the
roof

community

pressure

to
new
england
towns

permission
to
settle
there
n
and
residents
were
required
to
register
the
names

colonial
laws
forbade
residents
from
living
alone

far
from
the
meeting
house

center
of
town

was
the
practice
in
england
n
court
records

that
massachusetts
homes
were
systematically
searched
in
for
single
persons
to
be
relocated
with
families
n
opposition
to
solitary
living
was
motivated
not
by
lack
of
concern
for
privacy
but
by
traditions
practicality
and
an
underlying
fear
of
sin
n
from
the
perspective
of
the
church
living
together
as
a
family
unit
was
the
best
arrangement
for
individuals
and
the
community
as
a
whole
n
by
the
eighteenth
century
however
new
england
society
was
prepared
to
accept
the
person
who
wanted
to
live
alone
because
he
enjoyed
the
privacy
this
way
of
living
provided
n
while
living
conditions
afforded
colonists
little
privacy

pre
technological
world
enabled
greater
privacy
relative
to
the
present
day

circulated

moved
about

but
people
could
avoid
eavesdropping

conducting
conversations
beyond
the
earshot
of
others

business
was
transacted
with
scant
written
exchanges

and
personal
records

largely
of
diaries

letters

only
one

despite
the
casualness

to
have
been
little
premeditated

malicious

noted
that

as
fully
guarded

late
nineteenth

court
upheld

privacy

forbid
their
newly

a
requirement

into

the
bill
of
rights
in
n
the
supreme
court
has
deemed
the
familiar
history
of
the
fourth
amendment
as
reflecting
a
choice
that
our
society
should
be
one
in
which
citizens
dwell
in
reasonable
security
and
freedom
from
surveillance
n
its
commands
grew
in
large
measure
out
of
the
colonists
memories
of
the
general
warrants

in
use
in
england
these
writs
granted
sweeping
power
to
agents
of
the
king
to
search
at

for
smuggled
goods

indeed
aside
from
searches
incident
to
arrest
such
warrantless
searches
were
not
a
large
issue
in
colonial
america
n
while
the
warrant
requirement
was
adopted
to
stave
off
the
intrusiveness
of
the
crown
anonymous
speech
flourished
in
social

political
life
around
the
time
that
freedom
of

became
constitutionally
protected

for

anonymity

strictly
limited

trial

york
an
act
which
according
to
justice
thomas
in
his
concurring
opinion
in

commission
n
signified
at
an
early
moment
the
extent
to
which
anonymity
and
the
freedom
of
the
press
were
intertwined
in
the
early
american
mind
n
in
alexander
hamilton
james
madison
and
john
jay
published
the
most
famous
example
of
the
outpouring
of
anonymous
political
writing
that
occurred
during
the
ratifica
tion
of
the
constitution
n
the
federalist
papers
they
used
the
pseudonym
publius
to
disseminate
the
treasured
constitutional
writings

signed
others
as
an
american
citizen
marcus
and
americanus
n
anonymous
speech
and
opposition
to
it
continued
to
play
a
central
role
in
political
discourse
after
ratification
the
continental
congress
famously
attempted
to
identify
an
article
by
benjamin
rush
who
published
his
attack
on
members
of
congress
for
inflation
embezzlement
and
fraud
under
the
name
leonidas
n
when
a
massachusetts
delegate
moved
to
require
the
article
s
printer
to
appear
before
congress
and
discuss
leonidas
several
members
successfully
opposed
the
motion
on
the
grounds
that
it
violated
freedom
of
the
press
n
federalists
and
anti
federalists
continuously
sparred
in
essays
written
under
fictitious
names

one
hand

cato
brutus
cincinnatus

washington

decision
to
remain
neutral
in
the
war
between
the
british
and
the
french
n
scholars
have
surmised
from
these
and
other
examples
that
the
historical
use
of
anonymous
speech
strongly
suggests
that
the
framers
originally
viewed
anonymity
as
a
vital
part
of
free
speech
and
freedom
of
the
press

in
the
nineteenth

otherwise
unknown
individual

anonymous
image

this
function

it

as
the
supreme
court
s
first
recognition
of
a
right
to
decisional
privacy
n
on
the
theory
that
specific
guarantees
in
the
bill

have
penumbras
formed
by
emanations
from
those
guarantees
that

life

judgment

douglas
construed

the
fourth

s
right
to
be
secure
in

seizures
n
although
the
supreme
court
has
steadily
reviewed
new
surveillance
technologies
under
the
fourth
amendment
for
more
than
a
century
prevailing
doctrine
leaves
frt
beyond
constitutional
scrutiny
by
contrast
anonymity
is
an
interest
that
has
received
first
amendment
protection
but
no
court
has
extended
that
doctrine
to
government
surveillance
methods
n
thus
as
things
stand
the
constitution
plays
no
meaningful
role
in
confining
the
serious
anonymity
harms
associated
with
frt
identification
and
monitoring
a
anonymity
and
the
fourth
amendment
the
supreme
court
has
recognized
that
the
overriding
function
of
the
fourth
amendment
is
to
protect
personal
privacy
and
dignity
against
unwarranted
intrusion
by
the
state
n
in
mapp
v
ohio
n
the
court
characterized
the
fourth
amendment
as
actually
establishing
a
right
to
privacy
no
less
important
than
any
other
right
carefully
and
particularly
reserved
to
the
people
n
together
with
the
fifth
amendment
n
the
fourth
amendment
expresses
supplementing
phases
of
the
same
constitutional
purpose
to
maintain
inviolate
large
areas
of
personal
privacy
n
application
of
traditional
fourth
amendment
doctrine
to
modern
surveillance
technologies
such
as
frt
nonetheless
risks
emptying
such
privacy
guarantees
of
meaning
numerous
scholars
have
addressed
whether
the
fourth
amendment
covers
the
government
s
use
of
novel
technologies
and
how
leading
doctrine
should
be
adjusted
to
ensure
sufficient
constitutional
scrutiny
of
new
methods
of
conducting
a
law
enforcement
search
n
this
section
highlights
an
additional
nuance
that
warrants
consideration
within
this
discussion
a
distinction
between
pre
digital
and
digital
age
cases
the
surveillance
potential
of
big
data
was
only
technologically
possible
after
the
internet
took
hold
on
the
public
with
the
development
of
the
first
webpage
and
web
browsers
in
the
early
s
n
today
it
is
technology
s
capacity
to
generate
new
information
by
making
correlations
among
individual
data
points
which
poses
unprecedented
threats
to
the
ability
to
remain
anonymous
in
modern
society
rendering
traditional
fourth
amendment
doctrine
outmoded
for
the
digital
age
as
explained
below
a
contingent
of
the
supreme
court
is
beginning
to
recognize
that
constitutional
doctrine
must
be
adapted
to
establish
boundaries
on
the
use
of
technology
for
constant
surveillance
of
the
general
public
pre
digital
age
the
categorization
of
government
activity
as
a
search
under
the
fourth
amendment
is
important
under
traditional
doctrine
if
something
is
not
a
search
the
analysis
ends
and
the
government
is
not
required
to
show
probable
cause
n
a
traditional
search
is
like
the
tort
of
trespass
which
existed
at
the
time
the
fourth
amendment
was
adopted
it
involves
a
physical
intrusion
on
private
property
the
supreme
court
deviated
from
this
property
based
approach
to
determining
whether
something
is
a
search
early
on
however
and
developed
a
reasonable
expectation
of
privacy
trigger
n
in
the
absence
of
a
trespass
a
fourth
amendment
search
occurs
when
the
government
violates
a
subjective
expectation
of
privacy
that
society
recognizes
as
reasonable
n
the
legitimate
expectation
of
privacy
in
a
searched
person
or
location
must
meet
both
a
subjective
and
an
objective
test
of
reasonableness
first
has
the
individual
manifested
a
subjective
expectation
of
privacy
in
the
object
of
the
challenged
search
second
is
society
willing
to
recognize
that
expectation
as
reasonable
n
for
subpoenas
the
court
has
invoked
the
fourth
amendment
only
minimally
applying
a
reasonableness
test
that
is
satisfied
if
a
subpoena
is
not
too
sweeping
in
its
terms
n
it
has
also
authorized
warrantless
searches
in
three
circumstances
if
there
is
reasonable
suspicion
of
a
past
or
imminent
crime
to
justify
a
stop
and
frisk
n
if
special
needs
other
than
the
normal
need
for
law
enforcement
provide
sufficient
justification
for
a
search
n
as
in
cases
of
mandatory
drug
testing
for
employment
or
in
schools
n
and
if
a
regulatory
scheme
authorizes
warrantless
inspections
of
property
for
compliance
with
health
and
safety
standards
n
for
example
additionally
the
court
has
established
a
status
based
continuum
of
diminished
privacy
rights
under
the
fourth
amendment
which
includes
parolees
having
fewer
expectations
of
privacy
than
probationers
n
the
question
of
what
privacy
means
under
the
fourth
amendment
has
nonetheless
been
in
flux
from
the
phrase
s
inception
n
in
olmstead
v
united
states
n
louis
brandeis
famously
dissented
from
the
majority
s
holding
that
wiretapping
was
not
a
fourth
amendment
violation
absent
physical
trespass
to
the
home
employing
his
familiar
theory
that
the
makers
of
our
constitution
conferred
as
against
the
government
the
right
to
be
let
alone
the
most
comprehensive
of
rights
and
the
right
most
valued
by
civilized
men
n
employing
a
property
based
approach
to
the
fourth
amendment
boyd
v
united
states
n
marked
a
high
point
of
the
supreme
court
s
recognition
of
broad
protections
against
government
invasion
of
privacy
under
the
fourth
amendment
in
refusing
to
uphold
a
court
order
directing
a
defendant
in
a
civil
forfeiture
proceeding
to
produce
documentary
evidence
of
liability
the
court
framed
the
essence
of
the
government
s
offense
as
the
invasion
of
the
indefeasible
right
of
personal
security
personal
liberty
and
private
property
as
the
framers
were
keenly
attuned
to
the
struggles
against
arbitrary
power
in
which
they
had
been
engaged
for
more
than
years
when
they
approved
the
fourth
and
fifth
amendments
n
in
katz
v
united
states
n
however
a
majority
of
the
court
rejected
the
property
based
reasoning
of
boyd
and
held
that
the
relevant
fourth
amendment
inquiry
is
whether
the
practice
at
issue
violated
the
privacy
upon
which
the
defendant
justifiably
relied
n
it
wrote
that
the
constitu
tion
protects
people
not
places
n
thus
the
government
violated
the
fourth
amendment
in
electronically
listening
to
and
recording
the
defendant
s
conversation
in
a
public
telephone
booth
once
a
fixture
on
american
street
corners
and
in
superman
comics
the
court
found
it
insignificant
that
the
electronic
device
did
not
penetrate
the
structure
s
walls
n
in
doing
so
the
court
rejected
the
property
based
approach
to
electronic
surveillance
instead
embracing
brandeis
s
articulation
of
the
right
to
be
let
alone
n
it
has
restated
this
refrain
many
times
since
n
despite
the
doctrinal
shift
in
katz
existing
fourth
amendment
doctrine
provides
no
clear
protection
from
government
surveillance
conducted
through
an
amalgamation
of
frt
algorithms
and
other
data
that
court
made
clear
that
what
a
person
knowingly
exposes
to
the
public
even
in
his
own
home
or
office
is
not
a
subject
of
fourth
amendment
protection
n
accordingly
the
court
has
held
that
because
the
exterior
of
a
car
is
thrust
into
the
public
eye
to
examine
it
does
not
constitute
a
search
n
nor
is
there
a
reasonable
expectation
of
privacy
in
the
phone
numbers
voluntarily
conveyed
to
the
telephone
company
and
exposed
in
the
ordinary
course
of
business
n
there
is
no
reasonable
expectation
of
privacy
in
abandoned
property
like
garbage
left
out
for
collection
n
or
in
the
movements
of
an
automobile
on
public
thoroughfares
n
as
a
consequence
the
collection
of
a
faceprint
does
not
constitute
a
search
under
the
court
s
longstanding
view
that
mere
visual
observation
does
not
constitute
a
search
n
non
consensual
facial
scanning
amounts
to
no
more
than
visual
observation
of
what
is
held
out
to
the
public
to
the
extent
that
frt
is
considered
part
and
parcel
of
the
traditional
visual
surveillance
that
police
conduct
in
unmarked
vehicles
which
has
long
been
considered
constitutional
n
the
fourth
amendment
does
not
apply
frt
also
targets
an
area
of
the
body
that
a
person
would
not
reasonably
expect
to
consider
private
the
court
has
held
that
the
taking
of
a
photograph
does
not
constitute
a
search
because
it
does
not
involve
a
physical
intrusion
onto
the
person
and
does
not
invade
any
recognized
expectation
of
privacy
n
insofar
as
frt
enables
law
enforcement
to
identify
a
subject
from
an
anonymous
photo
moreover
hiibel
v
sixth
judicial
district
court
n
suggests
that
such
identification
is
constitutional
n
there
the
court
rejected
a
fourth
amendment
challenge
to
a
law
requiring
people
to
identify
themselves
during
a
police
stop
on
the
theory
that
answering
a
request
to
disclose
a
name
is
likely
to
be
so
insignificant
in
the
scheme
of
things
as
to
be
incriminating
only
in
unusual
circumstances
n
in
dissent
justice
stevens
highlighted
the
ability
to
attach
a
name
to
a
broad
array
of
information
about
the
person
which
in
turn
can
be
tremendously
useful
in
a
criminal
prosecution
n
even
if
the
fourth
amendment
were
construed
to
broaden
the
meaning
of
search
to
encompass
frt
it
would
be
an
empty
victory

each
day

from
the
thirteenth

on

n
the
constitution
and
thus
brandeis
s
constitutional
formulation
of
a
right
to

alone
applies
only
as
against
the

effectively
results

twenty
four
hour
passive
surveillance
relatedly
the
supreme
court
has
held
repeatedly
that

fourth
amendment
does
not
prohibit
the
obtaining
of
information
revealed
to
a
third
party
and
conveyed
by
him
to

there
is
no

on

use

informants

they
frustrate
actual
expectations

the
court
has
also
upheld
the
warrantless
installation
of
pen
registers
to
record
numbers
dialed
from

home
on
the
theory

by
treating
public
exposure

waivers
of

protections
modern
doctrine
offers
a
difficult
path
to
erecting
protections
against
government
surveillance
conducted
by
piecing
together
various
public
and
private
sector
data
with
images
posted

or
captured

plain
sight
digital
age
the
court
has
grappled
for
decades
with
the
related
question
of
whether
and
the
extent
to
which
government
can
use
technology
to
enhance
its
ability
to
see
what
is
arguably
exposed
to
the
public
it
held
in
that
there
is
no
legitimate
expectation
of
privacy
in
the
interior
of
a
car
illuminated
by
a
flashlight
because
the
use
of
artificial
means
to
illuminate
a
darkened
area
simply
does
not
constitute
a
search
n
three
years
later
it
found
that
warrantless
naked
eye
aerial
observation
of
a
fenced
in
backyard
was
not
unreasonable
under
the
fourth
amendment
as
any
member
of
the
public
flying
in
this
airspace
who
glanced
down
could
have
seen
everything
that
these
officers
observed
n
in
however
the
court
recognized
emerging
technologies
privacy
implications
when
it
decided
that
the
use
of
thermal
imaging
technology
to
measure
heat
emanating
from
a
home
was
a
search
because
it
amounted
to
more
than
naked
eye
surveillance
with
a
device
that
is
not
in
general
public
use
n
as
justice
alito
recently
described
it
kyllo

a
decision
about
the
use
of
new
technology
n
writing
for
the
majority
in
florida
v
jardines
n
justice
scalia
similarly
distinguished
kyllo
as
a
case
involving
surveillance
technology
that
allows
law
enforcement
to
learn
details
that
would
previously
have
been
unknowable
without
physical
intrusion
n
he
reached
the
conclusion
that
a
drug
sniffing
police
dog
deployed
from
the
front
porch
of
a
home
constituted
a
fourth
amendment
search
despite
the
antiquity
of
forensic
dogs
as
an
investigative
tool
because
there
was
no
implicit
license
or
invitation
for
the
police
to
approach
the
home
for
the
purpose
of
obtaining
incriminating
evidence
inside
n
earlier
in
city
of
ontario
v
quon
n
the
court
similarly
highlighted
the
novelty
of
new
technology
as
relevant
to
whether
the
user
of
a
government
issued
pager
had
a
reasonable
expectation
of
privacy
in
messages
retained
by
the
service
provider
sidestepping
the
fourth
amendment
question
on
the
merits
justice
kennedy
cautioned
that
it
must
proceed
with
care
when
considering
the
whole
concept
of
privacy
expectations
in
communications
made
on
electronic
equipment
else
it
risks
error
by
elaborating
too
fully
on
the
fourth
amendment
implications
of
emerging
technology
before
its
role
in
society
has
become
clear
n
he
explained
that
modern
judges
are
not
on
so
sure
a
ground
as
the
katz
court
was
in
relying
on
its
own
knowledge
and
experience
to
conclude
that
there
is
a
reasonable
expectation
of
privacy
in
a
telephone
booth
n
rapid
changes
in
the
dynamics
of
communication
and
information
transmission
are
evident
not
just
in
the
technology
itself
but
in
what
society
accepts
as
proper
behavior
he
continued
and
cell
phone
and
text
message
communications
are
so
pervasive
that
some
persons
may
consider
them
to
be
essential
means
for
self
expression
even
self
identification
thus
potentially
strengthening
the
case
for
an
expectation
of
privacy
n
two
additional
cases
highlight
the
modern
court
s
struggle
with
fitting
modern
technologies
within
the
existing
fourth
amendment
rubric
in
united
states
v
jones
n
the
court
held
that
the
warrantless
installation
of
a
global
positioning
system
gps
device
to
monitor
the
location
of
a
person
s
car
constituted
a
search
because
the
police
physically
occupied
private
property
for
the
purpose
of
obtaining
information
n
justice
scalia
thus
revived
for
the
majority
the
old
property
based
approach
to
the
fourth
amendment
n
instead
of
taking
an
arguably
more
obvious
tactic
applying
united
states
v
knotts
n
for
the
proposition
that
there
is
no
reasonable
expectation
of
privacy
in
a
driver
s
movements
from
one
place
to
anoth
er
n
declaring
katz
the
inexclusive
test
justice
scalia
confined
it
to
situations
involving
merely
the
transmission
of
electronic
signals
without
trespass
n
while
conceding
that
electronic
surveillance
without
an
accompanying
trespass
of
a
gps
device
could
amount
an
unconstitutional
invasion
of
privacy
in
a
future
case
n
justice
sotomayor
n
and
separately
justice
alito
n
joined
by
justices
ginsberg
breyer
and
kagan
expressed
concern
that
modern
technology
is
eroding
individuals
ability
to
be
free
of
government
monitoring
she
wrote
that
electronic
or
other
novel
modes
of
surveillance
can
generate
a
precise
comprehensive
record
of
a
person
s
public
movements
that
reflects
a
wealth
of
detail
about
her
familial
political
professional
religious
and
sexual
associations
without
any
physical
invasion
of
property
n
the
government
she
added
can
store
and
mine
such
data
indefinitely
n
because
modern
electronic
surveillance
is
cheap
by
comparison
to
traditional
surveillance
techniques
it
proceeds
surreptitiously
and
evades
the
ordinary
checks
that
constrain
abusive
law
enforcement
practices
limited
police
resources
and
community
hostility
n
she
referred
to
the
fourth
amendment
s
goal
to
prevent
a
too
permeating
police
surveillance
n
and
questioned
the
propriety
of
the
third
party
doctrine
as
ill
suited
to
the
digital
age
in
which
people
reveal
a
great
deal
of
information
about
themselves
to
third
parties
in
the
course
of
carrying
out
mundane
tasks
such
as
phone
numbers

visited
corresponding
email
addresses
and
the
books
groceries
and
medications
they
purchase
online
n
although
some
people
might
accept
this
diminution
of
privacy
as
a
tradeoff
for
access
to
technology
or
simply
inevitable
she
expressed
doubt
that
people
would
accept
without
complaint
the
warrantless
disclo
sure
to
the
government
of
a
list
of
every
web
site
they
had
visited
in
the
last
week
or
month
or
year
n
for
his
part
justice
alito
focused
on
the
problem
of
long
term
monitoring
agreeing
in
principle
with
the
majority
that
we
must
assure
preservation
of
that
degree
of
privacy
against
government
that
existed
when
the
fourth
amendment
was
adopted
n
of
course
he
added
it
is
almost
impossible
to
think
of
late
th
century
situations
analogous
to
the
capabilities
of
modern
surveillance
technology
n
the
majority
s
physical
trespass
theory
he
explained
would
provide
no
protection
to
long
term
monitoring
accomplished
without
committing
a
technical
trespass
n
yet
for
such
offenses
society
s
expectation
has
been
that
law
enforcement
agents
and
others
would
not
and
indeed
in
the
main
simply
could
not
secretly
monitor
and
catalogue
every
single
movement
of
an
individual
s
car
for
a
very
long
period
n
justice
alito
thus
recognized
that
because
new
devices
such
as
closed
circuit
television
video
monitoring
automatic
toll
collection
systems
with
recording
technology
built
in
gps
systems
and
wireless
tracking
devices
embedded
in
cell
phones
permit
the
monitoring
of
a
person
s
movements
in
ways
that
were
impossible
before
the
digital
age
traditional
fourth
amendment
analysis
is
inapposite
n
maryland
v
king
n
is
the
most
recent
case
in
which
the
supreme
court
addressed
the
vexing
intersection
of
technology
and
privacy
under
the
fourth
amendment
at
a
booking
on
an
arrest
for
assault
the
police
took
a
dna
sample
by
applying
a
buccal
swab
to
the
inside
of
a
suspect
s
cheek
n
the
dna
matched
that
of
a
rape
victim
taken
six
years
earlier
leading
to
the
arrestee
s
subsequent
rape
conviction
n
the
dna
matching
occurred
through
the
combined
dna
index
system
codis
which
connects
dna
data
at
the
national
state
and
local
levels
under
fbi
supervision
n
on
appeal
a
maryland
court
held
that
the
cheek
swab
was
an
unreasonable
search
under
the
fourth
amendment
n
reversing
justice
kennedy
wrote
for
the
majority
that
a
fourth

that
it
was
reasonable
and

and

of

community
n
justice
kennedy
suggested
that
dna
is
a
mere
relative
of
fingerprinting
n
and
that
its
value
lies
in
allowing
law
enforcement
to
make
critical
choices
about
how
to
proceed
ensuring
that
the
accused
remains
available
for
trial
and
helping
protect
the
public
from
further
harm
interests
that
taken
together
outweighed
the
arrestee
s
privacy
interests
in
king
n
although
king
would
appear
to
narrow
the
availability
of
fourth
amendment
protections
against
invasive
new
technologies
three
aspects
of
justice
kennedy
s
decision
distinguish
dna
sampling
from
the
dragnet
style
surveillance
of
the
general
public
which
frt
makes
possible
first
he
emphasized
that
an
arrestee
s
diminished
expectations
of
privacy
are
distinguishable
from
those
of
the
public
at
large
or
a
particular
class
of
law
abiding
citizens
n
second
justice
kennedy
stressed
that
technology
could
progress
to
the
point
at
which
the
fourth
amendment
balance
would
be
struck
in
the
arrestee
s
favor
such
as
if
dna
showed
a
predisposition
for
a
particular
disease
or
other
hereditary
factors
not
relevant
to
identity
n
it
is
thus
possible
that
the
court
would
condemn
the
warrantless
use
of
frt
on
law
abiding
citizens
for
particularly
invasive
purposes
third
a
maryland
statute
forbidding
the
use
of
dna
for
anything
other
than
identification
generally
allayed
privacy
concerns
at
issue
in
king
n
in
the
absence
of
regulatory
or
statutory
protections
the
court
might
grant
the
constitution
a
greater
role
in
protecting
particular
zones
of
privacy

unjustified
government
intrusion

frt
justice
scalia

dissenting
opinion
joined
by
justices
ginsberg
sotomayor
and
kagan
took
issue
with
justice
kennedy
s
characterization
of
king
s
dna
matching
as
mere
identification
n
for
justice
scalia
justice
kennedy
confused
verification
the
use
of
biometric
data
to
confirm
whether
someone
is
whom
he
appears
to
be
with
identification
which
properly
understood
is
more
like
searching
for
evidence
that
a
person
has
committed
crimes
unrelated
to
the
crime
of
his
arrest
n
it
taxes
the
credulity
of
the
credulous
justice
scalia
quipped
to
assert
that
the
dna
in
king
was
not
in
fact
used
to
solve
crimes
n
an
aim
that
has
never
been
thought
to
justify
a
suspicionless
search
n
justice
scalia
likened
the
practice
to
so
called
general
warrants
at
the
time
of
the
founding
those
not
grounded
upon
a
sworn
oath
of
a
specific
infraction
by
a
particular
individual
and
thus
not
limited
in
scope
and
application
n
justice
scalia
also
noted
that
the
suspect
s
identity
was
already
known
when
the
state
ran
his
dna
through
the
codis
system
long
after
he
was
arrested
the
matching
was
thus
performed
in
order
to
identify
the
dna
sample
from
the
rape
not
to
verify
identity
n
what
dna
offers
that
fingerprinting
does
not
he
added
is
the
ability
to
solve
unsolved
crimes
by
matching
old
crime
scene
evidence
against
the
profiles
of
people
whose
identities
are
already
known
n
justice
scalia
warned
that
if
one
believes
that
dna
will
identify
someone
arrested
for
assault
he
must
believe
that
it
will
identify
someone
arrested
for
a
traffic
offense
n
his
dissent
in
king
is
thus
an
acknowledgement
that
some
constitutional
limits
must
be
placed
on
the
uses
of
surveillance
technologies
that
enable
government
to
create
new
information
by
identifying
correlations
among
otherwise
disparate
data
points
perhaps
the
construction
of
a
genetic
panopticon
is
wise
he
wrote
but
i
doubt
that
the
proud
men
who
wrote
the
charter
of
our
liberties
would
have
been
so
eager
to
open
their
mouths
for
royal
inspection

unfettered

of
constitutional

observed

played
an
important
role

arisen
in
response
to
the
problems
of

n
this
part
seeks
to
reclaim
the

s
relevance
in
protecting

in
the

by
identifying
points
at
which
the

its
modern
fourth

intersect

correlations

predict
the

in
ways
that
were
impossible

a
few
years
ago
n
it
is
through
such
correlations
that
frt
enables
users
to
recognize

merely
see
a
subject
and
from
that
data
erect
a
comprehensive
portrait
of
that
person
s
past
present
and
future
life
at
least
three
guidelines
can
be
inferred
from
the
court
s
first

fourth

courts

and

should
take
into

be
treated
as
a
significant
factor
in
assessing
the
proper
constitutional
statutory
and
regulatory
scope
of
government
activity
that
has
the
potential
to
expose
an
individual
s

and
accordingly
the
law
should
place
boundaries
around
the
ability
of

to
match
faceprints
with
other
data
points
for
purposes
other
than
verification
of
an
individual
s
known
identity
third
courts
and
lawmakers
should
keep
in
mind
that
legislative
protection
of
an
individual
s
ability
to
invoke
anonymity
through
conspicuous
and
mandatory
opt
out
provisions
for
web
tracking
for
example
is
constitutionally
prudent
if
not
necessary
a
recognition
through
correlation
as
the
first
amendment
cases
indicate
anonymity
implies
a
freedom
from
being
recognized
versus
just
being
seen
in

of

expect
to
mostly
avoid

has
construed
the
first
amendment
as
protecting

enables

extended
to
the

this
idea
would
help
modernize

perform
a
search
with
technology
which
does
not
result
in
a
physical
trespass
in
both
the
first

arenas
the
court
has
treated
the
right
to
pursue
lawful
private
interests
privately
as
constitutionally
protected
from
government
interference
n
yet
it
has
never
suggested
that
the
public
disclosure
of
one
s
face
is
itself
an
act
of
constitutional
dimension
in
addressing
anonymity
the
court
has
instead
drawn
a
distinction
between
mere
observance
of
physical
identities
and
recogni
tion
n
a
stranger
knocking
on
a
door
might
remain
anonymous
even
though
his
face
is
visible
a
surrender
of
anonymity
takes
place
when
the
face
is
linked
to
other
identifying
information
such
as
a
name
on
a
pamphlet
n
chief
justice
roberts
extended
this
principle
to
modern

he
emphasized
in

n
justice
brennan
was
presciently
troubled
by
the
central
computer
storage
of
the
data
collected
back
in
because
it
allowed
government
to
manipulate
information
in
ways
that
could
harm

interests
even
though
the
fourth

did
not
shield
the
information
itself
from
government
scrutiny
in
that
case
n
in
his
view
the
central
storage
and
easy
accessibility
of
computerized
data
vastly
increase
the
potential
for
abuse
of
that
information
n
future
developments

suggested
might
one
day
demonstrate
the
necessity
of
some
curb
on

in

v
knotts
the
court
similarly
acknowledged
that
if
dragnet
type
law
enforcement
practices
such
as
twenty
four
hour
surveillance
without
judicial
knowledge
or
supervision
should
eventually
occur
there
will
be
time
enough
then
to
determine
whether
different
constitutional
principles
may
be
applicable

that
time
has
come

has
progressed

the
point
at
which
frt

big

can
be
used
to
make
predictions
about

be

be

is
no
reasonable
expectation

been
criticized

correlating

therefore
should
trigger
the

constitutional
scrutiny
that

whether

sotomayor
explained
in

modern

surreptitiously
and
cheaply
and
evade
the
ordinary
checks
that
constrain
abusive
law

practices

has
enabled
the
government
to
generate
a
precise
comprehensive
record
of

person
s
public
movements
that
reflects
a
wealth
of
detail
about
her
familial
political
professional

n
this
novel
use
of

defies
what
justice
alito
called

not

hugely
problematic
in

autonomy
even
if
the

justices
alito
and
thomas
suggested
that
there
is
a
meaningful
distinction
under
the
first
amendment
between
using
personal
information
contained
on
referendum
petitions
for
verification
and
using
the
information
for
other
purposes
n
unlike
verification
identification
links
a
face
with
a
wealth
of
personal
information
about
an
individual
from
the
internet
and
other
public
and
private
sources
such
as
birth
date
and
place
medical
data
affiliated
friends
and
organizations
and
criminal
history
this
data
can
be
put
toward
law
enforcement
aims
that
go
well
beyond
verification
that
a
person
is
in
fact
whom
he
claims
to
be
justice
scalia
emphasized
as
much
in
his
maryland
v
king
dissent
when
he
assailed
the
majority
for
characterizing
the
government
s
use
of
the
suspect
s
dna
as
unrelated
to
crime
solving
n
he
explained
in
great
detail
how
the
police
employed
the
dna
sample
to
solve
unsolved
crimes
by
matching
old
crime
scene
evidence
against
the
profiles
of
people
whose
identities
were
already
known
n
in
jardines
as
well
justice
scalia
suggested
that
the
intended
use
of
a
technology
such
as
a
drug
sniffing
dog
is
an
important
element
of
the
fourth
amendment
analysis
n
he
distinguished
between
licensed
and
unlicensed
entries
into
a
curtilage
e
g
knocking
on
a
door
versus
arriving
with
a
bloodhound
or
a
metal
detector
and
suggested
that
an
invitation
to
engage
in
canine
forensic
investigation
assuredly
does
not
inhere
in
the
very
act
of
hanging
a
knocker
n
as
to
the
reasonableness
of
a
search
justice
scalia
similarly
observed
that
it
depends
upon
whether
the
officers
had
an
implied
license
to
enter
the
porch
which
in
turn
depends
upon
the
purpose
for
which
they
entered
n
if
unlike
the
dna
in
king
faceprints
were
used
for
surveillance
of
common
citizens
a
majority
of
the
court
might
find
that
the
fourth
amendment
applies
to
limit
the
use
of
such
data
for
secondary
purposes
that
include
identification
versus
mere
verification
of
identity
the
first
amendment
anonymity
cases
provide
insight
into
how
courts
might
determine
whether
a
secondary
use
of
faceprint
data
is
constitutional
in
mcintyre
v
ohio
elections
commission
for
example
the
court
credited
the
state
s
interest
in
preventing
fraud
and
libel
during
elections
when
false
statements
if
credited
may
have
serious
adverse
consequences
for
the
public
at
large
but
found
it
insufficient
under
the
exacting
scrutiny
applicable
to
core
political
speech
n
under
that
standard
the
simple
interest
in
providing
voters
with
additional
relevant
information
did
not
justify
the
anonymity
ban
which
did
little
to
help
voters
evaluate
the
pamphlet
s
message
n
by
the
same
token
the
fbi
shouldn
t
be
in
the
business
of
monitoring
demonstrations
unless
it
has
a
cause
a
tip
a
reason
n
in
order
to
develop
meaningful
constitutional
distinctions
between
the
various
possible
uses
of
facial
data
collected
in
the
public
sphere
the
court
s
identification
of
the
government
s
rationale
for
collecting
personal
information
in
the
first
amendment
cases
could
be
extrapolated
to
the
fourth
amendment
context
in
other
words
if
anonymity
warrants
constitutional
protection
under
the
first
amendment
some
requisite
showing
should
be
made
before
the
government
can
perform
a
matching
that
results
in
monitoring
of
an
individual
s
activity
as
a
matter
of
fourth
amendment
law
as
well
n
lower
courts
have
held
that
before
the
government
can
utilize
fingerprint
evidence
gathered
from
the
general
public
it
must
demonstrate
probable
cause
if
the
government
cannot
show
probable
cause
it
must
at
least
show
an
articulable
suspicion
to
believe
that
the
person
committed
a
criminal
offense
and
that
fingerprinting
will
establish
or
negate
the
person
s
connection
to
the
offense
n
frt
should
be
treated
no
differently
n
whether
fash
ioned
as
probable
cause
reasonable
suspicion
or
something
else
first
amendment
doctrine
suggests
that
the
government
should
have
to
justify
its
correlation
of
frt
data
with
other
information
to
form
a
working
profile
of
citizens
who
otherwise
abide
by
the
law
n
c
the
importance
of
choice
with
the
exception
of
doe
an
important
distinguishing
feature
of
the
first
amendment
anonymity
cases
is
the
involvement
of
legislative
attempts
to
coerce
the
disclosure
of
personal
identities
frt
presents
a
particularly
difficult
problem
under
prevailing
constitutional
law
because
most
faces
are
routinely
exposed
in
public
no
domestic
law
requires
that
a
person
s
facial
features
be
unobstructed
while
she
maneuvers
about
in
public
places
so
that
the
government
can
use
them
for
identification
purposes
her
visage
is
there
for
the
government
s
taking
technology
has
thus
become
deterministic
of
personal
privacy
today
yet
there
is
no
reciprocal
power
on
the
part
of
individuals
to
direct
how
technology
will
evolve
in
relationship
to
their
privacy
interests
or
even
to
opt
out
of
its
implications
for
their
daily
lives
the
first
amendment
anonymity
cases
and
fourth
amendment
doctrine
assume
that
a
person
possesses
the
discretion
to
take
steps
to
protect
communications
or
other
effects
from
governmental
intrusion
that
is
by
keeping
personal
information
private
in
the
first
amendment
context
the
court
has
upheld
private
individuals
ability
to
choose
to
keep
their
identities
anonymous
in
some
respect
indeed
the
fact
that
the
mcintyre
plaintiff
simultaneously
disclosed
her
identity
in
other
pamphlets
was
irrelevant
to
the
court
s
analysis
and
ultimate
conclusion
that
her
choice
to
remain
anonymous
was
protected
by
the
first
amendment
n
in
the
fourth
amendment
arena
disclosure
operates
as
a
waiver
of
sorts
but
the
court
has
taken
pains
to
identify
how
the
subject
of
police
inquiry
could
have
effectively
invoked
constitutional
protections
by
keeping
information
private
in
both
contexts
the
underlying
assumption
supporting
the
court
s
analyses
of
the
constitutional
guarantee
at
issue
is
that
citizens
have
a
choice
and
caveat
emptor
if
they
choose
public
disclosure
the
constitution
cannot
save
them
from
the
consequences
of
that
choice
facebook
s
frt
features
are
active
by
default
n
it
takes
six
clicks
to
reach
a
disclosure
that
facebook
uses
frt
n
apple
s
iphoto
does
not
have
an
opt
out
function
at
all
n
currently
there
are
no
laws
requiring
private
entities
to
provide
individuals
with
notice
that
they
are
collecting
personal
data
using
frt
how
long
that
data
will
be
stored
whether
and
how
it
will
be
shared
or
how
it
will
be
used
n
other
countries
have
regulations
that
give
internet
users
control
over
their
own
data
n
in
the
united
states
however
private
companies
are
free
to
sell
trade
and
profit
from
individuals
biometric
information
private
companies
can
also
disclose
individuals
data
to
government
authorities
without
their
consent
n
fourth
and
first
amendment
law
is
remarkably
consistent
in
its
deference
to
the
subject
s
choice
to
remain
anonymous
or
put
information
into
the
public
domain
if
people
protect
their
privacy
the
constitution
protects
it
too
in
modern
times
the
problem
with
this
tautology
is
that
the
concept
of
choice
implies
that
there
is
more
than
one
meaningful
option
with
frt
and
other
emerging
technologies
there
is
no
mechanism
for
opting
out
of
the
various
sources
that
are
amalgamated
into
what
amounts
to
surveillance
the
theory
behind
the
fourth
amendment
doctrines
that
lift
its
protections
for
information
disclosed
publicly
or
to
third
parties
is
thus
unsustainable
accordingly
the
recognition
of
anonymity
as
a
constitutional
value
that
warrants
protection
under
the
first
and
fourth
amendments
may
require
numerous
safeguards
in
place
for
forestalling
indiscriminate
disclosure
as
justice
brennan
suggested
in
whalen
n
in
his
words
whether
sophisticated
storage
and
matching
technology
amounts
to
a
deprivation
of
constitutionally
protected
privacy
interests
might
depend
in
part
on
congressional
or
regulatory
protections
put
in
place
to
forbid
the
government
s
use
of
big
data
for
arbitrary
monitoring
of
the
populace
without
individuals
consent
n
this
will
not
be
easy
choosing
to
opt
out
of
google
s
tracking
technologies
itself
leaves
a
trace
and
technology
exists
to
re
identify
people
whose
personal
identifiers
such
as
name
address
credit
card
information
birth
date
and
social
security
number
had
been
removed
from
a
dataset
n
but
constitutional
limits
on
the
government
s
ability
to
work
around
individuals
attempts
to
protect
their
privacy
would
be
an
important
step
toward
rescuing
the
constitutional
value
of
anonymity
before
frt
and
big
data
are
used
to
do
more
than
simply
predict
who
may
commit
crimes
i
e
to
punish
people
for
future
acts
n
conclusion
the
writing
is
on
the
wall
one
day
soon
your
phone
or
in
some
years
your
glasses
and
in
a
few
more
your
contact
lenses
will
tell
you
the
name
of
that
person
at
the
party
whose
name
you
always
forget
or
it
will
tell
the
stalker
in
the
bar
the
address
where
you
live
or
it
will
tell
the
police
where
you
have
been
and
where
you
are
going
n
frt
is
rapidly
moving
society
toward
a
world
in
which
the
constitution
s
scope
needs
to
be
meaningfully
reformulated
else
it
risks
irrelevance
when
it
comes
to
individuals
ability
to
hide
from
the
prying
eyes
of
government
n
the
third
party
doctrine
and
the
longstanding
judicial
rejection
of
a
reasonable
expectation
of
privacy
in
matters
made
public
have
depleted
the
fourth
amendment
of
vitality
for
purposes
of
establishing
constitutional
barriers
to
the
government
s
use
of
frt
to
profile
and
monitor
individual
citizens
although
the
court
has
expressly
affirmed
protections
for
anonymous
speech
under
the
first
amendment
that
doctrine
has
not
been
extended
to
address
the
harms
that
flow
from
dragnet
style
surveillance
yet
every
member
of
the
modern
court
has
at
some
point
recognized
that
technology
necessitates
a
rethinking
of
traditional
constitutional
boundaries
this
article
argued
that
existing
first
amendment
protections
for
anonymity
should
be
brought
to
bear
in
assessing
how
fourth
amendment
doctrine
can
adapt
to
the
challenges
of
modern
surveillance
methods
today
the
conglomerate
of
publicly
available
data
is
colossal
and
constantly
expanding
technology
enables
the
government
and
private
companies
to
identify
patterns
within
such
data
which
reveal
new
information
that
does
not
exist
anywhere
in
isolation
as
a
consequence
information
in
the
digital
age
is
fundamentally
distinct
from
information
in
the
pre
digital
age
in
which
the
court
s
fourth
amendment
doctrine
evolved
this
article
thus
identified
constitutionally
derived
guidelines
for
courts
and
lawmakers
to
consider
in
crafting
judicial
legislative
and
regulatory
responses
to
the
government
s
newfound
capacity
to
create
new
information
from
storehouses
of
data
gleaned
from
social
media
sites
public
cameras
and
increasingly
sophisticated
technologies
like
frt
by
giving
these
guidelines
serious
consideration
courts

the

it
is
to
explore
the

doctrine
in
the
hopes
of
identifying
a

in
limiting
the
application
of
new

the

must
be
brought
to

of

forces
including
even
the

which
has
a
relatively
extensive
and
aggressive
intelligence
operation
experts
say
analysts
at
the

los

police
departments
routinely
crawl
through
social

to
keep
tabs
on
individuals
on

such
as
gang
members
or
to
prepare
for
high

events
but
in
an
era
of
shrinking
or
stagnant
budgets
buying
high

software
and
hiring
trained
data
analysts
can
be
costly
many
police
departments
utilize
fairly
rudimentary
tools
the
nypd
uses
common
search
engines
experts
say
it
is
possible
to
program
an
algorithm
to
pick
up
threatening
messages
but
the
sheer
volume
of
data
and
the
potential
number
of
false
positives
would
impede
its
effectiveness
it
is

despite

the

chief
mark
yokoyama
said
in

alhambra
was
the
first
law
enforcement
agency
in
southern
california
to
have
citywide
implementation
of
predpol
a
cloud
based
software
that
forecasts
areas
where
crimes
are
likely
to
be
committed
nine
months
ago
some
residents
expressed
reservations
about
technology
that
could
target
the
homeless
or
minorities
but
co
founder
jeffrey
brantingham
a
ucla
anthropology
professor
said
predpol
doesn
t
use
personal
information
to
predict
crime
it
doesn
t
include
who
the
offenders
are
or
what
type
of
music
they
like
or
anything
like
that
he
said
it

and
report

police
are
using

they
are
given
they
re
actually
doing
what
the
public
wants
it
s
nothing
like
minority

or
criminal

predpol
uses
five
years
worth
of
law
breaking
data
to
map
a
by
square
foot
area
where
crime
will
likely
happen
the
technology
essentially
places
officers
at
the
right
place
and
time
to
prevent
lawbreaking
the
alhambra
police
department
focused
on
the
two
most
common
crimes
in
alhambra
yokoyama
said
by
year
s
end
when
compared
to
numbers
car
burglaries
decreased
by
percent
and
auto
theft
declined
by
percent
a
statistics
report
showed
yokoyama
said
the
system
works
he
recalled
a
time
when
police
officers
were
patrolling
valley
boulevard
at
predpol
s
direction
and
noticed
a
suspicious
vehicle
they
found
ski
masks
inside
the
vehicles
and
arrested
the
individuals
on
suspicion
of
robbery
he
said
the
act
of
robbery
burglary
et
cetera
does
not
have
to
be
committed
for
a
crime
to
occur
yokoyama
said
the
planning
and
actions
toward
committing
the
crime
is
a
crime
in
and
of
itself
in
fact
it
would
always
be
our
preference
to
stop
a
crime
at
this
stage
than
for
an
act
to
occur
yokoyama
added
that
giving
officers
direct
clear
missions
to
patrol
particular
areas
has
had
a
positive
effect
that
residents
and
business
owners
have
noticed
it
s
actually
increased
our
communication
and
visibility
to
the
community
because
police
officers
are
spending
more
time
in
the
residential
area
as
an
example
yokoyama
said
i
get
positive
calls
all
the
time
about
why
the
police
are
in
their
neighborhood
more
residents
such
as
william
rising
however
said
he
hasn
t
noticed
more
officers
on
the
streets
but
he
said
response
time
to
emergency
calls
has
improved
just
a
more
visible
police
presence
can
avert
many
potential
criminal
activities
such
as
car
theft
break
ins
and
drug
dealing
he
said
in
a
facebook
post
in
addition
to
printouts
of
potential
crime
areas
yokoyama
said
every
police
car
is
now
equipped
with
in
car
computers
that
receive
refreshed
information
every
five
minutes
in
general
he
said
officers
spend
about
percent
of
their
time
doing
random
patrols
based
on
their
knowledge
of
the
city
and
they
spend
percent
of
their
time
focused
in
the
by
square
foot
areas
to
which
predpol
directs
them
yet
the
crime
rate
forcertain
activities
has
increased
residential
burglaries
went
up
by
percent
and
robberies
increased
by
percent
a
report
found
although
the
numbers
are
up
based
on
predpol
predictions
we
feel
a
number
of
crimes
were
prevented
and
would
have
been
higher
if

blight
in
manhattan
and
found
little
to
report
he
has
marveled
that
grievances
about
noise
are
now
a
leading
complaint
from
residents
in
washington
heights
an
area
he
associates
with
the
violent
drug
gangs
of
an
earlier
time
crime
is
not
interestingly
enough
a
big
issue
at
this
time
in
the
city
he
said
in
a
recent
interview
the
city
is
a
vastly
different
place
than
mr
bratton
knew
in
the
s
in
his
first
year
as
police
commissioner
there
were
robberies
in
manhattan
alone
and
homicides
across
the
city
this
year
through
sunday
there
have
been
just
over
robberies
citywide
and
killings
but
mr
bratton
is
not
veering
from
his
focus
on
low
level
offenses
rather
he
is
doubling
down
although
for
different
reasons
if
two
decades
ago
mr
bratton
championed
the
zealous
pursuit
of
subway
fare
beaters
he
did
so
partly
because
it
led
to
the
arrest
of
more
serious
criminals
in
those
crime
plagued
years
one
in
turnstile
jumpers
was
found
to
have
a
weapon
now
his
attention
to
minor
offenses
is
more
about
banishing
the
specter
of
disorder
crime
endures
in
the
city
but
it
often
differs
from
what
he
faced
last
time
around
heroin
is
resurgent
but
users
are
now
more
frequently
found
in
staten
island
houses
than
derelict
shooting
galleries
youth
gangs
rarely
battle
over
drug
turf
but
engage
in
violence
for
violence
sake
mr
bratton
has
said
with
a
kind
of
disgusted
wonder
while
homicides
are
down
shootings
are
up
percent
so
far
this
year
to
an
increase
that
has
been
seized
upon
by
his
critics
and
those
of
the
mayor
but
in
the
interview
mr
bratton
spoke
with
evident
frustration
at
how
each
uptick
in
violence
has
been
treated
as
evidence
that
public
safety
was
slipping
that
s
something
that
we
had
to
address
and
the
mayor
has
to
continually
keep
addressing
because
everybody
is
still
waiting
and
watching
he
said
god
forbid
we
had
more
shootings
than
we
had
last
year
he
added
people
tend
to
forget
what
this
place
looked
like
in
the
s
for
mr
bratton
the
present
reality
is
best
tackled
with
what
he
sees
as
a
time
tested
approach
signaling
for
officers
to
go
after
highly
visible
conditions
such
as
subway
begging
and
graffiti
and
he
is
resisting
an
effort
by
the
brooklyn
district
attorney
to
be
more
lenient
with
low
level
marijuana
offenders
he
has
even
sought
to
brand
the
showtime
performers
who
dance
in
train
cars
or
as
mr
bratton
often
calls
them
the
subway
acrobats
as
resonant
symbols
of
disorder
much
as
he
once
did
with
the
squeegee
men
of
a
generation
ago
you
re
seeing
activity
directed
against
the
acrobats
against
the
aggressive
beggars
soaring
he
said
he
announced
with
satisfaction
the
arrest
last
week
of
a
long
island
man
accused
of
routinely
spray
painting
on
highway
overpasses
and
walls
in
queens
graffiti
along
the
long
island
expressway
has
come
under
particular
scrutiny
from
mr
bratton
who
gets
a
close
view
of
the
vandalism
as
he
returns
from
his
weekend
home
in
the
hamptons
i
get
criticized
about
what
are
you
going
after
graffiti
for
we
ve
got
kids
killing
each
other
mr
bratton
said
it
s
just
this
sense
of
in
public
spaces
who
s
in
control
when
he
reflects
on
his
policing
career
mr
bratton
speaks
in
terms
of
big
challenges
he
has
overcome
helping
to
turn
the
tide
against
crime
in
new
york
in
the
early
s
and
a
decade
later
to
remake
a
los
angeles
police
department
which
had
come
to
be
defined
by
brutality
and
racism
he
can
seem
at
times
cramped
by
the
challenges
enumerated
for
him
by
mr
de
blasio
who
campaigned
on
reducing
and
reforming
the
stop
and
frisk
tactic
the
aggressive
use
of
which
led
to
new
court
oversight
and
the
city
council
to
create
an
inspector
general
for
the
department
while
the
mayor
hailed
mr
bratton
as
the
right
leader
to
carry
out
changes
to
the
stop
and
frisk
policy
mr
bratton
soon
began
describing
the
issue
as
moot
pointing
out
that
by
the
end
of
the
bloomberg
administration
officers
had
abandoned
it
as
a
tactic
mr
bratton
has
also
grown
quieter
about
mr
de
blasio
s
signature
public
safety
initiative
reducing
traffic
deaths
with
less
fanfare
mr
bratton
has
embarked
on
several
new
initiatives
including
detectives
focused
on
cellphone
theft
and
cybercrime
and
a
push
aimed
at
those
who
disable
metrocard
machines
and
sell
swipes
to
desperate
straphangers
he
said
he
wants
the
department
to
embrace
so
called
predictive
policing
which
uses
data
streams
to
anticipate
crime
patterns
or
allocate
police
resources
already
the
department
is
looking
back
at
the
hours
before
every
shooting
to
see
which
complaints
and
calls
for
minor
events
loud
music
playing
crowds
gathering
preceded
the
violence
and
if
addressed
in
the
future
could
help
head
it
off
mr
bratton
has
brought
in
familiar
non
officers
from
his
past
postings
john
linder
who
is
working
on
the
re
engineering
of
the
department
as
he
did
in
john
miller
a
former
reporter
to
head
the
department
s
intelligence
and
counterterrorism
efforts
and
zachary
tumin
the
co
author
of
mr
bratton
s
book
on
leadership
to
direct
efforts
on
data
driven
policing
and
social
media
but
one
of
his
most
urgent
priorities
in
the
wake
of
the
political
and
legal
fight
over
stopping
and
frisking
has
been
improving
morale
in
what
he
describes
as
an
unhappy
organization
to
that
end
he
has
traveled
the
city
shaking
hands
with
patrol
officers
adding
his
signature
to
their
memo
books
last
month
during
a
late
night
tour
of
the
th
precinct
in
the
bronx
he
stopped
by
the
station
house
in
the
neighboring
th
precinct
at
a
m
on
a
whim
a
lot
of
my
role
at
this
juncture
in
this
department
is
personal
touching
of
the
cops
and
the
public
he
said
indeed
mr
bratton
is
trying
to
find
new
ways
to
improve
the
public
s
confidence
in
the
police
department
soon
he
said
the
department
will
regularly
conduct
a
question
survey
with
residents
in
each
precinct
to
ask
the
old
ed
koch
thing
how
am
i
doing
at
his
direction
precinct
commanders
have
taken
to
twitter
it
is
part
public
relations
and
part
responding
to
citizens
everyday
complaints
to
build
a
better
relationship
with
the
public
but
mr
bratton
has
also
encouraged
his
precinct
commanders
to
make
more
decisions
on
their
own
potentially
leading
to
conflicts
if
say
the
dictates
of
a
computer
algorithm
do
not
align
with
the
approach
taken
by
a
local
commander
a
situation
like
that
presented
itself
in
the
th
precinct
during
mr
bratton
s
visit
last
month
when
the
area
was
leading
the
city
in
homicides
by
design
teams
of
young
officers
sent

are
assigned
to
high

zones
determined
by

at

and
can
be
moved
only
after
a
lengthy
approval
process
but
the
commander
of
the
th
precinct
ruel
r
stephenson
said
the
system
limited
his
ability
to
respond
to
pockets
of
crime
as
they
cropped
up
around
the
sprawling
precinct
after
the
precinct
commander
described
the
situation
mr
bratton
instructed
his
new
chief
of
patrol
james
o
neill
to
fix
it
he
then
set
off
for
a
midnight
tour
of
the
unfamiliar

a
little
noticed
measure
on
today
s
ballot
could
fundamentally
transform
the
role
of
government
in
the
lives
of
everyday
californians
and
position
the
state
to
be
a
leader
of
the
big
data
movement
on
its
face
proposition
is
a
simple
state
constitutional
amendment
the
measure
clarifies
that
local
governments
must
comply
with
california
s
open
records
laws
cities
and
counties
will
no
longer
be
able
to
simply
say
they
cannot
afford
to
answer
citizens
requests
for
information
the
measure
could
also
finally
force
local
agencies
to
provide
key
sets
of
data
that
have
been
unavailable
and
allow
the
state
for
the
first
time
to
direct
what
kinds
of
data
must
be
made
available
and
help
turn
government
into
a
clearing
house
for
vital
sets
of
public
information
having
comprehensive
reliable
public
data
will
give
developers
and
policymakers
alike
the
ability
to
create
better
solutions
to
help
the
public
prop
could
transform
the
role
of
the
state
from
a
simple
deliverer
of
services
into
a
platform
for
data
that
will
allow
the
private
sector
to
provide
those
services
more
efficiently
it
could
pave
the
way
for
the
uberization
of
public
services
creating
new
kinds
of
solutions
that
are
enabled
by
government
but
driven
by
the
market
it
is
a
st
century
vision
for
what
government
can
and
should
become
people
use
a
lot
of
words
to
describe
government
but
efficient
is
rarely
one
of
them
but
if
it
can
be
an
agent
for
accurate
and
vital
information
it
will
allow
both
the
private
and
public
sector
to
recognize
inefficiencies
and
gaps
in
government
services
and
come
up
with
ways
to
fill
those
gaps
it
will
also
allow
for
the
kind
of
government
transparency
needed
to
hold
elected
officials
accountable
if
done
properly
the
measure
can
help
us
get
a
better
understanding
of
what
our
elected
representatives
are
up
to
and
whether
promises
that
are
so
often
attached
to
policy
choices
actually
bare
fruit
did
that
sales
tax
increase
aimed
at
improving
transportation
infrastructure
actually
help
with
the
problem
good
quality
data
can
help
us
find
that
answer
if
prop
passes
it
could
unlock
massive
troves
of
data
and
allow
the
private
sector
to
set
about
addressing
some
of
our
most
pressing
issues
in
the
state
already
for
example
there
is
a
movement
afoot
to
address
the
current
drought
by
mining
local
water
consumption
data
finding
data
that
can
help
solve
big
problems
will
become
easier
under
prop
the
current
state
of
public
data
in
california
is
quite
frankly
embarrassing
for
example
we
have
no
reliable
statewide
numbers
for
how
many
businesses
are
opening
and
closing
in
california
or
what
kinds
of
businesses
are
setting
up
shop
or
moving
out
of
the
state
our
current
information
is
haphazard
and
largely
anecdotal
and
laws
are
made
based
on
hypotheses
and
incomplete
information
prop
will
allow
state
lawmakers
to
require
local
governments
to
track
specific
types
of
information
and
make
it
available
to
the
public
we
are
already
seeing
the
power
of
data
and
how
reliable
and
current
information
can
lead
to
better
delivery
of
services
in
los
angeles
for
example
the
lapd
rolled
out
predictive
policing
technology
that
analyzes
historic
crime
data
to
forecast
where
police
resources
are
likely
to
be
needed
in
the
future
government
can
improve
the
lives
of
californians
but
it
may
not
in
the
way
the
state
has
intervened
in
the
lives
of
citizens
throughout
the
th
century
with
the
passage
of
prop
government
can
evolve
into
a
platform
to
enable
innovative
ways
to
