abstract
evidence
based
policing
is
a
method
of
making
decisions
about
what
works
in
policing
which
practices
and
strategies
accomplish
police
missions
most
cost
effectively
in
contrast
to
basing
decisions
on
theory
assumptions
tradition
or
convention
an
evidence
based
approach
continuously
tests
hypotheses
with
empirical
research
findings
while
research
on
all
aspects
of
policing
grew
substantially
in
the
late
twentieth
century
the
application
of
research
to
police
practice
intensified
in
the
early
twenty
first
century
especially
for
three
tasks
that
make
up
the
triple
t
strategy
of
policing
targeting
testing
and
tracking
evidence
based
targeting
requires
systematic
ranking
and
comparison
of
levels
of
harm
associated
with
various
places
times
people
and
situations
that
policing
can
lawfully
address
evidence
based
testing
helps
assure
that
police
neither
increase
crime
nor
waste
money
tracking
whether
police
are
doing
what
police
leaders
decide
should
be
done
may
grow
most
rapidly
in
coming
years
by
the
use
of
gps
records
of
where
police
go
and
body

of
what
happens
in
encounters
with

text
can
research
help
improve
democratic
policing
for
over
four
decades
numerous
colleagues
and
i
have
struggled
to
answer
that
question
when
we
began
policing
was
done
very
differently
from
how
it
is
done
now
in
the
years
to
come
it
will
be
done
even
more
differently
yet
the
trajectory
of
change
is
likely
to
remain
consistent
from
less
research
evidence
to
more
and
from
lesser
to
greater
use
of
the
evidence
available
the
years
covered
in
this
volume
bear
witness
to
the
rise
of
evidence
based
policing
in
both
the
quantity
of
evidence
and
its
influence
on
police
practices
this
essay
reports
on
my
ongoing
participant
observation
study
of
these
changes
for
which
i
have
tried
to
be
a
primary
instigator
policing
in
was
largely
delivered
in
a
one
size
fits
all
strategy
sometimes
described
as
the
three
rs
random
patrol
rapid
response
and
reactive
investigations
berkow
after
world
war
ii
random
patrols
in
police
cars
were
promoted
on
the
theory
that
police
omnipresence
would
deter

wilson
in
the
s
the
advent
of
three
digit
emergency
phone
numbers
turned
random
patrol
into
an
airport
style
holding
pattern
for
rapid
response
also
based
on
a
theory
of
deterrence
but
producing
a
new
theory
of
organizational
action
albert
j
reiss
s
distinction
between
reactive
and
proactive
actions
what
police
did
when
they
reacted
to
a
citizen
call
was
not
subject
to
much
police
agency
direction
or
analysis
the
main
organizational
requirement
was
to
arrive
do
something
and
leave
as
quickly
as
possible
as
reiss
reported
his
chicago
study
found
patrol
officers
spending
percent
of
their
time
reactively
answering
such
calls
and
investigating
crime
about
percent
of
their
time
proactively
stopping
people
at
their
own
initiative
and
percent
of
their
time
in
unstructured
random
patrolling
reactive
investigations
when
required
were
taken
over
by
detectives
who
in
theory
investigated
all
reported
crimes
but
in
practice
closed
most
cases
as
unsolvable
cases
that
were
solved
relied
primarily
on
the
evidence
presented
to
them
by
crime
victims
and
the
patrol
officers
who
arrived
first
on
the
scene
greenwood

there
was
almost
no
targeting
of
patterns
or
predictions
of
crime
or
disorder
no
testing
of
what
worked
best
to
prevent
or
solve
crimes
and
problems
or
much
tracking

managing
of
what
police
were
doing
where
when
and
how
in

to
any
specific
objectives
most
police
agencies
lacked
computers
the
few
computers
in
use
in
were
mainframes
designed
for
dispatching
police
cars
not
analyzing
crime
data
police
leaders
rarely
discussed
crime
at
all
unless
a
particularly
gruesome
crime
received
substantial
publicity
by
the
three
rs
were
changing
into
what
i
describe
in
this
essay
as
the
triple
t
of
targeting
testing
and
tracking
while
the
standard
model
is
far
from
gone
its
resources
are
increasingly
guided
by
statistical
evidence
in
the
emerging
triple
t
strategy
both
patrol
and
detective
managers
had
moved
toward
far
greater
proactive
management
of
police
resources
although
these
changes
are
far
more
evident
in
some
police
agencies
than
in
others
anglo
celtic
policing
is
increasingly
targeting
scarce
resources
on
evidence
of
large
predictable
and
harmful
statistical
patterns
rather
than
on
isolated
cases
spelman

to

more
elaborate

differentiated

from
a
wider
range
of

and
objectives
on
the

police
methods
have
also
become
far
more
subject
to
testing
with
evaluation
and
debate
over
what
works
the
core
idea
of
evidence
based
policing
sherman
yet
the
most
evident
use
of
new
statistical
evidence
is
the
growth
of
tracking
and
managing
what
police
were
or
were
not
doing
in
relation
to
the
dynamic
patterns
of
crime
and
public
safety
problems
examples
of
the
growth
of

the
best
test
of
evidence
based
policing
is
whether
it
has
improved
public
safety
and
police
legitimacy
there
is
certainly
a
correlation
over
time
between
the
rise
of
evidence
and
a
decline
in
serious
crime
in
both
the
united
states
and
the
united
kingdom
proof
that
serious
crime
dropped
because
of
evidence
based
policing
however
is
more
elusive
there
is
some
micro
level
analysis
of
the
new
york
city
crime
drop
that
offers
a
greater
basis
for
causal
inference
than
national
trends
zimring
but
it
is
impossible
to
rule
out
other
plausible
causes
that
also
match
the
timing
of
the
crime
drop
there
is
also
a
danger
that
a
sharper
focus
on
crime
can
undermine
police
legitimacy
especially
since
proactive
policing
is
structurally
less
legitimate
than
reactive
policing
with
a
personal
victim
s
endorsement
reiss
p
yet
there
is
no
evidence
that
the
rise
of
evidence
in
policing
has
caused
reductions
in
police
legitimacy
indeed
more
data
about
legitimacy
have
been
incorporated
into
police
management
as
part
of
evidence
based
tracking
than
ever
before
overall
the
vast
scale
of
the
rise
of
evidence
in
policing
leaves
it
without
a
fair
comparison
group
just
as
it
does
in
medicine
sagan
leaving
causation
unknowable
still
the
macro
trends
in
reduced
mortality
suggest
that
we
should
celebrate
the
rise
of
evidence
in
both
medicine
and
policing
the
changes
from
to
raise
the
further
question
of
what
anglo
celtic
policing
will
look
like
by
the
answers
cannot
be
predicted
just
by
extrapolating
the
trends
of
four
decades
or
even
ideally
by
a
causal
model
for
prediction
silver
but
by
explaining
why
policing
changed
as
it
did
from
to
a
forecast
using
the
same
causal
model
can
identify
a
range
of
possible
scenarios
for
policing
in
chief
among
these
will
be
the
possible
global
influence
of
the
creation
of
the
first
professional
body
ever
charged
by
a
national
government
with
recommending
police
practices
on
the
basis
of
continuous
review
of
new
research

what

this
body
has
tremendous
potential
to
follow
the
pathway

such
major

as

of
adaptation
of
an
idea
used
in

setting

to
another
such
as
evidence
based
policing
the
rise
of
evidence
the
causal
model
this
essay
suggests
for
these
changes
is
a
dynamic
system
that
links
external
demands
on
police
to
cut
crime
cut
costs
or
build
legitimacy
to
research
evidence
on
how
to
meet
those
demands
supported
by
the
increasing
availability
of
innovative
technologies
while
external
factors
drive
the
availability
of
both
research
evidence
and
technology
how
policing
responds
depends
on
a
fourth
factor
the
governmentally
generated
human
capital
of
education
and
police
professionalism
the
role
of
government
policies
is
crucial
in
setting
salaries
and
recruitment
standards
that
shape
the
quality
of
police
skills
and
creativity
in
general
and
of
police
leaders
in
particular
those
human
resources
are
so
influential
that
the
entire
causal
model
can
reasonably
be
said
to
call
for
evidence
based
professionalism
inside
this
abstract
causal
model
are
many
human
beings
struggling
hard
for
change
influential
leaders
of

combine

in
what
these

generally
shared
with
most
notably
nypd
commissioner
and
us
police
foundation
president
patrick
v
murphy
was
a
loosely
articulated
but
deeply
held
belief
that
greater
use
of
research
could
help
transform
policing
into
a
more
legitimate
and
respected
profession
a
profession
is
widely
defined
as
a
public
interest
occupation
that
restricts
entry
to
those
who
have
mastered
knowledge
and
skills
needed
to
provide
a
particular
set
of
complex
services
in
the
past
century
the
level
of
knowledge
deemed
necessary
for
a
profession
has
become
linked
to
requirements
for
university
based
education
it
is
only
a
century
for
example
since
the
radical
proposal
to
force
doctors
to
attend
university
was
presented
to
the
united
kingdom
s
haldane
commission
sherman
b
similarly
proposals
in
repeated
us
commission
reports
in
the
s
and
s
recommended
that
a
university
degree
be
a
requirement
for
appointment
as
a
police
officer
sherman
and
national
advisory
commission
on
higher
education
for
police
officers
that
idea
remains
controversial
and
widely
unacceptable
on
both
sides
of
the
atlantic
by
conventional
definition
then
policing
has
yet
to
become
a
profession
yet
by
the
same
definition
policing
has
made
great
strides
toward
professionalism
the
past
years
have
seen
a
huge
increase
in
the
educational
levels
of
police
leaders
almost
half
of
english
chief
constables
in
had
been
educated
at
the
cambridge
university
police
executive
program
and
three
decades
of
major
city
chiefs
in
the
united
states
attended
the
nondegree
harvard
police
executive
sessions
the
role
of
universities
in
disseminating
police
research
has
been
a
remarkably
successful
top
down
change
process
rising
levels
of
police
chief
education
have
also
fostered
more
support
for
research
first
led
by
external
scholars
and
now
increasingly
led
by
police
leaders
in
partnership
with
universities
the
production
of
new
research
evidence
has
helped
police
respond
to
external
demands
for
improvement
at
minimum
research
is
perceived
to
be
helpful
with
such
demands
that
is
especially
true
when
there
is
internal
or
external
controversy
about
which
police
methods
are
best
and
whether
new
technologies
are
cost
effective
even
a
radical
change
in
structures
of
police
accountability
can
enhance
the
value
of
police
research
evidence
the
devolution
of
control
over
chief
constables
in
england
and
wales
to
locally
elected
police
and
crime
commissioners
for
example
created
a
potential
for
disputes
between
elected
officials
and
professional
police
leaders
one
possible
solution
is
the
professional
college
of
policing
setting
independent
evidence
based
standards
of
police
practice
whether
this
institution
or
its
cognates
in
other
countries
can
create
a
global
demand
for
more
production
and
use
of
evidence
is
a
crucial
question
for
the
next
decade
targeting
testing
and
tracking
both
the
demand
for
and
uses
of
research
evidence
have
become
clustered
around
three
strategic
principles
police
should
conduct
and
apply
good
research
to
target
scarce
resources
on
predictable
concentrations
of
harm
from
crime
and
disorder
once
police
choose
their
high
priority
targets
they
should
review
or
conduct
tests
of
police
methods
to
help
choose
what
works
best
to
reduce
harm
once
police
agencies
use
research
to
target
their
tested
practices
they
should
generate
and
use
internal
evidence
to
track
the
daily
delivery
and
effects
of
those
practices
including
public
perceptions
of
police
legitimacy
the
growing
adoption
of
those
three
principles
has
given
shape
to
what
is
increasingly
called
evidence
based
policing
ebp
broadly
defined
as
the
use
of
best
research
evidence
on
what
works
as
a
guide
to
police
decisions
sherman
the
ebp
framework
was
meant
to
be
only
a
method
of
making
decisions
rather
than
a
substantive
strategy
for
police
operations
in
the
years
from
to
however
police
have
shaped
their
own
emergent
definition
of
ebp
as
a
substantive
strategy
for
managing
large
police
agencies
on
the
basis
of
these
three
principles
the
rise
of
the
triple
t
strategy
did
not
emerge
from
any
theoretical
plan
to
use
evidence
in
such
a
coherent
strategy
the
clustering
of
evidence
around
three
key
strategic
tasks
was
driven
as
much
by
innovative
police
leadership
as
by
police
scholarship
its
success
resulted
from
the
surprisingly
rational
convergence
of
police
reform
with
a
flood
of
new
research
in
criminology
this
essay
has
four
sections
section
i
discusses
the
key
social
trends
institutions
and
people
who
helped
shape
research
aiming
to
improve
policing
the
triple
t
strategy
emerged
from
the
users
of
that
evidence
section
ii
offers
major
examples
of
how
much
the
evidence
has
grown
since
and
how
widely
police
have
applied
that
knowledge
these
examples
address
all
three
triple
t
principles
including
instances
in
which
evidence
and
practice
have
sharply
diverged
they
are
selected
to
highlight
the
wide
range
of
what
has
already
been
accomplished
even
as
so
much
still
remains
to
be
done
section
iii
analyzes
conceptual
issues
and
confusion
that
hold
back
progress
in
targeting
testing
and
tracking
the
issues
are
arguably
little
different
from
those
arising
in
the
development
of
evidence
based
practices
in
professional
baseball
election
campaigns
or
marketing
they
reflect
the
current
struggle
between
system
i
and
system
ii
thinking
kahneman
in
a
wide
range
of
endeavors
all
of
which
face
the
same
challenge
policing
faces
to
get
much
better
at
what
they
do
in
the
next
decade
in
the
conclusion
i
suggest
things
institutions
can
do
to
institutionalize
research

in
ways
that
foster
more
fairness
and
effectiveness
in
democratic
policing
these
are
the
most
important
points
i
make
in
this
essay
the
evidence
base
for
police
decisions
has
grown
enormously
since
use
of
that
evidence
lags
behind
the
knowledge
but
use
has
also
grown
most
police
practices
despite
their
enormous
cost
are
still
untested
targeting
and
testing
require
highly
reliable
measures
of
crime
and
harm
crime
rates
and
counts
are
by
themselves
misleading
a
crime
harm
index
offers
far
better
evidence
to
guide
police
decisions
police
in
used
evidence
on
targeting
much
more
widely
than
evidence
from
testing
research
on
tracking
police
outputs
remains
largely
descriptive
and
incomplete
with
great
room
for
using
new
technologies
to
improve
the
quality
of
evidence
more
use
of
evidence
can
increase
police
legitimacy
both
internal
and
external
the
state
boards
of
police
officer
standards
and
training
in
the
united
states
and
the
college
of
policing
in
the
united
kingdom
will
be
key
institutions
in
making
policing
more
effective
along
with
the
practitioner
led
society
for
evidence
based
policing
i
the
rise
of
evidence
for
police
decision
making
the
rise
of
evidence
in
policing
is
mostly
an
anglo
american
story
with
events
on
each
side
of
the
atlantic
influencing
the
other
both
sides
began
with
parallel
social
trends
in
the
s
that
challenged
police
legitimacy
both
the
united
kingdom
and
the
united
states
faced
rising
crime
rates
and
increasing
racial
tensions
authoritative
commissions
in
both
set
out
ambitious
agendas
for
upgrading
the
police
as
one
think
tank
put
it
saunders
both
saw
policing
become
a
matter
of
national
politics
in
unprecedented
ways
the
different
responses
of
police
in
each
country
helped
build
a
special
intellectual
relationship
that
was
conceptually
far
deeper
than
the
military
collaboration
of
world
war
ii
one
continuing
theme
on
both
sides
of
the
atlantic
has
been
that
they
do
policing
better
on
the
other
side
a
setting
the
stage
by
the
early
s
anglo
american
policing
faced
a
kind
of
christmas
tree
of
ideas
for
police
reform
each
idea
an
ornament
unconnected
to
the
others
one
idea
was
that
police
needed
more
research
including
experiments
and
demonstration
projects
with
criminologists
and
other
social
scientists
becoming
part
of
the
police
agency
workforce
focusing
on
crime
prevention
president
s
commission
pp
there
was
no
consensus
about
the
questions
research
should
answer
there
was
no
particular
vision
of
a
new
policing
strategy
to
which
research
could
contribute
yet
belief
in
innovation
and
evaluation
as
a
strategy
in
itself
became
a
major
force
in
police
reform
reiss
that
belief
led
to
public
and
charitable
investments
in
new
institutions
for
police
research
the
growing
role
of
the
british
home
office
in
police
research
helped
inspire
the
creation
of
a
similar
function
in
the
us
department
of
justice
yet
neither
government
agency
s
efforts
had
much
impact
until
after
the
ford
foundation
in
funded
the
police
foundation
in
washington
to
foster
innovation
and
improvement
in
american
policing
the
bold
experiments
the
foundation
conducted
led
government
funders
to
test
policing
more
deeply
in
less
than
a
decade
the
police
foundation
s
and
government
supported
research
discredited
the
intellectual
basis
for
the
three
rs
strategy
of
random
patrol
rapid
response
and
reactive
investigations
what
replaced
that
strategy
was
not
a
coherent
new
theory
only
in
retrospect
can
we
use
the
triple
t
framework
of
targeting
testing
and
tracking
to
make
sense
of
what
emerged
the
multicentered
work
of
examining
current
practices
designing
innovations
and
evaluating
new
programs
produced
something
that
scholars
now
call
emergence
the
confluence
of
properties
arising
from
a
combination
of
elements
not
found
in
any
one
of
the
elements
johnson
the
essential
new
property
is
the
capacity
to
lead
police
organizations
with
dynamic
evidence
rather
than
static
doctrine
this
property
arose
initially
from
the
destruction
of
the
prevailing
three
rs
model
that
in
turn
opened
the
door
to
considering
the
implications
of
basic
research
provided
by
an
earlier
generation
of
thinkers
the
most
important
basic
research
had
documented
the
existence
of
police
discretion
to
choose
different
strategies
rather
than
being
handcuffed
by
the
three
rs
most
notably
reiss
s
conception
of
police
work
as
divided
between
proactive
and
reactive
discretion
stimulated
much
creative
thinking
at
the
same
time
banton
s
research
in
britain
and
wilson
s
research
in
the
united
states
showed
how
the
discretionary
choices
of
police
organizations
differ
on
the
basis
of
their
political
and
cultural
environments
despite
their
sharing
a
common
legal
system
these
insights
expanded
the
concept
of
police
discretion
from
the
level
of
case
by
case
to
agency
by
agency
decision
making
and
helped
to
set
the
stage
for
the
emergence
of
triple
t
but
that
new
evidence
based
strategy
took
almost
four
decades
to
emerge
from
the
accumulation
of
new
research
evidence
what
happened
was
a
process
of
prosumption
tapscott
and
williams
in
which
the
producers
of
elements
of
the
triple
t
strategy
were
simultaneously
its
consumers
b
testing
the
three
rs
strategy
was
intellectually
discredited
after
three
major
efforts
were
made
to
assess
the
effects
of
key
elements
these
studies
did
not
adequately
support
the
conclusions
attributed
to
them
they
did
not
show
that
random
patrol
had
no
effect
on
crime
that
rapid
police
response
had
no
deterrent
effect
or
that
detectives
made
no
contribution
to
detection
prosecution
and
general
deterrence
of
crime
regardless
of
what
the
research
evidence
really
did
show
those
conclusions
became
widely
accepted
by
police
leaders
and
police
scholars
then
and
now
random
patrol
the
police
foundation
s
kansas
city
preventive
patrol
experiment
kelling
et
al
launched
the
rise
of
evidence
based
policing
the
first
attempt
to
undertake
a
scientifically
controlled
test
of
the
effects
of
patrol
staffing
levels
it
proved
that
bold
experiments
were
possible
in
policing
the
experimental
design
of
withdrawing
patrols
from
five
patrol
beats
and
doubling
it
in
five
others
was
stunning
and
unprecedented
that
the
sky
did
not
fall
made
the
world
safe
for
further
bold
experiments
the
reported
conclusion
that
frequency
of
police
patrols
did
not
affect
crime
opened
many
minds
to
think
more
critically
about
police
strategy
the
experiment
s
leadership
by
a
police
chief
who
was
subsequently
appointed
fbi
director
also
suggested
that
research
even
with
negative
results
could
be
good
for
police
career
advancement
it
is
unfortunate
that
the
kansas
city
experiment
did
not
actually
support
its
conclusion
the
limitations
of
the
experiment
s
research
design
have
been
extensively
reviewed
elsewhere
sherman
b
sherman
and
weisburd
the
main
problem
is
that
the
actual
frequency
of
patrols
was
unmeasured
and
may
well
have
been
identical
in
all
beats
because
of
reactive
responses
to
calls
larson
moreover
there
were
large
differences
across
treatment
groups
in
certain
crime
rates
but
too
few
beats
to
call
the
differences
statistically
significant
but
the
most
important
critique
has
never
been
published
before
that
random
patrol
was
not
compared
to
any
other
pattern
of
patrol
so
there
was
no
evidence
showing
that
random
patrol
did
not
work
relative
to
other
patterns
of
patrol
such
as
concentration
on
crime
hot
spots
policing
still
needs
a
strong
randomized
trial
comparing
random
patrol
to
hot
spots
patrol
nonetheless
the
conclusion
that
random
patrol
did
not
work
was
widely
accepted
tens
of
thousands
of
police
officers
lost
their
jobs
in
the
aftermath
of
the
study
which
came
coincidentally
just
before
a
financial
crisis
in
many
us
cities
none
of
that
stopped
the
widespread
use
of
random
patrol
but
it
did
help
drive
a
research
agenda
seeking
alternative
police
strategies
rapid
response
the
theory
that
marginally
faster
response
times
would
catch
and
deter
more
criminals
was
effectively
falsified
by
a
national
institute
of
justice
funded
research
project
led
by
staff
of
the
kansas
city
police
department
the
study
reported
that
it
was
necessary
to
divide
crimes
into
victim
offender
involvement
crimes
e
g
robbery
assault
rape
and
after
the
crime
discovery
crimes
e
g
burglary
car
theft
it
then
focused
response
time
analysis
on
involvement
crimes
with
response
time
including
three
time
periods
crime
occurrence
to
calling
the
police
reporting
time
police
receipt
of
call
to
dispatch
dispatch
time
and
travel
time
of
police
from
receipt
of
dispatch
to
arrival
at
the
scene
using
systematic
observation
methods
and
interviews
of
victims
the
kansas
city
study
found
that
there
was
no
correlation
between
response
related
arrest
probability
and
reporting
time
once
the
reporting
time
exceeded
minutes
the
average
reporting
time
for
involvement
crimes
was
minutes
kansas
city
police
department
vol
pp
replications
of
the
reporting
time
segment
in
other
us
cities
found
similar
results
spelman
and
brown
what
the
research
did
not
show
is
that
a
capacity
for
rapid
response
had
no
effect
on
crime
the
kansas
city
study
was
not
an
experiment
comparing
police
agencies
or
areas
with
very
rapid
responses
to
similar
agencies
or
areas
with
slower
responses
or
even
no
response
much
remains
to
be
learned
about
the
effect
of
any
rapid
response
capacity
compared
to
none
the
latter
being
the
state
of
police
services
in
much
of
the
world
from
india
to
parts
of
rural
america
what
mattered
historically
was
the
growing
recognition
that
there
were
better
things
police
could
do
with
their
time
than
just
wait
for
calls
while
the
research
did
not
prove
that
point
it
helped
open
the
minds
of
police
leaders
and
scholars
about
what
those
other
things
might
be
reactive
investigations
the
view
that
detectives
solve
crimes
that
are
reported
to
them
was
strongly
rejected
by
another
national
institute
of
justice
nij
project
this
one
conducted
by
the
rand
corporation
greenwood
and
petersilia
this
report
examined
the
value
detectives
add
to
the
information
that
was
in
the
record
at
the
end
of
a
preliminary
investigation
by
the
first
responders
to
a
crime
usually
uniformed
patrol
officers
the
conclusion
was
that
detectives
rarely
uncovered
new
evidence
that
made
a
difference
in
solving
the
crime
contrary
to
a
century
of
detective
fiction
here
again
the
evidence
is
thin
in
relation
to
the
conclusion
an
experiment
comparing
cases
prosecuted
without
detective
work
to
cases
prosecuted
after
detective
work
would
be
a
strong
test
of
the
no
effect
hypothesis
but
what
mattered
was
that
yet
another
sacred
cow
was
wounded
for
many
police
leaders
this
completed
the
well
justified
execution
of
the
three
rs
strategy
which
legitimated
trying
alternatives
these
three
studies
created
a
strong
appetite
for
more
experiments
and
support
for
funding
them
from
influential
scholars
franklin
e
zimring
james
q
wilson
albert
j
reiss
jr
and
others
shaped
several
national
academy
of
science
reports
recommending
more
nij
funding
for
randomized
experiments
zimring
white
and
krislov
these
reports
led
to
nij
funding
streams
for
most
of
the
more
than
tests
of
police
practices
listed
online
by
lum
koper
and
telep
many
of
which
were
funded
in
by
james
k
stewart
the
only
nij
director
to
have
served
as
an
operational
police
officer
and
leader
c
targeting
important
as
these
tests
were
they
could
not
answer
the
more
fundamental
question
how
can
police
resources
be
allocated
more
effectively
once
the
idea
of
proactive
policing
became
widely
understood
it
sparked
a
revolutionary
insight
in
targeting
that
goldstein
called
problem
oriented
policing
pop
for
reactive
investigations
the
rand
report
also
led
to
a
revolutionary
question
can
detectives
target
which
cases
they
can
solve
by
predicting
the
likely
outcome
before
they
begin
working
on
each
case
problem
oriented
policing
after
decades
of
observing
police
operations
for
a
major
study
of
police
discretion
lafave
and
assisting
one
of
the
first
university
graduate
police
executives
in
history
o
w
wilson
as
police
superintendent
of
chicago
herman
goldstein
offered
a
revolutionary
new
targeting
strategy
for
policing
describing
a
case
by
case
response
to
events
as
a
myopic
failure
to
see
larger
patterns
goldstein
recommended
that
police
invest
more
time
in
treating
the
causes
of
those
patterns
rather
than
their
symptoms
pop
is
more
than
a
targeting
strategy
however
since
it
also
develops
ideas
for
the
content
of
police
actions
to
deal
with
targeted
problems
yet
the
tactical
content
of
pop
is
appropriately
broad
and
highly
dependent
on
good
diagnosis
and
good
research
on
what
action
would
work
best
the
major
breakthrough
of
the
strategy
is
the
injunction
to
first
look
for
patterns
proactively
crime
and
harm
concentrations
it
was
therefore
no
accident
that
reiss
the
person
who
first
used
the
term
proactive
in
a
policing
context
suggested
that
i
study
the
distribution
of
all
reactive
police
responses
to
reported
crimes
and
disorder
by
each
and
every
address
in
a
major
city
the
result
was
our
discovery
of
tiny
micro
level
crime
hot
spots
sherman
sherman
gartin
and
buerger
in
contrast
to
conventional
concepts
of
much
larger
high
crime
areas
the
city
of
minneapolis
provided
the
first
but
by
no
means
the
last
evidence
of
far
greater
concentrations
of
repeat
problems
at
individual
street
addresses
than
among
individual
offenders
only
percent
of
all
street
addresses
in
minneapolis
generated
over
half
of
all
police
rapid
responses
this
addition
to
the
existing
research
on
crime
concentrations
showed
how
police
scholars
could
identify
important
new
targets
for
proactive
policing
on
both
sides
of
the
atlantic
while
goldstein
s
examples
were
richly
qualitative
the
research
on
crime
and
harm
concentrations
was
intensely
quantitative
american
scholars
found
hot
spots
of
crime
british
scholars
found
patterns
of
repeat
victimization
farrell
in
both
cases
the
numbers
of
potential
patterns
were
unlimited
only
newly
available
computers
could
say
how
many
addresses
or
people
had
more
than
or
or
crimes
over
any
given
time
period
only
the
computer
could
rank
every
known
offender
victim
location
neighborhood
weapon
modus
operandi
or
crime
recruiter
by
the
number
of
repeat
events
in
a
year
reiss
what
these
studies
showed
were
highly
concentrated
distributions
of
crime
in
a
small
proportion
of
any
of
the
units
at
risk
from
people
to
places
to
times
and
situations
investigative
solvability
factors
news
reports
intermittently
reveal
that
only
a
small
proportion
of
crimes
lead
to
arrests
or
convictions
as
if
they
had
discovered
something
new
there
is
however
no
evidence
to
suggest
that
it
was
ever
otherwise
at
any
time
in
the
last
two
centuries
see
e
g
monkkonen
at
the
same
time
the
rand
report
on
detectives
was
under
way
scholars
at
stanford
university
asked
whether
they
could
target
solvable
crimes
for
priority
investment
allocating
resources
that
might
otherwise
be
wasted
on
pursuing
unsolvable
crimes
this
idea
of
triage
was
at
least
as
old
as
the
us
civil
war
when
doctors
worked
first
on
people
who
would
die
without
immediate
assistance
they
postponed
work
on
two
other
groups
hence
the
term
tri
age
those
who
would
die
even
with
treatment
and
those
who
would
live
without
immediate
treatment
the
strategy
was
intended
to
optimize
the
number
of
lives
for
policing
it
offered
a
way
to
make
policing
far
more
effective
as
greenberg
and
lang
suggested
the
likely
solvability
of
each
case
can
be
reliably
but
not
perfectly
identified
at
the
time
an
initial
investigation
is
completed
by
using
a
checklist
of
available
forensic
evidence
in
each
case
when
it
arrives
on
a
detective
s
desk
the
detective
can
decide
whether
to
close
the
case
or
start
working
on
it
the
checklist
that
stanford
developed
included
such
items
as
fingerprints
witnesses
footprints
names
of
likely
suspects
and
other
facts
a
test
of
one
such
solvability
model
on
over
burglary
cases
found
that
it
correctly
predicted
in
percent
of
the
cases
whether
the
case
would
be
solved
or
not
eck
suggesting
that
nonsolvable
cases
could
be
filed
immediately
with
little
difference
in
result
the
next
question
however
is
still
unanswered
as
with
the
untested
conclusions
about
response
time
and
random
patrols
how
would
a
checklist
of
solvability
factors
regime
compare
to
an
investigate
every
case
regime
in
terms
of
overall
detection
rates
or
even
to
a
discretionary
nonchecklist
decision
about
solvability
regime
d
tracking
no
matter
what
targets
are
selected
for
police
resources
no
matter
how
well
the
police
methods
are
tested
the
central
management
question
will
always
be
what
are
police
doing
to
accomplish
our
objectives
when
where
and
with
what
apparent
result
in
my
first
year
at
the
nypd
in
few
police
leaders
ever
discussed
that
question
by
the
question
was
asked
all
over
the
new
york
subways
by
then
transit
police
chief
william
bratton
and
by
he
was
grilling
nypd
commanders
on
the
question
in
front
of
people
at
police
headquarters
yet
long
before
new
york
reached
that
point
the
british
police
were
being
driven
hard
by
the
numbers
only
the
numbers
and
the
conversations
were
very
different
performance
management
uk
style
from
the
dawn
of
the
thatcher
government
uk
policing
was
dominated
by
two
themes
huge
pay
increases
and
an
explosion
of
statistical
management
key
performance
indicators
were
tabulated
annually
on
a
national
level
and
monthly
on
a
local
level
parkinson
eventually
police
agencies
were
not
only
assessed
on
whether
they
had
met
specific
goals
set
by
central
government
but
also
compared
to
all
other
police
agencies
in
a
kind
of
class
rank
or
football
league
table
one
police
agency
would
be
ranked
first
one
ranked
last
these
rankings
created
enormous
pressure
on
police
leadership
to
track
what
their
officers
were
doing
yet
the
pressure
was
not
matched
by
any
new
tools
either
hardware
or
managerial
for
monitoring
police
activity
only
the
numbers
of
police
car
dispatches
crime
reports
or
arrests
were
easily
measurable
it
was
no
surprise
that
these
numbers
were
sometimes
manipulated
including
a
flexible
definition
of
crime
types
and
other
crimes
taken
into
consideration
when
confessed
by
offenders
caught
red
handed
even
police
response
time
was
used
in
some
years
despite
its
discredited
status
in
the
united
states
by
these
interagency
competitions
were
mostly
rejected
in
uk
police
culture
yet
the
precedent
they
set
for
tracking
in
general
is
still
widely
accepted
what
police
now
understand
is
that
the
number
of
actions
tracked
should
be
relatively
small
and
each
one
should
have
a
direct
connection
to
something
that
is
well
researched
and
found
useful
what
us
police
learned
from
the
british
experience
is
that
timely
data
could
help
drive
a
police
agency
compstat
no
one
put
that
lesson
to
better
use
than
william
bratton
who
served
as
the
chief
executive
of
the
boston
new
york
and
los
angeles
police
departments
with
his
colleague
jack
maple
he
developed
a
more
focused
process
of
tracking
police
activity
using
area
commanders
as
the
conduit
for
strategic
initiatives
bratton
and
maple
developed
the
compstat
computerized
statistics
meetings
as
a
means
of
pushing
for
better
policing
and
less
crime
local
commanders
were
arrested
from
time
to
time
and
charged
with
manipulating
crime
statistics
but
for
the
most
part
the
system
has
been
seen
as
operating
with
integrity
by
the
nypd
system
was
years
old
and
was
still
in
operation
despite
turnover
in
mayors
and
police
commissioners
there
is
enormous
potential
to
expand
it
to
better
indicators
and
performance
auditing
for
evidence
in
late
the
metropolitan
police
at
new
scotland
yard
launched
a
top
to
bottom
effort
to
push
evidence
into
every
aspect
of
police
operations
training
and
promotions
stanko
this
decision
included
a
plan
to
appoint
a
commissioner
s
professor
of
policing
in
a
major
university
a
position
that
would
entail
percent
time
doing
research
for
a
employee
police
agency
this
research
could
include
comprehensive
reviews
of
police
practices
against
what
the
research
evidence
especially
testing
says
about
those
practices
it
would
also
likely
entail
new
randomized
controlled
trials
to
be
conducted
in
london
this
plan
for
evidence
based
policing
was
premised
on
the
recognition
of
a
vast
body
of
research
that
had
not
yet
been
fully
applied
to
police
operations
this
decision
of
police
commissioner
sir
bernard
hogan
howe
provides
perhaps
the
clearest
indication
of
the
anglo
american
rise
of
evidence
for
police
decisions
e
explaining
the
rise
how
policing
learned
so
much
and
put
so
much
of
it
to
work
cannot
be
easily
explained
by
any
current
theory
of
knowledge
even
the
history
of
medicine
offers
thin
explanations
of
why
doctors
do
research
and
why
if
ever
they
decide
to
use
it
millenson
or
not
as
in
their
continued
failure
to
wash
their
hands
after
touching
each
patient
pittet
and
boyce
what
follows
is
my
insider
s
hunch
about
a
theory
of
police
knowledge
this
hunch
is
by
no
means
a
general
theory
of
developing
and
using
professional
knowledge
my
explanation
is
deeply
if
not
widely
grounded
glaser
and
straus
in
my
continuous
participant
observation
study
of
anglo
celtic
policing
since
the
theory
has
a
major
premise
that
democratic
policing
is
an
extremely
open
system
far
more
than
any
publicly
held
stockholder
corporation
and
probably
more
than
any
other
government
agency
policing
is
always
vulnerable
to
the
demands
of
any
vocal
constituency
no
matter
how
small
the
group
of
demanders
or
how
justified
their
complaints
police
leaders
must
listen
to
them
and
give
due
consideration
to
them
in
providing
better
or
different
police
practices
this
pattern
of
organizational
behavior
has
been
observed
in
general
since
at
least
thompson
pp
wilson
p
described
a
subset
of
this
pattern
in
his
discussion
of
critical
events
in
policing
such
as
scandals
riots
police
killings
of
citizens
and
police
strikes
the
key
question
for
evidence
is
what
happens
next
how
critical
events
may
shape
evidence
and
how
evidence
may
then
shape
policy
figure
presents
a
causal
model
in
which
external
demands
for
different
policing
are
the
major
driving
force
the
theory
claims
that
these
demands
are
transformed
by
the
human
capital
of
the
police
institution
at
both
its
core
police
leaders
and
its
periphery
police
scholars
and
research
funders
in
turn
human
capital
is
shaped
by
the
broader
government
policies
that
are
also
a
target
of
public
demands
the
presence
or
absence
of
talented
police
leaders
and
scholars
often
reflects
a
or
year
lag
in
recruitment
conditions
and
is
highly
dependent
on
national
policies
affecting
police
salaries
research
funding
and
other
aspects
of
the
capacity
to
generate
and
use
research
evidence
the
people
in
a
position
to
influence
policy
if
they
are
skilled
enough
can
then
identify
critical
research
questions
and
complete
research
projects
which
are
then
communicated
to
police
practitioners
police
managers
and
officers
will
then
decide
immediately
somewhat
later
or
many
years
later
to
apply
the
conclusions
of
the
research
evidence
in
their
police
practices
sometimes
this
happens
without
their
even
knowing
that
the
practice
was
shaped
by
research
evidence
see
e
g
police
executive
research
forum
these
practices
and
the
ongoing
critical
events
associated
with
them
continue
to
shape
external
demands
on
police
this
happens
only
in
part
on
the
basis
of
police
success
or
failure
in
meeting
those
demands
many
other
things
shape
those
demands
of
course
and
may
be
far
more
important
than
what
police
actually
do
these
other
factors
include
economic
ups
and
downs
emigration
and
immigration
ethnic
and
racial
conflict
baby
booms
and
busts
and
possibly
even
a
lag
time
from
policies
on
leaded
gasoline
nevin
thus
external
demands
on
police
are
largely
exogenous
to
the
model
even
though
police
can
try
to
shape
them
to
some
degree
this
makes
the
external
demands
fairly
insensitive
to
how
well
police
are
performing
in
any
objective
sense
yet
the
model
leaves
room
for
improvements
in
police
practice
at
least
to
mitigate
criticism
and
possibly
even
to
increase
legitimacy
of
the
police
and
trust
and
confidence
in
them
fig
a
theoretical
model
of
the
rise
of
evidence
based
policing
the
role
of
technology
is
also
exogenous
to
the
model
and
may
be
even
more
important
than
citizen
demands
manning
both
police
and
societies
adopt
new
technologies
rapidly
when
their
advantages
are
obvious
and
their
cost
declines
many
technologies
such
as
the
automobile
and
the
computer
are
sold
initially
at
high
cost
and
then
become
much
cheaper
by
the
time
most
us
households
owned
an
auto
for
example
most
police
patrols
were
also
performed
in
cars
the
adoption
of
personal
computers
also
lagged
but
was
much
faster
the
desktop
computer
that
analyzed
police
mainframe
data
to
identify
hot
spots
of
crime
sherman
was
unavailable
in
the
minneapolis
police
department
in
the
s
but
later
faster
cheaper
laptop
models
were
widely
available
in
policing
by
the
s
the
rise
of
dna
testing
still
hinges
on
reducing
the
cost
of
speedy
results
roman
et
al
the
spread
and
impact
of
body
worn
video
may
also
hinge
on
reliability
and
the
cost
of
data
storage
the
model
does
not
suggest
that
there
is
a
direct
pathway
between
demands
for
specific
improvements
in
policing
such
as
more
legitimate
rape
investigations
and
research
on
how
this
demand
can
be
met
to
the
contrary
demands
for
immediate
solutions
send
governments
and
police
in
a
frantic
search
for
research
that
has
already
been
done
if
none
exists
that
merely
provides
evidence
that
policing
lacks
an
evidence
base
for
example
the
death
of
a
bystander
hit
by
a
constable
in
a
london
protest
was
associated
with
a
controversial
police
tactic
called
kettling
or
restraining
people
for
hours
in
a
cordoned
off
area
the
uk
government
launched
a
rapid
evidence
assessment
on
kettling
but
found
that
little
research
had
been
done
rather
than
investing
in
such
research
over
a
longer
time
frame
the
government
chose
to
report
the
knowledge
gap
and
then
ignore
it
the
direct
pathway
from
specific
demands
for
police
innovations
usually
travels
to
police
leaders
through
theory
and
precedent
from
other
jurisdictions
but
not
through
new
research
the
way
research
can
affect
policy
is
to
anticipate
the
chronically
recurring
issues
and
have
research
evidence
ready
for
the
next
critical
event
as
a
member
of
parliament
for
cambridge
once
said
research
findings
are
money
in
the
bank
howarth
they
do
not
have
to
be
used
immediately
and
can
go
unused
for
years
until
there
is
a
demand
for
them
that
is
why
the
line
from
research
goes
directly
to
police
practices
since
research
can
be
kept
in
readiness
to
shape
the
decisions
on
police
practices
when
critical
events
press
police
leaders
to
meet
external
demands
to
change
them
this
theory
explains
the
past
but
need
not
predict
the
future
a
more
rational
model
of
using
evidence
to
improve
policing
would
be
proactively
led
by
the
police
profession
not
reactively
driven
by
the
political
environment
that
model
might
even
reduce
the
number
of
critical
events
that
threaten
police
legitimacy
it
is
one
that
as
applied
to
health
care
has
helped
to
keep
down
medical
costs
in
the
united
kingdom
to
less
than
half
the
percentage
of
gross
domestic
product
as
in
the
united
states
where
there
is
no
system
to
target
resources
on
the
basis
of
professional
research
evidence
sherman
b
it
is
also
the
plan
for
what
the
college
of
policing
might
do
as
a
champion
and
arbiter
of
evidence
based
practice
ii
what
we
know
and
what
police
do
the
clearest
test
of
my
claims
about
evidence
is
whether
police
decisions
are
more
consistent
with
the
evidence
now
than
in
as
of
the
record
on
that
test
was
mixed
but
encouraging
there
are
many
areas
of
triple
t
in
which
the
evidence
is
useful
and
police
are
using
it
there
are
others
in
which
the
evidence
is
useful
but
is
not
used
the
adoption
of
evidence
based
decision
making
has
been
stronger
for
targeting
and
tracking
than
for
testing
but
all
three
areas
have
seen
a
substantial
impact
of
research
on
practice
this
section
supports
those
conclusions
with
a
series
of
short
summaries
of
good
evidence
on
many
aspects
of
policing
followed
by
even
shorter
summaries
of
whether
that
evidence
is
used
there
are
many
other
strategies
that
can
use
ebp
besides
triple
t
evidence
can
be
useful
for
example
in
the
recruitment
and
promotion
of
more
women
police
leaders
in
developing
better
ways
to
train
police
or
in
finding
lighter
weight
body
armor
with
greater
protection
this
essay
focuses
on
triple
t
because
it
can
shape
the
core
of
policing
and
holds
the
greatest
potential
for
the
direct
reduction
of
harm
in
society
the
most
accessible
evidence
of
the
large
quantity
of
the
testing
police
have
done
can
be
found
by

the
likely
solution
to
that
problem
is
for

and
other

to
broaden

much
harder
to
come
by

badly
in
need
of
more

this

draws
heavily
on
qualitative
evidence
gathered
in
over
weeks
of

at

from
around
the
world
in
primarily
reporting
on

some

any

is

as
a

be

the

police

largely
because
there

other

then
a
few
uk
police

began
doing
so

interest
in

came
from

by

there
is
good
evidence
summarized
above
that
police
investigations
can
be
targeted
on
the
cases
most
likely
to
be
solved
and
that
investigations
are
wasted
on
cases
in

to

what
police
do
this
is
another
major
failure
of
getting
research
into
practice
at
least
by
it
is
hard
to
find
a
police
agency
that
employs
a
statistical
model
of
solvability
factors
to
allocate
the
very
scarce
resource
of
investigators
time
many
police
agencies
still
say
they
investigate
all
crimes
others
admit
that
they
will
close
cases
that
are
not
solved
after
a
certain
period
but
they
do
not
use
a
statistical
algorithm
to
decide
which
ones
to
abandon
at
the
outset
many
confuse
this
research
with
closing
cases
on
the
basis
of
seriousness
rather
than
solvability
such
as
when
the
value
of
property
stolen
is
too
low
it
remains
a
prime
opportunity
for
policing
to
save
money

do
more

the

have

some
have

it
is
the
most
robust
area
of
evidence
supporting
the
triple

but
also
the
area
of
biggest
gaps
between
evidence

random
marked

the
evidence
there
is
little
direct
evidence
that
random
patrol
of
areas
that
have
little
crime
can
cause
any
less
crime
than
having
no

the
major
exception
is

in
any
of
the
police
agencies
from
countries
whose
representatives
were
asked
about
this
in
recent
classes
of
the
cambridge
police
executive
programme
compstat
the
evidence
since
nothing
has
done
more
than
the
compstat
idea
to
increase
the
availability
of
evidence
for
tracking
police
performance
at
micro
levels
of
activity
at
highly
structured
and
periodic
meetings
of
senior
police
officials
operational
commanders
report
the
tracking
data
on
their
crime
patterns
and
less
often
on
their
anticrime
strategies
pioneered
by
bratton
and
maple
the
compstat
program
was
probably
the
first
police
interaction
ritual
collins
to
make
a
sacred
meaning
by
reporting
the
crime
trends
within
days
rather
than
months
at
very
local
levels
the
institutional
meaning
and
police
legitimacy
associated
with
crime
control
became
far
more
intense
than
they
had
ever
been
before
willis
mastrofski
and
weisburd
my
own
observations
in
the
nypd
in
and
in
revealed
an
enormous
increase
under
compstat
in
the
extent
to
which
specific
evidence
about
crime
and
police
practices
was
portrayed
in
statistical
and
graphical
visualizations
my
own
attempt
to
introduce
something
similar
for
the
mayor
of
indianapolis
in
had
failed
to
mobilize
the
same
kind
of
intensity
largely
because
the
new
york
version
engaged
almost
people
in
the
room
listening
very
closely
compared
to
six
or
seven
in
indianapolis
new
york
also
used
compstat
with
its
unusually
great
legal
authority
to
press
unambitious
area
commanders
to
retire
and
to
reward
successful
commanders
with
promotions
something
few
other
agencies
are
able
to
do
nypd
officials
who
had
used
compstat
moved
to
other
large
cities
where
they
also
used
compstat
for
citywide
reviews
of
specific
issues
from
domestic
violence
to
police
corruption
sherman
no
other
system
of
tracking
evidence
on
outcomes
or
outputs
has
been
so
influential
or
comprehensive
what
police
do
in
some
years
after
new
york
s
compstat
had
become
highly
publicized
the
police
foundation
conducted
a
national
survey
of
us
police
agencies
in
cities
over
residents
weisburd
et
al
the
survey
found
that
over
half
of
those
agencies
with
an
percent
response
rate
either
had
adopted
a
compstat
like
program
or
were
planning
to
do
so
in
the
early
twenty
first
century
compstat
like
meetings
were
held
regularly
in
many
uk
police
agencies
few
such
meetings
however
track
the
key
question
under
discussion
where
are
the
police
doing
what
and
for
how
much
of
their
time
on
duty
that
is
a
question
that
two
major
advances
in
technology
will
soon
make
it
easier
to
answer
gps
tracking
of
officer
locations
the
evidence
police
agencies
have
been
able
to
track
the
locations
of
police
cars
since
at
least
the
s
but
have
rarely
done
so
police
unions
once
resisted
the
idea
especially
in
the
s
when
some
us
officers
regularly
slept
in
their
cars
on
the
midnight
shift
the
rise
of
gps
devices
in
police
radios
and
smart
phones
now
makes
it
possible
to
track
the
whereabouts
of
each
officer
every
few
minutes
or
seconds
police
officers
also
seem
more
willing
to
allow
this
if
only
as
a
safety
device
that
could
enable
a
rapid
response
of
other
police
to
help
them
an
experiment
in
providing
police
supervisors
with
data
on
how
much
time
each
patrol
officer
spent
at
directed
patrols
in
crime
hot
spots
has
been
completed
in
dallas
with
encouraging
results
weisburd
other
experiments
testing
the
use
of
tracking
evidence
for
effects
on
police
performance
are
needed
to
determine
whether
tracking
at
this
level
of
detail
is
cost
effective
or
not
what
police
do
from
the
limited
evidence
available
it
appears
that
as
of
no
major
police
agency
has
made
statistical
use
of
gps
data
about
locations
of
police
outputs
as
a
standard
part
of
tracking
or
compstat
for
reasons
discussed
in
the
first
section
of
this
essay
however
it
seems
likely
that
such
tracking
will
be
widespread
by
body
worn
video
the
evidence
inexpensive
body
worn
video
bwv
cameras
with
long
running
batteries
came
on
the
market
around
as
a
student
in
the
cambridge
police
executive
program
police
chief
tony
farrar
of
rialto
california
decided
to
test
the
hypothesis
that
police
officers
wearing
bwv
would
generate
fewer
complaints
from
encounters
with
citizens
one
theory
is
that
officers
would
be
more
polite
and
compliant
with
rules
knowing
that
every
word
and
action
was
on
digital
record
the
other
theory
states
exactly
the
same
for
citizens
encountering
police
in
a
randomized
controlled
trial
of
police
shifts
in
which
all
patrol
officers
either
did
or
did
not
wear
the
cameras
farrar
found
initial
evidence
of
fewer
complaints
on
shifts
when
officers
wore
their
bwv
devices
given
spillover
diffusion
effects
to
shifts
when
officers
did
not
wear
cameras
it
was
no
surprise
that
total
complaints
against
police
dropped
sharply
related
hypotheses
can
be
tested
in
this
design
for
the
rates
at
which
arrestees
plead
guilty
as
charged
or
the
rates
at
which
either
citizens
or
police
are
injured
in
their
encounters
note
that
this
evidence
is
a
prime
example
of
testing
a
means
of
tracking
police
performance
as
distinct
from
testing
the
effects
of
performance
itself
it
asks
whether
tracking
has
benefits
regardless
of
what
police
do
and
whether
tracking
improves
police
quality
what
police
do
bwv
is
at
a
very
early
stage
of
development
in
policing
one
uk
agency
tried
to
incorporate
it
into
stop
and
question
procedures
but
citizens
who
were
stopped
refused
to
answer
questions
while
police
had
their
cameras
on
a
large
australian
police
agency
has
had
problems
with
equipment
failures
what
no
agency
appears
to
have
tried
is
the
use
of
bwv
to
replace
typing
with
video
recorded
crime
reports
victim
and
investigative
interviews
and
other
work
such
use
of
videos
could
keep
police
out
of
stations
typing
up
text
for
many
hours
when
they
could
be
on
patrol
taking
video
statements
as
well
as
increasing
patrol
visibility
in
the
united
kingdom
s
ongoing
effort
to
cut
red
tape
and
reduce
reports
no
solution
could
be
easier
or
more
elegant
than
downloading
police
video
and
audio
as
a
digital
logbook
if
text
reports
need
to
be
created
for
any
reason
including
prosecution
then
civilian
video
specialists
can
do
that
rather
than
police
trained
to
patrol
prevent
and
investigate
d
summary
knowledge
and
its
use
the
examples
offered
above
support
a
key
conclusion
there
has
been
a
massive
growth
of
policing
knowledge
over
the
levels
in
equally
important
is
a
second
conclusion
there
has
been
less
progress
in
using
knowledge
than
in
generating
it
but
the
crude
and
perhaps
inaccurate
measures
of
evidence
in
practice
fail
to
suggest
what
may
be
the
most
important
point
that
police
interest
in
using
evidence
grew
most
rapidly
in
the
last
decade
before
even
though
the
s
was
the
most
intense
period
for
producing
police
research
the
s
and
s
were
the
most
intense
periods
for
consuming
it
if
the
demand
for
evidence
continues
to
grow
so
may
the
future
production
of
evidence

t
targeting
testing
and
tracking
this
section
highlights
the
major
conceptual
issues
that
must
be
addressed
for
policing
to
use
evidence
in
a
fully
professional
way
these
issues
all
relate
to
the
way
in
which
the
concept
of
evidence
is
defined
the
greatest
threat
to
police
professionalism
is
that
the
word
evidence
will
be
hijacked
to
mean
what
it
is
intended
to
replace
intuition
anecdote
and
opinion
just
because
a
word
is
fashionable
does
not
mean
that
people
who
use
it
will
understand
it
let
alone
accept
it
and
agree
with
its
message
even
with
the
best
of
intentions
the
word
evidence
is
often
applied
incorrectly
by
people
who
lack
adequate
training
in
how
evidence
should
be
used
this
risk
requires
that
police
leaders
and
scholars
pay
close
attention
to
the
integrity
of
the
concept
and
relentlessly
challenge
any
claims
that
the
evidence
shows
when
no
such
evidence
exists
this
threat
has
major
implications
for
how
police
training
and
promotion
processes
teach
and
communicate
about
evidence
based
practices
simple
lists
of
best
practices
may
have
great
value
in
some
contexts
but
for
people
sitting
at
conference
tables
deciding
on
what
best
practices
they
should
adopt
simplicity
is
not
good
enough
policing
is
a
complex
enterprise
and
so
is
drawing
conclusions
from
evidence
people
analyzing
evidence
need
to
be
qualified
to
do
so
one
way
or
another
at
minimum
they
should
understand
the
concepts
presented
in
this
section
it
is
reassuring
that
these
same
conceptual
issues
bedevil
other
complex
enterprises
as
well
there
is
nothing
wrong
with
police
thinking
about
evidence
that
is
not
also
wrong
with
the
thinking
of
highly
seasoned
politicians
issenberg
baseball
managers
lewis
and
nuclear
power
plant
engineers
silver
chap
as
kahneman
demonstrates
it
is
very
hard
for
humans
to
discipline
their
thinking
away
from
intuitive
snap
judgments
system
i
to
accept
more
systematic
analyses
that
follow
strict
rules
of
evidence
system
ii
fortunately
he
concludes
that
it
is
at
least
possible
for
humans
to
achieve
that
discipline
but
only
if
we
work
pretty
hard
at
it
this
section
considers
four
questions
most
important
is
the
question
of
what
good
evidence
is
and
what
it
means
to
make
policing
evidence
based
the
other
three
questions
cover
related
issues
in
targeting
testing
and
tracking
the
targeting
subsection
introduces
the
concept
of
a
crime
harm
index
as
the
best
way
to
measure
what
matters
in
valuing
police
effectiveness
the
testing
subsection
shows
how
testing
is
increasingly
done
by
pracademics
not
just
academics
the
tracking
subsection
discusses
how
to
use
evidence
for
ensuring
better
implementation
of
evidence
based
policies
a
what
is
good
evidence
what
is
good
evidence
this
question
must
be
addressed
almost
daily
if
policing
is
to
raise
its
level
of
professionalism
even
among
those
strongly
committed
to
using
good
evidence
it
is
easy
to
lose
the
core
principles
of
testing
at
an
early
meeting
of
the
society
of
evidence
based
policing
for
example
a
presentation
led
a
session
chair
to
endorse
an
innovation
in
taking
witness
statements
that
had
just
been
described
by
two
presenters
one
speaker
described
laboratory
tests
of
the
new
procedure
while
the
other
speaker
described
its
use
in
just
three
cases
in
the
field
no
controlled
field
test
had
been
conducted
nor
any
test
measuring
the
key
outcome
of
conviction
rates
yet
on
the
basis
of
the
strong
results
of
the
lab
experiments
the
session
chair
enthusiastically
described
the
research
as
really
strong
evidence
and
suggested
that
it
was
unethical
for
police
at
the
conference
not
to
adopt
the
innovation
i
felt
compelled
to
challenge
that
claim
by
pointing
out
the
major
difference
between
laboratory
and
field
tests
i
noted
that
evidence
based
medicine
limits
its
definition
of
evidence
to
field
tests
only
viewing
lab
tests
as
a
necessary
precursor
to
testing
treatments
on
real
people
in
this
police
context
this
means
that
the
proper
channel
for
the
enthusiasm
we
all
felt
for
the
innovation
would
be
to
conduct
a
randomized
field
experiment
which
had
not
yet
been
done
the
session
chair
readily
accepted
this
amendment
to
his
initial
conclusion
yet
few
advocates
of
new
ideas
would
be
so
open
minded
as
the
session
chair
who
is
widely
seen
as
one
of
the
most
promising
police
leaders
in
britain
it
is
people
like
him
who
will
make
a
key
difference
in
how
well
evidence
is
understood
used
and
defined
in
science
as
in
law
evidence
is
an
objective
finding
that
can
be
confirmed
by
repeated
observations
of
independent
observers
and
that
can
help
to
support
a
conclusion
most
people
as
philosopher
david
hume
observed
find
great
difficulty
in
accepting
that
their
own
subjective
impressions
hunches
prejudices
theories
or
opinions
are
not
objective
evidence
as
the
late
senator
daniel
p
moynihan
observed
the
plural
of
anecdote
is
not
data
the
rules
of
science
and
statistics
require
many
complex
procedures
and
conceptual
tests
in
order
to
establish
that
evidence
is
reliable
including
probability
sampling
causal
inference
selection
bias
statistical
power
confidence
intervals
and
many
other
challenges
to
deciding
what
is
a
fact
let
alone
whether
the
known
facts
can
support
a
conclusion
the
us
supreme
court
in
daubert
v
merrell
dow
u
s
codified
these
principles
into
federal
court
procedures
for
admitting
scientific
evidence
of
all
kinds
at
a
more
advanced
level
of
understanding
the
challenge
is
grasping
the
full
breadth
of
decision
making
processes
for
which
good
evidence
is
essential
including
but
not
limited
to
targeting
testing
or
tracking
to
some
critics
evidence
is
only
about
testing
or
even
just
about
randomized
controlled
trials
to
baseball
fans
familiar
with
the
moneyball
story
of
the
oakland
athletics
team
lewis
it
is
all
about
targeting
hiring
the
most
cost
effective
baseball
players
by
replacing
experienced
baseball
scouts
with
computer
geeks
to
some
observers
of
president
obama
s
victory
lab
issenberg
better
evidence
means
replacing
intuitive
political
gurus
with
computerized
geeks
for
tracking
the
delivery
of
more
favorable
voters
to
the
polls
these
partial
understandings
of
evidence
based
practice
converge
on
a
single
straw
man
caricature
that
quantitative
thinking
beats
and
should
replace
qualitative
judgment
nothing
could
be
further
from
the
truth
as
the
doctors
who
helped
develop
evidence
based
medicine
argued
the
best
evidence
is
a
blend
of
individual
clinical
experience
with
the
best
quantitative
and
qualitative
external
evidence
research
findings
and
experience
about
similar
cases
or
problems
sackett
et
al
as
baseball
statistician
nate
silver
p
observed
two
baseball
players
could
have
identical
statistics
but
one
could
spend
his
evenings
volunteering
at
a
homeless
shelter
while
the
other
is
snorting
cocaine
in
nightclubs
he
writes
that
there
is
probably
no
way
to
quantify
this
distinction
but
you
d
sure
as
hell
want
to
take
it
into
account
similarly
if
a
police
commander
knows
that
a
robbery
hot
spot
has
developed
in
a
racially
tense
minority
area
targeting
and
that
the
average
effect
of
doubling
police
patrols
in
robbery
hot
spots
is
to
cut
robbery
percent
testing
that
is
not
enough
evidence
for
a
good
decision
the
commander
would
also
think
of
many
other
qualitative
factors
such
as
the
recent
or
long
history
of
police
community
relations
in
that
area
the
extent
to
which
stop
and
frisk
would
be
used
the
likely
weather
or
school
vacations
the
availability
of
minority
group
officers
to
work
in
the
area
and
the
track
record
or
personality
of
a
sergeant
who
would
directly
supervise
any
effort
to
double
patrols
the
commander
might
also
wish
to
consult
with
neighborhood
leaders
on
how
best
to
bring
in
more
patrols
perhaps
with
a
handout
flyer
for
police
to
give
everyone
they
encounter
on
the
streets
a
practice
for
which
there
is
experimental
evidence
from
australia
mazerolle
et
al
evidence
based
practice
does
not
and
cannot
replace
judgment
based
on
experience
it
can
only
inform
such
judgment
and
usually
improve
it
attempts
to
portray
ebp
as
trying
to
replace
rather
than
supplement
experience
sparrow
are
merely
noise
in
relation
to
the
signal
not
even
baseball
teams
as
silver
pp
points
out
replaced
qualitative
scouts
with
quantitative
geeks
after
the
events
depicted
in
moneyball
lewis
instead
baseball
teams
increased
their
investments
in
both
integrating
qualitative
and
quantitative
information
supported
by
a
profession
led
science
see
weisburd
and
neyroud
the
body
of
knowledge
supporting
ebp
embraces
and
incorporates
police
experience
and
craft
skills
it
does
not
replace
traditional
thinking
about
legality
legitimacy
and
common
sense
nor
does
it
replace
the
wisdom
and
experience
of
police
professionals
what
it
adds
to
these
assets
is
the
crucial
step
of
an
objectivity
check
about
questions
that
have
often
been
answered
on
the
basis
of
subjective
opinions
sherman
is
there
any
systematic
scientifically
generated
evidence
that
bears
on
the
decisions
we
are
about
to
make
moreover
is
the
evidence
the
right
kind
of
evidence
for
the
decision
while
the
meaning
of
the
phrase
what
works
in
policing
may
seem
obvious
it
is
not
whether
a
prediction
model
works
simply
means
whether
its
predictions
are
accurate
no
randomized
controlled
experiment
is
needed
whether
gps
works
to
track
police
locations
accurately
is
simply
a
matter
of
auditing
by
physical
tests
there
is
no
cause
and
effect
relationship
just
measurement
reliability
whether
arrest
for
domestic
violence
works
however
is
a
matter
of
testing
for
cause
and
effect
this
means
that
in
a
controlled
experiment
cases
in
which
police
made
arrests

that

why
the

not
to

the

also

issues
in
targeting

the
targeting
of
scarce
resources
can
be
compared
to
an
investment
portfolio
like
police
agencies
investors
have
a
variety
of
objectives
such
as
growth
income
and
security
like
police
investors
make
a
variety
of
investments
to
accomplish
different
objectives
like
police
investors
face
an
endless
array
of
choices
about
how
to
invest
scarce
resources
but
investors
have
one
great
advantage
over
police
that
makes
the
investors
job
much
easier
a
common
currency
police
can
have
a
common
currency
as
well
but
only
if
they
create
it
this
subsection
starts
by
describing
a
way
in
which
police
can
guide
targeting
decisions
with
a
common
currency
of
return
on
investment
it
then
shows
how
different
methods
of
predicting
returns
of
investment
in
that
currency
will
produce
much
higher
or
lower
rates
of
error
in
making
targeting
decisions
including
the
new

called
predictive

as

a

the
biggest
obstacle
to
reducing
crime
may
be
the
misleading
way
in
which
it
is
counted
as
a
raw
summation
of
all
crimes
regardless
of
any
differences
in
public
views
of
the
seriousness
of

across
crime
categories
rossi
et

from

governments
earnestly

whether
there
were
more

this

this

all

not

some

horrible

others

scant
meaningful

to
anyone
such
as

crime
counts
are

by
such

only
percent

or
a

yet
public
officials
are
pleased
to
report
success
when
total

drops
and
displeased
when
total
crime
counts
rise
even
if
murders
rapes
and
serious
woundings
stay
constant
if
ebp
accepts
this
fungibility
fallacy
that
all
crimes
are
equal
its
value
will
be
greatly
restricted
police
professionals
are
acutely
sensitive
to
the
idea
that
the
weight
of
harm
from
crime
matters
more
than
a
raw
count
of
incidents
sherman
a
they
know
that
a
car
theft
is
less
harmful
than
a
rape
that
a
fraud
is
less
harmful
than
a
stabbing
what
they
lack
is
a
way
to
account
for
these
differences
in
combination
across
all
crimes
this
would
allow
police
to
know
whether
total
harm
from
crime
in
one
city
is
higher
this
year
than
last
higher
in
this
part
of
town
than
that
or
with
this
offender
s
record
compared
to
that
one
s
the
best
way
to
compile
meaningful
evidence
about
reported
crime
is
to
give
each
type
of
crime
a
weight
that
represents
how
harmful
each
type
of
crime
is
combining
crime
in
this
way
would
create
what
statisticians
call
an
index
yielding
a
single
bottom
line
the
weight
can
be
based
on
a
variety
of
metrics
the
simplest
metric
would
be
taken
from
any
sentencing
guideline
recommendations
of
the
number
of
days
in
prison
for
a
first
offender
convicted
of
that
offense
this
would
give
an
approximation
of
the
pure
weight
of
harm
of
the
offense
itself
in
contrast
to
the
actual
sentence
length
an
offender
may
receive
the
latter
being
influenced
by
the
number
of
prior
convictions
of
the
offender
summing
the
total
weight
for
each
type
of
any
indicator
such
as
crime
types
then
adding
the
subtotal
weights
together
is
the
basis
for
a
commonly
used
method
of
constructing
an
index
of
multiple
indicators
a
consumer
price
index
cpi
for
example
takes
the
cost
of
consumer
goods
in
different
categories
food
housing
transportation
and
then
assigns
a
weight
to
those
costs
based
on
the
average
household
s
budget
proportions
for
each
category
if
housing
costs
rise
percent
but
housing
is
only
percent
of
the
family
s
budget
then
the
housing
increase
of
percent
becomes
a
percent
increase
in
the
total
cpi
similarly
a
crime
harm
index
chi
is
a
tool
for
creating
just
such
a
bottom
line
for
the
harm
caused
by
crime
sherman
a
weighting
crimes
on
the
basis
of
sentencing
guidelines
can
be
justified
on
good
democratic
grounds
as
reflecting
the
will
of
the
people
almost
every
sentencing
guideline
process
in
the
united
states
and
united
kingdom
has
reflected
awareness
of
opinion
polls
debates
and
scrutiny
by
elected
officials
and
news
media
the
scrutiny
may
not
have
been
perfect
yet
it
remains
far
closer
to
the
will
of
the
people
than
any
theoretical
or
even
empirical
system
of
weighting
that
academics
might
develop
most
important
it
is
readily
available
to
be
applied
to
any
set
of
crimes
whether
for
an
individual
a
community
or
a
nation
any
police
agency
or
government
can
construct
its
own
index
with
the
following
seven
steps
counting
up
the
number
of
crimes
of
each
type
in
an
area
or
for
one

multiplying
the
count
for
each
type
by
the
median
number
of
prison

recommended
for

of
that
type
by

calling
the

creating
a
standardized

for
any

by
dividing
the
estimated

the

in
that

for
that

include

has
been
at

of
committing

as
an
adult
usually
since
age
either
removing
days
in
prison
or
not
depending
on
data
availability
as
an
example
of
how
a
chi
works
consider
a
community
or
an
offender
with
crimes
in
the
record
assume
that
the
recommended
sentence
for
a
shoplifting
crime
is
day
in
prison
and
that
the
recommended
sentence
for
a
first
manslaughter
is
years
in
prison
or
days
if
all
crimes
are
shoplifting
cases
the
chi
value
of
those
crimes
would
be
days
if
all
crimes
are
manslaughter
cases
then
the
chi
value
would
be
x
p
in
both
cases
the
crime
count
is
but
the
range
of
chi
varies
from
in
the
first
example
to
in
the
second
which
would
tell
voters
more
about
how
safe
or
dangerous
their
community
is
by
creating
a
more
sensitive
bottom
line
a
chi
can
show
much
more
transparently
whether
the
harm
from
crime
is
higher
or
lower
depending
on
the
exact
nature
of
the
crimes
to
translate
a
chi
into
an
overall
targeting
plan
police
leaders
can
simply
use
a
checklist
of
possible
targets
to
pick
one
or
more
ways
of
organizing
a
resource
targeting
strategy
such
a
strategy
can
be
based
on
hot
spot
places
convicted
offenders
repeat
victims
crime
recruiters
see
below
criminal
networks
predicted

patterns
times
of

situations
or
crime
types
any
of
these
will
do
as
long
as
the
analysis
is
comprehensive
that
is
a
chi
analysis
of
all
of
these
units
should
encompass
percent
of
the
chi
for
the
entire
jurisdiction
perhaps
the
greatest
value
of
a
chi
would
be
in
using
it
to
forecast
how
much
harm
an
individual
offender
suspect
or
defendant
is
likely
to
cause
in
the
next
years
such
forecasts
can
help
guide
the
massive
use
of
police
discretion
to
divert
cases
from
prosecution
into
out
of
court
penalties
constituting
some
percent
of
all
nontraffic
penalties
in
england
and
wales
judge
the
legitimacy
of
policing
could
be
enhanced
by
using
these
forecasts
to
reduce
the
risk
of
releasing
a
very
dangerous
offender
who
may
for
example
soon
murder
someone
such
forecasting
can
provide
missing
evidence
for
the
existing
system
of
triage
in
allocating
scarce
tax
revenues
for
maximum
public
benefit
the
triage
of
targeting
police
resources
embraces
all
police
services
better
evidence
can
make
the
likely
consequences
of
these
hard
choices
clearer
to
those
who
must
make
them
a
standard
metric
such
as
a
chi
for
predicting
the
benefit
of
one
choice
over
another
can
make
such
evidence
much
easier
to
apply
in
practice
good
and
bad
predictions
or
forecasts
no
matter
what
currency
police
use
to
target
police
resources
the
evidence
they
need
to
make
good
decisions
is
a
reliable
forecast
of
future
events
they
may
prefer
to
have
a
prediction
but
predictions
are
far
less
reliable
than
forecasts
the
difference
between
a
forecast
and
a
prediction
is
crucial
as
the
scientists
who
study
earthquakes
know
to
their
cost
silver
p
reports
that
in
seismology
a
prediction
is
a
definitive
and
specific
statement
about
when
and
where
an
earthquake
will
strike
a
major
earthquake
will
hit
kyoto
japan
on
june
a

is
a
probabilistic
statement
usually
over
a
longer
time
scale
there
is
a
percent
chance
of
an
earthquake
in
southern
california
over
the
next
thirty
years
silver
notes
that
the
official
position
of
the
us
geological
survey
usgs
is
that
earthquakes
can
be
forecasted
but
they
cannot
be
predicted
much
the
same
can
be
said
about
evidence
based
police
targeting
it
employs
forecasting
not
precise
predictions
about
when
and
where
crimes
are
likely
to
occur
in
the
first
published
analysis
of

across
every
address
in
an
entire

there
were

in

there
was

chance
of
crime
at
a
specific
address
every

sherman
gartin
and
buerger
what
the

did
not
do
is
to
name
a
time
and
date
when
the
next
robbery
would
occur
at
a
specific
place
nor
the
name
of
the

remarkable

takes
the
form
of
projecting

basis
of
the
past

what
might
be
called
post

based
on
long

the

this
way
can
be

the
future
time
window
in

the

applies
could
be

a

these
forecasts
have
high
levels
of
accuracy
but
low
levels
of
precision
they
cannot
tell

exactly
where
and
when
the
next

will
occur
a
newer
approach
may
offer
both
precision
and
accuracy
at

for

at

if

they

more
valuable
than

what
all
these

offer
at

in

are
empirical

draw
increasing

no

compare

in

the
bright

between
quantitative

and
subjective

also
known

a
three
methods
of

there
are
three
basic
ways
to
make
statements
about

subjective
or
clinical
methods
a
checklist
of

factors
and
supercomputer

based
on
large

sizes
by
far
the
most
common
method
is
the
subjective
intuitive
system
i
approach
based
on
experience
with
similar
situations
kahneman
the
second
method
is
a
checklist
approach
that
moves
past
experience
from
qualitative
to
quantitative
analysis
it
translates
prior
experience
into
a
more
systematic
algorithm
the
word
statisticians
prefer
for
a
formula
or
equation
based
on
a
few
consistent
criteria
forcing
the
forecaster
to
answer
a
checklist
of
weighted
questions
to
make
decisions
about
predictive
factors
found
in
large
samples
of
previous
cases
crime
solvability
factors
eck
provide
an
example
of
the
checklist
approach
the
third
method
requires
the
use
of
a
supercomputer
performing
massive
calculations
about
each
individual
case
in
relation
to
tens
of
thousands
of
similar
but
slightly
different

by

massive
amounts
of

on
previous
events
to
predict
future
events
it
is
especially
useful
in
forecasting
very
rare
events
such
as
hurricanes
or
homicides
the
primary
published
example
of
data

in

forecasting
is

clinical
versus
statistical
predictions
since
at
least
the
advent
of
freudian
theory
professionals
such
as
psychiatrists
have
been
paid
well
to
make
predictions
about
human
behavior
these
predictions
have
been
based
on
detailed
analysis
of
an
individual
s
personality
and
previous
behavior
the
method
has
been
highly
respected
it
is
still
used
widely
to
decide
whether
violent
people
are
insane
or
criminally
responsible
for
their
conduct
many
police
agencies
also
use
it
to
screen
police
recruits
for
mental
health
since
the
advent
of
mechanical
calculators
a
far
less
expensive
approach
to
prediction
has
been
used
by
institutions
dealing
with
large
volumes
of
decisions
from
insurance
companies
to
university
admissions
offices
decisions
have
been
made
on
the
basis
of
classifying
people
by
their
numbers
how
many
accidents
how
high
a
test
score
what
average
grades
how
many
speeding
violations
and
so
on
these
characteristics
can
be
recorded
at
much
lower
expense
than
the
cost
of
having
a
professional
personality
assessment
while
making
exactly
the
same
kind
of
predictions
until
meehl
s
comparison
of
these
inexpensive
statistical
methods
to
the
expensive
clinical
methods
no
one
had
ever
shown
which
method
is
more
accurate
since
then
no
research
has
ever
contradicted
his
central
conclusion
what
meehl
found
was
that
statistically
validated
predictions
were
always
either
more
accurate
than
clinical
prediction
or
at
worst
just
as
good
at
a
much
lower
cost
his

comparing
subjective

of

to
rather
modest
combinations
of
numerical
information
about

organized
according
to
a
rule
such
rules
are
called
algorithms
the
statistical
predictions
based
on
algorithms
in
meehl
s
comparison
were
very
simple
by
modern
standards
without

analysis
nonetheless
they
usually
did
better
than

statistical

does
much
better

is
little

remain

there
is
no
convincing
case
in
which
clinical

has
beaten
statistical
forecasts
until
recently
this
debate
had
no
relevance
to

since
police
made
little
use
of
either
kind
of
prediction
in
targeting
their
resources
yet
by
the
early
twenty
first
century
police
on
both
sides
of

had
invested
in
clinical

rather
than
in
statistical

uk

developed

to

for

the
cost
of
subjective
methods
of

forecasting
often
becomes
apparent
when

are
audited
against
what
really
happens
an

of

of

or
attempted

in

major
uk
police
force
did
not
find
one
case
of

committed
by

their

but
at

this
approach
offers
a

opportunity
for

yet
it
lacks
a
crucial
piece
of
evidence
that
is
needed
to
recommend
their
widespread

the
most
important
new
evidence
about
statistical
solvability
factors
would
be
a
randomized
trial
comparing
the
overall
detection
rates
of
a
team
of
detectives
using
tested
solvability
factors
to
target
cases
for

to
those
of
a
team
using
unstructured
discretion
to
target
cases
by
randomly
assigning
all
incoming
cases
to
one
or
the
other
of
the
two
teams
the
experiment
would
yield
a
valid
estimate
of
using
one
system
or
the
other
even
better
such
an
experiment
could
use
a
chi
to
weight
the
value
of
the
cases
in
the
two
teams
resulting
in

this
would
create
an
incentive
for
the
investigators
to
use
harm
weightings
in
combination
with
solvability
factors
to
decide
which
cases
to
investigate
the
investigative
results
could
then
be
compared
by

the

of
the

the

c
issues
in
testing
for
outcomes
evidence
based
policing
requires
a
clear
understanding
of
the
difference
between
trying
and
testing
many
police
agencies
say
they
have
evidence
that
a
police
practice
works
because
they
have
tried
it
yet
in
most
cases
there
is
no
good
evidence
gained
from
piloting
a
new
practice
or
trying
it
out
the
minimal
standards
of
evidence
from
the
kind
of
test
that
should
be
used
to
guide
policy
require
direct
measurement
of
outputs
and
outcomes
and
direct
comparison
of
those
outcomes
with
a
control
group
s
outcomes
there
is
no
better
example
than
the
case
of
the
free
chocolate
trying
versus
testing
the
chocolate
case
the
dorset
uk
police
tried
a
very
interesting
idea
in
bournemouth
in
the
early
twenty
first
century
when
all
pubs
still
closed
at
p
m
sharp
what
happened
between
and
midnight
each
evening
was
reportedly
a
big
spike
in
the
hourly
number
of
fights
many
fights
happened
while
people
were
waiting
in
line
at
fish
and
chips
shops
hungry
for
their
first
food
after
drinking
beer
for
or
hours
a
creative
police
leader
reasoned
that
this
pattern
or
problem
as
goldstein
defined
it
was
caused
by
low
blood
sugar
making
people
more
irritable
the
dorset
police
then
tried
handing
out
free
chocolates
to
people
waiting
in
line
for
their
takeaway
food
media
reports
at
the
time
quoted
police
saying
the
idea
worked
this
brilliant
idea
appears
however
never
to
have
been
tested
at
the
standard
required
by
evidence
based
policing
i
found
no
report
of
any
counts
of
fights
between
and
midnight
either
before
or
after
the
free
chocolate
policy
the
first
standard
of
a
scientific
test
is
that
there
be
consistently
defined
and
reliable
measurement
of
both
the
problem
to
be
solved
fights
in
this
case
and
the
solution
itself
in
this
case
chocolate
as
a
public
health
doctor
might
ask
what
was
the
dosage
of
chocolate
handed
out
how
many
individuals
took
the
chocolate
how
many
ate
it
how
many
nights
a
week
was
the
chocolate
handed
out
was
it
handed
out
equally
at
every
fish
and
chips
shop
if
not
were
there
fewer
fights
where
there
was
more
chocolate
over
a
long
enough
time
period
to
constitute
a
statistically
powerful
test
by
what
percentage
did
the
average
number
of
fights
in
bournemouth
between
and
midnight
go
down
even
if
all
those
questions
of
measurement
were
answered
however
there
would
still
be
no
assurance
that
the
chocolates
had
worked
unless
the
second
standard
of
a
test
were
to
be
met
a
fair
comparison
to
a
control
group
that
did
not
receive
the
free
chocolates
a
control
group
could
be
selected
from
the
central
entertainment
area
of
a
similar
city
nearby
which
would
constitute
a
level
test
on
the
maryland
scale
of
scientific
methods
sherman
et
al
the
minimum
level
recommended
for
evidence
on
which
to
base
policy
even
better
would
have
been
the
identification
of
fish
and
chips
shops
in
dorset
s
entertainment
areas
in
multiple
cities
and
towns
with
of
them
selected
at
random
for
the
free
chocolate
treatment
the
distinction
between
trying
and
testing
has
become
increasingly
clear
to
police
leaders
if
not
the
rank
and
file
in
the
united
states
and
united
kingdom
over
the
past
four
decades
yet
the
absolute
comprehension
level
remains
low
it
is
hard
to
teach
these
concepts
to
senior
police
leaders
in
a
short
conversation
even
though
they
now
feel
obliged
to
discuss
them
as
if
they
understand
them
perfectly
the
concept
of
testing
has
not
until
recently
been
a
part
of
police
training
for
leaders
or
street
officers
but
since
the
cambridge
university
institute
of
criminology
has
been
teaching
these
ideas
to
a
large
proportion
of
all
the
leaders
who
became
chief
constables
the
success
of
that
teaching
has
been
far
from
perfect
but
it
is
no
accident
that
the
uk
police
leadership
spends
far
more
time
talking
about
the
evidence
for
policies
than
us
police
leaders
do
what
may
work
better
than
training
is
to
have
a
much
greater
volume
of
experiments
going
on
in
police
agencies
than
ever
before
since
this
has
been
happening
in
the
united
kingdom
if
not
in
the
united
states
the
downside
of
this
development
may
be
less
rigor
and
care
in
the
conduct
of
experiments
for
reasons
discussed
below
these
problems
may
be
outweighed
however
by
the
increased
awareness
they
promote
of
the
difference
between
trying
and
testing
between
evidence
free
and
evidence
based
policing
what
works
testing
practices
using
tests
there
are
two
ways
for
police
to
find
out
whether
a
specific
police
practice
is
effective
one
is
to
have
someone
look
for
relevant
evidence
in
the
growing
police
research
repositories
see
the
appendix
the
other
is
for
police
to
conduct
tests
in
their
own
agencies
in
an
ideal
world
there
would
be
so
many
tests
of
police
services
as
there
are
of
medical
services
that
ebp
would
operate
primarily
by
looking
up
tests
rather
than
doing
them
the
ebp
matrix
lum
koper
and
telep
and
other
tools
already
make
it
easy
to
do
this
other
tools
for
easy
lookups
are
under
development
some
of
them
designed
for
access
via
smart
phones
the
college
of
policing
may
even
develop
the
ideas
of
computerized
medicine
for
instant
access
to
relevant
evidence
hafner
in
the
foreseeable
future
however
many
expensive
police
services
will
remain
untested
the
costs
of
conducting
tests
are
minimal
in
comparison
to
the
costs
of
delivering
untested
services
and
every
time
a
police
agency
contributes
a
high
quality
cost
effectiveness
test
to
the
global
police
literature
the
entire
world
will
gain
unlike
such
agencies
as
the
uk
national
health
service
police
are
not
yet
required
to
have
randomized
trials
justify
large
portions
of
the
police
budget
but
it
would
be
major
progress
if
at
least
or
percent
of
a
police
operating
budget
could
be
based
on
good
evidence
the
most
relevant
question
for
any
police
leader
is
which
of
our
services
is
so
expensive
and
of
such
doubtful
value
that
it
is
worthwhile
to
do
our
own
local
randomized
controlled
trial
a
generalizability
of
evidence
there
is
also
a
scientific
question
of
how
reliably
research
in
one
police
agency
or
more
will
predict
effectiveness
in
any
other
agency
the
present
state
of
science
cannot
say
whether
one
or
even
strong
tests
are
enough
to
generalize
to
all
democracies
or
even
across
the
country
where
the
tests
were
done
this
problem
is
confounded
by
the
wide
range
of
results
reported
in
such
systematic
reviews
as
the
meta
analysis
of
the
effects
of
hot
spot
policing
braga
papachristos
and
hureau
while
the
average
effect
is
beneficial
the
range
of
effects
is
very
great
whether
another
agency
implementing
some
form
of
hot
spot
policing
will
achieve
a
large
or
small
effect
remains
highly
uncertain
from
the
available
research
the
external
validity
of
results
is
also
challenged
by
the
wide
variety
of
practices
tested
even
under
a
common
rubric
like
hot
spots
policing
the
range
of
specific
police
methods
of
policing
included
in
that
review
is
almost
as
great
as
the
range
of
effect
sizes
braga
papachristos
and
hureau
while
the
review
is
nonetheless
a
major
contribution
to
the
literature
the
wide
range
of
research
designs
unavoidably
strains
the
scientific
definition
of
replication
on
which
the
statistical
procedures
are
premised
for
example
while
the
hot
spot
review
found
randomized
trials
of
hot
spot
policing
and
more
have
been
finished
since
only
one
of
them
tested
a
substantial
increase
in
marked
car
patrols
in
street
corner
hot
spots
other
designs
are
of
interest
but
for
a
police
leader
considering
a
percent
increase
in
hot
spot
patrols
at
street
corners
any
other
design
is
a
different
research
question
for
the
foreseeable
future
the
best
evidence
on
outcomes
police
agencies
can
get
will
come
from
conducting
their
own
experiments
most
readers
may
wonder
whether
that
idea
is
feasible
or
is
a
fantasy
the
answer
depends
entirely
on
who
does
the
experiments
who
designs
them
leads
them
and
analyzes
them
those
tasks
have
been
the
traditional
domain
of
police
scholars
with
police
practitioners
as
their
partners
yet
a
rapidly
growing
appetite
for
good
evidence
will
soon
swamp
the
available
numbers
of
experimental
criminologists
unless
they
reinvent
their
partnerships
with
policing
b
who
shall
test
the
police
themselves
from
until
police
testing
was
largely
orchestrated
by
academics
in
universities
who
had
found
police
chiefs
to
partner
with
them
the
experiments
typically
involved
large
grants
from
foundations
or
national
governments
research
agencies
us
national
institute
of
justice
uk
home
office
australian
research
council
these
grants
usually
provided
for
well
trained
and
closely
supervised
doctoral
students
to
work
with
police
in
the
delivery
and
measurement
of
the
experimental
variables
ensuring
independent
quality
control
and
monitoring
of
the
data
collection
senior
academics
would
then
analyze
the
data
and
write
the
report
since
the
number
of
academics
interested
in
doing
all
this
work
was
limited
the
maximum
number
of
experiments
was
limited
by
human
resources
as
much
as
by
the
tiny
overall
funding
stream
for
such
experiments
since
around
both
funding
and

barriers
have
started
to
fall

been
increasingly

by

to
earn
a

degree
some
in

after
years
in
policing
whatever
their
background
they
are
rapidly
increasing
the
numbers
of
people
who
can
produce
good
evidence
on
policing
this
change
is
especially
visible
in
the
united
kingdom
where
cambridge
graduates
form
a
critical
mass
to
pioneer
the
new
model
for
testing
police
practices
this
model
has
made
possible
a
far
greater
volume
of
experimentation
because
police
officers
from
sergeant
to
police
chief
have
designed
and
delivered
their
own

this
benefit
must
be
weighed
against
important
issues
of

in
the

of
the

the

other
important

issues
in
tracking
police
outputs
and
outcomes
three
key
issues
shape
the
growth
of
tracking
police
outputs
and
outcomes
one
is
how
police
leaders
measure
what
police
officers
do
a
second
is
how
they
compare
measures
of
performance
across
officers
and
units
the
third
is
how
they
use
tracking
data
to
deliver
better
policing
by
evidence
based
management
measuring
what
police
do
for
all
the
progress
that
compstat
has
brought
policing
it
is
striking
how
little
measurement
it
has
used
of
what
police
do
in
for
example
the
philadelphia
police
department
s
compstat
never
reviewed
data
on
where
police
patrolled
where
they
made
arrests
where
they
conducted
stop
and
frisks
or
even
how
many
police
were
scheduled
to
work
by
time
or
day
in
relation
to
the
hourly
frequency
of
crime
in
any
police
district
in
social
science
terms
compstat
was
a
discussion
of
dependent
variables
without
any
review
of
independent
variables
they
discussed
crime
patterns
endlessly
each
week
with
rarely
any
evidence
on
policing
since
then
technologies
such
as
gps
have
made
such
measurement
even
easier
all
that
is
required
is
a
commitment
to
tracking
policing
along
with
crime
and
an
investment
in
information
technology
to
produce
the
data
and
graphics
mapping
police
presence
in
relation
to
crime
harm
for
example
would
produce
an
algorithm
that
could
identify
outliers
wherever
a
patrol
district
deployed
its
patrols
or
arrests
in
too
great
a
departure
from
the
occurrence
of
crime
a
list
of
such
exceptions
can
be
generated
for
police
managers
if
they
fail
to
correct
the
discrepancies
the
lists
can
be
reviewed
in
aggregate
at
compstat
meetings
comparing
police
performance
one
reason
police
activity
is
undermeasured
may
be
the
risk
of
making
inappropriate
comparisons
with
disciplinary
implications
the
number
of
arrests
per
officer
for
example
is
likely
to
be
much
higher
in
certain
areas
than
in
others
if
only
because
there
is
more
crime
per
square
foot
in
some
areas
yet
there
are
many
ways
to
adjust
for
these
differences
in
order
to
create
fair
comparisons
across
officers
and
units
the
critical
tool
for
fair
comparisons
is
a
risk
model
for
each
policing
area
such
a
model
can
be
computed
on
the
basis
of
any
large
sample
such
as
the
hundreds
of
local
policing
areas
in
england
and
wales
the
models
can
address
both
police
outputs
and
outcomes
using
social
economic
and
demographic
data
the
models
can
forecast
how
much
work
police
will
be
asked
to
do
reactively
by
citizens
and
how
much
work
they
may
choose
to
initiate
proactively
in
relation
to
social
conditions
the
models
can
estimate
how
many
calls
will
be
dispatched
how
many
arrests
may
be
made
and
even
how
much
force
police
will
use
with
how
much
injury
to
citizens
and
police
once
a
risk
model
is
found
to
be
reliable
in
forecasting
outputs
or
outcomes
it
can
detect
major
changes
in
delivery
of
those
measures
over
what
was
predicted
if
police
produce
more
proactive
work
than
predicted
or
less
the
model
can
say
so
this
could
be
done
in
a
way
that
could
confirm
or
disprove
the
success
of
an
area
commander
in
delivering
specific
changes
in
police
patrols
arrests
problems
solved
or
any
objective
for
police
outputs
the
greatest
benefit
of
a
fair
comparisons
model
would
be
to
link
changes
in
outputs
to
changes
in
crime
harm
chi
within
a
range
of
error
these
models
can
forecast
the
likely
chi
or
chi
per
capita
in
each
area
for
each
year
if
a
change
in
outputs
appears
linked
to
changes
in
chi
outcomes
then
police
leaders
can
begin
to
develop
skill
in
relating
these
two
tools
at
a
strategic
level
in
contrast
if
there
is
no
change
in
outputs
but
the
chi
gets
worse
that
can
be
taken
as
evidence
of
sudden
changes
in
social
conditions
rather
than
as
a
failure
of
policing
if
police
outputs
worsen
and
the
chi
rises
that
can
be
taken
as
evidence
that
police
failures
actually
caused
an
increase
in
harm
this
kind
of
macro
level
strategic
management
is
already
the
substance
of
discussion
in
many
compstat
meetings
what
it
lacks
is
any
kind
of
evidence
base
there
are
a
few
published
studies
for
example
of
the
effect
of
the
ratio
of
arrests
to
crime
output
on
crime
rates
outcome
themselves
tittle
and
rowe
brown
chamlin
but
they
would
quickly
be
replaced
by
current
studies
within
large
police
agencies
better
evidence
could
lead
to
better
strategic
decisions
with
less
crime
harm
as
a
result
delivering
policing
with
evidence
based
management
the
greatest
value
of
measuring
police
performance
comes
from
leaders
taking
immediate
corrective
action
all
too
often
police
leaders
are
flying
blind
about
whether
policies
or
operations
are
being
implemented
tracking
evidence
provides
independent
audits
on
a
timely
basis
about
whether
the
plans
are
being
delivered
if
they
are
not
then
commanders
can
be
transferred
and
tighter
control
can
be
imposed
if
they
are
then
rewards
can
be
given
and
medals
can
be
pinned
the
use
of
tracking
to
focus
on
implementation
can
have
major
consequences
for
example
there
is
much
controversy
about
whether
stop
and
questioning
in
minority
areas
reduces
crime
by
using
tracking
evidence
for
deciding
whether
stop
and
question
has
been
reducing
robberies
in
minority
group
areas
a
police
leader
can
ask
to
have
stop
and
question
encounters
plotted
against
robberies
if
the
answer
is
that
very
few
stops
have
actually
been
done
the
leader
can
take
stronger
action
to
ensure
that
the
policy
is
carried
out
if
the
policy
has
been
delivered
the
leader
can
ask
what
level
of
crime
reduction
is
needed
to
be
cost
effective
at
the
same
time
tracking
may
raise
the
question
of
police
legitimacy
are
complaints
up
since
stops
have
increased
are
public
surveys
needed
should
people
who
have
been
stopped
be
interviewed
to
assess
their
reactions
should
training
be
refreshed
on
how
to
speak
to
suspects
tracking
can
often
raise
questions
that
would
otherwise
never
be
asked
asking
them
could
in
turn
substantially
improve
service
delivery
tracking
methods
can
even
be
subjected
to
testing
for
outcomes
in
a
dallas
experiment
for
example
weisburd
groff
and
yang
randomly
assigned
gps
information
to
some
middle
managers
and
not
others
showing
how
much
time
officers
were
spending
in
their
assigned
hot
spots
the
experiment
suggested
that
the
assignment
of
that
information
led
to
less
crime
in
the
high
crime
hot
spots
other
experiments
with
tracking
systems
could
profitably
use
similar
designs
across
police
districts
across
patrol
beats
or
even
in
large
police
agencies
such
as
india
s
or
chile
s
with
hundreds
of
police
stations
across
police
districts
themselves
e
connecting
the
three
ts
thinking
of
triple
t
as
a
triangle
may
allow
police
leaders
to
think
about
evidence
in
a
more
integrated
way
agencies
can
use
the
triangle
to
design
checklists
of
all
the
numbers
that
must
be
examined
simultaneously
in
ebp
like
the
pilots
who
look
at
all
the
dials
on
the
dashboard
of
a
b
cockpit
police
leaders
must
be
aware
of
multiple
sources
of
threat
to
smooth
performance
when
all
three
ts
are
able
to
be
seen
at
once
the
combined
triple
t
can
become
a
dynamic
process
targets
can
be
adjusted
as
crime
goes
down
on
some
targets
and
rises
on
others
tested
treatments
can
change
as
the
types
of
targets
shift
and
tracking
may
look
at
different
delivery
indicators
as
both
targets
and
practices
shift
fig
no
police
agency
stands
still
for
a

let

triple

for

the

be
the
best
response
to
a

to

quantitatively
derived
conclusions
are
often
hard
to
sell
when
the
conclusion
directly
challenges
conventional
thinking
acceptance
of
evidence
requires
nothing
less
than
a
culture
change
this
phenomenon
has
been
observed
repeatedly
in
medicine
giluk
and
rynes
weller
baseball
lewis
and
politics
issenberg
yet
these
cases
also
offer
much
hope
that
experience
and
evidence
can
work
together
silver
chap
that
is
what
can
happen
to
make
culture
change
more
likely
to
succeed
the
open
window
may
be
a
need
to
cut
budgets
and
to
do
more
with
less
by
connecting
policy
decisions
on
tested
services
with
policy
decisions
on
what
to
target
police
leaders
can
develop
a
clear
dialogue
about
hard
choices
operational
police
may
accuse
them
of
robbing
peter
to
pay
paul
as
if
all
priorities
are
of
equal
importance
but
the
use
of
evidence
to
make
those
decisions
can
disprove
that
claim
by
combining
the
seriousness
of
the
harm
being
targeted
with
the
effectiveness
of
the
police
practice
being
considered
for
a
target
police
leaders
can
compare
two
different
choices
for
their
likely
cost
benefit
ratios
if
spending
can
yield
a
percent
reduction
in
the
harm
of
a
robbery
pattern
but
only
a
percent
reduction
in
the
harm
of
a
burglary
pattern
the
better
choice
may
seem
obvious
it
is
not
the
key
evidence
in
such
a
choice
would
be
the
absolute
levels
of
harm
associated
with
the
burglary
pattern
and
the
robbery
pattern
creating
or
using
such
a
metric
is
not
routinely
done
in
ebp
yet
but
it
could
be
the
key
to
pulling
triple
t
into
a
viable
operating
system
that
key
is
the
idea
of
a
crime
harm
index
which
may
ultimately
be
the
key
to
sustaining
ebp
iv
future

for

in

the
best
way
to

your
future
is
to
create
it
attributed
to
abraham
lincoln
by
more
people
than
ever
before
were
trying
to
create
the
future
of
evidence
based
policing
the
society
of
evidence
based
policing
had
over
members
the
new
professional
college
of
policing
had
a
mandate
from
the
uk
government
to
develop
and
share
evidence
on
what
works
in
policing
the
george
mason
university
center
for
evidence
based
crime
policy
joined
with
the
scottish
institute
of
police
research
to
communicate
ebp
to
policy
makers
in
washington
newly
elected
police
and
crime
commissioners
in
england
and
wales
organized
an
all
day
seminar
at
cambridge
university
to
gain
an
introduction
to
the
evidence
on
policing
over
percent
of
senior
leaders
at
scotland
yard
said
they
had
at
least
heard
of
ebp
stanko
yet
the
same
study
at
scotland
yard
found
that
percent
of
its
leaders
said
they
would
not
change
a
policy
if
the
evidence
showed
it
did
not
work
stanko
many
if
not
most
operational
police
officers
remained
skeptical
that
research
could
help
improve
policing
laws
in
the
majority
of
us
states
as
of
still
required
police
to
make
arrests
when
evidence
shows
that
they
would
only
increase
crime
rather
than
prevent
it
sherman
a
evidence
based
policing
in
still
had
a
long
way
to
go
as
kahneman
and
others
have
documented
our
intuitive
preference
for
fast
thinking
with
an
emotional
system
i
will
always
cause
resistance
to
conclusions
based
on
more
comprehensive
slow
thinking
by
our
system
ii
reasoning
which
system
will
win
depends
on
a
larger
cultural
struggle
for
the
branding
of
policing
as
a
complex
profession
for
those
who
take
lincoln
s
advice
seriously
it
may
be
useful
to
suggest
ways
to
create
a
stronger
future
for
using
evidence
in
policing
the
suggestions
are
speculations
informed
by
a
deep
engagement
in
the
context
the
kind
of
experience
that
is
essential
for
making
the
best
use
of
evidence
the
suggestions
aim
at
institutional
decisions
as
the
outcomes
but
they
are
also
aimed
at
the
individuals
whose
actions
can
make
institutions
change
their
policies
the
key
institutions
are
the
college
of
policing
in
the
united
kingdom
the
state
police
officer
standards
and
training
boards
in
the
united
states
the
australian
institute
for
police
management
and
the
australia
new
zealand
policing
advisory
agency
these
are
all
professionally
driven
institutions
with
governmental
funding
capable
of
making
substantial
changes
in
the
incentives
and
organizational
culture
for
better
use
of
research
evidence
until
recently
they
were
largely
unconnected
to
the
academic
community
but
the
invention
of
a
new
professional
body
in
the
cradle
of
anglo
celtic
policing
is
committed
to
forging
that
connection
with
a
working
agenda
for
police
university
relationships
it
is
not
impossible
that
professional
bodies
in
other
countries
may
follow
suit
unless
otherwise
indicated
each
suggestion
below
is
aimed
at
the
institutions
named
above
a
graduate
level
education
in
evidence
based
policing
should
be
required
for
all
chief
police
executives
starting
at
the
top
is
a
path
of
least
resistance
from
police
labor
organizations
and
an
ideal
first
step
toward
a
total
evidence
strategy
of
the
kind
scotland
yard
has
adopted
police
commissioner
sir
bernard
hogan
howe
who
approved
that
plan
not
only
has
a
master
of
business
administration
and
a
law
degree
but
also
completed
the
graduate
level
cambridge
police
executive
programme
that
teaches
evidence
in
policing
a
graduate
level
knowledge
of
evidence
based
policing
should
be
required
for
all
police
managers
at
ranks
equivalent
to
chief
inspectors
in
uk
policing
and
captains
in
the
new
york
or
los
angeles
police
an
early
second
step
toward
a
culture
of
evidence
in
policing
would
be
to
focus
ambitious
officers
on
the
first
major
step
to
police
command
knowing
that
research
evidence
is
constantly
growing
could
foster
a
habit
of
keeping
up
a
habit
that
may
continue
even
after
completing
a
degree
or
taking
an
exam
or
doing
whatever
is
established
as
the
requirement
for
promotion
to
that
level
most
important
may
be
the
substantial
impact
this
requirement
would
have
on
the
demand
for
graduate
education
promotion
to
first
line
supervision
e
g
sergeant
should
be
based
in
equal
parts
on
knowledge
of
the
law
and
of
the
evidence
on
what
works
in
policing
perhaps
some
time
after
the
first
two
suggestions
are
adopted
a
cultural
familiarity
with
ebp
will
ease
a
transition
to
changing
the
content
of
promotional
examinations
once
knowledge
of
evidence
becomes
essential
for
any
promotion
at
all
in
policing
it
will
greatly
broaden
the
incentive
to
study
evidence
and
use
it
in
police
operational
decisions
research
could
even
be
cited
in
arrest
reports
and
court
testimony
thereby
promoting
a
stronger
public
image
of
the
complex
knowledge
police
must
master
completion
of
probation
at
the
end
of
police
recruit
training
should
be
based
on
an
examination
that
includes
equal
parts
on
knowledge
of
the
law
and
of
the
evidence
on
what
works
in
policing
once
ebp
becomes
an
expected
part
of
promotional
examinations
it
will
be
less
difficult
to
add
it
to
the
final
requirement
for
permanent
police
officer
status
if
that
concept
itself
survives
it
will
also
enhance
the
use
of
evidence
in
police
operations
since
officers
at
all
rank
levels
would
then
be
tested
on
their
knowledge
it
would
also
mean
that
research
evidence
would
have
to
be
taught
in
police
recruit
schools
police
professionals
at
all
ranks
should
be
able
to
achieve
international
certification
of
advanced
knowledge
by
an
exam
based
fellowship
of
the
college
of
policing
to
be
designated
an
fcp
the
practice
of
advanced
testing
of
highly
skilled
practitioners
is
well
established
in
medicine
and
other
professions
us
doctors
have
an
equivalent
process
of
becoming
board
certified
since
the
sixteenth
century
british
professional
colleges
have
been
administering
such
examinations
and
certifying
knowledge
for
people
from
all
over
the
world
online
educational
preparation
will
make
such
examinations
even
easier
to
pass
providing
free
access
to
knowledge
worldwide
universities
should
create
faculties
of
policing
that
would
eventually
operate
like
medical
schools
the
growth
of
demand
for
police
evidence
requires
far
greater
commitment
by
universities
to
this
kind
of
public
service
the
rise
of
pracademics
makes
it
even
more
important
since
the
technical
support
they
need
to
do
experiments
at
a
high
standard
will
grow
rapidly
academic
positions
in
faculties
of
policing
should
include
clinical
lectureships
and
professorships
modeled
on
those
in
medical
schools
in
which
academics
split
their
time
equally
between
working
on
police
operational
matters
and
teaching
research
activity
in
the
university
by
investing
in
partial
funding
of
clinical
professorships
police
agencies
or
the
institutions
named
above
could
speed
up
the
process
of
creating
more
police
faculties
promotion
to
senior
police
posts
as
with
senior
medical
positions
should
require
demonstrated
achievements
in
research
and
teaching
within
the
profession
this
suggestion
builds
on
the
recommendations
of
the
uk
home
secretary
may
it
could
be
achieved
with
evidence
of
publications
in
peer
reviewed
journals
or
teaching
in
university
faculties
or
police
training
institutions
the
college
of
policing
uk
should
create
a
global
example
of
a
process
for
approving
and
recommending
evidence
based
police
practices
engaging
police
leaders
at
all
ranks
with
researchers
victims
and
others
affected
by
police
policies
in
deciding
what
works
when
and
for
whom
the
transparency
of
evidence
is
a
hallmark
of
science
just
as
openness
to
public
demands
is
a
hallmark
of
policing
the
model
of
the
process
used
by
the
united
kingdom
s
national
institute
for
health
and
clinical
evidence
is
one
that
can
be
widely
adopted
sherman
every
nation
should
develop
its
own
inventory
of
evidence
based
practices
based
on
its
own
domestic
police
research
international
research
approved
practices
of
the
college
of
policing
and
a
list
of
similar
institutions
in
other
nations
once
a
process
is
adopted
to
review
evidence
for
policy
decisions
the
dearth
of
such
evidence
in
most
countries
will
become
clear
there
is
no
point
in
american
police
research
providing
the
only
evidence
for
policing
in
new
zealand
india
or
hong
kong
each
and
every
country
may
have
its
own
social
and
cultural
context
that
affects
the
transportability
of
evidence
of
what
works
the
only
way
to
be
certain
of
how
police
practices
work
in
each
country
is
to
test
those
practices
in
that
country
since
the
twenty
first
century
began
the
pace
at
which
police
use
evidence
has
grown
geometrically
that
pace
could
still
slow
reverse
or
be
crippled
by
a
hijacking
of
the
meaning
of
evidence
in
police
practice
but
if
even
half
the
suggestions
offered
here
are
adopted
evidence
based
policing
will
continue
to
grow
that
trend
may
ultimately
provide
many
tangible
benefits
to
police
officers
making
their
work
more
legitimate
and
meaningful
a
majority
of
neither
police
nor
the
public
may
ever
accept
or
even
understand
the
benefits
of
evidence
but
popularity
is
not
the
right
test
for
the
success
of
ebp
the
sole
test
is
whether
it
benefits
the
public
all
the
evidence
suggests
that
it
will
appendix
the
resources
for
locating
external
tests
of
police
services
are
growing
rapidly
in
the
past
decade
the
campbell
collaboration
hosted
by
the
norwegian
government
has
completed
over
systematic
reviews
of
multiple
tests
of
practices
relevant
to
crime
and
policing
a
systematic
review
in
this
context
is
a
comprehensive
inventory
of
all
possible
tests
of
a
specific
practice
which
then
examines
the
pattern
of
results
to
conclude
whether
the
program
is
effective
where
it
has
already
been
tested
the
results
in
other
countries
do
not
necessarily
predict
results
in
all
countries
but
the
information
in
these
reviews
is
highly
detailed
reporting
exactly
where
the
tests
were
done
and
how
reviews
are
in
pdf
files
that
can
be
downloaded
for
free
from

the

a
supervising

pulls
up
a

sgt
bryan
clenna
of
the
city
s
west
precinct
said
instead
of
driving
around
like
drone
bees
predictive
policing
programs
like
this
one
used
for
now
only
for
property
crimes
are
a
harbinger
of
how
for
better
or
worse
police
officers
across
the
country
are
relying
on
the
data
analytics
business
seattle
is
at
the
center
of
this
experiment
the
city
s
license
plate
readers
record
the
movement
of
vehicles
information
that
is
then
stored
in
a
vast
database
to
be
tapped
later
in
criminal
investigations
its
red
light
cameras
record
traffic
violations
and
issue
tickets
though
unlike
many
other
municipalities
seattle
requires
a
police
officer
to
vet
each
citation
the
police
department
uses
twitter
that
rushing
stream
of
data
as
its
crime
blotter
letting
residents
report
possible
crimes
in
their
neighborhoods
and
starting
in
july
the
seattle
police
will
use
a
similar
software
program
to
predict
where
gun
violence
is
likely
to
occur
the
department
even
procured
an
unmanned
drone
equipped
with
a
video
camera
to
take
aerial
shots
but
the
plan
was
halted
after
residents
raised
concerns
about
privacy
where
technology
has
caught
up
is
to
allow
police
to
ask
questions
about
what
s
happening
in
their
jurisdictions
and
to
be
able
to
understand
temporal
patterns
spatial
patterns
said
joel
m
caplan
assistant
professor
of
criminal
justice
at
rutgers
university
in
new
jersey
who
has
developed
a
crime
forecasting
program
with
his
colleagues
and
is
testing
it
at
a
half
dozen
police
agencies
critics
say
that
surveillance
technologies
carry
risks
to
civil
liberties
and
that
predictive
policing
in
particular
can
additionally
perpetuate
a
self
fulfilling
cycle
of
bias
that
is
to
say
an
area
with
historically
high
rates
of
crime
gets
greater
police
attention
which
results
in
more
arrests
which
in
turn
the
algorithm
uses
to
deem
that
neighborhood
an
area
where
crime
is
more
likely
to
occur
it
comes
with
inherent
biases
and
prejudices
that
can
be
worse
than
the
help
it
offers
said
jason
m
schultz
who
studies
the
privacy
implications
of
new
technologies
at
the
school
of
law
at
the
university
of
california
berkeley
it
kind
of
reinforces
its
own
data
by
redirecting
resources
to
those
areas
because
predictive
policing
is
still
in
its
infancy
there
is
little
independent
evidence
to
suggest
whether
data
mining
in
law
enforcement
is
really
effective
but
for
companies
that
make
the
analytics
tools
it
is
already
a
large
and
fast
growing
market
for
instance
i
b
m
which
has
spent
billions
of
dollars
in
the
last
year
acquiring
analytics
start
ups
offers
a
software
package
of
its
own
for
predictive
policing
its
social
media
analytics
tool
can
be
used
by
police
agencies
to
vet
facebook
and
twitter
chatter
and
its
coplink
software
allows
one
investigating
police
agency
to
mine
another
s
crime
data
to
track
down
a
wanted
person
police
officials
in
mesa
ariz
said
they
used
this
technology
to
find
a
man
suspected
of
murder
who
was
picked
up
for
jaywalking
hundreds
of
miles
away
microsoft
teamed
up
with
the
new
york
police
department
to
develop
one
of
the
most
ambitious
crime
analytics
tools
in
the
world
known
as
the
domain
awareness
system
it
can
analyze
video
from
the
more
than
police
surveillance
cameras
across
the
city
and
comb
through
a
variety
of
other
databases
from
license
plate
readers
to
sensors
that
can
pick
up
heightened
radiation
levels
to
arrest
records
in
announcing
the
program
last
august
the
police
said
it
could
for
instance
find
a
car
associated
with
a
possible
crime
or
lawbreaker
and
analyze
where
that
car
had
been
seen
over
the
last
several
weeks
law
enforcement
agencies
especially
gang
units
mine
social
networks
like
facebook
and
twitter
to
gather
intelligence
on
criminal
networks
the
department
of
homeland
security
uses
an
analytics
tool
that
combs
through
twitter
for
key
words
that
might
signal
trouble
the
list
includes
pipe
bomb
plume
and
listeria
seattle
s
predictive
policing
program
grew
out
of
an
earlier
experiment
in
data
analytics
it
began
with
a
software
program
that
culled
calls
from
the
previous
week
identified
crime
hot
spots
and
assigned
officers
to
patrol
each
one
for
at
least
minutes
every
hour
not
all
calls
turn
out
to
be
about
criminal
activity
though
and
the
department
cut
back
on
the
practice
of
these
so
called
directed
patrols
earlier
this
year
seattle
bought
a
new
software
package
known
as
predpol
short
for
predictive
policing
and
developed
by
academics
at
the
university
of
california
los
angeles
it
initially
deployed
the
software
in
two
precincts
and
in
may
announced
its
expansion
citywide
acting
lt
bryan
grenon
said
it
was
too
early
to
know
whether
it
was
working
in
any
case
property
crimes
have
plummeted
in
seattle
in
the
last
year
by
as
much
as
percent
predpol
according
to
p
jeffrey
brantingham
a
u
c
l
a
anthropologist
who
helped
develop
it
does
not
rely
just
on
the
previous
day
or
previous
week
s
incidents
it
looks
at
both
short
term
and
long
term
patterns
in
property
crimes
he
said
and
uses
a
proprietary
algorithm
to
weigh
their
relative
importance
and
forecast
risk
in
the
next
few
hours
it
has
been
used
by
other
police
agencies
including
those
in
los
angeles
and
santa
cruz
it
has
not
been
independently
tested
sometimes
his
algorithm
has
a
pretty
good
idea
of
where
someone
might
cause
trouble
but
not
necessarily
what
kind
in
late
may
sergeant
clenna
recalled
the
predpol
map
divined
danger
in
a
tiny
patch
of
downtown
that
is
dotted
with
liquor
stores
and
loiterers
sure
enough
there
was
a
robbery
right
there
though
not
one
that
a
computer
program
could
have
predicted
a
thief
walked
into
a
chinese
restaurant
and
made
off
with
a

said
during

last

there
was
a

reduction
in
robbery
aggravated
assault
burglary
and

theft
and
for

in

we
saw
fewer

homicides
he
added
police

charlie
beck
said
the
violent

recorded
in

an

slide
from
the
year
before
statistics
showed
significant
decreases
in

and

offset
increases
in

and

is

lowest
violent
crime
level
in
the
city
of
los
angeles
since
william
parker
was
chief
of
the
lapd
in
the
s
and
s
beck
said
he
added
a
percent
drop
in
gang
related
crimes
overall
helped
drive
the
numbers
down
noting
the
gang
related
homicides
last
year
were
the
fewest
in
decades
the
city
however
saw
property
crimes
increase
for
the
first
time
in
years
though
by
only
percent
for
a
total
of
thefts
burglaries
and
carjackings
beck
blamed
the
uptick
on
a
percent
increase
in
cellphone
thefts
in
particular
and
he
urged
the
public
to
take
precautions
to
prevent
their
various
electronic
gadgets
from
being
stolen
lock
it
hide
it
and
you
ll
keep
it
he
advised
put
the
responsibility
on
yourself
for
keeping
your
property
safe
if
you
do
that
then
i
can
continue
to
reduce
crime
in
the
city
of
los
angeles
beck
also
attributed
some
of
the
increase
in
property
crime
to
realignment
which
took
effect
in
october
that
law
backed
by
gov
jerry
brown
included
a
provision
that
placed
certain
ex
cons
on
probation
instead
of
parole
when
realignment
was
originally
announced
i
predicted
property
crime
would
increase
in
los
angeles
by
a
couple
of
percentage
points
because
of
it
and
i
believe
that
has
occurred
he
said
calling
for
the
law
to
be
tweaked
so
that
police
can
monitor
ex
cons
more
closely
taken
together
the
overall
drop
in
violent
crimes
and
property
crimes
in
was
percent
the
smallest
percentage
decline
in
the
last
five
years
in
during
the
recession
overall
crimes
receded
percent
in
the
drop
was
percent
beck
however
bristled
at
the
observation
that
last
year
s
percent
drop
in
the
overall
crime
rate
did
not
seem
up
to
par
you
re
minimizing
something
that
is
a
remarkable
achievement
he
said
why
don
t
you
ask
the
other
cities
that
had
an
increase
why
don
t
you
ask
new
york
chicago
the
county
of
los
angeles
if
they
would
like
to
have
percent
villaraigosa
whose
term
ends
in
june
said
he
hopes
the
incoming
mayor
whoever
it
may
be
will
make
the
continued
hiring
of
police
officers
a
priority
he
said
the
lapd
recently
hit
a
milestone
when
its
ranks
swelled
to
but
added
los
angeles
remains
the
most
underpoliced
big
city
in
the
country
he
refused
to
back
a
proposed
ballot
measure
to
boost
the
sales
tax
if
the
lapd
is
not
allowed
to
continue
growing
there
is
no
way
i
would
support
a
sales
tax
if
we
don
t
continue
police
hiring
villaraigosa
said
these
numbers
the
declining
crime
rates
don
t
lie
he
added
these
numbers
are
a
reflection
of
growing
our
police
department
of
our
commitment
to
community
policing
beck
vowed
the
lapd
would
continue
to
lower
crime
rates
by
remaining
data
driven
in
its
crime
suppression
strategies
and
by
working
closely
with
the
mayor
s
gang
reduction
and
youth
development
office
he
also
vowed
to
expand
predictive
policing
which
uses
logarithms
to
predict
where
crime
will
occur
and
to
control
the
response
of
officers
as
well
as
more
officers
long
term
to
the
toughest
parts
of
the
city
so
they
can
form
deep
partnerships
with
the
communities
there
he
also
intends
to
continue
operation
ceasefire
which
calls
for
talking
to
gang
members
so
they
know
the
consequences
of
continued
violent
crimes
and
operation
laser
which
closely
tracks
people
who
have
committed
violent
crimes
in
the
past
and
are
likely
to
do
so

santa

on

day
meant
to
introduce
residents
to

hot
spots
that
officers
check
in
their
down
time
santa
cruz
police
wednesday
arrested
a
man
on
beach
street
during
a
predictive
check
the
day
was
billed
as
international
predictive
policing
day
of
action
with
police
in
kent
england
and
los
angeles
sharing
locations
with
residents
to
try
to
increase
their
presence
on
the
street
and
hopefully
prevent
crime
near
beach
and
main
streets
about
a
m
police
apprehended
a
year
old
man
on
suspicion
of
being
drunk
in
public
and
carrying
a
concealed
knife
both
misdemeanors
police
said
it
was
a
small
illustration
of
the
idea
at
work
our
goal
today
is
not
to
arrest
a
lot
of
people
it
s
to
prevent
the
crime
from
happening
said
santa
cruz
police
chief
kevin
vogel
i
m
exceptionally
proud
that
we
were
the
first
ones
to
do
this
launched
in
the
program
essentially
uses
historical
data
of
the
time
and
location
of
burglaries
and
thefts
and
uses
an
algorithm
to
predict
future
crime
when
officers
are
not
responding
to
other
calls
they
are
asked
to
patrol
in
those
areas
wednesday
some
residents
gathered
at
places
such
as
lower
ocean
street
and
lincoln
and
chestnut
streets
which
were
predicted
to
have
a
higher
likelihood
of
burglary
vehicle
burglary
or
vehicle
theft
it
s
almost
like
neighborhood
watch
in
the
next
century
said
santa
cruz
deputy
police
chief
steve
clark
clark
said
police
have
not
tracked
the
number
of
arrests
that
have
come
from
the
extra
checks
as
police
often
call
them
yet
he
said
that
once
or
twice
a
week
an
officer
on
a
predictive
policing
check
has
either
talked
to
a
suspicious
person
received
information
on
another
case
or
made
an
arrest
the
arrests
have
not
been
associated
with
major
crimes
such
as
murders
or
robberies
but
they
have
helped
to
solve
burglaries
and
put
police
in
places
they
might
not
think
to
patrol
it
s
been
a
tool
that
officers
have
added
to
their
natural
intuition
clark
said
predictive
examples
one
night
in
for
instance
officers
were
on
an
extra
check
near
windham
street
when
they
talked
to
a
man
who
had
more
than
four
gps
units
on
him
no
one
s
that
lost
clark
said
through
more
investigation
we
wrapped
up
several
auto
burglary
cases
off
that
last
year
near
north
branciforte
and
goss
avenues
police
stopped
a
bicyclist
and
recognized
him
as
a
drug
user
he
wore
a
ncaa
basketball
ring
and
didn
t
look
like
a
basketball
player
police
later
linked
it
to
a
burglary
and
returned
it
clark
s
favorite
example
is
that
of
a
santa
cruz
beat
cop
who
was
eating
his
lunch
in
his
patrol
car
in
a
downtown
parking
lot
because
it
was
on
that
shift
s
predictive
list
he
spotted
two
women
trying
to
break
into
cars
and
arrested
them
for
neighborhood
leaders
like
deborah
elston
the
list
of
predictive
policing
addresses
distributed
to
neighbors
on
wednesday
were
not
a
big
surprise
they
included
five
areas
in
the
lower
ocean
street
neighborhood
as
well
as
the
block
of
beach
street
and
near
seabright
avenue
and
murray
street
elston
was
pleased
that
the
list
was
shared
with
neighbors
and
she
encouraged
residents
to
be
aware
of
suspicious
people
and
problems
like
graffiti
which
can
lead
to
more
crime
when
you
make
the
call
to
report
suspicious
activity
you
never
know
what
you
re
preventing
elston
said
although
many
factors
go
in
to
crime
trends
overall
reported
crime
dropped
more
than
percent
in
june
and
july
compared
with
june
and
july
according
to
police
for
instance
there
were
reported
burglaries
in
the
city
in
july
down
from
in
july
elston
said
she
understood
it
might
be
difficult
to
quantify
the
success
of
predictive
policing
because
crime
could
have
been
prevented
by
the
presence
of
an
officer
or
neighbor
the
person
trying
door
handles
on
cars
to
steal
things
might
have
gone
elsewhere
for
instance
yet
she
said
that
twice
in
the
first
few
months
of
the
predictive
program
she
had
her
cellphone
out
to
call
for
a
suspicious
person
when
an
officer
on
an
extra
check
arrived
one
time
was
on
the
san
lorenzo
river
levee
when
an
officer
rolled
up
to
her

they

then
each

is
a

a
simple
a

warm
from
an
office
printer
they
don

look
like
much
but
the
maps
are
the
result
of
more
than
half
a
decade

work
by
anthropologists

from

marked

the
predictive

project
or
pred
pol
as
it
has
become
known
has
been
so
successful
in
cutting
crime
rates
since
it
was
tested
in
foothill
in
that
it
has
spread
to
seven
other
la
police
divisions
with
more
to
come
twenty
or
so
police
departments
across
the
us
have
signed
on
as
have
departments
in

it
is
understood
at
least
one
australian
force
is
in
talks
to
sign
up
a
driving
force
behind
pred
pol
is
dr
jeff
brantingham
an
anthropologist
at
the
university
of
california
los
angeles
ucla
the
standard
measure
of
accuracy
for
crime
prediction
is
he
says
multiplications
of
random
existing
techniques
are
usually
effective
about
three
times
random
pred
pol
is
twice
as
effective
accurate
to
six
times
random
and
it
is
likely
to
improve
brantingham
says
the
key
insight
that
informed
early
work
on
pred
pol
was
to
tackle
crime
prediction
via
mathematics
rather
than
the
social
sciences
usually
crime
analysts
look
at
crime
patterns
with
social
and
geographical
factors
they
would
look
at
a
particular
area
s
crime
history
demographic
make
up
the
location
of
transport
and
late
opening
bars
pred
pol
strips
all
that
away
it
simply
feeds
three
different
factors
crime
type
time
and
location
through
the
dizzyingly
sophisticated
equations
and
algorithms
the
team
has
created
the
problem
with
considering
how
many
open
bars
there
are
is
that
it
misses
the
point
brantingham
says
the
key
information
is
the
number
of
assaults
or
robberies
and
you
already
know
that
the
team
began
in
by
considering
crime
through
a
spatial
rather
than
social
lens
if
you
consider
a
potential
criminal
and
a
potential
target
to
be
atoms
floating
in
a
body
of
fluid
what
factors
would
cause
them
to
meet
and
how
and
when
and
what
other
factors
might
interrupt
that
meeting
working
with
brantingham
ucla
s
applied
mathematics
department
began
investigating
models
that
described
events
such
as
chemical
reactions
and
the
way
substances
diffuse
in
fluid
even
fish
migration
predictions
were
discussed
soon
the
los
angeles
police
had
become
involved
brantingham
had
asked
for
access
to
crime
data
and
had
feared
he
might
be
met
with
suspicion
instead
the
department
threw
itself
into
the
project
at
the
time
the
police
suffered
from
an
awkward
problem
crime
was
falling
across
the
city
and
had
been
for
a
few
years
the
city
that
had
registered
murders
in
a
single
year
two
decades
ago
lost
just
of
its
citizens
to
violence
in
when
it
became
the
safest
big
city
in
the
us
this
was
good
news
for
citizens
but
it
meant
innovation
was
needed
to
keep
up
the
momentum
then
police
chief
william
bratton
supplied
the
ucla
team
with
data
and
funding
and
assigned
one
of
his
captains
sean
malinowski
to
work
with
them
whenever
anyone
starts
talking
about
data
i
tend
to
get
the
mission
says
malinowski
who
has
a
phd
in
public
policy
the
next
breakthrough
came
when
brantingham
s
collaborator
dr
george
mohler
now
an
assistant
professor
of
mathematics
and
computer
science
at
santa
clara
university
discovered
that
equations
used
in
mapping
the
aftershocks
of
earthquakes
could
be
manipulated
to
map
crime
mohler
s
discovery
had
the
dramatic
effect
of
allowing
the
team
to
quickly
apply
their
theory
and
create
a
working
model
of
pred
pol
before
each
hour
shift
or
watch
begins
in
foothill
a
senior
officer
logs
in
to
pred
pol
and
calls
up
the
maps
for
the
coming
hours
on
a
desktop
computer
recent
and
historical
crime
data
are
run
through
pred
pol
which
prints
out
that
shift
s
crime
boxes
neatly
on
a
google
map
so
far
the
system
predicts
and
maps
only
car
theft
burglary
from
a
car
and
burglary
because
these
constitute
more
than
per
cent
of
crime
the
team
is
working
to
expand
into
gun
crime
and
homicide
in
the
long
run
it
is
feasible
that
the
technology
could
allow
police
to
enter
the
time
and
location
suspects
are
seen
on
the
street
and
instantly
be
fed
background
material
such
as
likely
gang
membership
while
the
science
is
high
tech
andrea
bertozzi
ucla
s
head
of
applied
maths
and
the
lead
mathematician
on
pred
pol
says
the
folded
piece
of
paper
handed
to
officers
is
good
technology
for
its
purpose
when
police
on
patrol
have
time
to
spare
they
are
directed
to
spend
time
in
their
allocated
boxes
the
beauty
is
the
simplicity
they
are
not
distracted
by
interacting
with
new
technology
or
equipment
police
report
that
once
in
their
boxes
they
find
themselves
hyper
alert
malinowski
says
they
take
note
of
who
is
around
they
talk
to
shopkeepers
and
home
owners
they
check
on
suspicious
activity
their
goal
in
the
boxes
is
not
so
much
to
catch
crooks
though
that
has
happened
but
to
suppress
crime
in
a
six
month
test
in
foothill
when
the
division
used
pred
pol
strictly
that
is
pred
pol
alone
was
used
for
crime
prediction
rather
than
in
concert
with
the
department
s
analysts
crime
rates
dropped
by
per
cent
overall
and
per
cent
for
car
theft
in
a
later
six
month
period
when
other
intelligence
types
were
used
crime
rates
rose
he
says
the
results
are
so
dramatic
that
the
force
s
chief
charlie
beck
is
backing
further
research
not
only
to
refine
the
technology
but
to
push
it
into
new
crime
areas
in
effect
malinowski
says
beck
has
so
much
confidence
in
the
model
he
is
allowing
the
researchers
to
use
parts
of
the
city
as
a
laboratory
to
study
crime
prediction

founder
jeffrey
brantingham
a
ucla
anthropology
professor
this
is
a
way
of
using
the
data
that
the
police
department
already
have
about
where
and
when
crimes
are
occurring
to
essentially
forecast
when
and
where
future
crimes
are
expected
to
occur
predpol
crunches
about
five
years
of
law
breaking
data
to
map
probable
crime
spots
this
policing
algorithm
has
become
a
practical
tool
only
in
the
last
two
years
although
it
has
been
in
development
for
the
last
seven
years
brantingham
said
places
such
as
seattle
and
santa
cruz
already
use
it
and
data
show
that
law
enforcement
officers
perform
six
times
better
when
they
use
predpol
brantingham
said
but
he
emphasized
the
software
is
a
tool
that
is
ineffective
without
skillful
officers
and
the
preemptive
program
does
not
ask
agencies
to
allocate
all
of
their
officers
in
one
neighborhood
while
abandoning
another
because
alhambra
implemented
the
program
about
five
months
ago
police
chief
mark
yokoyama
said
it
s
a
little
too
early
to
see
its
impact
however
when
he
compared
numbers
from
yokoyama
noted
that
residential
theft
has
decreased
by
percent
car
burglaries
by
percent
and
grand
theft
auto
by
percent
since
the
program
started
the
only
difference
between
this
year
and
last
year
is
utilizing
predpol
in
our
policing
strategies
yokoyama
said
at
a
m
and
p
m
daily
his
agency
prints
a
map
that
compares
the
most
up
to
date
crime
statistics
with
historic
figures
to
tell
police
what
by
square
feet
area
they
should
pay
attention
to
predpol
has
made
finding
criminals
easier
yokohama
said
but
he
doubts
the
higher
efficiency
will
lead
to
layoffs
within
his
department
we
still
rely
upon
our
police
officers
intuition
knowledge
and
personal
data
yokoyama
said
predpol
might
tell
us
here
s
an
area
to
focus
on
today
that
may
be
different
from
what
a
police
officer
knows
based
on
hot
spot
data
within
the
last
days
some
alhambra
residents
expressed
reservations
about
the
new
program
kelsea
perez
said
this
new
software
is
a
double
edged
sword
that
can
lead
to
discrimination
it
can
allow
for
the
homeless
who
live
in
this
area
to
be
pushed
away
perez
said
law
enforcement
s
goal
is
prevention
so
they
re
going
to
do
whatever
they
can
grinnell
almy
a
computer
programmer
who
works
in
alhambra
said
he
sees
the
possibility
of
targeting
ethnic
minorities
even
in
a
city
where
about
percent
of
residents
are
asian
whenever
you
use
technology
you
need
to
be
careful
to
guard
against
racial
profiling
he
said
anything
can
be
used
wrongly
you
have
to
be
aware
and
take
it
into
account
brantingham
said
predpol
doesn
t
profile
individuals
since
it
collects
data
only
on
where
and
when
a
type
of
crime
has
happened
it
doesn
t
target
offenders
races
or
the
poor
he
said
yokohama
said
preliminary
results
are
very
promising
and
he
doesn
t
see
any
negatives
in
using
predpol
using
the
software
as
a
guide
police
presence
has
been
increased
in
certain
areas
he
said
it
has
made
our
officers
more
visible
within
the
residential
areas
than
they
have
been
in
the
past
he
said
crime
prevention
is
what
we

section
local

until
its
most
recent
outbreak
of
shootings
and
three
homicides
in
days
salinas
was
on
track
for
the
lowest
level
of
gun
violence
since
shootings
peaked
in
police
say
they
are
frustrated
because
they
are
finally
armed
with
impressive
new
technology
for
predicting
where
and
when
violence
is
likely
to
occur
but
they
have
hardly
been
able
to
use
it
the
city
has
for
months
been
testing
a
predictive
policing
system
called
predpol
to
see
if
it
is
effective
in
forecasting
where
and
when
violent
crime
is
likely
to
occur
after
six
months
use
the
data
show
that
predpol
accurately
predicted
violent
crime
at
levels
percent
higher
than
the
previously
used
method
that
maps
high
crime
hot
spots
predpol
was
used
successfully
in
santa
cruz
county
to
predict
where
property
crimes
such
as
burglaries
are
likely
to
occur
but
until
salinas
agreed
to
try
it
the
system
hadn
t
been
used
to
predict
violent
crime
said
salinas
police
chief
kelly
mcmillin
after
salinas
detroit
adopted
the
system
to
try
to
predict
and
prevent
gun
violence
what
we
re
looking
for
is
a
net
reduction
in
violence
mcmillin
said
until
july
s
sudden
surge
a
summer
phenomenon
not
unusual
in
salinas
the
city
seemed
headed
in
that
direction
shootings
with
victims
until
july
totalled
putting
the
year
on
pace
for
an
annual
total
of
a
percent
drop
from
in
for
years
annual
shooting
counts
have
consistently
hovered
above
except
in
when
the
total
was
for
the
year
a
total
police
attribute
to
aggressive
use
the
year
before
of
the
ceasefire
intervention
strategy
and
police
roundups
such
as
operation
knockout
that
targeted
high
level
criminals
the
city
s
predictive
policing
tool
was
created
by
mathematicians
and
social
scientists
at
university
of
california
los
angeles
santa
clara
university
and
uc
irvine
who
worked
with
crime
analysts
and
officers
at
the
santa
cruz
and
los
angeles
police
departments
when
salinas
police
used
the
technology
between
august
and
february
violent
crime
was
accurately
predicted
percent
more
often
than
with
the
old
hot
spot
method
which
relies
only
on
mapping
past
crimes
robberies
were
correctly
predicted
percent
more
often
predpol
s
developers
say
the
technology
does
not
target
or
profile
specific
people
nor
does
it
simply
map
previous
crimes
it
does
study
patterns
demographics
and
other
data
to
produce
constantly
updated
place
based
prediction
boxes
that
salinas
police
review
before
starting
every
shift
but
for
the
system
to
be
effective
as
a
crime
prevention
tool
researchers
say
patrol
officers
should
spend
more
than
two
hours
of
every
hour
shift
in
the
areas
marked
by
the
highest
crime
prediction
boxes
salinas
officers
are
only
able
to
spend
about
six
minutes
per
shift
in
the
priority
boxed
areas
in
each
of
three
sections
of
the
city
mcmillin
said
that
undermines
the
purpose
of
the
technology
he
said
which
is
intended
to
prevent
new
crimes
from
occurring
salinas
officers
constantly
have
to
respond
to
calls
for
service
mcmillin
said
ninety
five
percent
of
what
we
do
is
reactive
analyzing
data
another
technology
unveiled
last
year
by
the
department
was
situation
awareness
hardware
and
software
that
helps
police
see
in
real
time
which
officers
are
in
the
area
where
they
re
headed
and
who
might
respond
to
a
crime
scene
the
department
is
still
working
on
deploying
that
technology
and
related
radio
based
gps
systems
with
the
help
of
the
naval
postgraduate
school
in
monterey
but
mcmillin
said
that
implementing
that
system
called
blue
force
tracking
is
not
high
on
his
priority
list
at
this
point
getting
more
patrols
on
the
streets
is
he
said
echoing
his
ongoing
pleas
for
funds
to
hire
more
officers
another
data
setback
came
last
year
when
the
department
lost
a
crime
analyst
it
had
just
hired
police
were
working
with
a
nonprofit
consultant
on
updating
the
city
s
problem
analysis
report
which
pulls
together
crime
statistics
social
factors
educational
levels
and
other
data
on
shooters
and
their
victims
one
such
report
for
revealed
some
eye
openers
about
local
crime
that
surprised
seasoned
crime
experts
here
and
in
other
areas
for
example
in
san
francisco
bay
area
cities
troubled
by
youth
violence
murder
victims
and
their
killers
were
much
more
likely
to
know
each
other
other
cities
shooters
also
had
longer
and
more
violent
crime
rap
sheets
compared
to
salinas
teenaged
assailants
who
often
had
no
criminal
records
before
going
after
their
victims
that
s
the
kind
of
information
that
if
updated
and
expanded
could
help
the
city
focus
its
violence
prevention
and
intervention
efforts
where
they
re
needed
most
mcmillin
said
his
department
has
found
an
analyst
who
passed
the
security
clearance
needed
to
process
crime
information
from
ongoing
investigations

the

at

police

s
foothill
division
begins
at

when
the

officers
gather
for

call
and
a
briefing
the
dozen
or
so
officers
file
into
the
roll
call
room
and
find
space
on
the
benches
they
are
briefed
on
incidents
from
the
previous
shift
and
on
any
offenders
or
vehicles
they
might
be
looking
for
then
before
they
hit
the
streets
each
team
is
a
handed
a
simple
a
map
warm
from
an
office
printer
it
doesn
t
look
like
much
but
the
maps
are
the
result
of
more
than
half
a
decade
s
work
by
anthropologists
and
pure
and
applied
mathematicians
from
two
leading
american
universities
funded
by
supporters
including
the

and

marked
on
the

are
a
series
of
little
red
boxes
outlining
metre
long
squares
superimposed
over
the
streets
they
will
patrol
through
the

the
boxes
indicate
with
spooky
accuracy
where
the
division
s
most
common
crimes
are
most
likely
to
be
committed
during
the
hour
shift
the
predictive
policing
project
or
pred
pol
as
it
has
become
known
has
been
so
successful
in
cutting
crime
rates
since
it
was
tested
in
foothill
in
that
it
has
spread
to
seven
other
la
police
divisions
with
more
to
come
another
or
so
police
departments
across
the
us
have
signed
on
as
have
departments
in
britain
it
is
understood
at
least
one
australian
force
is
in
talks
to
sign
up
though
its
creators
decline
to
discuss
potential
customers
one
of
the
driving
forces
behind
pred
pol
is
dr
jeff
brantingham
an
anthropologist
at
the
university
of
california
los
angeles
ucla
who
struggled
bravely
to
find
simple
enough
language
to
describe
the
science
behind
the
technology
crime
prediction
is
not
a
new
field
all
street
cops
know
the
crime
hot
spots
on
their
beat
and
larger
police
forces
have
been
employing
crime
analysts
and
software
to
assist
them
for
years
it
has
been
successful
too
the
standard
measure
of
accuracy
for
crime
prediction
is
multiplications
of
random
current
techniques
are
usually
effective
about
three
times
random
pred
pol
is
twice
as
effective
accurate
to
six
times
random
and
it
is
likely
to
improve
brantingham
a
former
archaeologist
who
never
lost
the
interest
in
crime
ingrained
in
him
by
his
criminologist
parents
says
the
key
insight
that
informed
early
work
on
pred
pol
was
to
tackle
crime
prediction
via
mathematics
rather
than
the
social
sciences
usually
crime
analysts
look
at
crime
patterns
combined
with
social
and
geographical
factors
they
would
look
at
a
particular
area
s
crime
history
demographic
make
up
the
location
of
transport
and
late
opening
bars
that
might
attract
potential
crooks
mostly
young
men
and
victims
pred
pol
strips
all
that
away
it
simply
feeds
three
different
factors
crime
type
time
and
location
through
the
dizzyingly
sophisticated
equations
and
algorithms
the
team
has
created
the
problem
with
considering
things
such
as
how
many
open
bars
there
are
is
that
it
misses
the
point
brantingham
says
the
key
information
is
the
number
of
assaults
or
robberies
and
you
already
know
that
the
team
began
in
by
considering
crime
through
a
spatial
rather
than
social
lens
if
you
consider
a
potential
criminal
and
a
potential
target
to
be
for
example
two
atoms
floating
in
a
body
of
fluid
what
factors
would
cause
them
to
meet
and
how
and
when
and
later
what
other
factors
might
interrupt
that
meeting
working
with
brantingham
ucla
s
applied
mathematics
department
began
investigating
models
that
described
events
such
as
chemical
reactions
and
the
way
substances
diffuse
in
fluid
even
fish
migration
predictions
came
up
in
the
discussion
soon
the
lapd
had
become
involved
brantingham
had
appealed
to
the
department
for
access
to
crime
data
and
had
feared
he
might
be
met
with
old
guard
suspicion
instead
the
department
threw
itself
into
the
project
at
the
time
the
lapd
suffered
from
an
awkward
problem
crime
was
falling
relentlessly
across
the
city
and
had
been
for
a
few
years
the
city
that
had
registered
murders
in
a
single
year
two
decades
ago
lost
just
of
its
citizens
to
violence
in
when
it
became
the
safest
big
city
in
the
us
this
was
good
news
for
citizens
but
since
the
only
real
measure
of
a
police
force
s
success
is
lower
year
on
year
crime
rates
it
meant
innovation
was
needed
to
keep
up
the
momentum
as
one
officer
puts
it
all
the
low
hanging
fruit
had
gone
the
then
lapd
chief
william
bratton
not
only
supplied
the
ucla
team
with
any
data
they
asked
for
but
also
assigned
one
of
his
captains
sean
malinowski
to
work
with
them
he
even
kicked
in
extra
funding
whenever
anyone
starts
talking
about
data
i
tend
to
get
the
mission
malinowski
says
this
is
probably
because
the
year
old
cop
has
a
phd
in
public
policy
data
and
statistics
don
t
scare
him
and
he
can
speak
basic
academic
the
next
breakthrough
came
when
brantingham
s
collaborator
dr
george
mohler
now
an
assistant
professor
of
mathematics
and
computer
science
at
santa
clara
university
discovered
that
equations
used
in
mapping
the
aftershocks
of
earthquakes
could
be
manipulated
to
map
crime
mohler
s
discovery
had
the
dramatic
effect
of
allowing
the
team
to
quickly
apply
their
theory
and
create
a
working
model
of
pred
pol
with
hindsight
brantingham
says
the
link
between
seismology
and
crime
makes
sense
research
already
showed
how
criminal
events
caused
their
own
aftershocks
such
as
when
burglars
returned
to
homes
or
streets
where
they
had
already
had
success
before
each
hour
shift
or
watch
begins
in
foothill
a
senior
officer
logs
in
to
pred
pol
with
a
password
and
calls
up
the
maps
for
the
coming
hours
on
a
desktop
computer
software
runs
up
to
date
and
historical
crime
data
through
pred
pol
s
algorithms
and
spits
out
that
shift
s
crime
boxes
which
are
all
printed
neatly
on
a
google
map
the
operator
can
also
pull
up
historical
crime
records
going
back
hours
or
days
weeks
or
months
so
far
the
system
in
use
predicts
and
maps
only
car
theft
burglary
from
a
car
and
burglary
because
these
constitute
more
than
per
cent
of
crime
the
team
is
working
to
expand
into
gun
crime
and
homicide
in
the
long
run
it
is
feasible
that
the
technology
could
allow
police
to
enter
say
the
time
and
location
suspects
are
seen
on
the
street
and
instantly
be
fed
background
material
such
as
what
their
gang
affiliation
is
likely
to
be
and
how
that
gang
fits
into
the
broader
criminal
ecology
of
the
area
the
technology
is
already
so
sophisticated
that
police
on
patrol
could
be
given
their
own
logins
and
pull
up
even
more
detailed
maps
via
smartphones
or
tablets
the
boxes
could
be
ranked
for
risk
and
police
could
even
watch
them
move
slowly
across
the
map
during
the
watch
as
police
attention
focused
on
particular
boxes
they
could
change
colour
as
the
risk
of
crime
abated
with
police
presence
so
far
the
developers
believe
that
could
lead
to
information
overload
police
are
basically
hunters
brantingham
says
should
the
boxes
be
ranked
they
would
focus
on
the
top
tiers
besides
says
andrea
bertozzi
ucla

the

on

pol
the
folded
piece
of
paper
is
good
technology
for
its
purpose
when
police
on
patrol
have
time
to
spare
they
are
directed
to
spend
time
in
their
allocated
boxes
the
beauty
is
the
simplicity
they
are
not
distracted
by
interacting
with
new
technology
or
equipment
police
report
that
once
in
their
boxes
they
find
themselves
hyper
alert
malinowski
says
they
take
note
of
who
is
around
they
talk
to
shopkeepers
and
home
owners
they
check
on
suspicious
activity
their
goal
in
the
boxes
is
not
so
much
to
catch
crooks
though
that
has
happened
but
to
suppress
crime
malinowski
dismisses
early
criticism
that
the
program
might
simply
diffuse
crime
saying
new
research
showed
that
the
type
of
crooks
they
were
after
such
as
car
thieves
were
opportunistic
and
often
give
up
in
the
face
of
risk
we
are
not
talking
about
committed
criminals
like
a
serial
rapist
he
says
as
brantingham
puts
it
it
is
not
too
hard
to
convince
them
back
home
to
their
xboxes
the
american
criminal
law
review
has
raised
the
concern
that
the
program
could
warp
crime
statistics
either
by
increasing
the
arrest
rate
in
the
boxes
through
extra
policing
or
falsely
reducing
it
through
diffusion
civil
rights
groups
are
taking
the
former
concern
seriously
because
designating
an
area
a
crime
hot
spot
can
be
used
as
a
factor
in
formulating
reasonable
suspicion
for
stopping
a
suspect
malinowski
says
so
far
there
is
no
evidence
of
an
increase
of
civil
rights
complaints
and
the
statistics
clearly
show
crime
is
decreasing
in
a
six
month
test
in
foothill
when
the
division
used
pred
pol
strictly
that
is
pred
pol
alone
was
used
for
crime
prediction
rather
than
in
concert
with
the
department
s
analysts
crime
rates
dropped
by
per
cent
overall
and
per
cent
for
car
theft
in
a
later
six
month
period
when
other
intelligence
types
were
used
crime
rates
rose
he
says
the
results
are
so
dramatic
that
the
force
s
chief
charlie
beck
is
backing
further
research
not
only
to
refine
the
technology
but
to
push
it
into
new
crime
areas
in
effect
malinowski
says
beck
has
so
much
confidence
in
the
model
he
is
allowing
the
researchers
to
use
parts
of
the
city
as
a
laboratory
to
study
crime
prediction
and
his
confidence
is
mirrored
around
the
country
and
the
world
as
other
police
forces
adopt
the
technology
because
the
system
uses
such
basic
data
the
technology
is
easily
transferable
and
blind
to
cultural
difference
brantingham
says
once
the
team
has
access
to
a
police
department
s
computer
system
they
can
be
online
within
a
couple
of
weeks
he
says
the
research
has
clearly
made
a
splash
at
ucla

is

funding

the
morning
watch
at
the
los

police

s
foothill
division
begins
at
am
when
the
shift
s
officers
gather
in
their
midnight
blue
uniforms
for
roll
call
and
a
briefing
the
dozen
or
so
officers
file
into
the
roll
call
room
and
find
space
on
the
benches
they
are
briefed
on
major
incidents
from
the
previous
shift
and
on
any
offenders
or
vehicles
they
might
be
looking
for
then
before
they
hit
the
streets
each
team
is
a
handed
a
simple
a
map
warm
from
an
office
printer
it
doesn
t
look
like
much
but
the
little
printed
maps
are
the
result
of
more
than
half
a
decade
s
work
and
research
by
anthropologists
and
pure
and
applied
mathematicians
from
two
leading
american
universities
funded
by
supporters
including
the
us
army
and
us
navy
and
working
hand
in
hand
with
the
lapd
marked
on
them
are
a
series
of
little
red
boxes
metre
long
squares
superimposed
over
the
streets
they
will
patrol
through
the
shift
the
boxes
indicate
with
spooky
accuracy
where
the
division
s
most
common
crimes
are
most
likely
to
be
committed
during
their
hour
shift
the
predictive
policing
project
or
pred
pol
as
it
has
become
known
has
been
so
successful
in
cutting
crime
rates
since
it
was
first
tested
in
foothill
in
that
it
has
spread
to
seven
other
la
police
divisions
with
more
to
come
another
or
so
police
departments
around
america
have
signed
on
as
have
departments
in
britain
it
is
understood
at
least
one
australian
police
service
is
in
talks
to
sign
up
though
its
creators
decline
to
discuss
potential
customers
one
of
the
driving
forces
behind
pred
pol
is
jeff
brantingham
an
anthropologist
at
the
university
of
california
los
angeles
who
as
he
guided
fairfax
around
the
leafy
ucla
campus
struggled
bravely
to
find
simple
enough
language
to
describe
the
science
behind
the
technology
crime
prediction
is
not
a
new
field
all
street
cops
know
the
crime
hot
spots
on
their
beat
and
larger
police
forces
have
been
employing
crime
analysts
and
software
to
assist
them
for
years
it
has
been
successful
too
the
standard
measure
of
accuracy
for
crime
prediction
is
multiplications
of
random
current
techniques
are
normally
effective
at
about
three
times
random
pred
pol
is
twice
as
effective
accurate
to
six
times
random
and
it
is
likely
to
improve
brantingham
a
former
archaeologist
who
never
lost
the
interest
in
crime
ingrained
in
him
by
his
criminologist
parents
says
the
idea
that
informed
early
work
on
pred
pol
was
to
tackle
crime
prediction
using
mathematics
rather
than
the
social
sciences
normally
crime
analysts
look
at
crime
patterns
combined
with
social
and
geographical
factors
they
would
look
at
a
particular
area
s
crime
history
demographic
make
up
the
location
of
transport
and
late
opening
bars
that
might
attract
potential
crooks
mostly
young
men
and
victims
pred
pol
strips
all
that
away
it
simply
feeds
three
factors
crime
type
time
and
location
through
the
dizzyingly
sophisticated
equations
and
algorithms
the
team
has
created
the
problem
with
considering
things
like
how
many
open
bars
there
are
is
that
it
misses
the
point
brantingham
says
the
key
information
is
the
number
of
assaults
or
robberies
and
you
already
know
that
the
team
began
in
by
considering
crime
through
a
spatial
rather
than
social
lens
if
you
consider
a
potential
criminal
and
a
potential
target
to
be
for
example
two
atoms
floating
in
a
body
of
fluid
what
factors
would
cause
them
to
meet
and
how
and
when
and
later
what
other
factors
might
interrupt
that
meeting
working
with
brantingham
ucla
s
applied
mathematics
department
began
investigating
models
that
described
events
such
as
chemical
reactions
and
the
way
substances
diffuse
in
fluid
even
fish
migration
predictions
came
up
in
discussion
by
now
the
lapd
had
become
involved
brantingham
had
appealed
to
the
department
for
access
to
crime
data
and
had
feared
he
might
be
met
with
old
guard
suspicion
instead
the
department
threw
itself
into
the
project
at
the
time
the
lapd
suffered
from
an
awkward
problem
crime
was
falling
relentlessly
across
the
city
and
had
been
for
a
few
years
the
city
that
had
registered
murders
in
a
single
year
two
decades
ago
lost
just
of
its
citizens
to
violence
last
year
when
it
became
the
safest
big
city
in
the
us
this
was
good
news
for
citizens
but
since
the
only
real
measure
of
a
police
force
s
success
is
lower
year
on
year
crime
rates
it
meant
innovation
was
needed
to
keep
up
the
momentum
as
one
officer
puts
it
all
the
low
hanging
fruit
had
gone
the
then
lapd
chief
william
bratton
not
only
supplied
the
ucla
team
with
any
data
they
asked
for
he
assigned
one
of
his
captains
sean
malinowski
to
work
with
them
he
even
kicked
in
extra
funding
whenever
anyone
starts
talking
about
data
i
tend
to
get
the
mission
malinowski
says
this
is
probably
because
the
year
old
cop
has
a
phd
in
public
policy
data
and
statistics
don
t
scare
him
and
he
can
speak
basic
academic
the
next
breakthrough
came
when
brantingham
s
collaborator
george
mohler
now
an
assistant
professor
of
mathematics
and
computer
science
at
santa
clara
university
discovered
that
equations
used
in
mapping
the
aftershocks
of
earthquakes
could
be
manipulated
to
map
crime
mohler
s
discovery
had
the
dramatic
effect
of
allowing
the
team
to
quickly
begin
applying
their
theory
and
creating
a
working
model
of
pred
pol
with
hindsight
brantingham
says
the
link
between
seismology
and
crime
makes
sense
research
already
showed
how
criminal
events
caused
their
own
aftershocks
such
as
when
burglars
returned
to
homes
or
streets
where
they
had
already
enjoyed
success
before
each
hour
shift
or
watch
begins
in
foothill
a
senior
officer
logs
into
pred
pol
and
calls
up
the
maps
for
the
coming
hours
on
a
desktop
computer
software
instantly
runs
up
to
date
and
historical
crime
data
through
pred
pol
s
algorithms
and
spits
out
that
shift
s
crime
boxes
all
printed
neatly
on
a
google
map
clicking
on
a
toolbar
the
operator
can
also
pull
up
historical
crime
records
going
back
hours
or
days
weeks
or
months
so
far
the
system
in
use
predicts
and
maps
only
car
theft
burglary
from
cars
and
burglary
because
these
constitute
more
than
per
cent
of
all
crime
the
team
is
working
to
expand
into
gun
crime
and
homicide
in
the
near
future
in
the
long
run
it
is
feasible
the
technology
could
allow
police
to
enter
say
the
time
and
location
a
suspect
is
seen
on
the
street
then
instantly
be
fed
background
material
such
as
what
their
gang
affiliation
is
likely
to
be
and
how
that
gang
fits
into
the
broader
criminal
ecology
of
the
area
the
technology
is
already
so
sophisticated
that
police
on
patrol
could
be
given
their
own
logins
to
pull
up
even
more
detailed
maps
using
smartphones
or
tablets
the
boxes
could
be
ranked
for
risk
and
police
could
even
watch
them
move
slowly
across
the
map
through
the
shift
as
police
attention
focuses
on
particular
boxes
they
could
change

the
risk

that
s
according
to

by

the

pioneered

predictive

was

by

a

as
a
way
to
combat

more
effectively
as
well
as
meet
the
public
s
demands
to
see
more
bobbies
on

with
tighter

and
fewer

this
st
century
model
allows
the

to
patrol
the
right
areas
at
the
right

with
the
aim
of
reducing

the
los

has
already
hailed
the
groundbreaking
technology
a

historic

figures
specific

chief

told

it

priority
we

configure
it
to
what
is
a
priority
for
us
at
the
time
in
the
summer
there
was
a
lot
more
violence
but
it
can
be
reconfigured
to
vehicle
crimes
anti
social
behaviour
or
burglaries
if
you
are
a
victim
of
crime
there
is
an
increased
likelihood
of
being
a
victim
in
the
few
weeks
after
for
instance
in
a
burglary
the
burglar
would
know
the
layout
of
your
house
and
where
the
belongings
are
they
would
know
you
would
have
replaced
the
goods
stolen

was
on

when
officers

for

those

these

possession

when
it
comes
to
predicting
crime
at
least
part
of
the
answer
may
lie
with
earthquakes
much
like
seismologists
use
one
earthquake
to
predict
its
aftershocks
a
team
of
researchers
at
the
university
of
california
los
angeles
is
using
a
complicated
algorithm
to
help
police
figure
out
when
and
where
the
next
likely
break
in
or
mugging
will
happen
it
s
not
that
earthquakes
cause
crime
says
andrea
bertozzi
a
professor
in
the
university
s
department
of
applied
mathematics
it
s
that
earthquakes
trigger
other
earthquakes
and
crime
also
triggers
other
crime
she
recently
gave
a
lecture
at
the
university
of
alberta
on
the
topic
of
mathematics
and
crime
using
ideas
from
the
earthquake
prediction
model
the
ucla
researchers
are
looking
at
new
crimes
possibly
being
spun
off
from
existing
crimes
the
after
crimes
bertozzi
says
the
intent
is
to
arm
police
with
information
on
how
to
best
use
their
thinly
stretched
resources
in
neighbourhoods
where
crimes
are
most
likely
to
happen
in
edmonton
police
have
been
using
ibm
business
analytic
technology
since
using
math
to
predict
and
solve
crimes
might
seem
like
part
of
a
plot
from
the
television
drama
numb
rs
but
for
the
researchers
it
makes
perfect
sense
most
police
agencies
already
keep
data
on
when
and
where
break
and
enters
robberies
and
other
crimes
are
happening
bertozzi
and
the
team
at
ucla
which
is
funded
by
the
u
s
national
science
review
correction
u
s
national
science
foundation
take
that
data
and
coupled
with
years
of
past
records
feed
it
into
a
model
that
will
give
police
a
time
and
place
to
focus
their
efforts
police
in
edmonton
have
used
an
intelligence
focused
policing
model
for
more
than
eight
years
but
haven
t
begun
to
use
any
one
tool
to
focus
on
the
when
and
where
of
crimes
instead
the
department
relies
on
a
variety
of
sources
data
mining
crime
mapping
and
officer
gathered
intelligence
to
figure
out
which
neighbourhoods
officers
should
patrol
although
we
do
have
these
tools
it
s
pulling
them
all
together
and
combining
that
with
the
human
elements
of
our
crime
analysts
our
division
commanders
and
our
patrol
members
that
really
helps
us
make
those
decisions
about
where
to
deploy
on
a
daily
basis
and
where
to
deploy
for
specific
initiatives
says
joanne
graham
director
of
business
intelligence
for
the
edmonton
police
service
the
math
works
because
humans
are
creatures
of
habit
even
the
ones
trying
to
evade
police
people
are
going
to
work
visiting
relatives
they
re
going
to
places
they
routinely
visit
and
then
a
crime
of
opportunity
happens
bertozzi
says
in
the
same
way
a
criminal
might
break
into
a
house
then
return
to
the
same
neighbourhood
because
they
ve
become
familiar
with
the
surroundings
it
could
be
the
thief
knows
homes
on
one
side
of
a
street
are
vulnerable
because
of
a
broken
street
light
or
perhaps
he
has
passed
a
tip
to
a
criminal
accomplice
it
s
about
being
comfortable
in
your
environment
identifying
targets
and
using
the
knowledge
you
have
ber
tozzi
says
of
course
there
are
major
differences
between
aftershocks
and
so
called
after
crimes
which
is
why
the
algorithm
is
so
useful
while
you
may
have
a
big
earthquake
you
re
not
necessarily
expecting
the
aftershock
to
have
the
same
magnitude
bertozzi
explains
with
crime
data
that
s
not
the
case
we
re
looking
at
crimes
that
could
be
related
to
an
initial
crime
but
could
be
equally
bad
to
the
initial
crime
or
even
worse
poring
over
the
crime
data
reveals
patterns
bertozzi
says
which
puts
that
information
somewhere
between
completely
random
and
percent
predictable
the
research
uses
mathematics
to
try
to
bridge
that
gap
between
random
and
predictable
in
the
santa
cruz
po
ice
department
which
hadn
t
been
following
a
predictive
policing
model
tested
software
developed
by
the
ucla
researchers
officers
were
given
a
list
of
locations
and
times
and
were
told
to
patrol
those
areas
whenever
they
weren
t
responding
to
calls
in
one
month
the
department
saw
crime
drop
by
per
cent
in
edmonton
police
began
seriously
working
toward
a
policing
model
based
on
intelligence
and
smart
resource
deployment
the
department
adopted
a
geographic
deployment
model
that
saw
patrol
squads
assigned
to
specific
districts
to
foster
a
sense
of
ownership
at
the
same
time
the
department
began
using
ibm
analytic
software
that
crunches
crime
data
helping
identify
trends
it
lets
us
take
a
close
look
at
what
s
happening
when
is
it
happening
where
is
it
happening
and
who
is
involved
graham
says
the
department
has
set
a
target
for
per
cent
of
patrol
officers
time
to
be
spent
doing
proactive
work
she
says
division
commanders
use
data
reports
crime
mapping
tools
and
intelligence
gathered
from
beat
cops
to
pinpoint
where
officers
should
work
proactive
patrols
by
setting
aside
that
per
cent
time
we
re
saying
to
patrol
officers
it
s
important
for
you
to
obviously
respond
to
calls
both
emergency
and
non
emergency
calls
but
we
have
an
expectation
that
you
re
going
to
undertake
activities
to
both
prevent
and
suppress
crime
graham
says
since
the
crime
rate
in
edmonton
has
dropped
with
robberies
break
and
enters
and
car
thefts
on
a
steady
downward
trend
according
to
statistics
canada
graham
doesn
t
attribute
that
strictly
to
mathematical
and
analytic
tools
but
it
did
allow
us
to
be
smarter
about
how
we
did
our
policing
while
bertozzi
recognizes
the
crime
prevention
software
isn
t
a
substitute
for
traditional
police
work
she
does
see
it
as
one
tool
in
their
arsenal
of
tools
to
deter
and
solve
crime
that
s
where
we
think
the
win
is
here
one
could
potentially
use
resources
more
efficiently
if
one
pays

that
don
t
share
the
same
affluence
property

demographics
as
santa

these
places
have
been
blighted

long
long
time

they
share
a

of

characteristics
said
erik
bovee
a
local
technology
investor
who
approached
the
sentinel
with
the
fbi

santa

doesn
t
share
those
bovee
said
he
has
brought
the
numbers
to
the
attention
of
numerous
local
officials
and
was
frustrated
to
see
them
dismissed
a
former
resident
of
big
cities
on
the
east
coast
and
in
europe
bovee
said
he
does
not
feel
safe
in

it
s
the
most
dangerous
place
that
i
ve
lived
or

in

said
crime
factors
many
things
affect
crimes
rates
and
criminologists
and
the
fbi
caution
the
statistics
are
not
an
accurate
picture
of
public
safety
the
figures
measure
offenses
reported
to
police
and
do
not
take
into
account
the
validity
of
the
report
or
crimes
that
were
never
brought
to
police
attention
while
the
statistics
are
a
snapshot
of
crime
in
santa
cruz
police
say
they
saw
a
drop
in
assaults
burglaries
and
thefts
in
property
crimes
are
also
on
a
downward
trend
sitting
at
less
than
percent
of
what
they
were
in
with
the
rate
being
the
lowest
in
the
past
years
police
and
others
say
there
are
several
factors
that
make
the
city
an
outlier
tourism
swells
the
city
s
population
particularly
on
sunny
summer
weekends
ucsc
brings
thousands
of
youths
and
young
adults
to
town
away
from
home
for
the
first
time
and
it
has
a
relatively
high
number
of
liquor
licenses
an
ongoing
topic
of
debate
i
am
convinced
that
you
cannot
benchmark
santa
cruz
to
any
other
city
santa
cruz
deputy
police
chief
steve
clark
said
you
can
t
we
re
an
anomaly
but
many
communities
must
deal
with
impacts
of
the
state
s
billion
tourism
industry
and
many
are
no
strangers
to
colleges
with
state
run
four
year
and
graduate
schools
across
california
community
colleges
and
scores
of
private
institutions
the
offenses
driving
both
rates
upward
are
thefts
and
assaults
and
countywide
they
seem
unique
to
santa
cruz
watsonville
rates
rank
rd
for
violent
crimes
and
rd
for
property
crimes
among
cities
with
a
population
of
and
greater
and
if
the
unincorporated
area
of
the
county
were
a
city
it
would
rank
in
the
bottom
half
statewide
for
both
categories
rates
for
the
smaller
cities
of
capitola
and
scotts
valley
are
both
far
less
than
santa
cruz
s
community
outcry
lately
an
increasing
number
of
santa
cruzans
are
raising
their
voices
about
crime
with
the
group
take
back
santa
cruz
the
name
implies
a
city
adrift
emerging
as
a
social
and
political
force
during
a
dark
period
co
founder
pamela
comstock
is
among
the
city
council
s
newest
members
the
level
of
criminal
activity
going
on
in
our
town
is
unacceptable
said
santa
cruz
city
councilman
david
terrazas
who
chairs
the
council
s
public
safety
committee
i
m
confident
this
city
council
is
taking
on
this
issue
and
the
community
is
no
longer
tolerant
of
crime
that
it
may
have
tolerated
in
the
past
the
debate
is
not
completely
new
it
dates
to
at
least
the
s
when
a
city
consultant
famously
penned
a
report
on
undesirable
transient
elements
or
utes
a
term
later
co
opted
by
protesters
to
city
policies
i
think
it
s
been
for
lack
of
a
better
word
sort
of
a
roller
coaster
issue
said
longtime
city
councilman
don
lane
in
my
time
in
this
community
there
have
been
periods
of
great
concern
about
crime
and
at
other
times
it
s
less
of
a
concern
this
is
not
a
new
phenomenon
but
tackling
crime
in
santa
cruz
is
a
complex
task
the
very
things
that
give
the
city
its
cultural
identity
not
just
its
famed
tolerance
but
its
vibrant
nightlife
and
global
draw
as
a
tourist
destination
also
contribute
to
the
problem
we
actually
do
a
lot
of
work
to
encourage
people
to
come
here
to
have
fun
that
s
one
of
our
main
industries
lane
said
but
when
people
are
on
vacation
they
do
drink
and
they
sometimes
use
drugs
let
s
not
mince
words
about
this
this
is
a
town
to
come
and
play
but
there
s
a
cost
to
that
drugs
also
often
are
named
as
a
culprit
particularly
methamphetamine
and
heroin
a
court
system
seen
as
lenient
is
also
a
frequent
target
as
is
the
county
s
suite
of
social
service
offerings
manifestation
of
neglect
there
are
ongoing
debates
about
what
role
the
police
play
in
preventing
crime
some
s
era
studies
concluded
that
standard
approaches
more
officers
preventive
patrols
and
faster
response
times
were
basically
ineffective
spurring
experimentation
in
how
best
to
reduce
crime
santa
cruz
s
predictive
policing
model
is
one
example
but
the
crime
reduction
factor
that
comes
up
is
the
role
santa
cruzans
themselves
must
play
part
of
that
is
what
have
we
taught
our
community
and
what
have
we
tolerated
clark
said
saying
the
city
is
reaping
what
he
called
the
manifestation
of
neglect
santa
cruz
is
a
compassionate
place
and
it
s
great
i
love
that
he
said
but
compassion
without
accountability
is
nothing
more
than
enabling
and
we
are
seeing
that
play
out
before
our
very
eyes
that
echoes
comments
by
former
defense
secretary
leon
panetta
at
the
funeral
for
baker
and
butler
speaking
of
their
accused
killer
and
the
numerous
red
flags
that
arose
before
he
made
his
way
to
santa
cruz
panetta
said
too
many
people
looked
the
other
way
we
live
in
a
society
now
where
everybody
hangs
by
their
iphone
or
their
computer
and
there
s
a
lot
of
turning
inward
and
not
enough
attention
to
the
people
around
you
panetta
said
in
a
later
interview
with
the
sentinel
experts
say
shaking
that
passiveness
is
key
to
preventing
crime
from
telling
errant
teens
to
knock
it
off
to
calling
out
criminal
behavior
uc
irvine
criminologist
charis
kubrin
said
informal
social
controls
are
effective
deterrents
a
community
that
s
vibrant
with
residents
out
and
about
that
has
a
lot
of
things
going
on
is
much
less
likely
to
have
crime
because
these
people
serve
as
the
eyes
and
ears
of
the
community
kubrin
said
minding
your
own
business
is
not
good
for
the
community
busy
department
the
santa
cruz
police
department
is
not
resting
on
its
laurels
in
the
department
averaged
arrests
per
sworn
officer
a
year
according
to
fbi
statistics
among
the
highest
in
the
state
and
a
figure
that
easily
beats
larger
cities
such
as
berkeley
oakland
and
san
francisco
each
of
which
averaged
fewer
than
four
per
officer
and
santa
cruz
averages
more
arrests
than
cities
such
as
sacramento
and
san
bernardino
which
have
similar
ratios
of
police
to
residents
nor
is
the
department
understaffed
when
measured
against
the
population
though
police
argue
that
measure
is
skewed
due
to
the
high
number
of
tourists
there
is
one
sworn
officer
for
every
residents
nd
in
the
state
furthermore
what
resources
the
department
has
are
on
the
street
the
ratio
of
civilian
staff
to
sworn
officers
is
third
lowest
in
california
many
homeless
santa
cruz
also
has
a
high
number
of
transients
and
the
killers
of
both
collins
and
officers
baker
and
butler
were
recent
transplants
to
santa
cruz
the
transient
issue
is
years
old
but
the
debate
over
it
do
social
services
attract
the
homeless
are
the
homeless
responsible
for
much
of
the
crime
rages
on
a
staunch
supporter
of
homeless
services
lane
says
there
s
no
question
that
some
transients
but
not
all
contribute
to
the
problem
there
are
people
who
are
kind
of
making
their
way
through
existence
by
petty
crime
lane
said
but
i
think
it
s
important
to
recognize
that
s
a
distinct
subpopulation
he
disputes
the
belief
closely
held
by
some
that
homeless
services
bring
homeless
people
to
the
area
i
don
t
think
people
are
choosing
to
come
great
distances
because
the
free
dinner
in
santa
cruz
is
better
than
the
dinner
in
salinas
lane
said
and
kubrin
said
you
cannot
draw
a
correlation
between
social
services
and
crime
in
fact
she
said
they
are
key
to
rehabilitation
and
should
help
reduce
crime
what
you
will
not
find
is
that
it
s
causing
crime
kubrin
said
i
cannot
think
of
a
study
that
would
show
that
a
city
its
police
in
a
city
with
an
anti
establishment
streak
the
santa
cruz
police
department
and
residents
have
sometimes
had
an
uneasy
relationship
the
department
has
cultivated
officers
who
match
the
community
and
continues
to
do
so
and
is
in
the
midst
of
an
exhaustive
search
for
new
recruits
this
is
a
very
political
community
maybe
a
politicized
community
is
a
better
word
lane
said
the
police
department
has
always
been
cognizant
of
dealing
with
what
the
community
attitudes
are
and
it
s
always
kind
of
wrestling
with
that
after
the
deaths
of
baker
and
butler
supervisor
zach
friend
a
former
crime
analyst
with
the
santa
cruz
police
department
called
for
a
rebirth
in
the
relationship
between
the
city
and
its
police
friend
said
he
sees
the
ongoing
public
safety
conversation
as
growing
pains
with
the
city
having
shifted
on
its
axis
in
the
s
from
a
conservative
growth
happy
area
known
for
fishing
to
a
politically
charged
liberal
bastion
this
to
me
is
part
of
the
discussion
and
growth
of
a
community
that
really
isn
t
that
old
friend
said
the
responsibility
for
preventing
crimes
falls
on
many
shoulders
he
said
by
the
time
a
law
enforcement
officer
knows
your
child
s
name
a
lot
of
elements
of
society
have
failed
that
child
the
police
are
really
the
parent
of
last
resort
speaking
of
his
former
police
colleagues
friend
added
they
feel
like
they
re
asked
to
accomplish
an
impossible
task
often
with
very
limited
resources
and
in
some
sections
of
the
community
with
little
support
but
it
isn
t
their
job
to
vocalize
that
marijuana
issue
in
santa
cruz
voters
passed
measure
k
which
not
only
made
marijuana
a
lesser
law
enforcement
priority
but
limited
the
police
department
s
ability
to
work
with
the
drug
enforcement
agency
on
pot
cases
at
the
time
voter
outrage
at
the
dea
over
its
participation
in
the
infamous
raid
on
the
wo
men
s
alliance
for
medical
marijuana
was
still
high
but
measure
k
s
practical
impact
was
to
limit
police
cooperation
with
the
dea
on
all
drug
investigations
including
going
after
top
level
suppliers
clark
said
the
fact
that
santa
cruz
has
such
a
large
drug
problem
and
gives
away
twice
as
many
needles
than
all
of
santa
clara
county
transcends
anything
the
police
department
or
city
council
can
control
clark
said
cutting
off
the
supply
might
help
change
the
city
s
drug
friendly
reputation
but
cutting
off
demand
and
getting
more
people
into
treatment
would
make
that
easier
and
could
lead
to
declines
in
drug
related
property
crimes
addiction
is
a
disease
that
needs
treatment
and
that
can
really
be
seen
when
we
see
a
transformation
in
people
and
get
them
back
to
a
place
where
they
are
stable
and
back
with
families
and
working
said
carolyn
coleman

director
of

cruz
community
counseling
center
and
an
appointee
to
mayor
hilary
bryant
s
new
task
force
on
public
safety
we
think
all
these
services
are
geared
toward
public
safety
what
s
next
the
city
council
is
taking
up
the
crime
issue
this
week
and
adding
to
the
fabric
of
community
concerns
is
a
state
prisoner
shift
that
some
feared
would
mean
more
crooks
roaming
the
streets
oakland
which
has
by
far
the
highest
violent
crime
rate
in
the
state
recently
hired
former
new
york
city
top
cop
bill
bratton
the
godfather
of
zero
tolerance
style
policing
as
a
consultant
but
the
hammer
of
the
criminal
justice
system
is
not
the
only
way
to
fix
a
crime
problem
kubrin
said
there
s
no
evidence
yet
that
the
prison
realignment
has
led
to
an
uptick
in
crime
and
locking
people
up
isn
t
the
answer
she
added
overreliance
on
incarceration
is
very
problematic
in
california
kubrin
said
you
cannot
incarcerate
your
way
out
of
a
crime
problem
there
are
diminishing
returns
after
awhile
ultimately
clark
said
crime
isn
t
about
numbers
at
all
but
a
sense
of
place
with
so
many
factors
at
play
it
comes
down
to
whether
people
feel
secure
in
the
place
where
they
live
how
good
do
you
feel
about
where
you
live
and
what
you
do
not
just
santa
cruz
but
there
are
a
lot
of
communities
at
a
crossroads
about
this
clark
said
my
whole
time
that
i
ve
been
here
santa
cruz
has
always
found
a
way
to
figure
it
out
and
move

carl

a

moved
up
from
her
position
as
the

administrator
to
become
the

s
commander
of
the
administrative

division
these
are
very
important
positions
in
our
leadership
chain
of
command
and
it
s
important
that
we
selected
the
right
individuals
to
fulfill
these
roles
police
chief
ron
de
pompa
said
povilaitis
who
is
a
longtime
glendale
resident
started
his
career
in
law
enforcement
with
the
glendale
police
department
where
he
has
spearheaded
major
projects
including
the
development
of
command
areas
predictive
policing
and
real

crime
analysis
as
the
new
deputy
chief
povilaitis
will
continue
to
oversee
his
current
duties
in
the
investigation
division
as
well
as
manage
all
day
to

operations
of
the

this
is
a
can
do
organization
he
said
everybody
in
this
organization
works
so
hard
it
s
not
what
can
t
we
do
or
why
can
t
we
do
it
it
s
how
can
we
get
it
done
his
new
role
will
let
de
pompa
focus
more
on
administrative
duties
working
with
the
legal
team
as
well
as
actively
interacting
with
the
community
according
to
police
sgt
tom
lorenz
this
is
a
very
special
position
at
least
in
my
eyes
because
he
will
truly
be
my
right
hand
man
de
pompa
said
but
truth
be
known
carl
has
kind
of
been
my
right
hand
man
throughout
my
tenure
as
chief
stepping
in
to
oversee
organizational
duties
goldman
a
non
sworn
police
employee
will
use
her
experience
to
supervise
fleet
services
as
well
as
communications
the
jail
records
budget
and
evidence
rooms
she
will
also
represent
the
city
on
the
governance
board
for
the
interagency
communications
interoperability
system
which
delivers
interoperable
radio
communication
to
the
los

i
look
forward
to
the
challenges
goldman
said
i
am
learning
a
great
deal
about
the
different
bureaus
here
i
like
what
i
see
i
like
the
work
that
is
being
done
and
i
look
forward
to
bringing
it
to
the
next
level
the
idea
of
allowing
a
non
sworn
employee
to
oversee
a
great
amount
of
the
department
s
operations
wasn
t
immediately
welcomed
by
some
city
officials
especially
after
they
learned
the
staffer
would
have
command
over
certain
police
functions
the
position
which
is
supposed
to
save
the
city
annually
is
on
the
same
tier
as
a
captain
which
means
goldman
will
be
allowed
to
act
as
police
chief
in
the
absence
of
de
pompa
during
an
emergency
however
she
would
act
as
a

mayor

said
at

thursday
this

is
a

multiplier
predpol
was
developed
by
a

firm
and
is
used
by

has
been
working

police
chief
william
m
heim
said
officers
discovered
a
car
theft
and
a
burglary
in
progress
while
patrolling
areas
where
crime
was
predicted
to
occur
those
may
or
may
not
be
attributable
to
predpol
he
said
but
the
city
has
a
two
year
contract
and
should
know
by
then
how
well
it
works
the
city
paid
from
a
federal
grant
for
the
setup
and
two
years
of
use
we
had
a
pretty
robust
crime
mapping
capability
to
establish
the
hot
spots
and
let
police
officers
know
where
to
take
proactive
measures
heim
said
it
worked
really
well
and
we
thought
we
were
on
the
cutting
edge
then
came
high
tech
predictive
policing
with
a
growing
number
of
providers
in
the
industry
such
as
predpol
so
how
does
it
work
algorithms
those
essentially
are
hugely
complex
math
formulas
that
combine
data
of
past
crimes
with
known
patterns
of
criminal
behavior
to
predict
where
the
next
one
will
occur
the
city
fed
years
of
crime
data
into
the
predpol
system
and
now
updates
it
twice
a
day
in
return
it
gets
a
map
sprinkled
with
by
foot
squares
showing
where
and
when
the
next
crime
might
occur
police
move
into
that
area
patrolling
talking
with
people
perhaps
not
full
time
but
to
establish
a
greater
presence
you
can
t
count
a
crime
that
didn
t
occur
as
a
measure
of
the
system
s
success
but
heim
said
he
ll
be
happy
if
there
s
a
percent
drop
in
burglaries
in
areas
that
predpol
pinpointed
and
police
took
proactive
measures
there
s
no
replacement
for
good
police
work
he
said
but
this
is
quite
an
enhancement

a

los

style
of

which

before

has
seen
street
violence
in
north
kent
slashed
by
and
is
now
being
introduced
across
the
county
sounding
more
like
something
out
of
a
hollywood
blockbuster
than
traditional
crime
fighting
the
idea
originated
in
the
californian
city
it
has
now
been
adopted
by
police
here
as
a
way
of
cutting
anti
social
behaviour
drug
dealing
and
street
violence
predpol
uses

which
reads
the
latest

maths
and
human

data
to
show
the

areas

zones
sometimes
as

as

with
the
aim

mark
johnson
kent
police
s
head
of
analysis
said
every
day
the
system
is
fed
new
crime
data
which
is
updated
to
produce
new
zones
officers
will
target
each
day
it
won
t
change
the
way
policing
is
done
but
it
will
predict
crime
in
high
risk
areas
across
the
county
in
a
targeted
way
so
it
helps
us
police
more
effectively
we
ve
had
an
intelligence
led
approach
to
crime
in
kent
for
the
last
years
this
new
system
does
not
replace
that
but
will
enhance
it
a
recent
three
month
pilot
in
north
kent
saw
levels
of
street
violence
fall
by
when
predictive
policing
was
introduced
chief
constable
ian
learmonth
said
he
was
pleased
with
the
results
so
far
and
is
confident
it
will
work
across
the
county
he
said
instead
of
just
doing
a
random
patrol
the
data
tells
us
to
go
to
a
zone
which
is
known
to
have
recent
levels
of
crime
it
means
more
of
a
police
presence
in
areas
that
have
some
of
the
highest
levels
of
criminality
mr
learmonth
said
the
officers
have
enjoyed
it
because
it
takes
them
back
to
the
policing
style
some
joined
to
do
officers
are
out
visible
doing
foot
patrols
engaging
with
the
community
talking
with
the
residents
and
they
are
dealing
with
the
crimes
they
see
as
an
added
bonus
the
public
want
to
see
visible
policing
on
the
streets
this
allows
us
to
do
that
the
idea
is
backed
by
the
county
s
police
commissioner
ann
barnes
who
gave
the
green
light
to
the
innovative
project
when
she
was
chairman
of
the
police
authority
last
year
she
accepted
that
if
crime
levels
are
to
continue
to
fall
in
kent
more
targeted
policing
would
need
to
happen
as
cuts
to
the
force
by
the
coalition
government
continue
she
said
when
you
have
nearly
officers
fewer
on
the
streets
you
have
to
put
your
officers
where
they
will
be
best
used
and
the
most
effective
it
s
just
ordinary
policing
but
this
targeted
system
will
give
a
better
chance
of
our
officers
stopping
crimes
taking
place
before
they
happen

predicting

is
standard
practice
for
weather
forecasters
economists
think
tanks
and
business
now
the
police
are
finding
their
own
way
of
mapping

before
it

happens
reminiscent
of
tom
cruise
film
minority
report
the
software
predpol
which
stands
for
predictive
policing
has
been
brought
to
north
kent
from
california
for
its
first
uk
trials
in
santa
cruz
and
los
angeles
where
the
software
was
first
tested
in
crime
dropped
by
per
cent
and
per
cent
respectively
in
the
first
six
months
it
began
as
an
academic
project
seven
years
ago
involving
mathematicians
social
scientists
and
an
anthropology
professor
whose
goal
was
to
understand
how
crime
hotspots
occur
they
found
that
by
using
a
mathematical
algorithm
similar
to
one
for
predicting
earthquake
aftershocks
they
could
create
predict
where
crimes
would
happen
speaking
to
the
reporter
from
santa
cruz
jeff
brantingham
anthropology
professor
at
the
university
of
california
explains
when
there
is
an
earthquake
you
see
a
lot
about
how
it
produces
aftershocks
in
general
they
occur
near
in
time
and
place
to
a
main
shock
crime
is
very
much
the
same
when
a
burglar
breaks
into
a
house
it
makes
the
chance
of
crime
occurring
close
by
much
more
likely
the
predpol
software
maps
years
of
past
crime
data
and
is
updated
daily
with
the
location
time
and
type
of
crime
committed
from
this
it
creates
prediction
boxes
of
precise
sq
ft
zones
which
are
listed
in
priority
order
as
to
where
crimes
are
most
likely
to
occur
which
is
then
delivered
to
the
smart
phones
tablets
and
pcs
of
police
officers
brantingham
explains
the
technology
is
more
sophisticated
than
just
highlighting
an
area
around
a
recent
crime
if
you
were
to
look
at
the
last
seven
days
of
crime
you
could
see
a
pattern
but
you
can
t
put
seven
years
of
offences
on
one
map
predpol
has
the
advantage
of
analysing
everything
that
has
happened
in
those
years
and
can
select
the
crimes
likely
to
produce
new
offences
he
says
one
problem
raised
is
the
ambiguity
over
whether
police
could
stop
and
search
someone
in
a
location
flagged
up
by
predpol
but
brantingham
stresses
this
isn
t
minority
report
that
s
about
producing
who
this
is
about
where
and
when
last
week
ch
insp
philip
painter
of
kent
police
gravesham
division
introduced
the
technology
to
councillors
at
a
crime
disorder
meeting
they
were
sceptical
one
worried
that
it
would
leave
rural
areas
without
police
cover
another
was
concerned
it
would
mean
job
cuts
however
ch
insp
insisted
rural
areas
do
still
have
crime
hot
spots
and
would
be
patrolled
and
that
the
technology
would
not
lead
to
any
cuts
kent
police
were
impressed
by
the
drop
in
offences
in
california
and
invested
into
a
trial
across
north
kent
which
will
if
successful
go
county
wide

insp
painter
remembers
patrolling

dickens

years

and

dynamics
he
is
optimistic
predpol
is
easy
to

and
easy
to

it

two
months
ago
will
be
the
first
time
the
alhambra
police
department
releases
official
information
in
a
language
other
than
english
as
a
part
of
our
long
term
strategy
we
know
that
the
population
of
asian
immigrants
to
the
united
states
is
continuing
to
rise
and
we
know
that
s
going
to
continue
in
the
san
gabriel
valley
and
we
know
that
s
going
to
continue
here
in
alhambra
as
well
yokoyama
said
and
we
also
know
that
the
population
is
going
to
be
younger
and
with
that
younger
population
they
re
going
to
be
using
social
media
such
as
weibo
about
percent
of
the
residents
in
alhambra
are
asian
according
to
the
u
s
census
of
the
city
s
residents
about
are
chinese
yokoyama
said
the
launch
ofweibo
com
alhambrapolice
arrived
about
months
after
the
alhambra
police
department
started
a
facebook
account
thefan
page
has
about
likes
yokoyama
said
he
is
not
sure
how
weibo
will
affect
his
agency
s
ability
to
solve
crimes
because
the
alhambra
police
department
doesn
t
keep
an
inventory
of
the
ethnic
background
of
witnesses
but
the
point
of
the
chinese
social
media
website
is
to
keep
residents
informed
help
community
engagement
and
encourage
people
who
might
not
otherwise
speak
to
the
police
to
turn
in
tips
yokoyama
said
thanks
to
the
facebook
fan
page
a
handful
of
crimes
have
been
solved
or
avoided
since
january
yokoyama
added
in
researchers
at
the
usc
annenberg
school
for
communication
journalism
surveyed
chinese
latino
and
white
alhambra
residents
chinese
residents
scored
lowest
when
it
came
to
feeling
a
sense
of
neighborhood
belonging
collective
efficacy
and
civic
participation
yokoyama
said
he
has
been
working
to
make
the
police
department
more
progressive
since
he
started
in
june
in
january
alhambra
became
the
first
citywide
agency
to
use
predictive
policing
orpredpol
a
cloud
based
software
program
that
forecasts
crime
zones
after
four
months
yokoyama
said
residential
theft
decreased
by
percent
car
burglaries
by
and
grand
theft
auto
by
weibo
is
a
critical
component
of
outreach
to
the
chinese
community
and
is
a
way
for
the
agency
to
increase
trust
community
and
overall
civic
engagement
yokoyama
said
there
is
a
segment
of
the
population
that
really
doesn
t
want
to
call
the
police
but
they
feel
comfortable
sending
a
message
he
said
the
alhambra
police
department
is
working
on
texting
a
beta
version
should
be
released
in
about
eight
months
and
a
functional
version
should
be
out
next
year
yokoyama
said
the
alhambra
police
department
partnered
with
alhambra
source
a
community
news
website
after
reading
one
of
its
articles
about
how
to
engage
the
chinese
community
mayor
stephen
sham
a
longtime
chinese
advocate
was
also
involved
in
the
project
many
of
the
chinese
community
here
they
re
first
generation
or
fresh
immigrants
sham
said
they
re
more
concerned
about
their
life
so
we
need
to
provide
a
safe
comfortable
community
for
them
to
live
chinese
immigrants
go
to
chinese
media
but
the
chinese
media
can
t
report
about
our
city
every
day
we
hope
that
through
this
it
ll
allow
them
to
be
more
comfortable
to
engage
with
the
police
department
about
percent
of
the
agency
s
weibo
website
will
be
a
carbon
copy
of
the
city
s
facebook
page
yokoyama
said
but
the
social
media
website
will
also
address
concerns
that
are
specific
to
the
local
and
international
chinese
community
such
as
visa
issues
he
said
while
about
officers
including
yokoyama
update
the
facebook
fan
page
around
the
clock
weibo
initially
will
have
one
page
manager
walter
yu
a

the

almost

the

arnold

that
still

of
its

thomas
edison

but
even
edison
might
need

before
he
d
grasp
all
the
dimensions
of
one
of
lund
s
projects
lund
s
question
how
can
power
companies
harness
the
power
of
data
to
predict
which
trees
will
fall
on
power
lines
during
a
storm
thus
allowing
them
to
prevent
blackouts
before
they
happen
the
work
of
richard
rothman
a
professor
at
johns

university
in
baltimore
is
more
fundamental
to
save
lives
the
centers

cdc
in
atlanta
predicts
flu

once
it
examines

from

that
takes
weeks
in
a

seemed
to
suggest
researchers
could
predict

much
faster
by
analyzing

of

in

like
my

signaled
a

before
the
cdc
knew
there
would
be

that
posed
a
new
question
for
dr
rothman
and
his
colleague
andrea
dugas
could
google
help
predict
influenza
outbreaks
in
time
to
allow
hospitals
like
the
one
at
johns
hopkins
to
get
ready
they
ask
different
questions
but
all
five
of
these
researchers
form
part
of
the
new
world
of
big
data
a
phenomenon
that
may
for
better
or
worse
revolutionize
every
facet
of
life
culture
and
well
even
the
planet
from
curbing
urban
crime
to
calculating
the
effectiveness
of
a
tennis
player
s
backhand
people
are
now
gathering
and
analyzing
vast
amounts
of
data
to
predict
human
behaviors
solve
problems
identify
shopping
habits
thwart
terrorists
everything
but
foretell
which
hollywood
scripts
might
make
blockbusters
actually
there
s
a
company
poring
through
numbers
to
do
that
too
just
four
years
ago
someone
wanted
to
do
a
wikipedia
entry
on
big
data
wikipedia
said
no
there
was
nothing
special
about
the
term
it
just
combined
two
common
words
today
big
data
seems
everywhere
ushering
in
what
advocates
consider
some
of
the
biggest
changes
since
euclid
want
to
get
elected
to
public
office
put
a
bunch
of
computer
geeks
in
a
room
and
have
them
comb
through
databases
to
glean
who
might
vote
for
you
then
target
them
with
micro
tailored
messages
as
president
obama
famously
did
in
want
to
solve
poverty
in
africa
analyze
text
messages
and
social
media
networks
to
detect
early
signs
of
joblessness
epidemics
and
other
problems
as
the
united
nations
is
trying
to
do
eager
to
find
the
right
mate
use
algorithms
to
analyze
an
infinite
number
of
personality
traits
to
determine
who
s
the
best
match
for
you
as
many
online
dating
sites
now
do
what
exactly
is
big
data
what
makes
it
new
different
what
s
the
downside
such
questions
have
evoked
intense
interest
especially
since
june
on
that
day
former
national
security
agency
analyst
edward
snowden
revealed
that
like
ms
mandelbaum
or
rothman
the
nsa
had
also
asked
a
question
can
we
find
terrorists
using
big
data
like
the
phone
records
of
hundreds
of
millions
of
ordinary
americans
could
we
get
those
records
from
say
verizon
mr
snowden
s
disclosures
revealed
that
prism
the
program
the
nsa
devised
secretly
monitors
calls
web
searches
and
e
mails
in
the
united
states
and
other
countries
the
dark
side
of
big
data
involves
much
more
than
snowden
s
disclosure
or
what
the
us
does
and
what
made
big
data
possible
did
not
happen
overnight
the
term
has
been
around
for
at
least
years
though
it
s
only
recently
become
popular
it
will
be
quite
transformational
says
thomas
davenport
an
information
technology
expert
at
babson
college
in
wellesley
mass
who
co
wrote
the
widely
used
book
competing
on
analytics
the
new
science
of
winning
what
exactly
will
it
transform
to
find
out
let
s
go
back
to
the
beginning
big
data
starts
with
a
lot
of
data
google
executive
chairman
eric
schmidt
has
said
that
we
now
uncover
as
much
data
in
hours
zettabytes
that
s
bytes
as
humans
gathered
from
the
dawn
of
civilization
to
the
year
you
read
that
right
the
head
of
a
company
receiving
billion
search
requests
a
day
believes
people
now
gather
in
a
few
days
more
data
than
humans
have
done
throughout
almost
all
of
history
mr
schmidt
s
claim
has
doubters
but
similar
assertions
crop
up
from
people
not
prone
to
exaggeration
such
as
massachusetts
institute
of
technology
researcher
andrew
mcafee
and
mit
professor
erik
brynjolfsson
authors
of
the
new
book
race
against
the
machine
more
data
crosses
the
internet
every
second
they
write
than
were
stored
in
the
entire
internet
years
ago
a
key
driver
of
the
growth
of
data
is
the
way
we
ve
digitized
many
of
our
everyday
activities
such
as
shopping
increasingly
done
online
or
downloading
music
another
factor
our
dependence
on
electronic
devices
all
of
which
leave
digital
footprints
every
time
we
send
an
e
mail
search
online
post
a
message
text
or
tweet
virtually
every
institution
in
society
from
government
to
the
local
utility
is
churning
out
its
own
torrent
of
electronic
digits
about
our
billing
records
our
employment
our
electricity
use
add
in
the
huge
array
of
sensors
that
now
exist
measuring
everything
from
traffic
flow
to
the
spoilage
of
fruit
during
shipment
and
the
world
is
awash
in
information
that
we
had
no
way
to
uncover
before
all
aggregated
and
analyzed
by
increasingly
powerful
computers
most
of
this
data
doesn
t
affect
us
amassing
information
alone
doesn
t
mean
it
s
valuable
yet
the
new
ability
to
mine
the
right
information
discover
patterns
and
relationships
already
affects
our
everyday
lives
anyone
for
instance
who
has
a
navigation
screen
on
a
car
dashboard
uses
data
streaming
from
satellites
miles
above
earth
to
pinpoint
his
or
her
exact
location
people
living
in
los
angeles
and
dozens
of
other
cities
now
participate
knowingly
or
not
in
the
growing
phenomenon
of
predictive
policing
authorities
use
of
algorithms
to
identify
crime
trends
tennis
fans
use
ibm
slamtracker
an
online
analytic
tool
to
find
out
exactly
how
many
return
of

andy
murray
needed
to
win

when
we
use
sites
like
slamtracker
companies
take
note
of
our
browsing
habits
and
through
either
the
miracle
or
the
meddling
of
big
data
use
that
information
to
send
us

a

that
will
transform
how
we
live

kenneth
cukier
and
viktor
mayer
sch
nberger
mention
wal
mart
s
discovery
gleaned
by
mining
sales
data
that
people
preparing

a

bought
lots
of

now
when
a

is
on
the

wal
mart
puts
pop
tarts
on
the
shelves
next
to
the
flashlights
but
what
excites
and
concerns
people
about
big
data
is
more
far
reaching
than
that
one
way
of
seeing
the
bigger
picture
taking
a
closer
look
at
some
of
the
people
in
the
digital
trenches
i
follow
mandelbaum
and
mr
youkel
down
a
corridor
of
the
library
of
congress
past
exhibits
redolent
of
history
and
what
you
might
expect
from
what
we
call
america
s
library
with
its
million
books
on
miles
of
shelving
they
open
a
door
we
pass
behind
people
staring
at
huge
computer
screens
and
enter
a
room
that
doesn
t
look
as
if
it
belongs
in
a
library
at
all
it
s
the
size
of
a
gym
with
fluorescent
lights
overhead
and
tall
metal
boxes
rising
from
the
floor
the
tweets
come
here
mandelbaum
says
it
s
been
three
years
since
twitter
approached
the
library
with
a
question
what
the
online
networking
service
started
in
had
become
a
new
way
of
communicating
would
there
twitter
asked
be
historical
value
in
archiving
tweets
we
saw
the
value
right
away
says
robert
dizard
deputy
director
of
the
library
our
mission
is
preserve
the
record
of
america
certainly
the
record
of
what
millions
of
americans
say
think
and
feel
each
day
would
be
a
treasure
trove
for
historians
but
was
the
technology
feasible
and
important
for
a
federal
agency
cost
effective
to
handle
the
three
v
s
that
form
the
fingerprint
of
a
big
data
project
volume
velocity
and
variety
the
library
said
yes
but
the
task
is
daunting
volume
it
will
archive
billion
tweets
in
alone
about
each
from
the
world
s
million
plus
tweeters
velocity
that
means
absorbing
more
than
million
tweets
an
hour
hours
a
day
seven
days
a
week
each
stored
in
a
way
that
can
last
variety
there
are
tweets
from
a
woman
who
may
run
for
president
in
and
from
lady
gaga
and
they
re
different
in
other
ways
sure
a
tweet
is
characters
says
jim
gallagher
the
library
s
director
of
strategic
initiatives
but
there
are
fields
we
need
to
record
who
wrote
it
where
when
because
many
tweets
seem
banal
the
project
has
inspired
ridicule
when
the
library
posted
its
announcement
of
the
project
one
reader
wrote
in
the
comments
box
i
m
guessing
a
good
chunk
came
from
the
kardashians
but
isn
t
banality
the
point
historians
want
to
know
not
just
what
happened
in
the
past
but
how
people
lived
it
is
why
they
rejoice
in
finding
a
semiliterate
diary
kept
by
a
confederate
soldier
or
pottery
fragments
in
a
colonial
town
it
s
as
if
a
historian
today
writing
about
lincoln
could
listen
in
on
what
millions
of
americans
were
saying
on
the
day
he
was
shot
youkel
and
mandelbaum
might
seem
like
an
odd
couple
to
carry
out
a
big
data
project
one
is
a
career
library
of
congress
researcher
with
an
undergraduate
degree
in
history
the
other
a
geologist
who
worked
for
years
with
oil
companies
but
they
demonstrate
something
babson
s
mr
davenport
has
written
about
the
emerging
field
of
analytics
hybrid
specialization
for
organizations
to
use
the
new
technology
well
traditional
skills
like
computer
science
aren
t
enough
davenport
points
out
that
just
as
big
data
combines
many
innovations
finding
meaning
in
the
world
s
welter
of
statistics
means
combining
many
different
disciplines
mandelbaum
and
youkel
pool
their
knowledge
to
figure
out
how
to
archive
the
tweets
how
researchers
can
find
what
they
want
and
how
to
train
librarians
to
guide
them
even
before
opening
tweets
to
the
public
the
library
has
gotten
more
than
requests
from
doctoral
candidates
professors
and
journalists
this
is
a
pioneering
project
mr
dizard
says
it
s
helping
us
begin
to
handle
large
digital
data
for
america
s
library
at
this
moment
that
means
housing
a
gutenberg
bible
and
lady
gaga
tweets
what
will
it
mean
in
years
i
ask
dizard
he
laughs
and
demurs
i
wouldn

look
that
far

paragraph
i

big
changes
mr
cukier
and
mr
mayer
sh
nberger
say
big
data
brings
to
research
it
s
what
we
might
call
the
three
nots
size
not
sample
for
more
than
a
century
they
point
out
statisticians
have
relied
on
small
samples
of
data
from
which
to
generalize
they
had
to
they
lacked
the
ability
to
collect
more
the
new
technology
means
we
can
collect
a
lot
of
data
rather
than
settle
for
samples
messy
not
meticulous
traditionally
researchers
have
insisted
on
clean
curated
data
when
there
was
not
that
much
data
around
researchers
had
to
be
as
exact
as
possible
now
that
s
no
longer
necessary
accept
messiness
they
write
arguing
that
the
benefits
of
more
data
outweigh
our
obsession
with
precision
correlation
not
cause
while
knowing
the
causes
behind
things
is
desirable
we
don
t
always
need
to
understand
how
the
world
works
to
get
things
done
they
note
lund
s
lab
exemplifies
all
three
first
his
entire
geography
and
variables
involve
massive
sets
of
data
information
streaming
in
from
sensors
satellites
and
other
sources
about
everything
from
forest
density
to
prevailing
wind
direction
to
grid
loads
second
he
looks
for
probability
not
obsessive
precision
correlation
lund
values
cause
but
the
reason
behind
say
tree
growth
interests
him
less
than
spotting
correlations
that
might
spur
action
ah
that
tree
he
exclaims
as
if
he
is
an
engineer
in
the
field
better
get
the
trucks
out
ahead
of
the
storm
cukier
and
mayer
sch
nberger
cite
the
united
parcel
service
to
bolster
their
argument
about
correlation
ups
equips
its
trucks
with
sensors
that
identify
vibrations
and
other
things
associated
with
breakdowns
the
data
do
not
tell
ups
why
the
part
is
in
trouble
they
reveal
enough
for
the
company
to
know
what
to
do
lund
s
boss
ge
chief
executive
officer
jeff
immelt
also
talks
about
sensor
data
the
company
is
now
investing
billion
in
software
and
analytics
which
includes
putting
sensors
on
its
jet
engines
to
help
enhance
fuel
efficiency
mr
immelt
has
said
that
just
a

change
in

burn
can
be
worth
hundreds
of
millions
of
dollars
to
an

immelt
said
at
a
conference
this
spring
you
re
his
friend
for
life
while
lund
has
talked
glowingly
about
how
much
data
his
projects
can
collect
he
wants
to
make
sure
i
know
data
isn
t
everything
as
a
scientist
he
says
i
know
the
biggest
challenge
is
finding
the
right
questions
how
do
you
find
the
questions
important
to
business
society
and
culture
rothman
has
questions
too
we
work
in
emergency
rooms
he
says
about
himself
and
dr
dugas
we
re
the
boots
on
the
ground
rothman
s
work
has
involved
emergency
medicine
and
the
nexus
between
public
health
and
epidemics
including
influenza
which
kills
as
many
as
people
a
year
around
the
world
and
about
in
the
us
the
two
researchers
wanted
to
find
out
if
the
google
national
study
held
lessons
for
baltimore
and
their
emergency
room
er
they
studied
google
queries
for
the
baltimore
area
queries
about
flu
symptoms
or
chest
congestion
or
where
to
buy
a
thermometer
if
they
could
spot
spikes
that
might
help
solve
one
crucial
problem
crowding
dugas
says
huge
issue
when
epidemics
start
people
rush
to
hospitals
waiting
rooms
fill
up
the
sheer
volume
of
people
means
decreased
care
errors
mortality
she
says
if
google
trends
showed
a
spike
just
as
epidemics
started
ers
could
staff
up
and
reserve
more
space
for
the
surge
of
patients
the
link
between
google
spikes
and
hospital
visits
in
baltimore
turned
out
to
be
strong
especially
for
children
as
soon
as
the
first
news
reports
surfaced
about
the
h
n
virus
pediatric
er
visits
at
hopkins
increased
at
the
peak
by
as
much
as
percent
but
when
the
two
researchers
looked
closer
they
found
something
unexpected
no
flu
it
turned
out
that
news
reports
about
h
n
elsewhere
fueled
a
rush
to
ers
in
baltimore
what
one
researcher
called
fear
week
if
you
just
looked
at
correlation
for
flu
you
d
say
it
was
a
false
trend
says
dugas
even
so
she
and
rothman
found
the
data
important
for
ers
no
matter
why
people
are
coming
in
the
door
they
need
to
staff
up
the
baltimore
study
also
showed
the
importance
of
finding
out
what
was
behind
all
those
medically
related
google
searches
in
other
words
not
just
correlation
but
cause
like
ge
s
lund
rothman
emphasizes
the
value
of
the
questions
you
re
asking
evidence
that
big
data
promises
enormous
benefits
is
more
than
anecdotal
mit
s
mr
brynjolfsson
did
a
study
in
examining
companies
he
found
those
whose
decisions
were

driven
had
become
to

more
productive
in
ways
only
the
use
of

could
explain

laura

at
american

of

in

she
and
others
worry
not
exclusively
about
three
questions
does
the
new
technology
erode
privacy
promote
inequality
and
turn
government
into
big
brother
she
points
to
public
health
data
as
one
potential
source
of
abuse
her
concern
echoes
that
of
critics
who
fear
that
supposedly
anonymous
patient
records
are
not
anonymous
at
all
as
far
back
as
the
s
a
massachusetts
state
commission
gave
researchers
health
data
about
state
workers
believing
this
would
help
officials
make
better
health
care
decisions
william
weld
then
governor
of
massachusetts
assured
workers
their
files
had
been
scrubbed
of
the
data
that
could
identify

one
harvard
university
computer
science
graduate
student
took
this
promise
of
privacy
as
a
challenge
using
just
three
bits
of

latanya
sweeney
showed
how
to
identify
everyone
including

whose
diagnoses
medications
and
entire
medical
history
ms
sweeney
now
a
professor
at
harvard
gleefully
sent
to
his
office
today
there
are
far
more
powerful
ways
to
identify
people
from
records
supposed
to
keep
things
private
and
there
are
concerns
other
than
our
health
records
dr
denardis
worries
about
how
much
companies
know
about
our
social
media
habits
take
a
look
at
the
published
privacy
policies
of
apple
facebook
or

she
says
they

where
you
are
people
consent
to
that
by
selecting
i

but
how
carefully
are
they
read
she
s
not
alone
jay
stanley
of
the

civil

union
describes
one
example
of
what

can
do
with
what
they
know
about

he
wrote
in

at

where
a

do
we
want

to
lower
our
credit
card
limits
thinking
we
re
a
risk
just
because
people
who
frequent
the
stores
we
do
don
t
pay
their
bills
in
addition
to
individual
privacy
critics
worry
about
big

s
impact
in
more
expansive
ways
such
as
the
growing
gap
between
rich
and
poor
nations
large
american
companies

hire
hundreds
of
data
analysts
how
can
bangladesh
compete
will
this
aggravate
the
global
digital
divide
perhaps
most
worrisome
to
people
at
the
moment
is
the
government
s
use
of
big
data
to
monitor
its
own
citizens
or
others
in
the
name
of
national
security
the
american
people
president
obama
said
a
few
days
after
the
nsa
story
broke
don
t
have
a
big
brother
who
is
snooping
into
their
business
did
obama
mean
george
orwell
s
term
doesn
t
include
governments
secretly
monitoring
calls
e
mails
audio
and
video
of
citizens
suspected
of
nothing
commandeering
information
from
firms
like
yahoo
and
google
the
questions
that
arose
from
snowden
s
revelations
in
june
encompass
issues
of
privacy
confidentiality
freedom
and
of
course
security
the
obama
administration
argues
that
monitoring
personal
information
keeps
the
country
safe
asserting
that
prism
has
helped
foil
separate
terrorist
plots
against
the
us
some
lawmakers
on
capitol
hill
dispute
that
number
though
and
in
recent
weeks
momentum
has
been
building
in
washington
to
rein
in
the
nsa
not
only
has
support
increased
on
the
left
and
right
to
adopt
more
oversight
of
its
surveillance
program
polls
show
a
hardening
of
public
opinion
about
snooping
too
meanwhile
there
is
no
doubt
about
the
fury
in
other
countries
when
the
news
broke
especially
in
germany
where
critics
have
compared
american
monitoring
of
foreigners
phone
calls
and
e
mails
with
that
of
stasi
the
former
hated
east
german
secret
police
in

some
of

most
upset
about

suzanne

head

pen
american
center
which

artists
around
the

imprisoned
for
free

worries
about
the
government
use
of
data
from
private
companies
to
stifle
dissent
it
s
not
new
she
says
citing
the
chinese
dissident
shi

imprisoned
by
china
in
for
posting
political
commentary
on
foreign
websites
and
still
locked
up
yahoo
china
had
assisted
the
chinese
government
they
used
yahoo
data
to
convict
him
but
then
ms
nossel
talks
about
the
recent
unrest
in
turkey
where
the
turkish
military
shot
and
arrested
dozens
of
protesters
in
istanbul
s
taksim
square
to
find
more
of
what
they
called
looters
the
turkish
government
went
to
twitter
and
facebook
for
help
and
announced
that
facebook
was
responding
positively
something
facebook
has
denied
and
nossel
sees
a
difference
between
and
now
talking
about
the
most
repressive
governments
in
the
world
she
argues
that
the
government
ability
to
sweep
and
search
is
now
so
great
it
tips
the
scale
no
technology
on
the
side
of
human
rights
advocates
can
confront
it
that
s
new
and
chilling
what
have
we
learned
there
s
a
notable
sesame
street
episode
from
years
back
in
which
cookie
monster
wanders
into
a
library
and
drives
the
librarian
crazy
by
asking
over
and
over
for
a
cookie
this
is
a
library
the
librarian
finally
screams
forgetting
to
whisper
we
have
books
just
books
that
s
certainly
been
our
image
of
what
libraries
do
you
can
still
find
books
here
mandelbaum
reminds
me
standing
in
a
room
full
of
processors
but
figures
over
the
past
decade
seem
to
show
that
books
those
rectangular
things
with
pages
we
turn
are
slowly
on
the
way
out
in
the
digital
age
that
s
less
significant
than
it
might
seem
though
after
all
we
value
books
because
of
the
knowledge
they
hold
we
ve
changed
the
way
we
convey
knowledge
many
times
big
data
is
another
source
of
knowledge
will
it
become
a
more
integral
part
of
tomorrow
s
libraries
it
is
perhaps
fitting
that
one
of
the
sesame
street
characters
most
in
tune
with
the
future
is
the
count
he
counts
everything
his
role
is
to
teach
kids
the
importance
of
counting
big
data
allows
us
to
count
everything
and
analyze
what
we
find
but
are
numbers
enough
brynjolfsson
and
mr
mcafee
compare
big
data
to
leeuwenhoek
s
development
of
the
microscope
in
the
s
they
are
after
all
both
tools
they
let
people
see
lots
of
things
that
have
always
been
around
of
course
the
microscope
also
prompted
us
to
ask
questions
we
could
never
ask
before
big
data
does
that
too
still
while
big
data
can
predict
a
flu
outbreak
or
where
trees
fall
it
can
t
by
itself
resolve
the
economic
and
moral
dilemmas
we
have
whether
to
keep
power
running
help
patients
faster
or
preserve
the
record
of
america
big
data
teaches
us
what
s
out
there
not
what
s
right
there
s
nothing
inherently
wrong
with
big

what
matters

it
does
for

richmond
police

chris

on
wednesday
sent
out
an
email
to
community
and
civic
leaders
detailing
the
challenges
and
strategies
investigators
face
in
solving
cases
the
email
stresses
the
importance
of
witnesses
participation
which
was
reportedly
key
in
the
recent
capture
of
a
man
charged
tuesday
with
fatally
shooting
his
neighbor
in
in
the
iron
triangle
neighborhood
the
richmond
police
department
offers
a
reward
for
information
leading
to
an
arrest
and
conviction
in
unsolved
homicide
cases
regardless
of
how
long
ago
they
occurred
here
is
a
magnus
email
dear
city
council
and
other
richmond
community
members
we
have
recently
seen
an
increase
in
gun
violence
in
richmond
much
of
it
associated
with
gang
activity
some
of
it
simply
a
result
of
personal
beefs
between
individuals
unfortunately
gun
violence
frequently
occurs
in
clusters
in
many
cases
because
incidents
of
retaliation
follow
the
initial
shooting
and
are
very
difficult
to
prevent
i
am
often
asked
how
the
police
department
investigates
these
gun
violence
cases
especially
homicides
and
why
they
are
difficult
to
prevent
and
solve
here
are
some
of
the
strategies
and
tools
we
use
as
well
as
some
of
the
challenges
we
face
community
engagement
as
an
ongoing
effort
well
before
a
homicide
or
other
gun
crime
even
takes
place
our
patrol
and
school
resource
officers
sros
are
out
in
the
community
doing
their
best
to
build
relationships
establish
trust
make
contact
with
neighborhood
residents
and
develop
information
about
dangerous
individuals
who
pose
a
threat
to
others
this
is
key
to
both
preventing
and
solving
crimes
obviously
the
community
quickly
hears
about
serious
crimes
after
they
occur
through
the
media
neighborhood
blogs
and
word
of
mouth
what
most
residents
don
t
know
are
the
many
crimes
that
are
prevented
because
beat
officers
and
sros
develop
information
or
engage
in
proactive
field
work
which
allows
them
to
intervene
ahead
of
the
crime
these
officers
will
make
a
key
arrest
confiscate
a
gun
our
officers
take
an
average
of
a
gun
off
the
street
each
day
or
conduct
compliance
checks
to
assure
probationers
and
parolees
are
following
the
rules
that
allow
them
to
be
back
in
the
community
our
personnel
work
closely
with
many
community
organizations
that
provide
services
or
have
a
mission
to
prevent
violence
they
also
engage
the
faith
community
school
personnel
and
everyday
residents
to
prevent
and
solve
gun
crimes
whenever
possible
partnerships
with
other
law
enforcement
entities
rpd
personnel
work
with
many
other
police
corrections
and
prosecution
entities
to
address
violent
crime
in
richmond
this
includes
local
jurisdictions
close
to
us
like
san
pablo
pd
el

pd
the
contra

county
sheriff
s
department
ccso
bart
pd
and
others
it
also
includes
the
contra
costa
county
probation
department
especially
important
based
on
the
recent
realignment
of
california
s
corrections
system
that
shifts
responsibility
for
many
offenders
away
from
the
state
and
to
the
counties
instead
as
well
the
cdcr
state
corrections
parole
section
rpd
also
has
a
close
relationship
with
personnel
from
several
federal
agencies
including
the
fbi
atf
alcohol
tobacco
and
firearms
the
dea
and
customs
although
we
have
no
involvement
with
ice
the
immigration
section
of
customs
lastly
we
work
closely
with
county
state
and
federal
prosecution
agencies
including
the
contra

the
state

of

although
the

often
refer
to
many
crimes
in
our
immediate
area
as
having
been
committed
in
richmond
a
great
deal
of
our
retaliatory
gang
violence
involves
young
men
who
live
or
hang
out
in
unincorporated
north
richmond
which
is
not
part
of
the
city
because
of
this
a
significant
number
of
gun
crimes
associated
with
our
larger
community
are
the
responsibility
of
the
contra
costa
county
sheriff
s
department
this
means
it
s
essential
that
rpd
work
closely
with
the
sheriff
s
department
when
a
shooting
occurs
it
s
not
uncommon
for
the
perpetrators
to
flee
from
richmond
into
north
richmond
or
vice
versa
this
complicates
our
ability
to
make
arrests
and
close
cases
but
despite
this
reality
our
officers
and
detectives
communicate
on
an
ongoing
basis
with
ccso

and
investigators
we
also
work
regularly
with
investigators
from
the

the

with

to
have
two
assistant

in
our

who
focus
exclusively
on
richmond
gun

and

they
work
with
our
patrol

to
give
special
attention
to
repeat

they
review

provide
immediate

answer

and
provide
training
for
our

that
make
our

more
effective
in
dealing

the

regular

to

these

involve
not
only
rpd

but
lead
investigators
from
other
local

in

as
a

crime
scene
investigations
and
evidence
processing
our
department
has
officers
specifically
trained
as
crime
scene
investigators
csis
these
personnel
are
available
and
respond
to
the
scene
of
all
homicides
and
many
other
violent
crimes
csis
have
many
important
responsibilities
they
document
the
physical
nature
and
characteristics
of
crime
scenes
which
is
painstaking
and
can
be
quite
time
consuming
this
typically
involves
taking
photographs
collecting
ballistic
evidence
bullet
casings
unexpended
rounds
etc
gathering
other
evidence
clothing
items
left
behind
by
the
offender
taking
latent
prints
when
appropriate
and
working
closely
with
the
other
investigators
at
the
scene
processing
crime
scenes
and
evidence
is
very
little
like
what
s
portrayed
on
television
evidence
handling
at
a
crime
scene
is
complex
for
example
people
sometimes
wonder
why
the
body
of
the
deceased
isn
t
moved
or
taken
away
from
the
scene
of
a
homicide
more
quickly
they
may
perceive
this
as
disrespect
or
lack
of
caring
by
the
officers
what
they
don
t
realize
is
that
a
detailed
inspection
of
the
deceased
at
the
scene
including
the
position
of
the
body
bullet
entry
and
exit
wounds
condition
of
the
deceased
s
clothing
and
many
other
factors
can
be
key
to
solving
a
case
later
on
it
is
a
lengthy
process
in
addition
it
usually
takes
time
for
the
county
coroner
to
respond
to
homicide
scenes
to
do
their
job
the
department
s
csis
pay
close
attention
to
ballistic
evidence
at
the
scene
there
may
be
numerous
bullet
casings
and
even
unexpended
rounds
spread
around
a
wide
area
that
need
to
be
collected
in
some
cases
a
gun
may
be
located
occasionally
one
that
belonged
to
the
victim
rpd
pays

lab
to
process
many
of
these
items
and
to
enter

evidence
in

the
federal
integrated
ballistics

system
the

records
the
distinctive
pattern
left
on
bullet
evidence
which
can
then
later
be
matched
to
the
exact
gun
that
fired
it
in
much
the
same
way
as
fingerprints
can
be
matched
to
the
person
who
left
them
behind
due
to
the
volume
of
cases
handled
by
the
ccso
crime
lab
ibis
comparisons
can
take
as
much
as
six
months
to
complete
to
expedite
our
comparisons
we
have
contracted
with
a
forensic
expert
to
prioritize
richmond
cases
for
a
quicker
turnaround
we
hear
a
lot
about
dna
evidence
through
the
media
on
television
dna
processing
of
evidence
occurs
in
minutes
and
is
usually
matched
right
away
to
a
known
criminal
facilitating
an
immediate
arrest
in
reality
many
dna
cases
take
months
to
be
processed
there
is
not
necessarily
a
match
to
anyone
since
the
dna
database
is
limited
to
persons
who
have
dna
samples
taken
from
them
at
the
time
of
a
previous
arrest
or
who
are
in
the
database
for
other
reasons
dna
analysis
is
extremely
expensive
for
the
submitting
agency
crime
labs
are
overwhelmed
with
evidence
from
richmond
and
other
cities
in
the
county
one
of
the
frustrations
for
our
investigators
is
the
time
it
takes
to
get
lab
results
physical
evidence
can
be
one
of
the
strongest
parts
of
a
criminal
case
yet
it
is
not
uncommon
for
months
to
pass
before
analysis
results
related
to
key
pieces
of
evidence
comes
back
to
investigators
this
can
delay
the
ability
to
link
a
suspect
to
a
crime
assuming
a
suspect
has
been
identified
witnesses
one
of
the
first
things
police
officers
try
to
do
when
they
respond
to
the
scene
of
a
homicide
or
serious
shooting
is
to
identify
and
speak
to
witnesses
unfortunately
this
is
one
of
the
most
difficult
parts
of
the
investigation
in
many
many
cases
particularly
those
involving
gang
related
violence
witnesses
are
unwilling
to
come
forward
or
talk
with
the
police
even
when
they
have
seen
or
know
something
about
the
crime
this
is
often
because
of
the
brutality
and
brazenness
of
shootings
which
frequently
occur
in
places
open
to
public
view
it
is
also
common
in
cases
where
gang
dynamics
are
at
play
for
rivals
to
know
one
another
while
neighborhood
residents
may
be
totally
unfamiliar
with
who
these
actors
are
offenders
generally
subscribe
to
a
strict
street
code
that
discourage
cooperation
with
legitimate
entities
such
as
police
and
government
there
are
many
reasons
witnesses
and
even
surviving
victims
in
many
cases
choose
not
to
work
with
the
police
some
of
these
reasons
include
fear
of
retaliation
perception
that
there
is
no
point
of
getting
involved
since
the
system
doesn
t
work
anyway
distrust
of
the
police
and
other
authorities
friendship
or
family
ties
to
the
perpetrators
cultural
or
language
barriers
bad
personal
or
family
experience
s
with
the
criminal
justice
system
current
arrest
warrants
or
other
charges
pending
against
them
they
are
on
parole
or
probation
they
are
not
confident
what
they
saw
or
heard
or
they
will
handle
it
themselves
perpetuating
the
cycle
of
violence
we
are
sometimes
asked
why
do
you
have
so
many
officers
at
a
serious
crime
scene
in
addition
to
securing
the
crime
scene
perimeter
which
can
be
challenging
depending
on
the
size
of
the
scene
the
main
reason
for
the
large
number
of
officers
and
detectives
is
to
make
every
possible
effort
to
identify
and
speak
to
witnesses
homicides
and
other
shootings
are
very
complicated
investigations
that
involve
piecing
together
many
facts
from
different
sources
that
we
address
with
a
team
approach
in
order
to
increase
our
accuracy
and
efficiency
time
is
of
the
essence
in
these
cases
if
witnesses
are
not
contacted
as
soon
as
possible
it
may
be
impossible
to
identify
or
locate
them
later
on
you
may
have
heard
of
or
watched
the
tv
show
the
first
which
portrays
how
critical
it
is
to
gather
evidence
and
identify
witnesses
during
the
first
hours
following
the
crime
when
it
comes
to
engaging
with
witnesses
however
the
process
would
better
be
called
the
first
minutes
the
more
time
that
passes
following
a
homicide
or
serious
shooting
the
more
difficult
it
is
to
identify
and
locate
witnesses
when
investigators
fail
to
locate
helpful
witnesses
initially
they
make
every
effort
to
continue
this
process
in
the
weeks
and
months
that
follow
the
crime
sometimes
important
leads
come
from
informants
also
known
as
confidential
informants
or
cis
sometimes
information
comes
from
neighbors
or
other
eyewitnesses
close
to
the
scene
of
the
crime
who
may
need
persuasion
or
reassurance
over
time
to
get
involved
sometimes
information
comes
from
a
family
member
or
associate
of
the
suspect
s
who
develop
a
motivation
to
work
with
the
police
there
are
cases
however
where
no
one
comes
forward
and
no
one
can
be
identified
to
interview
this
is
a
problem
because
eyewitnesses
are
equally
as
valuable
as
physical
evidence
in
shooting
cases
a
major
problem
we
face
in
dealing
with
witnesses
is
that
they
are
not
always
reliable
sometimes
a
witness
has
such
a
lengthy
criminal
record
and
or
such
questionable
motivation
there
is
little
chance
a
prosecutor
can
put
them
on
the
stand
to
testify
for
fear
they
might
actually
jeopardize
the
case
another
problem
can
be
locating
witnesses
later
on
for
preliminary
exams
or
trial
for
example
because
individuals
may
leave
the
area
become
uncooperative
or
generally
make
themselves
as
scarce
as
possible
to
avoid
testifying
on
tv
and
in
the
movies
witnesses
not
associated
with
the
suspect
or
victim
almost
always
seem
to
pick
the
suspect
s
out
of
a
photo
or
police
lineup
in
reality
witnesses
may
only
catch
a
fleeting
glance
of
a
suspect
it
may
be
dark
clothing
worn
by
the
suspect
s
may
make
it
difficult
to
see
them
and
things
often
happen
incredibly
fast
during
the
commission
of
a
crime
eyewitness
testimony
is
not
always
reliable
so
investigators
and
prosecutors
have
to
be
very
careful
about
how
this
evidence
is
developed
and
used
on
a
positive
note
because
of
the
relationships
many
of
our
officers
have
developed
with
the
community
it
is
not
uncommon
for
beat
officers
and
sros
to
be
told
about
the
word
on
the
street
going
around
about
a
particular
shooting
this
information
may
not
be
enough
to
make
a
solid
case
against
a
suspect
but
it
can
provide
us
with
a
starting
point
for
further
investigation
who
decides
about
charging
a
suspect
if
a
suspect
is
actually
identified
and
there
is
probable
cause
for
an
arrest
a
state
or
federal
prosecutor
must
still
make
a
decision
about
whether
there
is
enough
evidence
to
obtain
a
signed
warrant
from
a
judge
and
ultimately
to
try
the
case
in
court
many
people
believe
the
police
make
charging
decisions
that
involve
suspects
but
this
is
not
how
the
system
works
charges
against
suspects
have
to
be
made
by
prosecutors
and
prosecutors
base
their
charging
decisions
on
multiple
factors
it
is
not
uncommon
for
a
district
attorney
or
federal
prosecutor
to
send
a
case
back
to
detectives
requesting
more
information
or
follow
up
before
they
will
move
forward
with
prosecution
in
some
instances
it
is
simply
not
possible
for
detectives
to
obtain
additional
information
so
a
case
may
be
stalled
for
months
or
even
years
this
is
often
extremely
disappointing
to
family
members
or
friends
of
the
victim
who
may
believe
a
case
is
going
nowhere
because
the
police
and
or
prosecutors
simply
don
t
care
this
is
simply
not
true
nothing
makes
officers
and
detectives
more
frustrated
than
knowing
who
committed
a
crime
yet
not
having
sufficient
evidence
to
get
a
suspect
charged
and
tried
in
court
this
is
not
an
uncommon
occurrence
in
richmond
homicide
cases
prosecutors
are
legally
and
morally
obligated
to
not
file
charges
against
a
suspect
unless
they
believe
they
can
convince
a
jury
of
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt
of
the
suspect
s
guilt
people
often
ask
why
charges
aren
t
filed
in
an
effort
to
make
a
suspect
go
to
trial
even
if
the
prosecutor
knows
the
trial
will
end
in
an
acquittal
the
reason
for
this
is
that
such
conduct
could
be
construed
as
malicious
prosecution
resources
almost
every
police
agency
believes
it
needs
more
resources
to
solve
and
of
course
prevent
homicides
and
other
serious
gun
crimes
the
plain
truth
however
is
that
the
need
for
additional
resources
especially
personnel
is
much
greater
in
richmond
than
many
other
communities
simply
because
of
the
amount
of
gang
violence
and
the
overall
challenges
of
crime
in
the
city
when
i
ask
members
of
the
public
how
many
sworn
police
officers
we
have
in
richmond
i
get
answers
like
or
we
actually
have
sworn
personnel
which
includes
everyone
from
the
newest
recruit
who
may
still
need
to
go
through
a
basic
police
academy
or
be
partnered
up
with
a
training
officer
for
on
the
job
training
all
the
way
up
to
me
the
chief
about
of
our
personnel
are
patrol
officers
about
another
are
supervisors
patrol
sergeants
and
lieutenants
and
about
between
of
these
personnel
are
on
duty
at
any
given
time
patrolling
the
entire
city
the
remainder
of
our
sworn
staff
are
detectives
officers
assigned
to
special
details
like
the
regulatory
unit
or
recruiting
and
training
as
well
as
administrative
personnel
in
addition
most
people
do
not
realize
that
we
always
have
personnel
on
leave
days
vacation
going
through
mandatory
training
recovering
from
injuries
or
on
long
term
disability
and
otherwise
away
from
the
job
for
a
myriad
of
reasons
there
are
approximately
a
dozen
investigators
available
to
handle
homicides
although
about
half
of
them
are
primarily
assigned
to
work
robberies
homicides
tend
to
come
in
groups
so
the
reality
is
that
these
personnel
can
be
spread
very
thin
homicide
investigators
may
be
called
out
day
or
night
days
a
week
and
then
work
long
long
hours
to
follow
up
on
a
murder
or
serious
shooting
in
that
key
period
following
the
crime
s
thanks
to
the
support
of
the
city
council
and
the
city
manager
rpd
has
been
fortunate
that
our
overall
staffing
levels
have
increased
over
the
past
years
despite
these
increases
however
we
are
still
staffed
below
what
a
city
with
our
level
of
crime
ideally
needs
our
department
utilizes
a
variety
of
technologies
to
assist
us
with
the
investigation
of
violent
crime
including
crime
lab
services
which
come
with
a
hefty
price
tag
through
the
sheriff
s
department
closed
circuit
tv
also
expensive
and
complicated
to
operate
maintain
and
monitor
shotspotter
which
triangulates
gunfire
to
provide
the
location
and
type
of
gun
being
fired
but
it
can
t
help
with
the
fact
that
shooters
generally
don
t
stick
around
for
the
police
and
license
plate
readers
lprs
residents
often
assume
these
technologies
are
available
and
functioning
throughout
the
entire
city
but
because
of
cost
they
are
mostly
limited
to
neighborhoods
with
higher
levels
of
violent
crime
this
is
frustrating
to
many
members
of
the
public
and
police
officers
alike
who
wish
there
was
a
camera
or
a
gunshot
sensor
available
and
operating
in
every
area
where
crimes
occur
the
department
also
relies
on
our
crime
analysis
resources
including
our
ability
to
track
field
contacts
provide
timely
crime
data
to
our
personnel
and
conduct
meaningful
analysis
of
crime
trends
we
have
one
crime
analyst
who
works
behind
the
scenes
with
our
officers
and
detectives
to
track
serious
crimes
including
gang
activity
this
has
to
be
done
carefully
and
accurately
to
protect
people
s
rights
and
to
be
most
effective
thanks
to
recent
action
by
the
city
council
the
department
is
contracting
for
a
service
known
as
predictive
policing
which
is
being
successfully
used
in
other
cities
such
as
los
angeles
and
new
york
city
to
utilize
complex
algorithms
in
predicting
where
future
crimes
are
likely
to
occur
so
greater
resources
can
be
placed
in
these
locations
it
sounds
like
science
fiction
but
this
process
has
a
track
record
of
proven
positive
results
ceasefire
the
richmond
police

is
part
of
the
ceasefire
lifelines
to
healing

overall

the
ceasefire
program
cannot
prevent
all
homicides
but
it
is
recognized
as
a
best
practice
around
the
country
to
reduce
shootings
the
ceasefire
program
involves
police

and
other
key
individuals

at

are

also
hear
an
important
message
from
the
community
which
is
that
people
care
about
them
and
that
a
support
system
exists
to
help
them
turn
their
lives
around
this
effort
involves
community
groups
service
providers
the
faith
community
formerly
incarcerated
individuals
and
many
others
there
are
no
instant
or
magical
outcomes
associated
with
the
ceasefire
program
but
real
prevention
and
long
term
successes
are
hard
to
measure
and
difficult
to
achieve
this
program
requires
the
persistent
dedication
and
commitment
of
many
people
and
groups
it
also
requires
sufficient
funding
and
resources
to
provide
effective
interventions
to
provide
sustainable
interventions
shooters
who
want
to
make
major
life
changes
often
need
life
skills
training
employment
mental
health
and
substance
abuse
services
anger
management
and
conflict
resolution
skills
education
and
other
assistance
few
of
these
services
are
available
to
the
degree
they
are
needed
in
our
community
despite
the
best
efforts
of
many
groups
and
people
no
giving
up
here
s
one
especially
important
thing
i
d
like
people
to
know
about
our
homicide
investigations
we
don
t
give
up
homicide
cases
are
never
closed
even
when
evidence
is
very
limited
and
no
witnesses
have
come
forward
even
when
we
have
exhausted
all
leads
unsolved
homicide
cases
remain
open
in
case
information
or
evidence
is
developed
later
sometimes
years
later
that
helps
us
solve
a
case
and
charge
a
suspect
a
good
example
of
this
is
a
homicide
case
that
our
investigators
just
made
an
arrest
on
we
know
how
important
this
kind
of
closure
is
to
victims
families
and
friends
it
s
also
important
to
our
personnel
who
have
often
spent
several
thousand
hours
investigating
a
case
our
personnel
are
invested
in
these
cases
another
important
thing
to
keep
in
mind
the
department
offers
a
standing
reward
for
information
leading
to
the
arrest
and
conviction
of
the
person
or
persons
who
committed
any
homicide
even
a
homicide
many
years
ago
lesser
rewards
may
be
available
for
critical
information
that
helps
us
with
other
serious
shooting
cases
i
hope
this
information
has
helped
explain
the
ongoing
work
and
challenges
faced
by
the
police
and
others
in
addressing
the
problem
of
gun
violence
in
our
community
this
work
is
difficult
and
there
are
many
obstacles
to
achieving
success
we
are
fortunate
to
have
considerable
support
and
an
ongoing
commitment
for
this
work
from
our
city
council
and
other
regional
elected
leaders
we
also
have
a
caring
group
of
residents
who
are
highly
invested
in
this
effort
that
said
nothing
is
easy
and
our
needs
remain
considerable
i
appreciate
your
time
in
learning
more
about
these
issues
and
your
willingness
to
partner
with
us
as
we
move
forward

broad
debate
about
whether
the

mining
techniques
on

without

information
gathered

by

such

can
be
more

than
what

few

understand
what

or
how
the

we
normally
think
of

i
m
not

sure
they
are

said
mark

a

that
provides

there
are
thousands

out

collecting

together
they
are
really
aggregating
quite
a

he

not

what

dubbed
the
big

revolution
the
combination

cheap

robust
computing
power
and
sophisticated
analytics
that
allows
experts
to
find
correlations
in
ever
expanding
pools
of

in
many
ways
big

has
been
a
boon
for
consumers
allowing

netflixnflx
says
three
fourths
of
its
film

tv
show
rentals
come
from
its

which
rely
on
automated

of
customer
preferences
big

also
has
the
potential
advocates
say
to
improve
medical
outcomes
streamline
government
services
and
reduce

the
los

police
department
is
analyzing
data
to
isolate
hot
spots
in
its
predictive
policing
program
for
example
steering
officers
to
where
crimes
are
expected
to
happen
the
downside
may
be
just
as
dramatic
however
most
americans
emit
a
stream
of
personal
digital
exhaust
what
they
search
for
what
they
buy
who
they
communicate
with
where
they
are
that
is
captured
and
exploited
in
a
largely
unregulated
fashion
the

can
be
used
by
identity
thieves
insurance
companies
prospective
employers
or
opponents
in

how

said
ian

a

at

in
addition
to

threats
he
said
there
is
a
fundamental
problem
with
fairness
in
the
sense
that
i
am
generating
all
this

about
me
through
my

and
these
organizations
are
harvesting
it
and
making
a
profit
off
it
google
says
it
uses
algorithms
not
humans
to
mine
the
content
of
gmail
messages
thus
if
someone
sends
a
digital
note
about
an
upcoming
trip
the
computer
may
generate
an

for
an
airline
or
hotel
amazon

other

smartphones
double

sending

though
the

it
does
not

these

have
been
practicing
what

call

arbitrage
for

so
mining
all

said
a

he

understands
how

by
these
silicon

that

just
as

say
the

uses

only
to
hunt

spy
on
foreign

silicon

say
they
use
personal

experience
much
of
the

they
store
are
anonymous
they
say
they
don
t
care
about
customer
names
yet
anonymity
can
be
temporary
in
a
study
published
in
february
in
the

researchers
were
able
to
sort

richmond
police
chief
chris
magnus
on
wednesday
sent
out
an
email
to
community
and
civic
leaders
detailing
the
challenges
and
strategies
investigators
face
in
solving
cases
the
email
stresses
the
importance
of
witnesses
participation
which
was
reportedly
key
in
the
recent
capture
of
a
man
charged
tuesday
with
fatally
shooting
his
neighbor
in
in
the
iron
triangle
neighborhood
the
richmond
police
department
offers
a
reward
for
information
leading
to
an
arrest
and
conviction
in
unsolved
homicide
cases
regardless
of
how
long
ago
they
occurred
here
is
a
magnus
email
dear
city
council
and
other
richmond
community
members
we
have
recently
seen
an
increase
in
gun
violence
in
richmond
much
of
it
associated
with
gang
activity
some
of
it
simply
a
result
of
personal
beefs
between
individuals
unfortunately
gun
violence
frequently
occurs
in
clusters
in
many
cases
because
incidents
of
retaliation
follow
the
initial
shooting
and
are
very
difficult
to
prevent
i
am
often
asked
how
the
police
department
investigates
these
gun
violence
cases
especially
homicides
and
why
they
are
difficult
to
prevent
and
solve
here
are
some
of
the
strategies
and
tools
we
use
as
well
as
some
of
the
challenges
we
face
community
engagement
as
an
ongoing
effort
well
before
a
homicide
or
other
gun
crime
even
takes
place
our
patrol
and
school
resource
officers
sros
are
out
in
the
community
doing
their
best
to
build
relationships
establish
trust
make
contact
with
neighborhood
residents
and
develop
information
about
dangerous
individuals
who
pose
a
threat
to
others
this
is
key
to
both
preventing
and
solving
crimes
obviously
the
community
quickly
hears
about
serious
crimes
after
they
occur
through
the
media
neighborhood
blogs
and
word
of
mouth
what
most
residents
don
t
know
are
the
many
crimes
that
are
prevented
because
beat
officers
and
sros
develop
information
or
engage
in
proactive
field
work
which
allows
them
to
intervene
ahead
of
the
crime
these
officers
will
make
a
key
arrest
confiscate
a
gun
our
officers
take
an
average
of
a
gun
off
the
street
each
day
or
conduct
compliance
checks
to
assure
probationers
and
parolees
are
following
the
rules
that
allow
them
to
be
back
in
the
community
our
personnel
work
closely
with
many
community
organizations
that
provide
services
or
have
a
mission
to
prevent
violence
they
also
engage
the
faith
community
school
personnel
and
everyday
residents
to
prevent
and
solve
gun
crimes
whenever
possible
partnerships
with
other
law
enforcement
entities
rpd
personnel
work
with
many
other
police
corrections
and
prosecution
entities
to
address
violent
crime
in
richmond
this
includes
local
jurisdictions
close
to
us
like
san
pablo
pd
el
cerrito
pd
the
contra
costa
county
sheriff
s
department
ccso
bart
pd
and
others
it
also
includes
the
contra
costa
county
probation
department
especially
important
based
on
the
recent
realignment
of
california
s
corrections
system
that
shifts
responsibility
for
many
offenders
away
from
the
state
and
to
the
counties
instead
as
well
the
cdcr
state
corrections
parole
section
rpd
also
has
a
close
relationship
with
personnel
from
several
federal
agencies
including
the
fbi
atf
alcohol
tobacco
and
firearms
the
dea
and
customs
although
we
have
no
involvement
with
ice
the
immigration
section
of
customs
lastly
we
work
closely
with
county
state
and
federal
prosecution
agencies
including
the
contra
costa
district
attorney
the
state
department
of
justice
doj
and
the
u
s
attorney
s
office
most
of
our
violent
crime
cases
including
homicides
are
prosecuted
or
evaluated
for
prosecution
under
state
law
by
the
da
s
office
certain
gun
crimes
are
referred
to
the
u
s
attorney
s
office
for
prosecution
under
federal
law
when
more
serious
sentencing
options
are
appropriate
based
on
a
pattern
of
ongoing
violent
crimes
committed
by
the
offender
although
the
media
often
refer
to
many
crimes
in
our
immediate
area
as
having
been
committed
in
richmond
a
great
deal
of
our
retaliatory
gang
violence
involves
young
men
who
live
or
hang
out
in
unincorporated
north
richmond
which
is
not
part
of
the
city
because
of
this
a
significant
number
of
gun
crimes
associated
with
our
larger
community
are
the
responsibility
of
the
contra
costa
county
sheriff
s
department
this
means
it
s
essential
that
rpd
work
closely
with
the
sheriff
s
department
when
a
shooting
occurs
it
s
not
uncommon
for
the
perpetrators
to
flee
from
richmond
into
north
richmond
or
vice
versa
this
complicates
our
ability
to
make
arrests
and
close
cases
but
despite
this
reality
our
officers
and
detectives
communicate
on
an
ongoing
basis
with
ccso
deputies
and
investigators
we
also
work
regularly
with
investigators
from
the
da
s
office
the
city
of
richmond
contracts
with
the
da
s
office
to
have
two
assistant
das
in
our
headquarters
who
focus
exclusively
on
richmond
gun
crimes
and
other
criminal
cases
they
work
with
our
patrol
officers
and
detectives
to
give
special
attention
to
repeat
violent
offenders
they
review
cases
provide
immediate
feedback
answer
questions
and
provide
training
for
our
personnel
that
make
our
officers
more
effective
in
dealing
with
violent
crime
the
da
convenes
regular
meetings
to
discuss
richmond
homicides
and
crime
trends
these
meetings
involve
not
only
rpd
personnel
but
lead
investigators
from
other
local
state
and
federal
jurisdictions
in
addition
as
a
result
of
a
new
protocol
put
in
place
in
august
of
the
das
assigned
to
richmond
respond
to
most
homicide
scenes
to
provide
assistance
as
needed
this
can
help
with
prosecution
efforts
later
crime
scene
investigations
and
evidence
processing
our
department
has
officers
specifically
trained
as
crime
scene
investigators
csis
these
personnel
are
available
and
respond
to
the
scene
of
all
homicides
and
many
other
violent
crimes
csis
have
many
important
responsibilities
they
document
the
physical
nature
and
characteristics
of
crime
scenes
which
is
painstaking
and
can
be
quite
time
consuming
this
typically
involves
taking
photographs
collecting
ballistic
evidence
bullet
casings
unexpended
rounds
etc
gathering
other
evidence
clothing
items
left
behind
by
the
offender
taking
latent
prints
when
appropriate
and
working
closely
with
the
other
investigators
at
the
scene
processing
crime
scenes
and
evidence
is
very
little
like
what
s
portrayed
on
television
evidence
handling
at
a
crime
scene
is
complex
for
example
people
sometimes
wonder
why
the
body
of
the
deceased
isn
t
moved
or
taken
away
from
the
scene
of
a
homicide
more
quickly
they
may
perceive
this
as
disrespect
or
lack
of
caring
by
the
officers
what
they
don
t
realize
is
that
a
detailed
inspection
of
the
deceased
at
the
scene
including
the
position
of
the
body
bullet
entry
and
exit
wounds
condition
of
the
deceased
s
clothing
and
many
other
factors
can
be
key
to
solving
a
case
later
on
it
is
a
lengthy
process
in
addition
it
usually
takes
time
for
the
county
coroner
to
respond
to
homicide
scenes
to
do
their
job
the
department
s
csis
pay
close
attention
to
ballistic
evidence
at
the
scene
there
may
be
numerous
bullet
casings
and
even
unexpended
rounds
spread
around
a
wide
area
that
need
to
be
collected
in
some
cases
a
gun
may
be
located
occasionally
one
that
belonged
to
the
victim
rpd
pays
the
ccso
crime
lab
to
process
many
of
these
items
and
to
enter
check
firearms
evidence
in
ibis
the
federal
integrated
ballistics
identification
system
the
ibis
system
records
the
distinctive
pattern
left
on
bullet
evidence
which
can
then
later
be
matched
to
the
exact
gun
that
fired
it
in
much
the
same
way
as
fingerprints
can
be
matched
to
the
person
who
left
them
behind
due
to
the
volume
of
cases
handled
by
the

lab
ibis
comparisons
can
take

evidence
occurs
in
minutes
and
is
usually
matched
right
away
to
a
known
criminal
facilitating
an
immediate
arrest
in
reality
many
dna
cases
take
months
to
be
processed
there
is
not
necessarily
a
match
to
anyone
since
the
dna
database
is
limited
to
persons
who
have
dna
samples
taken
from
them
at
the
time
of
a
previous
arrest
or
who
are
in
the
database
for
other
reasons
dna
analysis
is
extremely
expensive
for
the
submitting
agency
crime
labs
are
overwhelmed
with
evidence
from
richmond
and
other
cities
in
the
county
one
of
the
frustrations
for
our
investigators
is
the
time
it
takes
to
get
lab
results
physical
evidence
can
be
one
of
the
strongest
parts
of
a
criminal
case
yet
it
is
not
uncommon
for
months
to
pass
before
analysis
results
related
to
key
pieces
of
evidence
comes
back
to
investigators
this
can
delay
the
ability
to
link
a
suspect
to
a
crime
assuming
a
suspect
has
been
identified
witnesses
one
of
the
first
things
police
officers
try
to
do
when
they
respond
to
the
scene
of
a
homicide
or
serious
shooting
is
to
identify
and
speak
to
witnesses
unfortunately
this
is
one
of
the
most
difficult
parts
of
the
investigation
in
many
many
cases
particularly
those
involving
gang
related
violence
witnesses
are
unwilling
to
come
forward
or
talk
with
the
police
even
when
they
have
seen
or
know
something
about
the
crime
this
is
often
because
of
the
brutality
and
brazenness
of
shootings
which
frequently
occur
in
places
open
to
public
view
it
is
also
common
in
cases
where
gang
dynamics
are
at
play
for
rivals
to
know
one
another
while
neighborhood
residents
may
be
totally
unfamiliar
with
who
these
actors
are
offenders
generally
subscribe
to
a
strict
street
code
that
discourage
cooperation
with
legitimate
entities
such
as
police
and
government
there
are
many
reasons
witnesses
and
even
surviving
victims
in
many
cases
choose
not
to
work
with
the
police
some
of
these
reasons
include
fear
of
retaliation
perception
that
there
is
no
point
of
getting
involved
since
the
system
doesn
t
work
anyway
distrust
of
the
police
and
other
authorities
friendship
or
family
ties
to
the
perpetrators
cultural
or
language
barriers
bad
personal
or
family
experience
s
with
the
criminal
justice
system
current
arrest
warrants
or
other
charges
pending
against
them
they
are
on
parole
or
probation
they
are
not
confident
what
they
saw
or
heard
or
they
will
handle
it
themselves
perpetuating
the
cycle
of
violence
we
are
sometimes
asked
why
do
you
have
so
many
officers
at
a
serious
crime
scene
in
addition
to
securing
the
crime
scene
perimeter
which
can
be
challenging
depending
on
the
size
of
the
scene
the
main
reason
for
the
large
number
of
officers
and
detectives
is
to
make
every
possible
effort
to
identify
and
speak
to
witnesses
homicides
and
other
shootings
are
very
complicated
investigations
that
involve
piecing
together
many
facts
from
different
sources
that
we
address
with
a
team
approach
in
order
to
increase
our
accuracy
and
efficiency
time
is
of
the
essence
in
these
cases
if
witnesses
are
not
contacted
as
soon
as
possible
it
may
be
impossible
to
identify
or
locate
them
later
on
you
may
have
heard
of
or
watched
the
tv
show
the
first
which
portrays
how
critical
it
is
to
gather
evidence
and
identify
witnesses
during
the
first
hours
following
the
crime
when
it
comes
to
engaging
with
witnesses
however
the
process
would
better
be
called
the
first
minutes
the
more
time
that
passes
following
a
homicide
or
serious
shooting
the
more
difficult
it
is
to
identify
and
locate
witnesses
when
investigators
fail
to
locate
helpful
witnesses
initially
they
make
every
effort
to
continue
this
process
in
the
weeks
and
months
that
follow
the
crime
sometimes
important
leads
come
from
informants
also
known
as
confidential
informants
or
cis
sometimes
information
comes
from
neighbors
or
other
eyewitnesses
close
to
the
scene
of
the
crime
who
may
need
persuasion
or
reassurance
over
time
to
get
involved
sometimes
information
comes
from
a
family
member
or
associate
of
the
suspect
s
who
develop
a
motivation
to
work
with
the
police
there
are
cases
however
where
no
one
comes
forward
and
no
one
can
be
identified
to
interview
this
is
a
problem
because
eyewitnesses
are
equally
as
valuable
as
physical
evidence
in
shooting
cases
a
major
problem
we
face
in
dealing
with
witnesses
is
that
they
are
not
always
reliable
sometimes
a
witness
has
such
a
lengthy
criminal
record
and
or
such
questionable
motivation
there
is
little
chance
a
prosecutor
can
put
them
on
the
stand
to
testify
for
fear
they
might
actually
jeopardize
the
case
another
problem
can
be
locating
witnesses
later
on
for
preliminary
exams
or
trial
for
example
because
individuals
may
leave
the
area
become
uncooperative
or
generally
make
themselves
as
scarce
as
possible
to
avoid
testifying
on
tv
and
in
the
movies
witnesses
not
associated
with
the
suspect
or
victim
almost
always
seem
to
pick
the
suspect
s
out
of
a
photo
or
police
lineup
in
reality
witnesses
may
only
catch
a
fleeting
glance
of
a
suspect
it
may
be
dark
clothing
worn
by
the
suspect
s
may
make
it
difficult
to
see
them
and
things
often
happen
incredibly
fast
during
the
commission
of
a
crime
eyewitness
testimony
is
not
always
reliable
so
investigators
and
prosecutors
have
to
be
very
careful
about
how
this
evidence
is
developed
and
used
on
a
positive
note
because
of
the
relationships
many
of
our
officers
have
developed
with
the
community
it
is
not
uncommon
for
beat
officers
and
sros
to
be
told
about
the
word
on
the
street
going
around
about
a
particular
shooting
this
information
may
not
be
enough
to
make
a
solid
case
against
a
suspect
but
it
can
provide
us
with
a
starting
point
for
further
investigation
who
decides
about
charging
a
suspect
if
a
suspect
is
actually
identified
and
there
is
probable
cause
for
an
arrest
a
state
or
federal
prosecutor
must
still
make
a
decision
about
whether
there
is
enough
evidence
to
obtain
a
signed
warrant
from
a
judge
and
ultimately
to
try
the
case
in
court
many
people
believe
the
police
make
charging
decisions
that
involve
suspects
but
this
is
not
how
the
system
works
charges
against
suspects
have
to
be
made
by
prosecutors
and
prosecutors
base
their
charging
decisions
on
multiple
factors
it
is
not
uncommon
for
a
district
attorney
or
federal
prosecutor
to
send
a
case
back
to
detectives
requesting
more
information
or
follow
up
before
they
will
move
forward
with
prosecution
in
some
instances
it
is
simply
not
possible
for
detectives
to
obtain
additional
information
so
a
case
may
be
stalled
for
months
or
even
years
this
is
often
extremely
disappointing
to
family
members
or
friends
of
the
victim
who
may
believe
a
case
is
going
nowhere
because
the
police
and
or
prosecutors
simply
don
t
care
this
is
simply
not
true
nothing
makes
officers
and
detectives
more
frustrated
than
knowing
who
committed
a
crime
yet
not
having
sufficient
evidence
to
get
a
suspect
charged
and
tried
in
court
this
is
not
an
uncommon
occurrence
in
richmond
homicide
cases
prosecutors
are
legally
and
morally
obligated
to
not
file
charges
against
a
suspect
unless
they
believe
they
can
convince
a
jury
of
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt
of
the
suspect
s
guilt
people
often
ask
why
charges
aren
t
filed
in
an
effort
to
make
a
suspect
go
to
trial
even
if
the
prosecutor
knows
the
trial
will
end
in
an
acquittal
the
reason
for
this
is
that
such
conduct
could
be
construed
as
malicious
prosecution
resources
almost
every
police
agency
believes
it
needs
more
resources
to
solve
and
of
course
prevent
homicides
and
other
serious
gun
crimes
the
plain
truth
however
is
that
the
need
for
additional
resources
especially
personnel
is
much
greater
in
richmond
than
many
other
communities
simply
because
of
the
amount
of
gang
violence
and
the
overall
challenges
of
crime
in
the
city
when
i
ask
members
of
the
public
how
many
sworn
police
officers
we
have
in
richmond
i
get
answers
like
or
we
actually
have
sworn
personnel
which
includes
everyone
from
the
newest
recruit
who
may
still
need
to
go
through
a
basic
police
academy
or
be
partnered
up
with
a
training
officer
for
on
the
job
training
all
the
way
up
to
me
the
chief
about
of
our
personnel
are
patrol
officers
about
another
are
supervisors
patrol
sergeants
and
lieutenants
and
about
between
of
these
personnel
are
on
duty
at
any
given
time
patrolling
the
entire
city
the
remainder
of
our
sworn
staff
are
detectives
officers
assigned
to
special
details
like
the
regulatory
unit
or
recruiting
and
training
as
well
as
administrative
personnel
in
addition
most
people
do
not
realize
that
we
always
have
personnel
on
leave
days
vacation
going
through
mandatory
training
recovering
from
injuries
or
on
long
term
disability
and
otherwise
away
from
the
job
for
a
myriad
of
reasons
there
are
approximately
a
dozen
investigators
available
to
handle
homicides
although
about
half
of
them
are
primarily
assigned
to
work
robberies
homicides
tend
to
come
in
groups
so
the
reality
is
that
these
personnel
can
be
spread
very
thin
homicide
investigators
may
be
called
out
day
or
night
days
a
week
and
then
work
long
long
hours
to
follow
up
on
a
murder
or
serious
shooting
in
that
key
period
following
the
crime
s
thanks
to
the
support
of
the
city
council
and
the
city
manager
rpd
has
been
fortunate
that
our
overall
staffing
levels
have
increased
over
the
past
years
despite
these
increases
however
we
are
still
staffed
below
what
a
city
with
our
level
of
crime
ideally
needs
our
department
utilizes
a
variety
of
technologies
to
assist
us
with
the
investigation
of
violent
crime
including
crime
lab
services
which
come
with
a
hefty
price
tag
through
the
sheriff
s
department
closed
circuit
tv
also
expensive
and
complicated
to
operate
maintain
and
monitor
shotspotter
which
triangulates
gunfire
to
provide
the
location
and
type
of
gun
being
fired
but
it
can
t
help
with
the
fact
that
shooters
generally
don
t
stick
around
for
the
police
and
license
plate
readers
lprs
residents
often
assume
these
technologies
are
available
and
functioning
throughout
the
entire
city
but
because
of
cost
they
are
mostly
limited
to
neighborhoods
with
higher
levels
of
violent
crime
this
is
frustrating
to
many
members
of
the
public
and
police
officers
alike
who
wish
there
was
a
camera
or
a
gunshot
sensor
available
and
operating
in
every
area
where
crimes
occur
the
department
also
relies
on
our
crime
analysis
resources
including
our
ability
to
track
field
contacts
provide
timely
crime
data
to
our
personnel
and
conduct
meaningful
analysis
of
crime
trends
we
have
one
crime
analyst
who
works
behind
the
scenes
with
our
officers
and
detectives
to
track
serious
crimes
including
gang
activity
this
has
to
be
done
carefully
and
accurately
to
protect
people
s
rights
and
to
be
most
effective
thanks
to
recent
action
by
the
city
council
the
department
is
contracting
for
a
service
known
as
predictive
policing
which
is
being
successfully
used
in
other
cities
such
as
los
angeles
and
new
york
city
to
utilize
complex
algorithms
in
predicting
where
future
crimes
are
likely
to
occur
so
greater
resources
can
be
placed
in
these
locations
it
sounds
like
science
fiction
but
this
process
has
a
track
record
of
proven
positive
results
ceasefire
the
richmond
police
department
is
part
of
the
ceasefire
lifelines
to
healing
working
group
and
overall
effort
the
ceasefire
program
cannot
prevent
all
homicides
but
it
is
recognized
as
a
best
practice
around
the
country
to
reduce
shootings
the
ceasefire
program
involves
police
detectives
and
other
key
individuals
identifying
persons
involved
in
or
at
high
risk
for
committing
gun
violence
these
individuals
are
then
called
in
to
participate
in
a
discussion
about
the
law
enforcement
consequences
greater
police
attention
enhanced
prosecution
efforts
etc
for
continuing
to
commit
shootings
they
also
hear
an
important
message
from
the
community
which
is
that
people
care
about
them
and
that
a
support
system
exists
to
help
them
turn
their
lives
around
this
effort
involves
community
groups
service
providers
the
faith
community
formerly
incarcerated
individuals
and
many
others
there
are
no
instant
or
magical
outcomes
associated
with
the
ceasefire
program
but
real
prevention
and
long
term
successes
are
hard
to
measure
and
difficult
to
achieve
this
program
requires
the
persistent
dedication
and
commitment
of
many
people
and
groups
it
also
requires
sufficient
funding
and
resources
to
provide
effective
interventions
to
provide
sustainable
interventions
shooters
who
want
to
make
major
life
changes
often
need
life
skills
training
employment
mental
health
and
substance
abuse
services
anger
management
and
conflict
resolution
skills
education
and
other
assistance
few
of
these
services
are
available
to
the
degree
they
are
needed
in
our
community
despite
the
best
efforts
of
many
groups
and
people
no
giving
up
here
s
one
especially
important
thing
i
d
like
people
to
know
about
our
homicide
investigations
we
don
t
give
up
homicide
cases
are
never
closed
even
when
evidence
is
very
limited
and
no
witnesses
have
come
forward
even
when
we
have
exhausted
all
leads
unsolved
homicide
cases
remain
open
in
case
information
or
evidence
is
developed
later
sometimes
years
later
that
helps
us
solve
a
case
and
charge
a
suspect
a
good
example
of
this
is
a
homicide
case
that
our
investigators
just
made
an
arrest
on
we
know
how
important
this
kind
of
closure
is
to
victims
families
and
friends
it
s
also
important
to
our
personnel
who
have
often
spent
several
thousand
hours
investigating
a
case
our
personnel
are
invested
in
these
cases
another
important
thing
to
keep
in
mind
the
department
offers
a
standing
reward
for
information
leading
to
the
arrest
and
conviction
of
the
person
or
persons
who
committed
any
homicide
even
a
homicide
many
years
ago
lesser
rewards
may
be
available
for
critical
information
that
helps
us
with
other
serious
shooting
cases
i
hope
this
information
has
helped
explain
the
ongoing
work
and
challenges
faced
by
the
police
and
others
in
addressing
the
problem
of
gun
violence
in
our
community
this
work
is
difficult
and
there
are
many
obstacles
to
achieving
success
we
are
fortunate
to
have
considerable
support
and
an
ongoing
commitment
for
this
work
from
our
city
council
and
other
regional
elected
leaders
we
also
have
a
caring
group
of
residents
who
are
highly
invested
in
this
effort
that
said
nothing
is
easy
and
our
needs
remain
considerable
i
appreciate
your
time
in
learning
more
about
these
issues
and
your
willingness
to
partner
with
us
as
we
move
