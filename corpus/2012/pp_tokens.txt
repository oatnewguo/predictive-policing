introduction
the
future
of
policing
blinks
on
a
computer
screen
in
downtown
los
angeles
n
on
that
screen
police
have
predicted
the
next
area
of
potential
criminal
activity
n
based
on
crime
data
collection
analysis
and
computer
modeling
the
los
angeles
police
department
lapd
is
directing
patrol
officers
to
a
targeted
block
of
expected
crime
n
in
the
lapd
s
real
time
analysis
and
critical
response
division
a
new
concept
of
predictive
policing
is
being
developed
based
on
past
crime
patterns
and
sophisticated
computer
algorithms
n
promoted
as
the
next
smart
policing
weapon
in
the
war
on
crime
its
promise
is
to
predict
crime
before
it
happens
n
in
another
part
of
california
police
stake
out
an
area
of
predicted
criminal
activity
as
described
by
the
new
york
times
in
a
parking
garage
forecast
to
be
the
location
of
future
car
thefts
two
women
are
arrested
after
peering
into
car
windows
n
one
has
an
open
arrest
warrant
n
the
other
is
caught
carrying
drugs
n
without
the
predictive
tip
it
is
arguable
that
peering
into
windows
in
a
parking
garage
is
sufficient
reason
to
be
stopped
and
detained
by
police
n
but
with
the
predictive
technologies
the
constitutional
questions
become
more
difficult
can
a
computer
program
that
predicts
the
probability
of
future
crime
locations
change
fourth
amendment
protections
in
the
targeted
area
are
data
driven
hunches
any
more
reliable
than
personal
hunches
traditionally
deemed
insufficient
to
justify
reasonable
suspicion
n
what
measures
exist
to
examine
the
reliability
and
accuracy
of
these
new
policing
tools
n
these
questions
and
more
are
raised
by
the
use
of
any
predictive
policing
strategy
this
article
addresses
the
fourth
amendment
consequences
of
this
police
innovation
analyzing
the
effect
of
predictive
policing
on
the
concept
of
reasonable
suspicion
more
broadly
this
article
addresses
the
theoretical
and
doctrinal
impact
of
predictive
policing
on
the
fourth
amendment
leaving
for
future
projects
an
empirical
study
of
the
program
s
effectiveness
or
practical
results
in
its
current
form
the
technology
is
too
new
to
make
any
definitive
conclusion
on
its
merits
as
a
crime
suppression
technique
n
yet
as
can
be
seen
by
the
growing
interest
in
the
concept
of
predictive
policing
in
the
form
of
test
programs
major
government
grants
national
news
articles
and
awards
the
future
is
now
and
the
constitutional
implications
of
that
future
must
now
be
addressed
n
this
article
examines
predictive
policing
in
the
context
of
the
larger
constitutional
framework
of
prediction
and
the
fourth
amendment
many
aspects
of
current
fourth
amendment
law
are
implicitly
or
explicitly
based
on
prediction
n
search
warrants
are
predictions
that
contraband
will
be
found
in
a
particular
location
n
investigative
detentions
are
predictions
that
the
person
is
committing
or
about
to
commit
a
crime
n
fourth
amendment
concepts
like
probable
cause
reasonable
suspicion
n
informant
tips
n
drug
courier
profiles
n
high
crime
areas
n
and
others
are
based
on
evaluating
levels
of
probability
that
criminal
activity
will
occur
or
is
occurring
n
predictive
policing
both
fits
within
this
established
tradition
and
also
challenges
it
in
novel
ways
as
will
be
argued
predictive
policing
may
in
fact
necessitate
a
reconsideration
of
some
of
the
existing
reasonable
suspicion
doctrine
as
well
as
point
to
refinements
in
future
application
n
the
article
concludes
that
in
its
idealized
form
predictive
policing
will
impact
reasonable
suspicion
analysis
and
become
an
important
factor
in
a
court
s
fourth
amendment
calculus
while
never
enough
alone
this
predictive
information
will
be
used
to
justify
stops
under
existing
fourth
amendment
precedent
evolving
from
a
rich
academic
tradition
of
criminological
insights
around
crime
and
place
and
building
on
real
world
experiments
with
hotspot
policing
the
theory
of
predictive
policing
has
both
academic
and
practical
grounding
n
in
addition
in
its
initial
implementation
focused
on
specific
types
of
property
crime
in
specific
locations
under
controlled
tests
the
predictions
appear
to
have
positive
results
in
reducing
crime
n
at
the
same
time
the
underlying
rationale
of
why
predictive
policing
may
be
effective
for
certain
crimes
and
areas
may
actually
lead
to
a
limitation
on
its
applicability
these
limitations
should
inform
future
fourth
amendment
analysis
in
determining
reasonable
suspicion
further
these
limitations
raise
deeper
questions
about
the
reliability
transparency
and
application
of
the
technology
articulating
and
framing
those
theoretical
and
practical
limitations
is
the
task
of
this
article
part
i
of
this
article
canvasses
the
current
state
of
predictive
policing
in
the
united
states
placed
within
the
context
of
a
two
decade
evolution
to
data
driven
and
intelligence
led
policing
predictive
policing
is
the
next
logical
step
in
using
crime
data
and
mapping
technologies
to
reduce
crime
n
this
part
briefly
examines
the
history
theoretical
background
and
current
research
on
predicting
crime
patterns
with
a
focus
on
the
types
of
crimes
that
police
departments
and
researchers
are
using
to
test
the
predictive
policing
model
part
ii
of
this
article
examines
prediction
as
a
significant
if
unexamined
aspect
of
the
fourth
amendment
doctrine
predicting
criminal
activities
based
on
probabilities
rests
at
the
core
of
fourth
amendment
concepts
such
as
probable
cause
and
reasonable
suspicion
n
in
addition
the
supreme
court
has
addressed
the
predictive
value
of
information
including
informant
tips
profiling
and
high
crime
areas
in
a
range
of
cases
n
this
part
distills
the
principles
emerging
from
these
cases
in
an
effort
to
ground
an
analysis
of
predictive
policing
part
iii
applies
the
relevant
fourth
amendment
analogies
to
the
problem
of
predictive
policing
depending
on
the
fourth
amendment
analogy
chosen
for
analysis
tips
profiles
high
crime
areas
different
problems
arise
notably
however
under
any
of
the
analogies
courts
will
come
out
with
the
same
answer
under
current
law
as
will
be
argued
predictive
policing
will
alter
the
reasonable
suspicion
analysis
in
a
direct
way
changing
the
current
calculus
to
favor
a
finding
of
reasonable
suspicion
whether
viewed
positively
or
negatively
as
a
constitutional
matter
this
shift
points
to
larger
problems
with
a
weakened
reasonable
suspicion
standard
if
a
law
enforcement
computer
algorithm
can
change
fourth
amendment
freedoms
then
courts
have
an
extra
responsibility
to
ensure
that
the
technology
meets
reasonable
standards
of
reliability
and
accuracy
part
iv
of
the
article
addresses
the
present
and
future
concerns
with
using
predictive
policing
technologies
first
this
part
looks
at
the
importance
of
understanding
why
predictive
technologies
work
and
it
links
the
underlying
research
on
prediction
to
the
fourth
amendment
analysis
that
courts
will
soon
be
required
to
make
in
general
the
predictive
theories
that
have
been
studied
focus
exclusively
on
property
crimes
one
concern
with
the
adoption
of
these
technologies
is
that
they
may
become
divorced
from
the
underlying
logic
of
why
certain
crime
locations
can
be
predicted
in
other
words
the
studies
that
focus
on
property
crimes
in
fixed
areas
could
be
applied
unthinkingly
to
other
crimes
in
other
contexts
in
addition
this
part
looks
at
ways
to
assess
the
reliability
transparency
and
accuracy
of
the
programs
as
well
as
the
need
to
create
mechanisms
to
avoid
manipulation
bias
or
uneven
application
predictive
policing
like
many
new
law
enforcement
strategies
raises
issues
of
class
based
and
race
based
targeting
as
well
as
general
civil
liberty
concerns
finally
this
part
looks
at
some
of
the
potential
unintended
consequences
of
this
technology
that
may
actually
make
certain
police
stops
more
difficult
to
justify
as
a
constitutional
matter
i
predictive
policing
an
introduction
predictive
policing
refers
to
any
policing
strategy
or
tactic
that
develops
and
uses
information
and
advanced
analysis
to
inform
forward
thinking
crime
prevention
n
more
objective
than
a
patrol
officer
s
hunch
about
an
area
predictive
policing
uses
the
power
of
big
data
to
isolate
patterns
in
otherwise
random
acts
n
predictive
policing
has
become
a
generic
term
for
any
crime
fighting
approach
that
includes
a
reliance
on
information
technology
usually
crime
mapping
data
and
analysis
criminology
theory
predictive
algorithms
and
the
use
of
this
data
to
improve
crime
suppression
on
the
streets
n
in
simple
terms
predictive
policing
involves
computer
models
that
predict
areas
of
future
crime
locations
from
past
crime
statistics
and
other
data
n
a
simple
predictive
policing
model
might
take
historical
data
about
a
particular
type
of
crime
the
location
and
time
of
that
crime
and
plot
those
past
crimes
in
a
way
that
would
inform
crime
analysts
about
an
unusual
cluster
of
crimes
n
as
will
be
discussed
later
research
studies
support
the
accuracy
of
this
historically
based
prediction
for
certain
crimes
under
certain
circumstances
n
a
more
complex
predictive
policing
model
might
involve
event
based
concerns
such
as
arrests
calls
for
service
or
incident
reports
in
combination
with
place
based
concerns
such
as
addresses
of
known
gang
members
arrestees
parolees
or
places
of
frequent
violence
or
unrest
n
this
information
could
be
weighted
by
types
of
crime
violent
crime
property
crime
and
even
include
information
about
particular
individuals
n
gang
activity
traffic
patterns
environmental
factors
and
other
local
information
n
a
computer
algorithm
would
then
analyze
the
data
by
searching
for
patterns
in
areas
of
statistically
more
probable
criminal
activity
n
most
relevantly
this
predictive
information
would
then
inform
police
administrators
about
how
to
allocate
resources
to
target
that
specific
type
of
crime
and
in
some
sophisticated
programs
this
information
would
be
provided
to
officers
patrolling
the
streets
in
real
time
through
a
squad
car
computer
or
mobile
device
n
as
an
example
currently
the
los
angeles
police
department
has
undertaken
an
ambitious
pilot
project
to
test
the
feasibility
of
predictive
policing
n
under
the
leadership
of
former
police
chief
william
bratton
and
with
the
collaboration
of
scholars
at
several
california
universities
the
police
have
begun
to
test
the
effectiveness
of
predictive
policing
focusing
on
certain
crimes
in
certain
areas
n
as
developed
by
lapd
captain
sean
malinowski
and
based
on
the
algorithms
created
by
ucla
professor
jeffrey
brantingham
and
university
of
santa
cruz
professor
george
mohler
the
project
focuses
on
three
specific
types
of
property
crime
burglary
automobile
theft
and
theft
from
automobiles
n
based
on
three
years
worth
of
data
weighting
more
recent
crimes
more
than
older
crimes
and
observing
patterns
the
algorithm
seeks
to
identify
by
foot
areas
of
probable
criminal
activity
n
officers
are
then
directed
to
those
areas
of
predicted
crime
initial
results
have
been
successful
as
non
violent
crime
has
dropped
in
those
areas
further
testing
is
being
done
in
a
controlled
experiment
to
test
the
reliability
of
the
results
n
a
similar
experiment
is
being
conducted
in
santa
cruz
california
in
santa
cruz
officers
are
provided
daily
crime
forecasts
every
morning
at
roll
call
which
direct
them
to
patrol
certain
designated
areas
n
each
forecast
has
a
specific
prediction
for
example
there
is
a
likelihood
of
a
car
theft
in
a
particular
downtown
garage
on
a
particular
day
n
the
times
when
those
car
thefts
are
most
likely
to
occur
are
also
listed
n
based
on
the
research
conducted
by
professor
george
mohler
the
predictive
policing
algorithm
is
modeled
on
seismic
aftershock
theory
and
demonstrates
that
certain
property
crimes
again
burglary
auto
theft
and
theft
from
auto
can
be
identified
and
predicted
in
small
by
foot
areas
n
police
officers
are
then
sent
to
patrol
those
areas
as
part
of
their
regular
beats
n
according
to
a
santa
cruz
spokesperson
thirteen
people
have
been
stopped
in
the
designated
areas
in
the
first
six
months
of
the
experiment
n
it
is
those
individuals
stopped
within
a
predicted
area
that
are
the
subject
of
this
article
whether
or
not
predictive
policing
works
as
a
matter
of
crime
suppression
it
raises
fourth
amendment
challenges
for
individuals
stopped
in
those
areas
the
los
angeles
and
santa
cruz
police
departments
may
be
ahead
of
other
cities
in
testing
the
predictive
policing
model
but
they
are
by
no
means
the
only
law
enforcement
agencies
using
the
technique
jurisdictions
as
diverse
as
palm
beach
county
florida
n
memphis
tennessee
n
chicago
illinois
n
minneapolis
minnesota
n
and
dallas
texas
n
are
testing
predictive
policing
tactics
with
federal
seed
money
from
the
department
of
justice
other
jurisdictions
are
testing
the
technology
n
in
addition
cities
with
particularized
crime
problems
are
using
predictive
policing
to
combat
those
specific
issues
n
there
are
at
least
three
reasons
why
predictive
policing
has
drawn
national
attention
and
federal
financing
n
first
it
is
cost
effective
in
an
era
of
shrinking
municipal
and
state
budgets
n
second
it
offers
promise
of
a
high
tech
progressive
sounding
plan
to
stop
crime
which
offers
significant
public
relations
benefits
n
third
from
early
tests
in
admittedly
small
areas
the
strategy
appears
to
reduce
crime
with
minimal
disruption
to
regular
policing
responsibilities
n
while
the
jury
is
out
on
the
accuracy
n
and
cost
savings
attendant
to
adopting
a
predictive
policing
model
n
there
is
little
doubt
that
adoption
of
the
terminology
and
the
data
driven
technology
is
growing
and
will
influence
police
departments
courts
and
criminal
suspects
for
years
to
come
n
a
predictive
policing
in
context
predicting
future
crime
patterns
from
past
crime
statistics
is
neither
as
futuristic
nor
as
far
fetched
as
it
might
initially
sound
in
fact
predictive
policing
can
be
viewed
as
part
of
an
evolution
to
intelligence
driven
policing
techniques
that
rely
on
scientifically
grounded
principles
and
decades
of
criminological
theory
on
crime
and
place
n
this
section
briefly
sets
out
the
history
theory
and
research
studies
that
support
the
predictive
policing
model
while
current
models
of
predictive
policing
do
not
purport
to
be
directly
based
on
these
theories
this
criminological
research
informs
any
evaluation
of
its
legitimacy
as
a
tool
that
could
have
constitutional
consequences
intelligence
led
policing
and
theories
of
crime
and
place
in
recent
years
intelligence
led
policing
has
become
an
influential
theory
in
the
growing
study
of
law
enforcement
practices
n
distinct
from
other
theories
such
as
community
policing
n
or
the
broken
windows
theory
of
policing
n
intelligence
led
policing
focuses
on
crime
data
analysis
and
targeted
police
efforts
in
response
to
that
data
n
large
cities
such
as
new
york
city
los
angeles
and
chicago
have
embraced
crime
mapping
technologies
using
objective
crime
data
to
determine
police
staffing
and
patrols
n
problem
areas
are
identified
through
crime
statistics
and
significant
police
resources
are
directed
at
those
particular
areas
n
as
evidenced
by
a
significant
drop
in
crime
rates
in
these
cities
these
types
of
smart
policing
tactics
have
been
widely
hailed
as
successful
innovations
in
the
law
enforcement
community
n
at
one
level
predictive
policing
is
merely
the
next
iteration
of
this
intelligence
led
policing
concept
n
analysts
have
moved
from
identifying
past
crime
patterns
to
predicting
the
next
crime
location
within
that
pattern
n
to
take
an
easy
example
if
there
are
assault
arrests
every
saturday
evening
at
a
particular
bar
at
closing
time
then
it
would
not
be
difficult
to
predict
that
on
a
future
saturday
night
there
might
be
a
bar
fight
at
that
location
stationing
a
police
officer
at
the
door
at
closing
time
might
prevent
future
fights
the
theory
of
predictive
policing
is
that
by
aggregating
all
reported
crimes
with
similar
time
place
and
crime
criteria
important
insights
into
larger
crime
patterns
in
a
jurisdiction
could
be
obtained
this
focus
on
identifiable
places
of
criminal
activity
exists
within
a
well
developed
theoretical
construct
that
criminologists
have
been
developing
for
decades
it
is
now
generally
acknowledged
that
crime
does
not
randomly
disperse
across
a
geographic
area
n
instead
crime
is
clustered
in
particular
areas
that
usually
can
be
explained
as
a
function
of
certain
environmental
factors
that
create
vulnerabilities
for
victims
at
certain
times
n
these
hotspots
of
crime
have
been
well
documented
in
academic
literature
and
confirmed
by
daily
police
reports
n
the
result
is
that
crime
disproportionately
affects
certain
victims
at
particular
places
n
traditionally
this
type
of
hotspot
analysis
would
involve
a
retrospective
mapping
of
crime
clusters
in
a
particular
area
reported
crimes
would
be
mapped
by
coordinates
on
a
searchable
computer
map
and
areas
of
heightened
criminal
activity
would
be
noted
n
use
of
hotspot
technology
has
resulted
in
some
surprising
results
n
for
example
half
of
the
crime
in
seattle
over
a
fourteen
year
period
could
be
isolated
to
only
of
city
streets
n
similarly
researchers
in
minneapolis
minnesota
found
that
of
street
addresses
and
intersections
in
minneapolis
generated
of
all
dispatched
police
calls
for
service
n
this
type
of
analysis
can
be
broken
down
by
type
of
crime
and
location
researchers
in
boston
found
that
only
of
street
segments
accounted
for
of
all
street
robberies
over
a
twenty
eight
year
period
n
traditional
hotspot
analysis
can
also
isolate
patterns
in
time
of
crime
n
or
locations
of
crime
n
to
be
clear
traditional
hotspot
mapping
does
not
directly
present
a
theory
to
predict
future
crime
clearly
repeated
patterns
of
localized
crime
suggest
an
inference
that
the
environmental
conditions
are
ripe
for
future
crime
n
but
the
identification
of
hotspots
does
not
necessarily
involve
prediction
predictive
policing
takes
this
traditional
retrospective
analysis
and
applies
it
prospectively
different
theories
have
been
posited
for
why
concentration
of
criminal
activity
occurs
event
based
theories
like
the
routine
activities
theory
suggest
that
crime
is
likely
to
occur
when
motivated
offenders
converge
suitable
targets
exist
and
capable
guardians
are
lacking
n
place
based
theories
focus
instead
on
vulnerabilities
in
the
location
as
the
reason
for
the
criminal
activity
n
these
vulnerabilities
can
include
simple
factors
such
as
poor
lighting
lack
of
police
surveillance
attractive
victims
or
easy
escape
routes
among
many
other
possibilities
of
course
a
place
does
not
create
crime
n
so
more
contextual
theories
have
been
developed
such
as
pattern
theory
which
examines
the
environmental
backcloth
n
as
inviting
a
space
for
criminal
activity
n
other
scholars
have
offered
an
opportunity
theory
that
focuses
on
the
availability
of
criminal
targets
as
the
determining
factor
for
criminal
acts
since
criminals
tend
to
stay
local
and
look
for
easy
opportunities
n
no
matter
the
chosen
theory
the
recognition
that
the
risk
of
crime
increases
because
of
identifiable
environmental
factors
has
clear
implications
for
predictive
policing
n
if
police
can
identify
a
location
of
potential
crime
and
understand
the
relevant
environmental
factors
for
that
predicted
crime
then
police
can
focus
their
resources
on
those
locations
as
future
problem
areas
for
police
attention
n
this
insight
about
place
and
crime
answers
a
critical
question
for
any
policing
theory
in
asking
why
people
commit
particular
crimes
at
particular
locations
we
generate
information
not
only
about
when
they
may
commit
the
next
crime
but
also
how
to
stop
it
for
example
applying
routine
activities
theory
to
a
pattern
of
residential
burglaries
requires
the
presence
of
an
offender
a
target
and
the
absence
of
a
guardian
n
an
offender
will
target
a
home
or
homes
in
an
area
if
vulnerabilities
exist
such
as
the
absence
of
law
enforcement
weak
structural
protections
or
a
lack
of
community
vigilance
n
adding
a
guardian
a
police
officer
to
the
location
of
those
burglaries
will
likely
remove
the
vulnerability
decreasing
the
likelihood
of
another
burglary
similarly
the
opportunity
theory
might
argue
the
following
having
targeted
a
particular
home
for
the
first
time
a
burglar
acquires
knowledge
to
inform
future
targeting
decisions
this
may
concern
the
internal
layout
of
a
burgled
property
the
ease
of
access
and
escape
the
products
that
may
be
found
were
the
offender
to
return
the
risks
of
identification
and
so
on
this
knowledge
is
likely
to
reduce
uncertainty
about
nearby
homes
n
changing
the
ease
of
access
or
escape
or
adding
uncertainty
in
the
form
of
locks
police
presence
security
lights
etc
may
alter
the
calculus
for
a
potential
opportunity
thief
understanding
why
people
commit
the
crimes
by
understanding
the
environmental
vulnerabilities
can
affect
decisions
about
how
to
stop
the
next
crime
before
it
happens
predictive
policing
applies
these
criminological
insights
in
two
ways
first
it
recognizes
that
the
past
patterns
identify
an
opportunity
to
ask
why
what
in
the
environment
of
that
space
has
increased
the
risk
of
that
particular
crime
second
by
directing
law
enforcement
personnel
to
that
area
the
environmental
vulnerability
may
be
removed
by
disrupting
the
routine
activities
the
pattern
or
the
opportunity
police
may
be
able
to
prevent
the
next
crime
n
as
a
pure
law
enforcement
matter
this
disruptive
preventive
effect
may
be
the
most
important
result
crime
may
go
down
simply
by
establishing
a
police
presence
in
an
area
predictive
models
of
crime
the
general
theory
of
crime
and
place
has
been
refined
by
scholars
who
have
looked
at
different
crime
patterns
as
predictors
of
future
crime
n
this
research
gives
legitimacy
to
the
theory
behind
predictive
policing
even
if
the
research
is
not
directed
at
any
formal
examination
of
predictive
policing
itself
n
in
time
of

researchers
will
evaluate
the
reliability
and
validity
of
official
predictive

strategies
at
this
time
however
one
can
only
look
at
analogous
research
studies
to
examine
whether
the
predictive
policing
model
offers
a
reliable
and
valid
method
of
prediction
that
will
survive
fourth
amendment
scrutiny
as
will
be
discussed
in
part
iv
if
the
predictive
methods
are
not
reliable
valid
and
transparent
they
will
not

support
the
level

stop
two
representative
predictive

sophisticated
theories
about
why

might
be
able
to

types
of

in
certain

a
key
point
in
understanding
these
studies
and
thus
the
reliability
of
analogous
predictive
models
is
to
identify
the
limitations
inherent
in
the
studies
as
will
be
discussed
the
predictive
policing
model
may
only
work
for
certain
types
of
crimes
in
certain
areas
a
near
repeat
theory
near
repeat
theory
seeks
to
identify
and
explain
the
phenomenon
that
certain
crimes
seem
to
generate
repeat
criminal
activity
at

place
n
the
theory
posits
that
once
a

to
a

it
is
statistically
more
likely
that

events
during

n
residential

automobile

theft
from

share
certain
characteristics
that
make
reliable

more
likely
n
significant
research
has
been
done
on
residential
burglary
which
has
consistently
demonstrated
a

pattern
n
in
the
most
exhaustive
study
of
ten
different
jurisdictions
across
an
international
spectrum
residential
burglaries
showed
a
near
repeat
phenomenon
despite
different
cultural
environments
n
specifically
a
successive
burglary
occurred
within
meters
and
two
weeks
of
the
initial
burglary
at
a
statistically
significant
rate

noting
the
near

studies
one
scholar
stated
burglary

appears
to
be
contagious
in
the

of
a

as
well
n
studies
from
england
and
canada
show
that
the
chance
of
near

burglary
victimization
is
four
n
to
twelve
n
times
higher
than
a
random
occurrence
while
not
definitive
these
statistics
show
a
pattern
that
might
be
useful
for
predicting
future
burglaries
n
in
fact
some
proponents
of
predictive
policing
argue
that
with
the
appropriate
technology
they
can
predict
and
deter
about
percent
of
burglaries
in
a
given
area
n
two
theories
have
been
put
forth
to
explain
why
the
near
repeat
phenomenon
occurs
in
residential
burglaries
n
flag
theory
posits
that
some
properties
are
vulnerable
and
effectively
advertise
their
vulnerability
n
flag
theory
applied
to
burglaries
means
that
burglaries
at
the
same
location
may
simply
be
the
work
of
different
offenders
who
respond
to
similar
signals
of
target
attractiveness
or
accessibility
attractive
opportunities
are
overtly
flagged
for
all
to
see
n
boost
theory
in
contrast
argues
that
repeat
victimization
occurs
because
some
information
learned
by
the
original
offenders
enhances
boosts
the
vulnerability
of
the
home
n
as
one
article
has
described
the
rationale
was
that
having
burgled
one
property
offenders
would
become
more
familiar
with
and
consequently
target
nearby
households
good
reasons
for
this
hypothesis
exist
for
instance
houses
nearest
to
each
other
are
likely
to
share
more
features
that
may
inform
offender
targeting
decisions
than
those
located
further
away
such
features
include
access
and
escape
routes
internal
and
external
architectural
layouts
levels
of
natural
surveillance
and
the
availability
of
desirable
goods
as
already
noted
the
results
of
the
studies
validated
the
hypothesis
demonstrating
that
burglary
clusters
in
space
and
time
n
one
reason
for
repeat
victimization
may
be
simply
that
it
is
the
same
individuals
or
gangs
committing
the
crimes
n
one
researcher
found
that
of
the
burglars
he
interviewed
had
gone
back
to
a
number
of
houses
after
a
varying
period
of
time
to
burgle
them
between
two
and
five
times
n
however
the
research
also
suggests
that
the
boost
theory
may
account
for
the
change
n
essentially
certain
kinds
of
crime
might
be
considered
communicable
like
a
contagious
virus
that
infects
not
only
the
particular
burglarized
property
but
also
those
in
close
proximity
n
in
boost
theory
information
about
an
environmental
vulnerability
spreads
and
a
subsequent
crime
occurs
because
of
that
spread
n
if
accurate
this
type
of
information
can
inform
predictive
theories
and
direct
police
resources
to
stop
the
spread
of
burglaries
n
two
caveats
must
be
mentioned
about
these
studies
first
while
other
crimes
such
as
automobile
theft
n
and
theft
from
automobiles
n
have
been
analogized
to
residential
burglary
as
having
similar
near
repeat
effects
not
all
crime
fits
this
category
residences
are
not
only
fixed
but
nearby
residences
may
share
similar
designs
demographic
factors
transportation
infrastructures
housing
density
and
lighting
issues
n
such
similarities
may
not
exist
for
other
crimes
n
the
second
limitation
in
the
studies
recognizes
the
temporal
limitation
of
the
near
repeat
phenomenon
n
a
consistent
finding
in
the
studies
was
that
a
large
number
of
repeat
incidents
occur
within
week
of
an
antecedent
and
the
risk
of
repeat
victimisation
appears
to
decay
over
time
n
thus
any
predictions
of
future
burglaries
would
have
to
be
within
this
limited
window
the
conclusion
from
this
brief
overview
is
that
the
near
repeat
pattern
can
be
validated
for
some
types
of
crime
but
has
not
been
for
others
in
fact
the
very
reason
why
the
theory
might
work
for
property
crimes
such
as
burglary
and
automobile
theft
may
make
it
inappropriate
to
apply
to
other
interpersonal
or
violent
crimes
that
are
not
so
place
based
similarly
while
there
has
been
consistency
within
the
jurisdictions
tested
this
does
not
mean
that
the
theory
would
hold
for
all
jurisdictions
n
finally
it
is
important
to
note
the
relatively
few
studies
done
and
thus
there
is
a
justifiable
caution
about
expanding
the
findings
beyond
the
carefully
controlled
study

rtm

a
way
of
looking
at

a
dynamic
interaction
between
social

identifies

creators
rtm
assigns
a
value
signifying
the
presence

of
the

when
all

are
combined
in

they
produce
a
composite

a

terrain
map
where
every

is
assigned
a
composite

value
that
accounts
for
all

the
particular

outcome
the
higher
the
risk

the
greater
the
likelihood
of
a

event
occurring
at
that
location
n
for
example
in
analyzing
burglaries
in
morris
county
new
jersey
an
rtm
map
was
created
using
five
variables
past
burglaries
the
residential
location
of
individuals
arrested
for
theft
or
burglary
between
and
the
proximity
to
major
highways
the
geographic
concentration
of
males
between
the
ages
of

n
and
the
location
of
apartment
complexes

hotels
n
the
result
led
police
administrators
to
redirect
available
police
resources
to
those
identified
locations
and
ultimately
to
an
overall
decrease
in
both
general
crime
and
more
specifically
violent
crime
and
property
crime
n
by
isolating
variables
that
correspond
with
past
crimes

environmental
factors
rtm
was
able
to
focus
attention
on
the
likely
areas

applied
to

rtm
seems
to
offer
great
promise

rtm

four

some
debate
about

the
attraction
of
this
type
of
innovation

reduces
violent

as

terrain
mapping
for

offers
two
insights

for

some
predictions

on
the

might
engage
in
repeated

retaliatory
actions
n
the
violent
actions
occur
in
a
social
fabric
and
patterns
of

are
also
communicable
as
gang
reacts
to

or
individuals

revenge
on
one
another
n
second
some
of
the
reasons
for
the
violence
are
due
to
environmental
factors
that
make
those
locations
more
conducive
to

n
this
summary
shows
that
sophisticated
mapping
and
analysis
technologies
exist
that
may
be
able
to
address
a
broader
range
of
crimes
jurisdictions
may
adapt
predictive
policing
techniques
beyond
property
based
crimes
to
more
complex
and
serious
violent
crimes
the
question
that
remains
of
course
is
not
whether
these
analytical
models
should
be
used

whether
law
enforcement
practices
arising
from
these
analyses
will
be
applied
consistently

cases

predictive

predictive
models
can
be
used
to
locate
areas
for
heightened
surveillance

to
mitigate
risk
by
removing
or
altering
environmental
dangers
n
in
addition
predictive
models
are
being
used
to
target
known
human
risk
factors

as
criminal
gangs

one
study
has
applied
the
place
based
approach
to
gangs
that
also
exist
in
an
established
and
usually
contested
territorial
geographic
area
n
it
has
not
been
determined
whether
the
models
hold
for
these
types
of
crimes
but
some
jurisdictions
are
considering
the
possibilities
n
in
addition
one
could
imagine
that
predictive
policing
models
could
also
be
established
for
individuals
or
at
least
individuals
on
probation
or
parole
n
in
some
jurisdictions

question
remains
whether
one
could
really
predict
an
individual
s
future
crime
without
running
into
the
limitations
of
a
probability
based
crime
system
as
predictive
policing
is
still
just
being
implemented
under
a
property
based
crime
model
this

concerns

merely
raises
them
for

the

contextualizes
the

against

warrant
that
intrusion
n
many
times
determining
what
is
reasonable
or
whether
sufficient
probable
cause
exists
in
a
given
case
involves
a
predictive
judgment
by
a
judge
or
law
enforcement
official
in
the
search

context
a
magistrate
judge
may
have
to
determine
whether
there

in
a

that
fair
probability
is
a
prediction
based
on
available
information
n
it
is
always
possible
that
the
contraband
will
be
gone
but
there
is
a
prediction
that
police
will
find
it
n
the
prediction
usually
includes
a
temporal
element
because
information
can
grow
stale
n
in
addition
it
is
usually
particularized
to
a
specific
area
or
person
to
be
searched
the
controlling
standard
of
probable

the
name
suggests
turns
on

rests
on
predictive
guesses
about
whether
the
evidence

sought
will
be
at

n
in

prediction
is
also
a
critical
element

in

of
criminal
activity

the

in

have
to

comes
from
the

involves
a

other
factors

changes

to

cases
of

way

to
consider
the

to

occur
while
the
analogy
is
inexact
one
could
imagine
a
parallel
situation
to
the
predictive

forecast
in
which
an

calls
police
to
predict
that

will
be

anonymous
tip
cases
the
fourth
amendment
requires
reasonable
suspicion
to
stop
a
specific
individual
based
on
a
tip
the
supreme
court
has
stated
that
an
informant
s
veracity
reliability
and
basis
of
knowledge
remain
highly
relevant
in
determining
the
value
of
the
tip
n
this
legal
standard
derives
from
illinois
v
gates
the
supreme
court
s
seminal
case
on
probable
cause
involving
an
anonymous
informant
n
gates
like
many
predictive
cases
involved
a
prediction
that
certain
contraband
would
be
in
the
possession
of
two
specific
named
individuals
who
had
been
identified
through
an
anonymous
letter
n
in
gates
police
had
no
information
about
the
informer
or
the
basis
of
knowledge
about
the
tip
n
however
many
of
the
details
in
the
tip
accurately
predicted
future
events
n
this
corroboration
of
predicted
actions
observed
by
police
officers
created
probable
cause
to
justify
the
search
n
gates
relied
on
draper
v
united
states
n
a
case
that
also
rested
a
finding
of
probable
cause
on
the
level
of
corroborated
detail
in
a
predictive
tip
n
in
draper
the
anonymous
informant
accurately
predicted
the
city
train
and
physical
and
clothing
description
of
the
suspect
who
was
thought
to
be
carrying
narcotics
n
the
supreme
court
reasoned
that
such
detailed
predictive
information
demonstrated
that
the
informant
had
inside
information
about
the
suspect
and
the
crime
and
thus
the
tip
was
reliable
n
both
gates
and
draper
stand
for
the
proposition
that
detailed
individualized
prediction
corroborated
by
police
observation
can
support
a
finding
of
probable
cause
n
the
predictive
judgment
of
probable
cause
is
to
be
considered
in
a
non
technical
manner
usable
by
officers
on
the
street
n
this
analysis
also
has
been
adopted
to
govern
the
reasonable
suspicion
calculus
for
informant
tips
n
the
supreme
court
has
explicitly
addressed
informant
tips
and
reasonable
suspicion
in
two
major
cases
providing
both
support
and
establishing
limits
for
the
use
of
informant
tips
first
in
alabama
v
white
an
anonymous
tip
that
was
corroborated
by
some
predictive
details
was
found
to
be
just
enough
to
establish
reasonable
suspicion
n
in
white
police
received
an
anonymous
call
stating
that
the
suspect
would
be
leaving
a
particular
apartment
at
a
particular
time
in
a
particular
brown
plymouth
station
wagon
with
the
right
taillight
lens
broken
and
that
she
would
be
going
to

that

would
be
in
possession
of
about
an
ounce
of
cocaine
inside
a
brown
attache
case
n
following
up
on
the
tip
police
observed
the
brown
plymouth
station
wagon
with
a
broken
taillight
at
the
correct
address
and
they
followed
the
vehicle
as
it
drove
the
most
direct
route
to
dobey
s
motel
when
the
vehicle
reached
the
mobile
highway
on
which
dobey
s
motel
is
located
corporal
reynolds
requested
a
patrol
unit
to
stop
the
vehicle
n
police
stopped
the
car
and
searched
it
with
ms
white
s
consent
n
following
the
reasoning
of
gates
the
supreme
court
found
the
prediction
detailed
enough
timely
enough
and
individualized
enough
to
justify
reasonable
suspicion
n
the
court
focused
on
the
substantial
corroboration
of
the
tip
what
was
important
was
the
caller
s
ability
to
predict
respondent
s
future
behavior
because
it
demonstrated
inside
information
a
special
familiarity
with
respondent
s
affairs
the
general
public
would
have
had
no
way
of
knowing
that
respondent
would
shortly
leave
the
building
get
in
the
described
car
and
drive
the
most
direct
route
to
dobey
s
motel
because
only
a
small
number
of
people
are
generally
privy
to
an
individual
s
itinerary
it
is
reasonable
for
police
to
believe
that
a
person
with
access
to
such
information
is
likely
to
also
have
access
to
reliable
information
about
that
individual
s
illegal
activities
n
the
court
emphasized
that
because
there
was
a
low
degree
of
reliability
and
no
information
about
the
basis
of
knowledge
such
a
tip
requires
more
corroboration
to
establish
reasonable
suspicion
n
in
other
words
the
weak
reliability
of
the
tip
has
to
be
compensated
for
with
greater
direct
corroboration
of
predicted
details
in
contrast
the
supreme
court
later
held
an
anonymous
tip
that
did
not
involve
predictive
detail
or
inside
information
to
be
insufficient
to
justify
reasonable
suspicion
for
a
stop
n
in
florida
v
j
l
an
anonymous
caller
reported
to
the
miami
dade
police
that
a
young
black
male
standing
at
a
particular
bus
stop
and
wearing
a
plaid
shirt
was
carrying
a
gun
n
in
response
to
this
tip
one
of
the
officers
approached
j
l
told
him
to
put
his
hands
up
on
the
bus
stop
frisked
him
and
seized
a
gun
from
j
l
s
pocket
n
as
the
court
acknowledged
while
the
general
description
of
the
suspect
was
predicted
apart
from
the
tip
the
officers
had
no
reason
to
suspect
j
l
of
illegal
conduct
the
officers
did
not
see
a
firearm
and
j
l
made
no
threatening
or
otherwise
unusual
movements
n
the
court
distinguished
white
because
in
white
the
tipster
had
inside
knowledge
about
the
suspect
and
therefore
it
was
reasonable
for
the
police
officer
to
credit
his
assertion
about
the
cocaine
n
in
j
l
the
prediction
did
not
mention
criminal
action
that
was
corroborated
by
police
observation
and
thus
the
prediction
alone
could
not
justify
reasonable
suspicion
n
four
important
principles
can
be
distilled
from
the
court
s
reliance
on
prediction
in
the
context
of
anonymous
informant
tips
first
the
prediction
must
be
individualized
not
only
to
a
specific
person
but
also
to
ongoing
criminal
activity
of
that
specific
person
second
the
predictive
tip
must
be
corroborated
by
police
observation
which
means
corroboration
of
both
the
specific
individual
and
the
ongoing
crime
n
third
the
predictive
value
of
the
tip
turns
on
the
level
of
particularized
detail
involved
in
the
prediction
fourth
the
timing
of
the
prediction
matters
as
tips
must
be
fresh
to
be
useful
n
these
themes
of
individualization
corroboration
particularized
detail
and
timing
are
central
to
the
fourth
amendment
analysis
for
reasonable
suspicion
known
informant
tips
while
focused
on
anonymous
tips
the
court
in
gates
also
recognized
that
known
informant
tips
or
police
informant
tips
can
sometimes
be
relied
upon
if
there
is
a
demonstrated
history
of
reliability
n
as
the
court
stated
if
for
example
a
particular
informant
is
known
for
the
unusual
reliability
of
his
predictions
of
certain
types
of
criminal
activities
in
a
locality
his
failure
in
a
particular
case
to
thoroughly
set
forth
the
basis
of
his
knowledge
surely
should
not
serve
as
an
absolute
bar
to
a
finding
of
probable
cause
based
on
his
tip
n
in
other
words
established
reliability
can
make
up
for
a
lack
in
basis
of
knowledge
thus
the
analysis
of
veracity
reliability
and
basis
of
knowledge
can
be
more
easily
evaluated
in
known
informant
cases
because
the
reliability
of
the
informant
can
be
more
easily
judged
n
in
so
holding
the
supreme
court
in
gates
and
later
cases
recognized
that
the
strength
or
weakness
of
a
tip
could
be
balanced
by
different
levels
of
direct
corroboration
through
observation
a
weak
unreliable
tip
could
be
bolstered
by
more
corroboration
n
a
strong
reliable
tip
needed
less
corroboration
n
this
balancing
along
a
continuum
of
suspicion
could
be
considered
in
the
totality
analysis
as
will
be
discussed
predictive
policing
may
be
more
analogous
to
a
known
informant
case
assuming
the
predictive
policing
model
is
reliable
it
may
matter
less
that
the
basis
of
knowledge
is
difficult
to
prove
b
profiles
predicting
criminal
activities
based
on
shared
characteristics
another
predictive
fourth
amendment
situation
involves
a
suspicion
that
a
person
sharing
certain
common
characteristics
will
be
committing
a
crime
most
easily
observed
in
profiling
cases
certain
shared
characteristics
or
actions
are
thought
to
predict
criminal
activity
in
certain
areas
drug
courier
profiling
illegal
immigration
profiling
and
group
profiling
have
been
addressed
by
courts
and
they
have
generally
been
acknowledged
as
a
relevant
factor
to
be
considered
in
determining
reasonable
suspicion
n
for
purposes
of
this
section
the
focus
is
on
how
courts
have
analyzed
the
predictive
weight
of
this
generalized
suspicion
in
certain
areas
n
in
addition
this
section
analyzes
the
use
of
pure
probabilistic
analysis
for
reasonable
suspicion
while
courts
are
reluctant
to
consider
pure
probabilities
in
evaluating
the
predictive
value
of
generalized
suspicion
there
has
been
significant
academic
debate
on
the
issue
since
predictive
policing
technology
actually
establishes
a
numerical
probability
that
a
particular
area
will
be
a
place
of
potential
crime
this
line
of
reasoning
will
be
addressed
as
well
profiling
as
prediction
courts
regularly
allow
generalized
suspicion
in
the
form
of
group
based
identifiers
to
justify
a
stop
in
a
robbery
case
individuals
who
fit
the
witness
s
description
of
the
suspect
can
be
stopped
n
on
a
known
drug
corner
individuals
suspected
of
participating
in
a
drug
buy
can
be
stopped
n
at
airports
train
stations
and
buses
people
fitting
general
profiles
for
a
drug
courier
can
be
stopped
and
questioned
n
along
the
border
individuals
who
are
suspected
of
being
illegal
immigrants
can
be
stopped
n
even
the
questionable
practice
of
racial
profiling
can
be
considered
a
series
of
predictive
suppositions
that
lead
to
suspicion
n
as
bernard
harcourt
has
observed
the
fact
is
that
the
police
do
not
profile
on
race
alone
they
also
profile
on
car
models
vehicle
attributes
rental
cars
stickers
location
direction
motorist
appearance
age
etc
the
police
use
these
various
attributes
as
well
as
possibly
race
to
narrow
down
the
pool
of
likely
suspects
n
each
of
these
fourth
amendment
police
citizen
stops
is
based
on
a
predictive
judgment
that
the
individual
will
be
engaging
in
criminal
activity
as
will
be
discussed
courts
have
upheld
the
use
of
these
profiles
against
repeated
fourth
amendment
challenges
n
most
clearly
the
supreme
court
has
referenced
the
drug
courier
profile
in
several
cases
without
directly
addressing
the
constitutionality
of
the
predictive
profile
n
united
states
v
sokolow
recognized
that
a
drug
courier
profile
is
not
an
irrelevant
or
inappropriate
consideration
that
taken
in
the
totality
of
circumstances
can
be
considered
in
a
reasonable
suspicion
determination
n
sokolow
involved
a
young
man
traveling
from
hawaii
to
florida
in
the
summer
with
a
two
day
stay
over
he
purchased
his
tickets
in
cash
and
with
what
appeared
to
be
a
fake
name
n
while
none
of
these
factors
alone
were
criminal
or
suspicious
together
they
fit
a
drug
courier
profile
as
established
by
the
drug
enforcement
agency
n
the
court
in
sokolow
acknowledged
the
probabilistic
basis
of
the
profile
but
it
avoided
any
sustained
analysis
of
what
level
of
probability
was
required
n
as
some
critics
have
pointed
out
the
government
failed
to
provide
empirical
proof
for
its
claim
that
the
drug
courier
profile
has
reliable
predictive
value
n
further
others
including
justice
marshall
in
dissent
pointed
out
that
even
if
predictive
in
the
short
run
the
profiles
have
questionable
utility
since
drug
couriers
will
just
change
their
behavior
to
avoid
suspicion
n
in
other
contexts
scholars
have
challenged
the
empirical
basis
of
the
predictive
value
of
profiling
and
found
it
lacking
n
nevertheless
the
current
law
from
the
supreme
court
and
other
courts
recognizes
that
a
predictive
profile
can
be
a
relevant
if
not
controlling
factor
for
reasonable
suspicion
n
the
drug
courier
profile
and
other
profiles
exists
as
an
example
of
predictive
evidence
predicated
on
the
belief
that
the
probability
that
a
person
who
engages
in
the
conduct
highlighted
by
the
profile
is
a
drug
courier
is
higher
than
the
probability
for
the
population
at
large
n
as
judge
charles
becton
has
acknowledged
in
his
article
on
drug
courier
profiling
the
predictive
value
of
profiles
combines
subjective
clinical
predictions
that
are
individualized
to
a
particular
person
with
statistical
predictions
that
are
based
on
general
formulas
with
predetermined
characteristics
of
generic
individuals
n
this
hybrid
model
gives
significant
power
to
the
officers
to
make
not
only
legitimate
individualized
judgments
but
also
illegitimate
arbitrary
judgments
that
can
be
retrospectively
justified
by
the
profile
n
because
the
profile
exists
and
is
generalized
enough
to
be
manipulated
n
it
is
hard
for
courts
to
decide
whether
the
stop
is
legitimate
or
not
n
further
because
the
agents
control
the
profile
they
can
create
a
self
fulfilling
prophesy
by
only
stopping
those
who
fit
the
profile
thus
strengthening
the
seeming
validity
of
the
profile
even
if
it
does
not
match
the
reality
of
who
is
engaged
in
drug
couriering
n
predictive
actions
a
less
defined
category
of
cases
involves
profiling
certain
actions
as
predictors
of
criminal
wrongdoing
flight
evasive
action
furtive
movements
hand
to
hand
exchanges
and
aggressive
driving
can
all
warrant
suspicion
based
on
predictive
judgments
that
such
actions
correspond
with
ongoing
criminal
activity
n
for
situations
in
which
there
is
an
expected
criminal
activity
in
a
particular
location
not
because
of
a
profile
but
because
of
generalizations
from
past
activities
the
group
trait
can
help
to
establish
individualized
suspicion
n
for
example
in
an
area
known
for
weapons
offenses
a
bulge
in
a
waistband
might
be
considered
a
sign
of
carrying
a
gun
n
on
a
known
drug
corner
a
hand
to
hand
exchange
of
money
for
small
objects
might
be
indicative
of
a
drug
deal
while
this
may
stretch
the
concept
of
prediction
a
bit
far
the
reality
is
that
underlying
the
suspicion
is
the
prediction
of
criminal
activity
in
each
of
the
cases
involving
profiling
group
traits
or
generalized
activities
several
principles
can
be
distilled
in
evaluating
reasonable
suspicion
n
first
the
profile
must
be
particularized
enough
to
distinguish
the
profiled
individual
from
the
rest
of
the
public
n
second
the
suspicion
based
on
a
group
trait
must
still
be
corroborated
by
direct
observation
of
the
officer
a
report
that
a
suspect
matched
a
drug
courier
profile
would
not
be
useful
if
the
officers
did
not
corroborate
that
in
fact
the
person
did
match
the
profile
upon
observation
third
suspicion
based
on
general
characteristics
is
limited
by
location
a
drug
courier
profile
would
not
be
useful
in
an
area
with
no
known
drug
problem
such
that
the
presence
of
an
established
drug
problem
should
be
part
of
the
profile
fourth
the
suspicion
must
be
connected
to
an
identifiable
on
going
specific
type
of
crime
it
would
not
be
sufficient
to
have
a
general
criminal
profile
that
covered
all
types
of
crimes
even
if
some
criminals
engage
in
multiple
criminal
acts
n
finally
the
profile
has
an
implicit
temporal
element
in
that
as
criminals
adapt
to
the
profile
the
existing
profiles
must
be
modified
or
abandoned
n
probabilities
as
prediction
a
final
related
concern
may
be
pure
probabilities
as
predictive
judgments
while
the
supreme
court
has
recognized
that
the
question
of
reasonable
suspicion
deals
with
probabilities
it
has
never
relied
on
a
purely
probabilistic
analysis
for
reasonable
suspicion
n
lower
courts
have
upheld
arrest
warrants
on
dna
matches
and
other
forensic
science
matches
based
on
pure
probabilities
but
there
has
never
been
a
supreme
court
case
in
which
the
probability
of
crime
explicitly
has
been
used
as
the
sole
justification
for
a
stop
n
this
does
not
mean
that
the
question
has
not
been
raised
and
addressed
in
the
abstract
as
professor
arnold
loewy
posed
in
an
article
on
the
fourth
amendment
suppose
that
in
a
particular
city
block
of
main
street
between
fourth
and
main
and
fifth
and
main
it
could
be
established
demographically
that
nine
out
of
every
ten
men
on
the
street
between
p
m
and
p
m
are
carrying
drugs
would
that
create
probable
cause
or
reasonable
suspicion
to
arrest
any
man
found
on
that
block
of
main
street
at
the
requisite
hours
the
answer
i
believe
is
no
probable
cause
and
reasonable
suspicion
require
more
than
demographic
probabilities
there
must
be
something
specific
to
the
defendant
to
create
the
probability
as
to
him
perhaps
a
furtive
gesture
an
informant
s
tip
excessive
nervousness
etc
n
other
scholars
might
disagree
and
would
hold
such
a
probability
is
sufficient
to
create
reasonable
suspicion
n
real
world
hypotheticals
can
easily
be
imagined
for
example
what
if
predictive
policing
technology
could
be
improved
such
that
on
a
notorious
drug
corner
the
likelihood
of
a
drug
sale
on
a
particular
day
was
or
higher
would
the
conclusion
that
police
need
more
than
just
the
probability
hold
n
similarly
what
if
the
probabilities
exist
but
are
statistically
quite
low
for
example
in
one
reported
situation
the
predictive
policing
information
provided
to
the
santa
cruz
police
officer
was
that
there
was
a
probability
of
a
crime
happening
that
day
at
a
particular
location
n
how
should
a
court
evaluate
the
predictive
impact
of
this
criminal
forecast
does
a
likelihood
create
reasonable
suspicion
must
there
be
a
determined
numerical
probability
such
low
probabilities
may
well
weigh
against
a
finding
of
reasonable
suspicion
based
on
the
forecast
data
finally
there
exists
the
problem
of
relative
probability
as
i
have
argued
elsewhere
in
the
high
crime
area
context
there
exists
a
denominator
problem
n
just
as
high
is
a
relative
term
that
requires
an
understanding
of
lower
crime
areas
drawing
lines
for
predictive
probabilities
presents
similar
problems
if
one
block
is
forecast
to
have
a
likelihood
of
burglary
and
another
block
a
likelihood
is
the
area
less
persuasive
because
there
are
other
higher
percentage
areas
so
far
courts
have
been
quite
uncomfortable
drawing
such
lines
but
the
questions
remain
c
high
crime
areas
predicting
criminal
activities
in
places
considerations
of
prediction
can
also
be
observed
in
courts
evaluations
of
the
high
crime
area
factor
in
reasonable
suspicion
cases
n
after
illinois
v
wardlow
the
high
crime
nature
of
an
area
can
be
considered
in
evaluating
the
officer
s
objective
suspicion
n
as
predictive
policing
technology
seeks
to
predict
certain
areas
of
higher
potential
criminal
activity
this
line
of
cases
has
clear
relevance
after
about
thirty
years
of
acknowledged
but
imprecise
usage
the
high
crime
area
term
of
art
reached
its
peak
in
wardlow
in
which
it
became
one
of
only
two
factors
considered
in
a
totality
of
circumstances
analysis
for
reasonable
suspicion
n
in
wardlow
high
crime
area
plus
unprovoked
flight
upon
noticing
the
police
resulted
in
reasonable
suspicion
to
stop
mr
wardlow
n
the
facts
in
wardlow
point
out
the
questionable
use
that
prediction
plays
in
many
high
crime
area
cases
in
wardlow
a
narcotics
unit
driving
in
a
caravan
observed
mr
wardlow
holding
a
white
opaque
bag
n
wardlow
was
standing
on
a
downtown
chicago
street
corner
at
about
noon
n
upon
sight
of
the
police
wardlow
ran
and
when
he
was
stopped
a
gun
was
recovered
from
the
bag
n
the
justification
for
the
stop
included
the
flight
in
a
high
crime
area
n
yet
as
was
revealed
in
the
lower
court
proceedings
the
observing
officers
had
no
information
about
that
particular
block
or
wardlow
and
happened
simply
to
be
riding
past
the
block
to
another
location
n
in
addition
the
proof
that
the
area
was
in
fact
a
high
narcotics
area
was
belied
by
the
crime
statistics
presented
to
the
courts
including
the
supreme
court
which
did
not
include
any
narcotics
arrest
data
n
while
the
area
in
question
chicago
s
district
was
a
low
income
area
known
for
violent
crimes
how
that
information
factored
into
a
predictive
judgment
about
a
man
holding
a
bag
in
the
afternoon
is
not
immediately
clear
n
more
relevantly
even
if
it
could
be
assumed
that
the
area
was
objectively
a
high
crime
area
it
is
not
clear
how
that
information
would
help
predict
that
mr
wardlow
as
opposed
to
any
one
of
the
people
who
lived
in
the
district
was
committing
a
crime
or
more
specifically
a
narcotics
crime
n
the
prediction
of
a
higher
level
of
criminal
activity
or
even
a
higher
level
of
narcotics
activity
simply
was
not
corroborated
by
the
actual
observation
in
this
situation
the
high
crime
area
label
is
more
of
a
retrospective
justification
for
a
stop
than
a
predictive
factor
n
the
court
s
flawed
reasoning
in
wardlow
might
be
unremarkable
except
that
there
have
been
thousands
of
post
wardlow
cases
that
have
relied
on
the
high
crime
area
designation
to
determine
reasonable
suspicion
n
while
a
handful
of
cases
have
explicitly
wrestled
with
the
predictive
value
of
this
label
most
have
simply
applied
it
without
considering
whether
it
offers
any
predictive
weight
n
numerous
judges
and
scholars
have
critiqued
the
use
of
the
high
crime
area
designation
almost
since
its
creation
n
critics
point
to
its
discriminatory
effect
on
low
income
areas
and
communities
of
color
n
its
use
has
raised
questions
of
infringements
on
civil
liberties
as
well
as
the
stigmatizing
effect
on
economic
development
and
community
police
relations
n
some
scholars
myself
included
have
suggested
retiring
the
high
crime
area
term
as
an
inexact
overly
general
term
of
art
that
is
inconsistent
with
the
existing
crime
mapping
technology
and
the
supreme
court
s
emphasis
on
particularized
suspicion
n
while
courts
routinely
use
the
term
high
crime
area
in
considering
the
totality
of
circumstances
to
support
reasonable
suspicion
there
is
less
emphasis
on
why
that
information
is
relevant
to
help
predict
a
particular
crime
as
stated
the
high
crime
area
in
wardlow
chicago
s
district
had
a
population
of
n
the
predictive
value
for
an
individual
among
that
number
of
people
is
negligible
similarly
the
lack
of
particularized
focus
on
the
type
of
crime
weakens
the
predictive
value
of
the
information
had
the
high
crime
area
been
localized
to
a
particular
block
or
a
particular
type
of
crime
the
value
of
the
predictive
information
would
be
more
relevant
some
federal
and
state
courts
have
required
this
nexus
between
a
particularized
area
crime
time
and
the
observations
of
the
police
officer
n
in
addition
most
of
the
current
predictive
policing
forecasting
programs
seem
to
embrace
the
importance
of
a
narrowly
tailored
area
with
a
focus
on
particular
crime
type
and
a
close
temporal
proximity
n
as
will
be
discussed
later
the
advent
of
predictive
policing
may
in
fact
signal
the
end
of
a
generalized
high
crime
area
analysis
by
replacing
it
with
more
precise
technology
and
terminology
d
principles
of
prediction
and
reasonable
suspicion
from
the
above
summary
of
fourth
amendment
cases
the
same
themes
emerge
to
analyze
reasonable
suspicion
first
no
matter
the
type
of
predictive
information
tip
profile
or
high
crime
area
the
information
alone
is
never
enough
to
control
the
reasonable
suspicion
analysis
in
every
case
this
information
is
considered
relevant
to
the
totality
of
circumstances
but
must
be
corroborated
by
direct
police
observation
second
the
predictive
information
must
be
particularized
to
a
person
a
profile
or
a
place
in
a
way
that
directly
connects
the
suspected
crime
to
the
suspected
person
profile
or
place
n
third
the
predictive
information
must
provide
sufficient
detail
to
identify
or
separate
the
targeted
person
profile
or
place
from
others
not
so
targeted
n
finally
the
predictive
value
of
the
information
declines
over
time
such
that
predictive
information
must
be
acted
on
quickly
or
be
lost
each
of
these
principles
informs
the
discussion
of
predictive
policing
and
reasonable
suspicion
the
subject
of
part
iii
iii
predictive
policing
and
reasonable
suspicion
if
crime
locations
can
be
predicted
and
the
current
fourth
amendment
doctrine
embraces
predictive
judgments
then
what
to
make
of
predictive
policing
certainly
an
accurate
prediction
of
a
particular
crime
in
a
specific
location
should
have
some
effect
on
police
officers
and
courts
whether
it
be
a
computer
algorithm
or
criminological
theory
the
identification
of
environmental
vulnerabilities
that
could
be
exploited
by
criminals
is
a
reasonable
factor
to
consider
in
evaluating
suspicious
activity
in
that
area
the
question
analyzed
in
this
part
is
how
to
apply
current
fourth
amendment
concepts
to
this
new
technological
innovation
two
basic
questions
exist
for
any
court
addressing
the
effect
of
predictive
policing
on
the
reasonable
suspicion
analysis
first
assuming
an
accurate
and
reliable
system
is
this
predictive
forecast
appropriate
to
consider
in
the
totality
of
circumstances
second
if
so
how
does
a
court
analyze
the
issues
under
the
fourth
amendment
the
short
answer
to
the
first
question
is
that
it
is
too
soon
to
evaluate
the
near
repeat
theories
and
the
risk
terrain
models
among
other
variations
are
only
now
being
developed
and
refined
n
the
underlying
theories
of
environmental
vulnerabilities
make
logical
sense
but
whether
that
logic
translates
into
accurate
crime
forecasts
will
take
several
years
to
determine
further
how
courts
interpret
these
predictive
forecasts
within
the
current
fourth
amendment
structure
may
in
fact
shape
the
technologies
judicial
demands
for
standards
of
precision
probabilities
and
procedures
will
likely
require
the
predictive
technologies
to
evolve
and
improve
n
lines
will
have
to
be
drawn
about
probabilities
and
the
predictive
reliability
of
the
models
tested
before
this
issue
of
legitimacy
is
resolved
however
a
predictive
policing
case
may
reach
a
trial
court
and
that
court
will
have
to
address
the
issue
using
the
existing
reasonable
suspicion
doctrine
as
to
the
second
question
the
existing
fourth
amendment
analogies
are
imperfect
but
informative
in
determining
how
courts
might
address
the
effect
of
predictive
policing
technologies
in
a
reasonable
suspicion
determination
as
detailed
below
a
careful
evaluation
of
the
available
analogies
cautions
against
adopting
any
of
them
as
models
for
examining
predictive
policing
at
the
same
time
revealingly
each
of
the
analogies
leads
to
the
same
ultimate
conclusion
predictive
policing
technologies
if
accurate
and
reliable
can
add
to
the
totality
of
circumstances
for
reasonable
suspicion
and
will
have
a
direct
effect
on
fourth
amendment
liberties
while
these
predictions
cannot
alone
establish
reasonable
suspicion
or
probable
cause
they
may
change
the
balance
of
suspicion
in
the
forecasted
areas
a
predictive
policing
as
a
data
driven
tip
as
examined
earlier
one
possible
fourth
amendment
analogy
for
predictive
policing
is
the
tip
cases
in
this
model
predictive
policing
technologies
provide
a
non
specific
tip
about
a
type
of
crime
in
a
particular
area
predictive
policing
as
an
anonymous
or
informant
tip
the
parallels
in
considering
predictive
policing
as
an
anonymous
or
informant
tip
are
obvious
and
yet
imprecise
n
unlike
a
tip
predictive
policing
includes
no
personal
knowledge
in
its
forecast
of
potential
criminal
activity
this
is
an
important
distinction
that
removes
predictive
policing
from
the
reasoning
of
draper
white
and
even
gates
in
that
there
is
no
inside
information
that
can
help
evaluate
the
reliability
of
the
tip
n
further
a
predictive
policing
tip
is
not
particularized
to
an
individual
while
a
particular
block
might
be
identified
as
being
the
location
of
a
particular
type
of
crime
the
algorithms
as
currently
used
are
no
help
in
identifying
particular
persons
suspected
thus
the
core
logic
of
the
tip
cases
falls
away
because
predictive
policing
does
not
provide
personal
knowledge
about
an
ongoing
crime
or
particularized
identification
of
the
suspect
involved
it
cannot
support
the
weight
of
reasonable
suspicion
n
as
such
if
considered
simply
like
a
tip
a
predictive
policing
forecast
should
not
support
reasonable
suspicion
to
stop
anyone
on
the
block
just
because
there
might
be
a
heightened
level
of
potential
criminal
activity
in
the
area
n
first
such
a
tip
is
too
generalized
lacking
the
detail
required
in
white
to
identify
a
suspect
n
second
it
does
not
identify
an
actual
ongoing
crime
as
required
by
j
l
n
third
there
is
no
corroboration
as
required
by
almost
all
the
tip
cases
n
for
reasonable
suspicion
police
would
need
more
than
just
the
generalized
tip
including
substantial
direct
corroborative
observation
linking
the
tip
to
the
individual
observed
predictive
policing
as
a
tip
about
an
area
the
more
difficult
and
more
relevant
example
for
predictive
policing
focuses
on
when
a
known
informant
provides
a
tip
about
an
area
or
location
for
example
known
informant
tips
about
drug
houses
drug
corners
or
general
areas
of
criminal
activity
are
commonplace
in
law
enforcement
n
in
these
cases
officers
responding
to
those
identified
areas
have
been
allowed
to
rely
on
the
non
specific
predictive
tip
about
an
area
in
their
reasonable
suspicion
calculus
n
predictive
policing
then
can
be
considered
like
a
reliable
tip
of
generalized
information
about
an
area
n
two
points
need
to
be
emphasized
about
this
second
type
of
generalized
tip
first
traditional
application
of
the
totality
of
circumstances
test
does
not
quite
fit
n
the
reason
why
police
might
trust
a
known
informant
s
prediction
of
criminal
activity
is
not
the
same
as
the
reason
one
might
trust
a
computer
program
s
prediction
of
criminal
activity
while
reliability
is
key
to
both
it
is
a
different
reliability
on
one
hand
an
objective
well
functioning
computer
program
seems
more
reliable
than
your
typical
police
informant
the
computer
has
no
biases
no
past
bad
acts
and
no
agendas
on
the
other
hand
the
information
in
the
computer
is
generalized
and
that
fact
makes
it
less
reliable
by
analogy
if
the
human
informant
stated
that
based
on
past
experience
with
car
thefts
the
informant
has
a
general
feeling
that
a
car
theft
would
occur
at
a
location
most
courts
would
not
think
this
feeling
would
be
sufficient
for
reasonable
suspicion
n
even
if
the
informant
explained
that
the
past
experiences
were
regular
recorded
and
accurate
the
inference
that
one
could
generalize
from
that
experience
to
future
crimes
is
weak
most
courts
would
want
more
than
past
experiences
requiring
something
particular
and
detailed
about
this
area
now
again
the
reliability
turns
on
the
particularized
insight
about
a
specific
area
at
a
specific
time
a
generalized
sense
standing
alone
would
not
be
enough
while
insufficient
on
its
own
this
type
of
reliable
known
informant
tip
if
corroborated
might
result
in
reasonable
suspicion
the
key
remains
the
observations
that
corroborate
the
tip
similar
to
a
police
informant
who
provides
reliable
if
generalized
suspicion
about
a
drug
house
or
street
corner
the
information
can
color
what
a
reasonable
officer
observes
even
if
it
cannot
be
reasonable
suspicion
in
itself
in
addition
because
courts
have
recognized
that
a
reliable
tip
may
require
less
corroboration
than
an
anonymous
tip
n
if
considered
more
like
a
reliable
informant
tip
about
an
area
then
police
may
actually
need
less
corroboration
in
their
observations
this
conclusion
presents
a
significant
change
in
how
courts
could
apply
the
reasonable
suspicion
standard
it
means
that
a
computer
algorithm
could
alter
fourth
amendment
protections
in
certain
forecast
locations
returning
to
the
parking
garage
scenario
at
the
beginning
of
this
article
the
two
women
could
not
have
been
stopped
on
reasonable
suspicion
but
for
the
predictive
element
of
the
analysis
merely
looking
into
car
windows
is
not
sufficient
activity
to
warrant
the
reasonable
belief
that
criminal
activity
is
afoot
however
with
a
predicted
computer
tip
of
car
theft
it
might
be
analyzed
carefully
this
conclusion
means
that
the
potential
for
crime
in
an
area
can
alter
the
reasonable
suspicion
analysis
for
courts
assuming
the
reliability
and
accuracy
of
the
prediction
a
data
driven
tip
may
be
appropriate
to
factor
into
the
reasonable
suspicion
analysis
while
corroboration
is
still
required
predictive
policing
tips
may
require
less
corroboration
than
other
tips
and
may
affect
the
fourth
amendment
analysis
b
predictive
policing
as
profiling
in
an
area
of
forecast
crime
a
second
fourth
amendment
analogy
to
consider
is
predictive
policing
as
a
form
of
profiling
in
this
analogy
predictive
policing
technologies
would
forecast
a
profiled
crime
in
a
certain
geographic
area
such
that
anyone
in
the
area
who
acted
in
conformity
with
certain
recognizable
characteristics
could
be
stopped
based
on
reasonable
suspicion
whether
considered
profiling
or
probabilistic
suspicion
of
activities
in
an
area
the
supreme
court
s
acceptance
of
profiling
helps
frame
the
analysis
n
under
current
law
profiles
of
suspected
criminal
activity
in
particular
locations
for
specific
crimes
appear
to
be
constitutional
n
the
focus
here
is
on
the
actions
or
activities
of
individuals
that
match
actions
or
activities
generally
considered
to
be
indicative
of
criminal
activity
the
profile
includes
considerations
of
activity
place
and
general
characteristics
for
example
in
a
residential
neighborhood
with
a
burglary
problem
a
burglar
profile
could
be
created
so
that
otherwise
innocent
actions
like
loitering
with
bags
large
enough
to
carry
contraband
tools
ropes
and
gloves
in
warm
weather
could
be
considered
suspicious
someone
acting
like
a
burglar
on
a
particular
block
within
a
particular
time
frame
would
then
be
considered
the
same
as
someone
acting
like
a
drug
courier
arriving
from
a
known
source
city
for
drugs
the
result
would
be
that
profiles
of
generalized
criminal
activities
would
be
used
to
justify
stops
of
individual
suspects
if
they
happen
to
be
in
a
predicted
area
of
crime
n
profiling
suspicious
activities
is
not
new
and
it
mirrors
the
daily
practice
of
police
officers
who
informally
have
an
idea
of
stereotypical
criminal
activity
n
labeling
it
a
profile
or
merely
good
police
work
may
not
be
significant
what
is
significant
is
that
the
predictive
policing
forecast
in
combination
with
this
traditional
police
observation
will
change
the
fourth
amendment
calculus
for
reasonable
suspicion
for
example
in
one
hypothetical
case
a
police
officer
sees
a
man
loitering
on
a
corner
with
a
large
duffle
bag
looking
at
a
house
under
these
limited
facts
a
stop
based
on
reasonable
suspicion
would
be
difficult
to
justify
there
is
nothing
objectively
criminal
about
waiting
with
a
bag
even
if
the
officer
could
say
that
burglars
carry
bags
and
burglars
steal
from
houses
there
is
not
a
fit
with
anything
criminal
this
man
has
done
yet
imagine
in
a
second
hypothetical
case
a
police
officer
is
informed
that
a
specific
city
block
has
had
a
rash
of
home
burglaries
the
predictive
policing
algorithm
predicts
that
there
is
a
statistical
likelihood
of
another
burglary
on
that
block
at
this
time
police
are
told
to
be
on
the
lookout
for
burglars
and
are
given
an
appropriate
profile
in
this
second
case
a
stop
based
on
reasonable
suspicion
would
likely
be
upheld
notice
that
the
actions
of
the
man
have
not
changed
at
all
objectively
what
the
suspect
has
done
is
no
more
or
less
suspicious
or
criminal
yet
the
prediction
in
combination
with
a
profile
of
generalized
criminal
activity
can
change
the
constitutional
analysis
of
the
two
changed
elements
in
the
analysis
the
prediction
and
the
profile
arguably
the
profile
is
more
important
from
a
purely
probabilistic
model
even
if
the
computer
model
said
that
there
was
a
very
significant
likelihood
of
a
burglary
in
a
particular
block
if
all
the
police
officer
saw
was
a
man
on
the
street
no
bag
no
looking
at
the
house
then
even
a
very
high
probability
of
crime
would
not
be
enough
to
justify
a
stop
the
profile
because
it
serves
the
corroborating
function
of
linking
the
prediction
to
the
individual
suspect
matters
more
this
insight
again
reveals
a
common
theme
in
the
fourth
amendment
analogies
corroboration
of
individual
actions
is
required
for
reasonable
suspicion
n
a
profile
of
a
burglar
is
insufficient
standing
alone
a
prediction
of
a
burglary
is
insufficient
standing
alone
but
together
a
court
might
find
that
under
a
totality
of
circumstances
this
combination
could
be
sufficient
for
reasonable
suspicion
c
predictive
policing
as
a
micro
high
crime
area
the
final
fourth
amendment
analogy
is
to
consider
predictive
policing
as
creating
a
micro
high
crime
area
as
discussed
earlier
location
in
a
high
crime
area
is
an
accepted
factor
in
the
reasonable
suspicion
analysis
n
under
wardlow
and
its
progeny
the
ability
to
predict
a
specific
area
of
heightened
potential
criminal
activity
appears
to
directly
impact
the
reasonable
suspicion
analysis
n
for
example
as
practiced
in
los
angeles
and
santa
cruz
the
predictive
policing
model
has
targeted
three
specific
types
of
property
crime
and
then
focused
police
attention
on
by
foot
areas
n
assuming
that
the
predictive
analysis
is
based
on
past
crimes
and
established
crime
patterns
those
micro
areas
would
easily
fall
within
the
supreme
court
s
understanding
of
a
high
crime
area
n
in
fact
those
areas
small
in
size
responsive
to
immediate
crime
patterns
and
particularized
to
a
type
of
crime
are
superior
to
the
rather
amorphous
definition
of
a
high
crime
area
previously
accepted
by
the
courts
in
analyzing
reasonable
suspicion
there
seems
to
be
little
reason
why
an
officer
should
not
consider
the
predictive
information
he
or
she
has
been
given
before
patrolling
the
streets
n
the
information
is
objective
verifiable
and
particularized
to
a
certain
area
about
a
certain
crime
and
even
temporally
relevant
a
court
analyzing
the
reasonableness
of
the
officer
s
suspicion
based
on
objective
standards
should
take
this
information
into
account
to
return
to
our
burglar
example
an
officer
who
stops
the
man
standing
with
the
bag
outside
the
house
in
part
because
it
was
a
predicted
high
burglary
block
is
making
a
reasonable
decision
based
on
the
available
information
notice
however
again
the
critical
fact
in
the
argument
is
that
there
is
a
corroborative
observation
that
matches
the
predicted
forecast
n
if
the
predictive
policing
forecast
suggested
an
area
with
a
heightened
pattern
of
residential
burglary
and
the
police
officer
went
to
the
area
and
observed
a
hand
to
hand
transaction
suggestive
but
not
conclusive
of
a
drug
deal
the
predictive
information
would
be
irrelevant
for
the
predictive
technology
to
add
any
value
to
the
totality
of
circumstances
test
there
must
be
a
nexus
between
prediction
crime
and
observed
activity
a
disconnect
in
any
of
those
factors
removes
the
value
of
the
prediction
for
reasonable
suspicion
finally
the
predicted
area
must
be
limited
in
size
for
example
if
the
predicted
area
covered
an
entire
neighborhood
or
police
district
then
the
predictive
relevance
of
a
man
holding
a
bag
outside
a
house
is
weakened
the
chosen
metric
of
a
by
foot
area
appears
workable
and
appropriate
time
is
also
relevant
if
for
example
there
had
not
been
a
burglary
in
six
months
the
predictive
value
of
the
prediction
is
minimal
n
particularized
place
and
time
remains
critical
to
a
useful
high
crime
area
analogy
in
many
ways
predictive
policing
has
the
potential
to
add
some
discipline
to
the
rather
protean
high
crime
area
term
predicted
areas
may
no
longer
be
generic
high
crime
areas
encompassing
tens
of
thousands
of
residents
as
in
wardlow
but
single
blocks
with
information
about
particular
crimes
with
this
available
technology
courts
may
no
longer
need
to
rely
on
the
generalized
high
crime
area
terminology
when
more
particularized
and
more
relevant
information
is
available
as
will
be
discussed
in
the
next
section
the
precision
of
the
technology
may
in
fact
provide
more
protection
for
citizens
in
broadly
defined
high
crime
areas
while
at
the
same
time
presenting
difficulties
for
law
enforcement
that
has
gotten
used
to
the
generic
and
easily
adaptable
term
d
the
future
of
predictive
policing
and
reasonable
suspicion
a
police
stop
based
on
a
predictive
policing
forecast
soon
will
be
in
front
of
a
trial
court
in
a
motion
to
suppress
evidence
the
court
will
need
to
consider
the
effect
of
predictive
policing
on
the
fourth
amendment
the
court
will
also
have
to
graft
existing
fourth
amendment
caselaw
on
this
new
technology
while
courts
may
take
different
approaches
to
the
question
no
matter
the
doctrinal
analogy
chosen
the
result
is
the
same
predictive
policing
will
impact
the
reasonable
suspicion
calculus
by
becoming
a
factor
within
the
totality
of
circumstances
test
while
never
enough
alone
with
some
relevant
corroboration
a
predictive
tip
will
serve
as
the
basis
of
a
constitutional
stop
timing
will
matter
as
the
predictive
value
of
the
information
decays
with
time
the
particularized
nexus
will
also
matter
as
the
predicted
forecast
must
match
the
observed
actions
yet
as
demonstrated
the
weight
of
predictive
policing
in
the
totality
has
the
potential
to
be
significant
the
fact
that
predictive
policing
forecasts
can
affect
constitutional
rights
may
be
more
of
a
symptom
of
the
malleability
of
the
reasonable
suspicion
doctrine
rather
than
signifying
any
great
change
that
prediction
offers
n
as
has
been
discussed
in
other
contexts
the
reasonable
suspicion
standard
offers
less
protection
than
perhaps
originally
designed
and
it
has
been
further
eroded
with
an
ever
evolving
totality
of
circumstances
test
n
yet
the
fact
that
a
law
enforcement
designed
technology
can
alter
liberty
protections
in
certain
areas
raises
the
question
of
whether
the
supreme
court
s
reasonable
suspicion
test
is
being
exploited
if
police
can
define
away
certain
areas
using
computer
algorithms
or
define
generalized
activities
as
immediately
suspicious
in
certain
areas
it
becomes
quite
easy
to
escape
what
had
been
a
limiting
restriction
on
police
officers
n
this
speaks
less
to
the
police
and
prosecutors
that
are
fighting
crime
within
the
existing
legal
doctrine
than
to
the
doctrine
itself
which
may
need
a
counterweight
to
protect
liberty
interests
in
all
areas
including
areas
of
predicted
criminal
activity
iv
future
concerns
with
predictive
policing
predictive
policing
is
new
and
evolving
definitions
validation
studies
and
its
effectiveness
will
be
evaluated
as
the
technology
matures
its
effect
on
the
fourth
amendment
may
evolve
as
well
as
courts
and
litigants
must
pick
among
the
existing
reasonable
suspicion
precedents
for
suitable
analogies
for
analysis
its
impact
may
in
fact
cause
courts
to
rethink
the
current
overly
flexible
approach
to
reasonable
suspicion
based
on
a
concern
that
this
technology
could
be
manipulated
or
used
in
a
discriminatory
manner
this
part
addresses
some
of
the
main
concerns
that
courts
litigants
and
predictive
policing
supporters
should
consider
in
analyzing
the
constitutional
impact
of
predictive
policing
the
focus
here
again
is
on
the
fourth
amendment
concerns
not
the
effectiveness
of
the
technology
from
a
law
enforcement
perspective
the
focus
is
also
on
predictive
technologies
centered
on
the
property
based
near
repeat
phenomenon
and
not
the
risk
terrain
model
because
the
former
has
actually
been
implemented
in
law
enforcement
practice
a
understanding
the
logic
of
why
prediction
works
and
its
limits
central
to
the
use
of
predictive
policing
technologies
in
fourth
amendment
cases
must
be
an
understanding
of
why
prediction
works
predictive
algorithms
are
not
magic
boxes
that
divine
future
crime
but
instead
probability
models
of
future
events
based
on
current
environmental
vulnerabilities
creators
of
those
algorithms
understand
that
the
limitations
of
the
predictions
rest
in
the
limitations
of
the
data
and
the
conclusions
drawn
from
the
data
n
early
adopters
of
predictive
policing
technologies
have
focused
primarily
on
property
crimes
for
a
good
reason
the
accumulated
research
data
supports
the
near
repeat
effect
for
some
property
based
crimes
and
not
for
other
crimes
n
if
burglaries
are
contagious
then
it
makes
sense
to
focus
police
efforts
near
the
original
burglary
if
a
particular
parking
lot
generates
a
high
volume
of
car
thefts
it
makes
sense
to
focus
resources
at
that
location
however
the
reason
there
will
be
a
future
crime
is
not
that
there
was
a
past
crime
instead
the
reason
there
will
be
a
future
crime
is
that
the
environmental
vulnerability
that
encouraged
the
first
crime
is
still
unaddressed
this
insight
is
critical
to
incorporate
into
the
reasonable
suspicion
analysis
prediction
should
be
irrelevant
if
the
underlying
vulnerability
has
been
remediated
litigants
and
courts
must
understand
these
limitations
for
example
if
a
particular
block
suffers
a
statistically
high
number
of
car
thefts
over
a
month
period
a
predictive
model
might
forecast
that
the
same
block
will
be
the
locus
of
a
subsequent
theft
blind
adherence
to
the
predictive
forecast
might
mean
that
an
individual
observed
with
a
screwdriver
on
that
block
in
combination
with
the
forecast
might
result
in
reasonable
suspicion
for
a
stop
however
if
prior
to
the
stop
police
had
arrested
the
gang
responsible
for
all
the
prior
car
thefts
improved
the
lighting
in
the
area
and
posted
police
on
the
street
reliance
on
the
prediction
should
be
irrelevant
n
the
reason
why
the
future
crime
is
predicted
to
happen
no
longer
holds
incorporating
predictive
policing
into
the
reasonable
suspicion
analysis
of
the
court
then
would
not
be
appropriate
this
insight
will
require
litigants
challenging
a
predictive
policing
stop
to
understand
the
logic
of
predictive
policing
technologies
legal
motions
may
have
to
be
filed
to
open
up
the
data
or
to
challenge
the
underlying
computer
models
it
requires
courts
to
see
the
prediction
as
a
comment
on
the
environmental
vulnerabilities
that
generate
crime
it
also
means
that
the
environment
must
remain
unchanged
or
uncorrected
such
that
the
same
vulnerability
exists
during
the
time
of
prediction
as
can
be
observed
timing
is
important
the
near
repeat
theory
incorporates
a
natural
decay
such
that
the
prediction
is
only
valid
for
a
short
time
span
one
or
two
weeks
n
this
finding
reveals
the
importance
of
understanding
the
environmental
factors
over
time
those
factors
change
and
thus
cannot
be
the
unthinking
basis
for
a
valid
prediction
the
crime
type
is
also
important
programs
like
risk
terrain
modeling
that
model
violent
crimes
present
different
challenges
than
the
near
repeat
phenomenon
for
property
crimes
violent
crimes
such
as
robbery
might
correlate
with
environmental
factors
isolation
darkness
escape
routes
reasons
for
being
on
the
street
while
violent
crimes
such
as
shooting
correlate
with
very
different
factors
revenge
gangs
turf
borders
computer
algorithms
that
predict
these
latter
types
of
crimes
must
be
based
on
very
different
theories
of
crime
and
place
and
courts
that
rely
on
these
predictions
must
understand
the
differences
the
early
adopters
of
predictive
policing
have
taken
a
careful
approach
to
considering
the
effects
of
their
experiments
admirably
the
coordinators
of
the
study
at
the
lapd
have
looked
to
conduct
validated
studies
with
blind
testing
and
very
precise
areas
as
their
model
n
researchers
developing
rtm
have
also
been
intentional
in
recording
analyzing
and
limiting
their
studies
in
a
scientific
manner
n
the
initial
tests
while
successful
have
been
tempered
with
an
understanding
that
the
methods
are
experimental
and
the
conclusions
restrained
while
there
is
tremendous
interest
in
expanding
the
technology
the
current
predictive
policing
systems
are
being
conducted
in
a
careful
reflective
and
scientific
manner
n
whether
this
caution
will
remain
as
other
police
departments
adopt
the
technology
is
unclear
further
whether
new
adopters
or
courts
recognize
the
limitations
and
logic
of
the
technologies
is
uncertain
a
real
concern
is
that
the
allure
of
a
magic
black
box
that
can
predict
crime
will
become
divorced
from
the
underlying
logic
of
why
the
predictions
work
in
the
first
place
in
fact
as
can
be
seen
in
a
review
of
part
iii
of
this
article
there
is
little
room
in
the
fourth
amendment
legal
analysis
to
argue
the
underlying
principles
of
why
prediction
works
by
the
time
courts
are
addressing
the
issue
a
police
officer
will
have
acted
on
predictive
information
and
arrested
an
individual
blind
reliance
on
the
forecast
divorced
from
the
reason
for
the
forecast
may
lead
to
inappropriate
reliance
on
the
technology
in
addition
to
finding
the
proper
fourth
amendment
analogy
or
articulating
the
reasonable
suspicion
factors
courts
will
have
to
focus
on
why
certain
environmental
factors
might
contribute
to
future
crime
or
why
the
absence
of
those
environmental
vulnerabilities
could
undermine
the
logic
of
the
algorithm
further
courts
will
need
to
remember
that
predictive
policing
predicts
the
potentiality
of
a
crime
and
not
the
crime
itself
and
thus
the
true
test
will
be
the
observation
of
actual
corroborative
criminal
activity
n
keeping
these
issues
in
the
forefront
of
any
reasonable
suspicion
determination
is
an
important
responsibility
for
litigants
and
courts
b
ensuring
reliability
accuracy
and
transparency
underlying
the
question
of
legitimacy
rests
the
foundational
question
of
whether
predictive
policing
technologies
are
reliable
and
accurate
any
data
driven
policing
system
is
only
as
good
as
the
data
involved
n
if
the
data
collection
recording
analysis
or
retention
is
flawed
then
the
entire
system
is
called
into
question
n
prior
experience
with
data
driven
crime
mapping
systems
presents
several
cautionary
lessons
for
the
future
of
predictive
policing
n
reliability
and
accuracy
the
first
concern
rests
on
the
data
itself
predictive
policing
is
based
in
large
measure
on
extrapolations
from
past
crime
data
however
as
has
been
well
studied
not
all
crime
is
reported
not
all
crime
is
recorded
and
thus
not
all
crime
is
included
in
crime
databases
to
be
used
for
predictions
n
while
most
murders
are
reported
not
all
automobile
thefts
petty
thefts
or
domestic
violence
assaults
are
reported
n
further
in
areas
of
high
crime
among
groups
of
violent
criminals
not
all
retaliatory
acts
are
reported
thus
the
precision
assumed
in
a
statistical
probability
may
not
reflect
the
accurate
crime
numbers
current
predictive
policing
has
focused
on
burglary
and
car
theft
two
crimes
that
tend
to
be
reported
more
regularly
perhaps
due
to
the
fixed
nature
of
the
property
or
the
insurance
incentives
to
report
predictive
numbers
for
those
types
of
crimes
might
be
more
accurate
however
as
predictions
move
toward
more
violent
crimes
or
gang
crime
the
underlying
reporting
percentages
need
to
be
reexamined
reporting
of
crimes
must
also
result
in
recording
of
crimes
a
police
report
does
not
get
entered
into
the
system
unless
the
police
officer
records
it
accurately
in
terms
of
date
location
crime
type
and
time
n
this
means
police
paperwork
must
be
accurate
and
processes
must
be
in
place
to
make
sure
that
all
reported
crimes
are
entered
into
the
system
this
emphasis
on
accuracy
is
not
a
speculative
concern
for
example
one
of
the
early
adopters
of
predictive
policing
was
the
memphis
police
department
which
saw
immediate
success
with
its
blue
c
r
u
s
h
crime
reduction
using
statistical
history
program
n
like
many
predictive
policing
tactics
the
blue
c
r
u
s
h
system
was
heralded
as
a
revolutionary
breakthrough
that
reduced
the
crime
rate
in
the
city
of
memphis
n
however
in
an
internal
governmental
audit
discovered
the
existence
of
police
memos
in
which
potential
crimes
were
recorded
but
not
counted
in
the
crime
statistics
this
trove
of
documents
called
into
question
the
scope
of
the
crime
reduction
as
many
potential
crimes
were
simply
not
inputted
into
the
computer
system
n
while
the
city
audit
is
ongoing
it
may
mean
an
upward
revision
in
the
crime
statistics
and
questions
for
a
much
heralded
crime
prevention
program
n
the
imprecision
of
crime
reporting
and
recording
does
not
simply
affect
the
accuracy
of
the
data
but
the
underlying
focus
of
resources
for
law
enforcement
n
if
financial
fraud
or
high
end
drug
dealing
is
underreported
compared
to
car
thefts
then
a
system
based
on
predictive
policing
and
data
will
focus
on
the
latter
at
the
expense
of
the
former
one
might
even
be
able
to
predict
that
certain
areas
would
be
the
site
of
these
crimes
such
as
wall
street
or
certain
university
campuses
but
if
not
reported
the
predictive
analysis
will
never
incorporate
this
data
in
addition
to
accurate
reporting
there
also
must
be
timely
analysis
one
of
the
lessons
of
the
crime
and
place
studies
is
that
the
near
repeat
effect
decays
quite
rapidly
n
crime
reports
must
be
inputted
into
the
systems
in
a
timely
enough
fashion
to
be
useful
to
officers
on
the
street
this
means
a
move
to
more
real
time
reporting
such
that
the
predictive
numbers
will
change
at
least
weekly
if
not
daily
or
hourly
finally
the
algorithms
chosen
to
forecast
crimes
must
be
validated
tested
and
submitted
for
outside
study
in
general
academic
scholars
have
developed
these
algorithms
from
experiments
independent
of
the
world
of
law
enforcement
n
as
academics
are
versed
in
the
scientific
method
scholars
expect
testing
and
peer
validation
this
tradition
however
may
run
into
tension
with
traditional
law
enforcement
practices
of
maintaining
control
and
secrecy
over
tactical
operations
further
some
of
the
predictive
policing
programs
are
proprietary
and
opening
them
for
study
would
decrease
the
competitive
advantage
of
those
institutions
or
companies
that
own
the
programs
n
adopters
of
predictive
policing
technologies
will
have
to
balance
the
utility
of
tactical
secrecy
with
the
reality
that
courts
and
litigants
will
be
seeking
to
evaluate
the
reliability
of
the
programs
only
in
this
way
will
the
legitimacy
of
the
technology
be
accepted
for
use
in
courts
transparency
related
to
the
internal
data
collection
and
analysis
is
the
concern
of
how
that
information
gets
translated
to
courts
and
litigants
in
a
court
proceeding
predictive
policing
programs
will
need
to
be
explained
to
courts
in
a
way
that
accurately
addresses
concerns
with
data
collection
analysis
and
the
creation
of
the
probabilities
after
all
it
will
be
a
judge
that
agrees
or
disagrees
with
the
reliability
of
the
information
before
it
can
be
included
in
the
totality
of
circumstances
calculus
one
can
easily
imagine
the
situation
described
earlier
from
santa
cruz
in
which
a
police
officer
explains
to
the
court
that
at
roll
call
he
was
informed
that
a
particular
block
had
a
probability
of
a
car
theft
for
a
particular
time
and
that
is
why
he
stopped
a
suspect
near
a
car
n
the
questions
may
include
where
did
that
probability
number
come
from
how
accurate
is
it
how
timely
how
reliable
adopters
of
the
new
technologies
will
need
to
have
answers
that
will
satisfy
the
courts
in
a
contested
hearing
metrics
for
evaluation
will
need
to
be
created
and
then
it
will
be
up
to
courts
to
address
the
line
drawing
on
a
case
by
case
basis
this
type
of
questioning
could
probably
be
addressed
outside
the
courtroom
if
mechanisms
of
accountability
and
transparency
were
built
into
the
predictive
policing
systems
independent
oversight
boards
audits
and
other
methods
to
test
and
retest
the
data
collection
and
analysis
may
be
needed
n
regulations
standards
and
best
practices
will
have
to
be
developed
and
disseminated
litigants
will
need
to
know
about
internal
processes
and
be
able
to
compare
them
to
other
systems
in
other
jurisdictions
this
will
mean
allowing
access
into
the
systems
as
well
as
limiting
some
of
the
proprietary
or
secrecy
arguments
mentioned
above
all
of
these
improvements
in
transparency
will
be
needed
for
public
oversight
of
these
new
public
safety
initiatives
these
issues
have
been
recognized
by
some
of
the
early
adopters
of
predictive
policing
the
lapd
pilot
program
has
for
example
developed
a
blind
control
test
to
see
the
effect
of
its
program
and
this
pilot
project
is
being
overseen
by
academics
trained
in
the
scientific
method
n
in
addition
the
lapd
model
has
been
designed
to
avoid
the
self
fulfilling
prophecy
concern
that
predictions
will
lead
to
arrests
which
will
lead
to
additional
predictions
in
the
same
area
n
to
remedy
this
problem
the
lapd
model
looks
at
a
three
year
period
of
crimes
and
does
not
over
value
recent
arrests
into
the
model
n
this
pilot
program
was
designed
with
accountability
and
transparency
in
mind
and
should
likely
be
a
model
not
just
for
effectiveness
but
also
for
a
process
of
openness
in
developing
these
programs
as
the
programs
expand
across
the
country
adopting
these
control
mechanisms
may
be
equally
as
important
as
adopting
the
technology
c
hard
cases
predictive
policing
may
well
become
an
effective
tool
for
law
enforcement
yet
the
technology
will
also
create
tension
for
police
in
defending
fourth
amendment
challenges
by
defendants
most
notably
by
defining
particular
areas
of
high
crime
down
to
the
block
police
are
also
implicitly
demarcating
other
areas
as
not
predicted
areas
of
heightened
criminal
activity
n
this
move
changes
how
police
and
prosecutors
will
be
able
to
rely
on
the
generic
high
crime
area
designation
as
there
have
been
thousands
of
reported
cases
involving
a
high
crime
area
the
number
of
potential
cases
implicated
by
this
change
is
significant
n
for
example
assume
police
are
dispatched
to
a
predicted
block
of
heightened
car
theft
following
the
map
in
front
of
them
the
police
set
up
surveillance
for
the
forecast
crime
nothing
happens
and
after
a
while
the
police
drive
off
two
blocks
away
the
police
see
a
young
man
with
a
screwdriver
standing
near
a
parked
car
at
that
moment
the
police
are
no
longer
in
the
predicted
area
while
subjectively
the
police
are
no
doubt
influenced
by
the
concern
of
car
thefts
in
the
general
area
and
objectively
such
a
concern
might
be
reasonable
the
forecast
does
not
cover
that
block
it
is
not
a
micro
area
of
heightened
crime
the
man
does
not
fit
the
profile
plus
activity
model
the
tip
is
for
the
wrong
area
so
assuming
the
officers
go
ahead
and
stop
and
search
the
young
man
the
predictive
profiling
model
works
against
the
officers
for
fourth
amendment
purposes
the
officers
cannot
rely
on
the
forecast
while
the
officers
common
sense
response
is
probably
come
on
we
were
just
two
blocks
away
the
move
from
a
predicted
area
of
particular
crime
to
a
generic
and
undefined
high
crime
area
might
actually
weaken
the
justification
to
stop
a
similar
problem
may
arise
when
the
predictive
model
suggests
that
one
type
of
crime
will
occur
and
an
observing
officer
sees
suspicious
activity
of
another
type
of
crime
as
discussed
the
logic
of
the
prediction
is
based
on
certain
types
of
crimes
n
further
the
logic
of
the
relevance
of
the
stop
is
based
on
the
nexus
between
prediction
and
observation
yet
one
can
easily
imagine
that
the
stakeout
for
a
residential
burglary
will
result
in
the
observation
of
a
suspicious
activity
unrelated
to
burglary
whereas
in
the
past
an
officer
could
finesse
the
difference
by
alluding
to
the
high
crime
nature
of
the
neighborhood
now
the
precision
of
predictive
policing
might
undercut
that
argument
a
final
example
might
involve
the
problems
with
statistical
probabilities
one
of
the
consequences
of
developing
a
sophisticated
crime
prediction
model
is
that
the
predictive
percentages
will
be
available
for
all
to
see
a
police
officer
who
used
to
be
able
to
state
in
a
suppression
hearing
i
was
patrolling
a
high
theft
area
one
of
the
top
areas
for
car
thefts
in
the
city
now
might
be
faced
with
justifying
whether
a
likely
prediction
as
directed
by
an
algorithm
is
sufficient
to
change
the
reasonable
suspicion
calculus
or
as
described
earlier
an
officer
may
be
faced
with
arguing
that
a
increase
is
statistically
significant
n
in
the
traditional
situation
most
trial
judges
would
take
on
good
faith
the
officer
s
generalized
professional
judgment
with
the
statistics
however
now
the
court
can
evaluate
the
probabilities
on
its
own
and
it
may
reach
a
contrary
conclusion
in
each
of
these
cases
the
court
may
well
limit
the
often
malleable
reasonable
suspicion
doctrine
hard
data
has
a
way
of
hardening
previously
fuzzy
judgment
calls
to
be
clear
in
the
above
examples
courts
may
still
choose
to
keep
both
the
high
crime
area
designation
and
the
predictive
forecast
as
separate
and
independent
bases
for
reasonable
suspicion
but
a
new
reliance
on
precise
real
time
crime
statistics
is
going
to
undercut
the
utility
of
the
old
overbroad
designation
while
this
may
be
a
positive
development
it
is
a
consideration
that
adopting
jurisdictions
may
want
to
consider
d
discriminatory
use
or
discriminatory
effect
a
concern
with
all
law
enforcement
technology
is
that
it
could
be
used
in
a
discriminatory
fashion
on
its
face
objective
data
driven
police
tactics
should
reduce
not
increase
the
discriminatory
effect
of
certain
police
tactics
however
as
can
be
seen
in
a
few
real
world
examples
data
driven
law
enforcement
can
have
a
disproportionate
effect
on
certain
communities
that
perceive
it
as
discriminatory
the
new
york
city
police
department
has
led
the
nation
in
its
implementation
of
a
data
driven
law
enforcement
model
n
the
adoption
of
the
compstat
program
led
to
a
dramatic
drop
in
crime
in
new
york
city
n
at
the
same
time
numerous
complaints
arose
both
about
the
pressures
to
collect
data
make
arrests
as
well
as
its
impact
on
certain
communities
n
currently
new
york
city
is
being
sued
by
citizens
over
the
use
of
stop
and
frisk
policies
that
are
largely
focused
on
certain
communities
n
the
numbers
are
striking
as
over
half
a
million
citizens
were
stopped
and
frisked
every
year
for
the
last
few
years
n
most
of
those
citizens
were
people
of
color
n
whether
data
driven
or
not
the
focus
on
particular
communities
usually
poor
and
usually
communities
of
color
has
created
concerns
about
constitutional
equities
while
all
citizens
would
like
reduced
crime
for
citizens
in
higher
crime
areas
the
costs
of
that
reduction
in
terms
of
police
citizen
tension
liberty
infringements
and
occasional
physical
violence
have
not
always
been
squarely
balanced
n
in
addition
constitutional
freedoms
to
assemble
travel
and
participate
are
at
stake
in
theory
predictive
policing
should
improve
these
tensions
because
the
focus
is
on
single
blocks
not
neighborhoods
and
particular
crimes
not
general
neighborhood
reputation
in
addition
if
the
strategy
is
merely
to
direct
police
to
higher
areas
of
crime
in
order
to
disrupt
the
environmental
vulnerability
and
not
arrest
anyone
then
this
innovation
may
decrease
rather
than
increase
police
citizen
tension
on
the
other
hand
one
could
imagine
potential
discrimination
if
certain
groups
were
targeted
using
predictive
technologies
while
gangs
are
an
obvious
and
oft
stated
target
of
future
use
one
could
see
how
predictive
forecasts
of
gang
criminal
activities
coupled
with
corroboration
of
gang
presence
in
an
area
could
result
in
an
automatic
finding
of
reasonable
suspicion
to
stop
gang
members
on
the
street
while
perhaps
not
the
most
sympathetic
figures
for
protecting
fourth
amendment
freedoms
such
police
made
manufacturing
of
reasonable
suspicion
also
runs
counter
to
existing
constitutional
law
n
e
courtroom
effect
as
a
final
matter
courts
should
consider
the
practical
effect
of
allowing
predictive
policing
programs
to
influence
the
reasonable
suspicion
analysis
in
court
independent
of
concerns
with
reliability
accuracy
or
potential
manipulation
there
is
a
separate
issue
with
allowing
law
enforcement
to
control
the
factors
that
make
up
reasonable
suspicion
as
seen
in
the
creation
of
profiles
or
the
claim
of
suspicion
based
on
presence
in
a
high
crime
area
a
malleable
reasonable
suspicion
test
offers
little
protection
from
a
police
stop
the
concern
with
adding
a
prediction
model
to
an
already
weakened
reasonable
suspicion
standard
is
that
one
factor
can
control
the
totality
of
circumstances
in
finding
reasonable
suspicion
the
prediction
because
it
comes
from
an
objective
source
will
color
the
subjective
suspicion
of
the
officer
and
the
ultimate
objective
decision
of
the
court
in
practical
application
it
will
be
difficult
for
a
court
to
discount
the
weight
of
some
objective
support
for
the
officer
s
suspicion
to
allow
predictive
policing
such
influence
without
mechanisms
of
accountability
for
the
data
and
analysis
and
without
full
transparency
may
result
in
a
troubling
lack
of
protection
for
individuals
who
end
up
in
the
forecasted
areas
n
this
concern
should
inspire
courts
to
take
a
more
active
role
in
ensuring
that
the
predictive
policing
models
work
and
can
be
evaluated
this
will
result
in
new
battles
over
discovery
expert
reports
and
line
drawing
about
the
predictive
validity
of
the
claims
this
development
is
to
be
expected
and
welcomed
as
a
natural
course
of
new
technologies
being
introduced
into
courtrooms
conclusion
in
the
future
predictive
policing
will
affect
the
fourth
amendment
reasonable
suspicion
analysis
how
it
affects
it
and
whether
these
changes
weaken
or
strengthen

remains

this

has
attempted
to
provide
a

and
do
in

make
additional
arrests
that
go
back

it
could
skew
further
forecasting
in

model
we
would
hope
to
deploy
the

only
and
then
hopefully
deny
the

the

it
might
seem
a

of
a
quarter
of

of
valuable
police
time
but
the
way
the
sergeant
sees
things
the
long
slow
tour
of
a
seemingly
normal
parking
lot
is
one
of
the
most
important
things
he
s
done
all
day
that
s
how
things
roll
in
the
brave
new
world
of
computerised
predictive
policing
a
hi
tech
crime
busting
technique
which
gomperz
is
helping
to
pioneer
and
which
has
the
potential
to
revolutionise
modern
law
enforcement
the
technique
revolves
around
a
single
mathematical
algorithm
developed
by
the
university
of
california
los
angeles
this
complex
equation
can
in
theory
predict
with
pinpoint
accuracy
where
criminal
offences
are
most
likely
to
happen
on
any
given
day
though
that
sounds
like
the
stuff
of
science
fiction
novels
the
principle
is
relatively
straightforward
it
mines
several
years
crime
statistics
to
tease
out
hidden
patterns
once
identified
they
are
projected
into
the
future
to
predict
where
cars
might
be
stolen
or
houses
burgled
on
any
given
day
the
forecasts
are
startlingly
specific
and
that
s
where
the
policing
comes
in
each
morning
gomperz
and
his
colleagues
in
the
foothill
area
of
los
angeles
where
the
technology
is
being
tested
are
given
maps
identifying
a
handful
of
boxes
measuring
ft
x
ft
the
supposed
crime
hot
spots
for
that
day
the
officers
are
instructed
to
visit
them
as
often
as
time
allows
once
inside
the
box
they
make
themselves
as
visible
as
possible
the
shopping
centre
car
park
which
gomperz
has
just
slowly
criss
crossed
is
bang
in
the
middle

one
of
that
day
s

computerised
predictive
policing
is
still
in
its
infancy
but
all
the
early
signs
are
that
it
has
a
startling
effect
in
the
city
of
santa
cruz
california
where
it
was
first
trialled
this
summer
a
per
cent
drop
in
crime
was
recorded
meanwhile
in
foothill
a
sq
mile
portion
of
northern
los

the
number
of
non
violent
crimes
has
dropped
from
around
a
week
to
nearer
in
the
eight
weeks
since
trials
began
so
striking
have
the
results
been
that
ucla
s
system
will
this
year
be
rolled
out
across
los

one
of
america
s
largest
police
forces
and
it
could
soon
be

captain

lapd
officer
who
helped
to
develop
the
technology
will
showcase
it
to
delegates
at
the
defence
geospatial
intelligence
conference
in
london
anecdotally
it
seems
to
work
from
the
data
we
re
seeing
it
stops
crime
happening
malinowski
says
adding
that
an
era
of
declining
resources
the
lapd
currently
has
a
paid
overtime
ban
predictive
policing
can
be
a
particularly
valuable
tool
since
it
isn
t
labour
intensive
if
a
suspect
turns
up
say
to
steal
a
car
and
he
sees
a
police
officer
then
maybe
that
s
enough
to
stop
him
committing
a
crime
that
day
making
arrests
is
still
important
it
keeps
officers
motivated
and
in
this
trial
it
has
certainly
been
happening
when
officers
are
in
their
boxes
but
arresting
people
also
takes
up
a
huge
amount
of
time
booking
one
guy
can
take
up
most
of
a
shift
so
if
we
can
reduce
crime
without
doing
that
so
much
the
better
malinowski
struck
on
the
idea
for
computerised
predictive
policing
several
years
ago
when
he
was
asked
to
supply
ucla
with
crime
data
for
a
research
project
a
bookish
man
with
an
interest
in
academia
he
began
attending
lectures
there
and
soon
learnt
that
it
was
theoretically
possible
to
use
equations
to
model
naturally
occurring
events
such
as
animal
population
growths
or
migration
patterns
in
conjunction
with
several
ucla
academics
he
decided
to
create
an
equation
which
could
model
crime
patterns
the
algorithm
they
came
up
with
uses
three
pieces
of
information
about
each
crime
the
time
date
and
co
ordinates
before
teasing
patterns
out
of
the
data
jeff
brantingham
a
ucla
anthropologist
who
helped
to
develop
it
says
the
ongoing
trial
in
foothill
is
using
a
randomised
control
on
some
days
the
co
ordinates
of
the
boxes
officers
are
asked
to
focus
on
are
randomly
generated
on
others
they
use
the
algorithm
comparing
crime
on
the
days
we
use
the
algorithm
and
the
days
we
don
t
will
give
us
a
true
gold
standard
test
as
to
whether
it
really
works
he
says
we
are
also
trying
to
measure
appropriate
dosage
how
long
an
officer
needs
to
spend
in
a
box
for
it
to
be
effective
the
concept
of
predictive
policing
is
not
without
critics
civil
libertarians
are
concerned
it
might
lead
to
life
mirroring
the
film
minority
report
which
starred
tom
cruise
in
which
police
target
people
for
crimes
they
might
commit
at
some
undetermined
point
in
the
future
it
also
has
legal
complications
under
the
fourth
amendment
of
the
us
constitution
police
officers
are
forbidden
from
stopping
a
suspect
without
reasonable
suspicion
that
they
are
committing
a
crime
no
one
yet
knows
whether
simply
being
in
a
geographic
box
identified
by
a
computer
programme
represents
reasonable
suspicion
what
happens
if
officers
turn
up
at
a
ft
x
ft
area
on
the
look
out
for
burglaries
see
a
guy
with
a
black
bag
search
him
and
find
it
contains
stolen
goods
wonders
andrew
ferguson
an
assistant
professor
of
law
at
the
university
of
the
district
of
colombia
if
that
case
goes
to
court
there
will
be
the
question
of
whether
it
was
reasonable
for
the
officer
to
suspect
he
was
committing
a
crime
if
computerised
predictive
policing
catches
on
ferguson
expects
a
test
case
eventually
to
work
its
way
up
to
the
us
supreme
court
in
the
meantime
he
expects
noisy
kickback
from
civil
rights
groups
that
a
computer
can
effectively
curtail
the
fourth
amendment
rights
of
individuals
in
certain
areas
would
be
particularly
troubling
to
the
civil
liberties
lobby
he
says
there
will
also
be
concerns
that
if
police
wanted
to
target
certain
areas
or
demographics
then
they
could
simply
tweak
the
algorithm
to
ensure
officers
visit
certain
neighbourhoods
back
on
the
streets
of
foothill
sergeant
gomperz
has
no
such
concerns

catches

maybe
something
way

gomperz
all
i
know
is
that

he

and
he
s
moving
on
when
i
see

i
think
maybe
that
s
stopped
him
committing

and
that
makes
me
think
that
this

thing
really
works
algorithms

exactly
is
an

an

recursive
computational
procedure
for
solving
a

in

or
to
put
it
more
simply
it
s
like
a
mathematical
recipe
a
set
formula
for
finding
your
way
through

long
codes
used

the
man

mohamed

to

it
might
seem
a
waste
of
a
quarter
of
an
hour
of
valuable
police
time
but
the
way
the
sergeant
sees
things
the
long
slow
tour
of
a
seemingly
normal
parking
lot
is
one
of
the
most
important
things
he
s
done
all
day
that
s
how
things
roll
in
the
brave
new
world
of
computerised
predictive

a
hi
tech
crimebusting
technique
which
gomperz
is
helping
to
pioneer
and
which
has
the
potential
to
revolutionise
modern
law
enforcement
the
technique
revolves
around
a
single
mathematical
algorithm
developed
by
the
university
of
california
los
angeles
this
complex
equation
can
in
theory
predict
with
pinpoint
accuracy
where
criminal
offences
are
most
likely
to
happen
on
any
given
day
though
that
sounds
like
the
stuff
of
science
fiction
the
principle
is
relatively
straightforward
it
mines
several
years
crime
statistics
to
tease
out
hidden
patterns
once
identified
they
are
projected
into
the
future
to
predict
where
cars
might
be
stolen
or
houses
burgled
on
any
given
day
the
forecasts
are
startlingly
specific
and
that
s
where
the
policing
comes
in
each
morning
gomperz
and
his
colleagues
in
the
foothill
area
of
los
angeles
where
the
technology
is
being
tested
are
given
maps
showing
boxes
measuring
ft
x
ft
the
supposed
crime
hot
spots
for
that
day
the
officers
are
instructed
to
visit
them
as
often
as
time
allows
once
inside
the
box
they
make
themselves
as
visible
as
possible
the
shopping
centre
car
park
which
gomperz
has
just
slowly
criss
crossed
is
bang
in
the
middle
of
one
of
that
day
s
boxes
computerised
predictive
policing
is
still
in
its
infancy
but
all
the
early
signs
are
that
it
has
a
startling
effect
in
the
city
of
santa
cruz
california
where
it
was
first
trialled
this
summer
a
per
cent
drop
in
crime
was
recorded
meanwhile
in
foothill
a
square
mile
portion
of
northern
la
the
number
of
non
violent
crimes
has
dropped
from
around
a
week
to
nearer
in
the
eight
weeks
since
trials
began
so
striking
have
the
results
been
that
ucla
s
system
will
this
year
be
rolledout
across
los
angeles
one
of
america
s
largest
police
forces
and
it
could
soon
be
crossing
the

on

officer
who
helped
to
develop
the
technology
will
showcase
it
to
delegates
at
the

geospatial
intelligence
conference
in
london
anecdotally
it
seems
to
work
from
the
data
we
re
seeing
it
stops
crime
happening
malinowski
says
adding
that
in
an
era
of
declining
resources
the
lapd
currently
has
a
paid
overtime
ban
predictive
policing
can
be
a
valuable
tool
if
a
suspect
turns
up
say
to
steal
a
car
and
he
sees
a
police
officer
then
maybe
that
s
enough
to
stop
him
committing
a
crime
that
day
making
arrests
is
still
important
it
keeps
officers
motivated
and
in
this
trial
it
has
certainly
been
happening
when
officers
are
in
their
boxes
but
arresting
people
also
takes
up
a
huge
amount
of
time
so
if
we
can
reduce
crime
without
doing
that
so
much
the
better
malinowski
struck
on
the
idea
for
computerised
predictive
policing
several
years
ago
when
he
was
asked
to
supply
ucla
with
crime
data
for
a
research
project
a
bookish
man
with
an
interest
in
academia
he
began
attending
lectures
there
and
soon
learnt
that
it
was
theoretically
possible
to
use
equations
to
model
naturally
occurring
events
such
as
animal
population
growths
or
migration
patterns
in
conjunction
with
ucla
academics
he
decided
to
create
an
equation
which
could
model
crime
patterns
the
algorithm
they
came
up
with
uses
three
pieces
of
information
about
each
crime
the
time
date
and
co
ordinates

jeff

a

anthropologist
who

it
says
the
ongoing
trial
in

is
using
a
randomised
control
on
some
days
the
coordinates
of
the
boxes
officers
are
asked
to
focus
on
are
randomly
generated
on
others
they
use
the
algorithm
comparing
crime
on
the
days
we
use
the
algorithm
and
the
days
we
don
t
will
give
us
a
true
gold
standard
test
as
to
whether
it
really
works
he
says
we
are
also
trying
to
measure
appropriate
dosage
how
long
an
officer
needs
to
spend
in
a
box
for
it
to
be
effective
the
technology
is
not
without
critics
civil
libertarians
are
concerned
it
might
lead
to
life
mirroring
the
tom
cruise
film
minority
report
in
which
police
target
people
for
crimes
which
they
might
commit
at
some
point
in
the
future
it
also
has
legal
complications
under
the
fourth
amendment
of
the
us
constitution
police
officers
are
forbidden
from
stopping
a
suspect
without
reasonable
suspicion
that
they
are
committing
a
crime
no
one
yet
knows
whether
simply
being
in
a
geographic
box
identified
by
a
computer
programme
passes
the
test
what
happens
if
officers
turn
up
at
a
ft
x
ft
area
on
the
lookout
for
burglaries
see
a
guy
with
a

search

if
that

there
will
be
the
question
of
whether

for

to
suspect
he

sergeant
gomperz
has
no
such
concerns

drives
to
another

this
time
at

named
after
ritchie

the
mexican
american
songwriter
as
we
pull
up
next
to
a
children

playground
a
young
man
with
tattoos
cropped
hair
and
a
menacing
pit
bull
terrier
catches
sight
of
the
patrol
car
seconds
later
he
turns
around
and
hastily
disappears
from
the
scene
maybe
he
s
going
home
to
his
mother
maybe
he
doesn
t
have
a
licence
for
that
dog
maybe
something
way
more
sinister
is
going
on
says
gomperz
all
i
know
is
that
he
was
here
he
s
seen
us
and
he
s
moving
on
when
i
see
that
i
think
maybe
that
s
stopped
him
committing
a

and
that
makes
me
think
that
this

really
works
arresting
people
takes
time

zach
friend
press
information
officer
and
crime
analyst
for
the
santa

pd
said
the
program
s
success
really
started
being
noticed
a
few
months
after
the
department
installed
the
system
as
a
pilot
project
in
july
crime
data
is
pumped
into
a
database
and
a
complex
computer
algorithm
predicts
hotspots
around
the
city
where
officers
can
expect
illegal
activity
to
occur
once
officers
got
comfortable
using
data
generated
from
the
sophisticated
computer
algorithm
crime
started
going
down
and
some
arrests
were
made
because
of
correct
predictions
for
example
in
august
an
officer
was
out
at
a
m
driving
into
a
zone
that
the
predictive
technology
told
him
to
check
out
he
noticed
two
people
attempting
to
steal
a
car
and
arrested
them
until
alerted
by
the
police
the
car
s
owner
had
no
idea
the
vehicle
had
been
tampered
with
to
me
that
s
the
perfect
example
of
the
success
of
the
program
preventing
the
crimes
before
they
occur
in
the
first
place
friend
said
predictive
policing
technology
is
becoming
widespread
among
local
law
enforcement
agencies
in
the
u
s
los
angeles
and
chicago
have
been
using
crime
stats
and
analytic
tools
for
a
few
years
now
other
cities
such
as
rialto
calif
are
just
starting
their
own
programs
initial
changes
the
santa
cruz
pd
bumped
its
predictive
policing
program
from
an
experimental
phase
to
full
operation
in
july
in
addition
to
property
theft
the
system
is
now
used
to
predict
gang
activity
and
street
crimes
for
specialty
units
in
the
department
when
officers
in
one
of
the
specialty
units
access
the
system
they
can
check
off
selections
to
run
predictive
analyses
just
in
their
specific
area
without
the
inclusion
of
property
theft
data
while
statistics
on
the
accuracy
of
these
predictions
aren
t
available
yet
friend
said
the
predictive
technology
has
been
able
to
focus
the
efforts
of
those
units
even
further
in
addition
the
system
is
now
automated
when
the
technology
was
initially
deployed
maps
featuring
the
predictive
algorithm
s
crime
hot
spot
findings
were
manually
generated
by
friend
on
a
daily
basis
now
maps
are
produced
and
supervisors
log
in
to
the
system
prior
to
briefings
and
print
out
a
one
page
sheet
that
lists
the
predicted
crime
locations
for
the
day
the
information
can
be
accessed
online
by
any
officer
and
the
data
is
refreshed
hourly
giving
users
almost
real
time
statistical
views
friend
said
data
generated
by
the
system
can
be
accessed
by
in
car
computers
and
smartphones
but
the
department
hasn
t
upgraded
its
equipment
yet
so
it
s
unable
to
accommodate
it
friend
believes
technology
upgrades
are
inevitable
however
a
lot
of
the
younger
officers
that
are
coming
up
are
very
adept
with
technology
and
have
an
expectation
that
the
technology
they
use
at
home
will
be
used
on
the
job
friend
said
i
think
predictive
technology
systems
like
this
will
be
widely
adopted
especially
by
younger
generations
of
officers
that
are
very
comfortable
with
having
data
in
their
cars
having
maps
and
the
interactivity
he
added
while
the
predictive
crime
maps
are
useful
friend
said
there
aren

police
are

beat
offenders
to
the
scene
of
a
crime
by
using
computers
to
predict
where
trouble
might
occur
the
los
angeles
police
department
is
the
largest
agency
to
embrace
an
experiment
known
as
predictive
policing
which
crunches
data
to
determine
where
to
send
officers
to
thwart
would
be
thieves
early
successes
could
serve
as
a
model
for
other
cash
strapped
law
enforcement
agencies
but
some
legal
observers
are
concerned
that
it
could
lead
to
stops
and
searches
that
violate
fourth
amendment
protections
in
the
san
fernando
valley
where
the
program
was
launched
late
last
year
officers
are
seeing
double
digit
drops
in
burglaries
and
other
property
crimes
the
program
has
turned
enough
in
house
skeptics
into
believers
that
there
are
plans
to
roll
it
out
citywide
by
next
summer
we
have
prevented
hundreds
and
hundreds
of
people
coming
home
and
seeing
their
homes
robbed
capt
sean
malinowski
said
crime
mapping
has
long
been
a
tool
used
to
determine
where
the
bad
guys
lurk
the
idea
has
evolved
from
colored
pins
placed
on
a
map
to
identifying
hot
spots
via
a
computer
database
of
past
crimes
and
possible
patterns
over
the
past
decade
many
large
police
departments
including
los
angeles
and
new
york
city
have
used
compstat
a
system
that
tracks
crime
figures
and
enables
police
to
send
extra
officers
to
trouble
spots
the
new
program
used
by
the
lapd
and
police
in
the
northern
california
city
of
santa
cruz
is
more
timely
and
precise
proponents
said
built
on
the
same
model
for
predicting
aftershocks
following
an
earthquake
the
software
promises
to
show
officers
what
might
be
coming
based
on
simple
constantly
calibrated
data
location
time
and
type
of
crime
the
software
generates
prediction
boxes
as
small
as
square
feet
on
a
patrol
map
when
officers
have
spare
time
they
are
told
to
go
in
the
box
the
goal
is
not
to
boost
the
number
of
arrests
a
common
benchmark
to
reflect
crime
reduction
officers
want
to
intercept
a
crime
in
progress
or
deter
would
be
criminals
i
want
to
disrupt
an
activity
before
an
arrest
is
made
malinowski
said
jeff
brantingham
an
anthropology
professor
at
ucla
said
the
data
are
derived
in
part
from
criminal
behaviors
repeat
victimization
and
the
notion
that
criminals
tend
not
to
stray
too
far
from
areas
they
know
best
if
you
are
victimized
today
the
risk
that
you
ll
be
a
victim
again
goes
way
up
said
brantingham
who
co
founded
a
software
company
tapped
by
the
lapd
for
its
program
so
far
the
program
has
been
implemented
in
five
lapd
divisions
that
cover
square
miles
and
about
million
people
in
the
valley
s
foothill
division
where
more
than
half
of
the
crimes
committed
are
property
related
about
patrol
officers
are
spending
a
total
of
about
hours
a
week
working
in
the
boxes
in
one
instance
a
police
captain
questioned
sending
officers
into
a
box
that
was
on
the
edge
of
his
coverage
area
officers
went
out
and
didn
t
find
anything
but
returned
several
nights
later
and
found
a
man
breaking
a
window
the
division
leads
the
department
in
crime
reduction
malinowski
said
crimes
were
down
in
the
area
percent
following
the
rollout
compared
with
a
slight
uptick
across
the
rest
of
the
city
where
the
program
wasn
t
being
used
if
you
had
told
us
a
few
years
ago
you
could
get
an
algorithm
to
perform
the
same
as
a
crime
analyst
we
would
think
you
were
crazy
malinowski
said
even
the
most
skeptical
people
are
now
coming
up
to
me
and
saying
i
think
this
is
working
x
ac
x
other
police
departments
across
the
nation
are
using
similar
approaches
ibm
has
teamed
up
with

ferguson
said
the

is
a
seductive
idea
for

of
power
he
said
that
the

has
done
a
good
job
with

but
he
s
concerned
that

abuse
the

a

there
are
real
pressures
to

this
nationally

ferguson
said
i
think
it

an

but
like
any

it

not
foolproof

the

this
can
be

in

he

andrew
ferguson
a
law
professor
at
the
university
of
the
district
of
columbia
said
the
use
of
technology
could
be
positive
but
that
it
could
lower
the
threshold
for
constitutional
protections
on
unreasonable
searches
to
stop
you
and
frisk
you
and
search
you
a
police
officer
needs
reasonable
suspicion
so
my
question
is
how
will
this
affect
reasonable
suspicion
he
said
if
the
search
is
based
on
a
computer
algorithm
ferguson
said
and
the
case
comes
to
court
how
do
you
cross
examine
a
computer
ibm
s
cleverly
said
the
technology
can
in
many
cases
improve
privacy
you
can
pinpoint
the
record
of
who
has
access
to
information
you
have
a
solid
history
of
what

going

so
if
someone
is

you
have

on

the

suggests

introduction
the
last
fifteen
to
twenty
years
has
brought
a
paradigm
shift
in
local
policing
efforts
moving
from
a
reactive
approach
to
a
proactive
one
marked
by
community
engagement
and
proble
moriented
policing
processes
this
shift
spawned
the
rise
of
community
policing
as
a
dominant
trend
in
local
policing
community
policing
is
in
part
based
on
the
seminal
work
of
george
l
kelling
and
james
q
wilson
s
broken
windows
n
the
broken
windows
theory
links
minor
public
disorders
vagrancy
public
drunkenness
and
panhandling
to
name
a
few
to
violent
crime
if
such
small
offenses
are
allowed
to
pervade
a
community
they
will
inevitably
escalate
and
lead
to
a
community
plagued
by
violent
crime
building
on
social
psychology
theory
the
broken
windows
theory
views
maintaining
a
perception
of
community
orderliness
by
cracking
down
on
low
level
criminal
offenses
to
stop
their
proliferation
or
escalation
as
central
to
keeping
that
community
safe
community
policing
was
designed
on
these
premises
and
thus
many
local
governments
adopted
order
maintenance
laws
such
as
panhandling
ordinances
anti
gang
statutes
anti
homeless
statutes
and
anti
loitering
laws
to
take
aim
at
maintaining
order
in
their
communities
this
focus
on
low
level
offenses
led
to
increases
in
prosecutions
and
a
demand
for
attendant
needs
such
as
jails
prisons
and
other
social
services
related
to
the
criminal
justice
system
this
trend
in
local
policing
also
coincided
with
a
wave
of
tough
on
crime
political
rhetoric
and
policies
the
great
recessions
n
and
the
related
budget
deficits
faced
by
many
local
governments
are
forcing
local
governments
n
to
think
critically
about
their
commitment
to
community
policing
and
the
costs
associated
with
it
can
this
dominant
approach
to
local
policing
remain
intact
with
the
economic
realities
faced
by
local
governments
or
might
new
local
policing
philosophies
align
with
fledgling
movements
in
the
criminal
justice
and
social
service
systems
that
seek
to
make
difficult
but
cost
efficient
decisions
regarding
the
allocation
of
scarce
resources
this
article
explores
these
questions
to
determine
what
changes
are
in
store
for
local
governments
due
to
the
current
economic
crisis
and
what
their
implications
are
for
localities
this
article
will
also
examine
the
proposed
changes
to
the
criminal
justice
and
social
service
systems
that
seek
cost
efficient
approaches
that
hark
back
to
a
rehabilitative
approach
to
low
level
criminals
in
somewhat
stark
contrast
to
the
tough
on
crime
rhetoric
that
has
pervaded
the
political
debate
finally
this
article
will
assess
and
evaluate
the
broader
implications
of
these
coalescing
trends
on
local
policing
and
criminal
justice
and
social
service
systems
part

of
this

provides
an
overview
of

the
most
prevalent

today
part
iii
briefly
describes
the
broken

theory
which
serves
as
a
foundational
basis
for
this
model
of
policing
part
iv
describes
some
of
the
costs
of
community
policing
both
for
local

and
arrestees
part
v
explores
how
the
financial
downturn
marked
by
the
great
recession
has
affected
local
government
funding
and
describes
the
difficult
funding
choices
communities
face
related
to
police
services
and
more
generally
because
of
these
changed
circumstances
part
vi
analyzes
how
cities
have
responded
to
reduced
funding
in
both
traditional
and
nontraditional
manners
part
vii
reflects
on
how
these
difficult
economic
times
may
provide
an
opportunity
for
a
more
creative
holistic
approach
to
policing
and
social
services
in
the
form
of
evidence
based
decision
making
that
remains
consistent
with
the
broken

theory
of
community
policing
while
adjusting
to
the
realities
of
current
local

budgets
part

uses
milwaukee
county
as
an
example
of
how
some
localities
are
embracing

to
reinvent

community
policing
the
term
community
policing
has
no
settled
definition
while
the
goal
of
this
article
is
not
to
delve
into
the
various
iterations
and
characteristics
that
collectively
define
community
policing
a
working
definition
and
understanding
proves
helpful
for
the
purposes
of
the
forthcoming
analysis
community
policing
is
a
theoretical
and
practical
approach
to
policing
that
focuses
on
crime
prevention
order
maintenance
and
partnership
with
the
community
to
achieve
these
goals
n
the
united
states
department
of
justice
s
office
of
community
oriented
police
services
defines
community
policing
as
a
philosophy
that
promotes
organizational
strategies
which
support
the
systematic
use
of
partnerships
and
problem
solving
techniques
to
proactively
address
the
immediate
conditions
that
give
rise
to
public
safety
issues
such
as
crime
social
disorder
and
fear
of
crime
n
as
described
further
below
community
policing
shepherded
in
a
new
model
of
policing
that
valued
decentralization
deep
community
partnerships
a
problem
solving
approach
to
crime
and
crime
prevention
and
citizen
satisfaction
n
community
policing
rose
to
prominence
in
the
s
after
a
general
consensus
formed
that
police
community
relationships
were
severely
strained
and
that
there
was
a
need
for
a
different
paradigm
for
the
legitimacy
and
effectiveness
of
local
police
forces
n
the
traditional
model
of
the
warrior
police
officer
the
detached
aloof
crime
fighter
battling
the
enemy
that
is
the
public
was
one
that
had
sown
deep
resentment
in
many
communities
n
law
enforcement
organizations
thus
sought
to
change
their
image
and
partner
with
their
respective
communities
to
better
achieve
a
mutual
goal
a
safe
environment
within
which
to
work
and
live
n
at
the
same
time
new
research
emerged
that
called
into
question
the
efficacy
of
traditional
policing
theories
and
practices
studies
questioned
whether
some
of
the
tenets
of
policing
leading
up
to
the
s
were
effective
increasing
the
number
of
passive
patrols
in
a
neighborhood
random
and
saturation
patrols
and
an
emphasis
on
rapid
response
times
for
calls
n
finally
crimes
rates
were
also
on
the
rise
during
this
time
which
led
to
considerable
fear
in
many
neighborhoods
n
the
confluence
of
these
three
forces
the
rise
in
crime
poor
relationships
between
many
police
departments
and
their
communities
and
research
questioning
the
effectiveness
of
traditional
police
strategies
led
to
an
environment
where
a
paradigm
shift
to
community
policing
could
and
did
occur
community
policing
thus
ushered
in
an
approach
to
policing
that
deemphasized
the
us
against
them
and
warrior
police
officer
versus
the
enemy
view
and
focused
instead
on
collaboration
and
partnership
with
the
community
n
in
this
model
instead
of
patrolling
neighborhoods
in
cars
police
officers
walk
a
beat
within
a
neighborhood
so
that
they
are
visible
easily
accessible
to
the
community
and
better
able
to
develop
strong
ties
with
community
stakeholders
n
the
collaborative
emphasis
of
community
policing
provides
the
community
with
an
opportunity
to
provide
input
regarding
the
services
that
it
receives
and
the
types
of
problems
it
would
like
addressed
n
community
policing
thus
embraces
collaboration
with
various
community
stakeholders
neighborhood
groups
grass
roots
organizations
property
owners
businesses
other
government
officials
and
agencies
and
the
like
in
making
common
cause
the
community
can
define
its
social
norms
and
values
partnering
with
the
police
department
ensures
that
those
norms
are
inculcated
and
respected
in
the
community
and
enforced
by
the
police
n
this
approach
also
allows
the
police
and
those
they
serve
to
tailor
specific
solutions
to
the
problems
and
challenges
facing
their
particular
community
n
this
ability
for
the
community
to
help
inform
police
decision
making
comports
with
the
problem
oriented
approach
to
policing
that
this
model
encourages
indeed
community
policing
envisions
a
problem
oriented
approach
where
police
officers
collaborate
with
key
stakeholders
in
a
community
this
collaboration
identifies
disorders
and
then
devises
solutions
that
seek
to
solve
the
underlying
problems
n
as
discussed
in
part
vii
not
all
of
these
underlying
problems
are
necessarily
crime
related
consequently
community
policing
expects
that
the
police
department
will
engage
and
collaborate
with
other
governmental
and
social
services
agencies
to
help
address
these
problems
n
with
the
financial
constraints
affecting
local
governments
today
this
holistic
approach
to
addressing
disorder
and
its
underlying
problems
may
prove
of
even
greater
importance
in
maintaining
community
policing
and
attempting
to
stay
true
to
the
broken
windows
theory
that
underlies
it
iii
broken
windows
theory
the
broken
windows
theory
of
policing
provides
one
of
the
key
philosophical
foundations
for
community
policing
n
george
l
kelling
and
james
q
wilson
first
outlined
the
theory
in
their
seminal
article
n
in
the
article
the
authors
describe
a
newark
new
jersey
neighborhood
that
implemented
a
police
foot
patrol
after
many
years
of
having
only
vehicle
control
n
the
foot
patrol
officer
kept
order
in
the
neighborhood
by
encouraging
normatively
desirable
behavior
for
example
the
officer
would
not
allow
drunks
to
sleep
on
the
main
streets
rather
only
in
alleys
and
he
arrested
people
for
breaking
informal
rules
of
vagrancy
n
interestingly
while
the
neighborhood
did
not
in
fact
see
a
reduction
in
crime
after
the
implementation
of
the
foot
patrol
residents
nevertheless
felt
safe
and
perceived
that
crime
rates
had
dropped
n
this
story
served
as
the
conduit
for
kelling
and
wilson
to
develop
their
theory
linking
disorder
to
violent
crime
while
acknowledging
that
for
many
the
link
seems
tenuous
at
best
kelling
and
wilson
claim
that
at
the
community
level
disorder
and
crime
are
usually
inextricably
linked
in
a
kind
of
developmental
sequence
n
to
this
end
the
authors
theorize
that
if
small
infractions
such
as
vagrancy
public
drunkenness
and
panhandling
the
broken
windows
are
allowed
to
pervade
a
community
then
crime
in
the
area
will
further
proliferate
and
the
neighborhood
will
eventually
be
riddled
with
violent
crime
n
these
obvious
and
visible
signs
of
disorder
undermine
the
social
law
abiding
norms
in
a
community
n
the
disorder
signals
that
the
community
either
cannot
or
will
not
enforce
basic
social
norms
a
clear
indication
of
a
breakdown
of
community
control
n
if
a
community
is
unwilling
or
unable
to
enforce
social
norms
it
provides
a
reasonable
inference
to
both
criminals
and
law
abiding
citizens
that
the
community
similarly
will
not
or
cannot
prevent
more
serious
crimes
n
this
disorder
leads
criminals
to
commit
more
serious
crimes
in
greater
numbers
and
instills
fear
in
the
law
abiding
stakeholders
in
the
community
conversely
if
criminals
see
more
arrests
for
drunkenness
driving
violations
or
other
disruptions
of
order
they
will
believe
arrest
is
more
likely
and
thus
will
be
deterred
from
committing
crimes
n
indeed
as
professor
dan
m
kahan
points
out
i
ndividuals
are
much
more
likely
to
commit
crimes
when
they
perceive
that
criminal
activity
is
widespread
n
if
there
is
no
visible
communal
moral
rebuke
of
small
crimes
people
in
the
community
will
likely
engage
in
such
behavior
themselves
because
they
perceive
such
actions
to
be
acceptable
with
low
risks
and
potentially
high
payoffs
n
social
psychology
supports
the
broken
windows
theory
if
people
see
a
weakening
in
the
orderliness
of
a
system
they
begin
to
doubt
whether
they
can
do
anything
to
prevent
such
disorder
n
this
doubt
feeds
on
itself
causing
those
in
a
disorderly
neighborhood
to
be
less
likely
to
report
a
crime
because
they
think
the
police
will
not
respond
in
time
or
will
not
be
able
to
do
anything
about
the
situation
n
this
devolving
cycle
leads
to
more
crimes
as
those
before
them
go
unreported
and
unpunished
n
the
increase
in
crimes
is
also
accompanied
by
a
greater
seriousness
in
the
type
of
crimes
that
are
committed
in
this
regard
disorder
leads
to
citizen
fear
which
causes
citizens
to
physically
and
socially
withdraw
n
such
withdrawal
spurs
increased
predatory
behavior
and
rising
crime
rates
leading
to
a
spiral
of
decline
in
the
neighborhood
n
therefore
according
to
the
broken
windows
theory
a
community
must
address
disorder
early
on
so
as
to
prevent
the
spiral
of
decline
from
eventually
occurring
the
broken
windows
theory
thus
spurred
policing
responses
that
sought
to
crack
down
on
low
level
criminal
offenses
to
stop
their
proliferation
escalation
or
both
n
for
when
police
enforce
basic
social
norms
and
when
community
stakeholders
both
obey
and
embrace
such
norms
the
community
signals
to
criminals
and
law
abiding
citizens
alike
that
it
is
intolerant
of
criminal
behavior
n
this
positive
messaging
broken
windows
theorists
posit
helps
avoid
the
downward
spiral
that
communities
with
rampant
disorder
experience
accordingly
police
seeking
to
adopt
broken
windows
policing
strategies
target
both
social
and
physical
disorder
social
disorder
includes
loitering
vandalism
gangs
public
drinking
drug
dealing
prostitution
and
street
harassment
n
physical
disorder
encompasses
building
abandonment
graffiti
litter
on
the
streets
and
sidewalks
abandoned
cars
junk
and
garbage
in
vacant
lots
and
the
like
n
these
small
quality
of
life
crimes
contribute
to
a
sense
of
disorder
and
danger
on
the
street
n
many
communities
thus
adopted
order
maintenance
laws
such
as
panhandling
ordinances
anti
gang
statutes
anti
homeless
statutes
anti
loitering
statutes
and
vagrancy
statutes
to
target
these
forms
of
disorder
and
avoid
the
devolution
toward
crime
that
the
broken
windows
theory
describes
n
police
departments
even
used
civil
laws
like
nuisance
abatement
and
forfeiture
laws
to
address
and
prevent
these
quality
of
life
criminal
activities
n
this
approach
supports
the
social
influence
theory
s
focus
on
how
a
community
s
norms
and
behavior
affect
its
conduct
and
the
conduct
of
others
entering
the
community
n
therefore
by
adopting
order
maintenance
laws
communities
can
use
social
influence
to
discourage
criminality
n
however
this
social
influence
aspect
of
the
broken
windows
theory
is
oftentimes
misunderstood
in
community
policing
literature
as
professor
k
babe
howell
notes
o
rder
maintenance
policing
as
described
in
broken
windows
neither
demands
nor
suggests
that
zero
tolerance
arrest
policies
are
efficient
desirable
or
effective
methods
to
achieve
order
and
reduce
fear
n
in
fact
the
broken
windows
approach
to
community
policing
is
not
entirely
based
on
arrests
for
example
the
police
officer
in
the
broken
windows
article
did
not
arrest
people
but
rather
enforced
social
norms
by
breaking
up
arguments
and
asking
drunks
to
move
to
different
areas
n
indeed
under
this
approach
police
seek
to
employ
non
arrest
approaches
and
interventions
such
as
discussion
persuasion
negotiation
counseling
and
ordering
in
an
attempt
to
ameliorate
the
problem
without
making
an
arrest
n
nevertheless
despite
this
philosophical
and
practical
approach
to
non
arrest
interventions
the
broken
windows
theory
has
led
to
a
significant
number
of
arrests
for
relatively
minor
offenses
during
the
community
policing
era
n
iv
the
costs
of
community
policing
whether
police
attempt
arrest
or
non
arrest
solutions
the
broken
windows
approach
to
community
policing
requires
significant
expenditures
and
resources
by
local
governments
n
foot
patrols
while
beneficial
for
establishing
better
community
relationships
are
less
efficient
for
police
in
terms
of
patrolling
portions
of
the
city
in
this
regard
a
police
department
needs
more
police
officers
than
it
previously
did
to
maintain
such
a
visible
presence
in
the
community
with
the
shift
to
community
policing
police
officers
spend
more
time
attending
community
meetings
and
developing
personal
relationships
with
key
stakeholders
in
the
neighborhood
in
order
to
help
understand
the
community
s
challenges
and
devise
strategies
for
addressing
them
while
an
effective
use
of
the
police
officer
s
time
in
the
theoretical
construct
of
community
policing
such
efforts
are
time
intensive
and
require
more
dedicated
officers
from
a
police
force
than
previous
approaches
to
policing
did
moreover
the
broken
windows
approach
to
community
policing
inevitably
leads
to
arrests
for
the
various
low
level
criminal
offenses
that
lead
to
disorder
in
a
community
there
are
also
tremendous
hidden
costs
in
the
time
money
and
personnel
required
for
extra
arrests
and
the
costs
to
the
local
criminal
justice
system
in
processing
and
prosecuting
each
misdemeanor
n
the
police
department
the
district
attorney
s
or
city
attorney
s
offices
the
public
defenders
offices
and
the
local
court
system
all
spend
a
significant
amount
of
resources
to
process
these
minor
offenses
through
the
criminal
justice
system
n
for
example
many
police
departments
face
substantial
overtime
expenses
to
pay
for
police
officers
and
other
staff
to
process
the
increase
in
these
quality
of
life
criminal
arrests
n
there
are
also
other
externalized
costs
borne
by
the
city
and
taxpayers
more
broadly
when
an
arrest
and
criminal
record
leads
an
individual
down
the
all
too
common
spiral
of
multiple
subsequent
arrests
incarceration
and
unemployment
n
this
is
to
say
nothing
of
the
significant
costs
to
the
individual
arrested
for
these
low
level
quality
of
life
crimes
the
arrestee
loses
significant
time
money
and
opportunity
each
time
he
or
she
is
booked
for
a
misdemeanor
he
or
she
typically
misses
two
to
four
days
of
work
or
school
which
may
lead
to
a
loss
of
employment
and
the
arrestee
must
also
pay
the
processing
fees
for
being
arrested
n
the
criminal
record
that
such
an
arrestee
may
wind
up
with
can
prevent
that
person
from
getting
a
loan
for
a
car
a
house
or
schooling
thus
limiting
his
or
her
options
and
potentially
leading
that
person
back
to
committing
more
crimes
n
the
arrestee
and
possibly
his
or
her
family
could
be
kicked
out
of
public
housing
n
all
of
these
costs
on
the
individual
affect
the
community
as
well
while
the
broken
windows
approach
to
community
policing
may
decrease
fear
in
the
community
it
might
also
result
in
economic
ruin
for
the
arrestee
and
thus
create
an
even
more
desperate
criminal
n
these
costs
have
become
more
magnified
in
the
past
few
years
as
the
great
recession
has
taken
a
devastating
toll
on
the
economy
more
generally
and
local
government
budgets
more
specifically
v
local
government
funding
and
the
great
recession
a
sources
of
local
government
funding
local
governments
receive
funding
from
six
main
sources
taxes
federal
government
assistance
state
government
assistance
special
assessments
fees
and
fines
and
borrowing
n
while
local
governments
do
not
have
an
inherent
power
to
levy
taxes
states
grant
localities
the
power
to
tax
through
their
constitutions
statutes
and
local
home
rule
charter
provisions
n
however
the
local
government
power
to
tax
is
often
quite
limited
and
not
universally
enjoyed
in
every
state
n
the
most
common
and
universal
form
of
local
government
tax
is
the
property
tax
while
some
localities
are
also
able
to
garner
funds
through
taxes
related
to
sales
and
other
excise
taxes
local
income
use
and
licenses
n
due
to
these
limited
taxation
sources
of
revenue
local
governments
rely
on
the
other
aforementioned
sources
of
non
tax
revenues
to
help
meet
their
budgets
the
federal
government
has
historically
given
substantial
financial
aid
to
local
governments
through
block
grants
categorical
grants
aimed
at
funding
particular
programs
with
specific
requirements
and
conditions
attached
which
gave
local
governments
more
discretion
to
use
such
funds
for
a
variety
of
policy
areas
n
state
governments
also
provide
funding
to
local
governments
through
direct
revenue
sharing
education
budgets
and
grants
in
aid
for
specific
purposes
or
uses
n
special
assessments
allow
local
governments
to
raise
revenue
by
funding
a
community
improvement
such
as
infrastructure
projects
by
assessing
a
fee
to
those
property
owners
who
will
benefit
from
it
n
localities
also
charge
various
fees
and
fines
on
businesses
individuals
properties
and
other
entities
for
various
regulatory
licensing
permitting
and
user
purposes
n
finally
local
governments
also
obtain
money
needed
to
meet
their
yearly
budgetary
obligations
by
borrowing
money
and
issuing
bonds
to
repay
their
debt
n
b
the
effects
of
the
great
recession
on
public
safety
budgets
before
the
great
recession
began
in
these
funding
sources
for
local
governments
were
relatively
stable
and
predictable
however
with
the
financial
downturn
that
the
united
states
and
the
world
more
generally
has
experienced
in
the
past
several
years
localities
experienced
severe
reductions
from
virtually
all
of
their
revenue
sources
that
dramatically
impacted
their
budgets
the
federal
government
significantly
cut
its
funding
to
local
governments
in
its
attempt
to
balance
its
budget
and
rein
in
the
national
debt
n
many
state
governments
cut
their
funding
to
local
governments
in
a
variety
of
different
areas
to
help
make
up
budget
deficits
n
cities
also
saw
a
significant
drop
in
tax
revenues
as
housing
prices
dropped
foreclosures
proliferated
and
spending
and
thus
sales
taxes
dropped
significantly
while
unemployment
rose
and
fear
of
worse
financial
circumstances
lingered
n
in
addition
some
cities
bore
additional
unexpected
costs
localities
in
california
for
example
were
forced
by
state
law
to
house
prisoners
formerly
imprisoned
in
state
facilities
in
an
attempt
to
save
money
at
the
state
level
n
police
departments
and
public
safety
budgets
more
generally
were
not
immune
to
these
difficult
economic
times
for
local
governments
a
study
conducted
by
the
police
executive
forum
revealed
that
fifty
one
percent
of
police
departments
responding
to
the
survey
had
their
budgets
cut
since
the
great
recession
began
n
the
average
cut
to
police
department
budgets
was
seven
percent
n
fifty
nine
percent
of
those
respondents
also
anticipated
cuts
to
their
budgets
in
n
another
study
showed
that
eight
five
percent
of
responding
police
departments
had
their
budgets
cut
in
with
more
than
half
of
them
experiencing
a
five
percent
cut
and
nearly
a
quarter
of
them
having
a
cut
of
ten
percent
or
more
n
still
another
study
detailed
that
seventy
eight
percent
of
responding
major
city
police
departments
experienced
budget
cuts
by
an
average
of
n
as
nearly
any
newspaper
in
the
country
would
likely
report
police
departments
like
all
other
local
government
agencies
have
experienced
and
will
likely
continue
to
face
budget
cuts
during
this
economic
downturn
vi
local
government
responses
and
an
opportunity
born
a
traditional
approaches
cutting
costs
and
raising
revenue
the
challenging
economic
times
and
attendant
budget
cuts
have
forced
police
departments
to
make
difficult
decisions
to
balance
their
budgets
there
are
several
approaches
that
are
worth
analyzing
because
of
their
potential
impact
on
a
police
department
s
ability
to
continue
with
a
broken
windows
approach
to
community
policing
many
police
departments
have
laid
off
officers
and
made
other
reductions
in
their
workforces
some
police
departments
have
experimented
with
turning
to
private
security
firms
for
help
with
police
services
or
at
least
permitting
them
to
operate
in
certain
spheres
and
de
deputizing
certain
police
work
so
that
civilian
employees
can
perform
those
tasks
other
cities
and
suburbs
have
explored
combining
or
regionalizing
police
services
finally
many
cities
have
attempted
various
cost
saving
measures
and
looked
to
identify
new
nontraditional
revenue
sources
in
an
attempt
to
maintain
staffing
and
service
levels
reductions
in
police
department
workforces
to
address
budget
cuts
many
police
departments
have
laid
off
officers
made
other
personnel
cuts
or
left
various
jobs
unfilled
n
in
fact
the
united
states
department
of
justice
estimated
that
by
the
end
of
approximately
officers
would
have
been
laid
off
by
police
departments
and
nearly
law
enforcement
jobs
would
go
unfilled
n
some
examples
of
police
layoffs
are
breathtaking
the
city
of
camden
new
jersey
announced
in
january
that
it
was
cutting
nearly
half
of
its
police
force
n
the
city
of
flint
michigan
laid
off
of
its
police
officers
due
to
budget
cuts
n
the
city
of
paterson
new
jersey
eliminated
one
quarter
of
its
police
force
officers
to
help
combat
a
million
city
budget
deficit
n
the
effects
of
such
cuts
are
even
more
staggering
when
considering
the
significant
amount
of
crime
that
each
of
these
cities
experiences
such
a
reduction
in
police
officers
has
forced
police
departments
to
alter
and
reduce
some
of
their
traditional
services
and
practices
many
police
departments
are
prioritizing
emergency
calls
over
non
emergency
calls
n
others
are
making
similar
though
difficult
decisions
on
what
problems
to
focus
on
given
their
more
limited
resources
for
example
some
departments
are
no
longer
responding
to
motor
vehicle
thefts
n
the
city
of
detroit
michigan
recently
followed
the
lead
of
other
big
cities
in
no
longer
responding
to
burglar
alarms
unless
the
alarm
company
has
verified
that
there
is
a
valid
alarm
n
in
a
response
to
a
reduction
of
sworn
police
officers
the
city
of
san
jose
california
adopted
a
modified
response
policy
that
reduces
the
number
of
police
responses
to
non
emergency
situations
n
to
this
end
the
san
jose
police
department
sjpd
no
longer
responds
to
noise
complaints
recycling
thefts
traffic
accidents
in
which
no
one
is
injured
fruit
vending
without
valid
permits
and
illegal
parking
n
the
sjpd
also
followed
a
national
trend
of
severely
reducing
if
not
eliminating
its
horse
mounted
police
force
n
other
police
departments
reduced
their
investigation
follow
ups
with
property
computer
and
financial
crimes
non
felony
domestic
assaults
narcotics
and
other
such
crimes
n
some
localities
are
reducing
or
eliminating
police
services
for
community
events
such
as
parades
funerals
and
high
school
football
games
n
finally
cutbacks
have
forced
some
police
departments
to
require
residents
to
file
their
own
reports
online
or
in
writing
for
lower
level
crimes
such
as
break
ins
n
with
the
reductions
in
police
personnel
that
many
cities
are
experiencing
some
police
departments
have
no
choice
but
to
make
such
difficult
decisions
partnering
with
private
security
firms
and
civilianizing
police
work
cities
and
their
police
departments
have
also
tried
to
cut
costs
by
working
with
private
security
firms
or
at
least
allowing
them
to
function
in
certain
capacities
and
locations
n
the
use
of
private
security
guards
in
specific
areas
of
a
city
in
downtown
or
particular
tourist
locations
was
not
uncommon
before
the
great
recession
n
however
the
recent
budget
cuts
have
led
some
police
departments
to
collaborate
with
or
even
hire
private
security
firms
to
help
them
with
providing
police
services
for
example
the
minneapolis
police
department
mpd
collaborates
with
private
security
officers
in
the
downtown
business
district
to
help
reduce
crime
through
enhanced
communication
wireless
cameras
placed
in
strategic
locations
and
mpd
training
of
these
private
security
officers
n
cities
such
as
las
vegas
nevada
wilmington
delaware
new
york
city
new
york
and
durham
north
carolina
have
all
collaborated
with
private
security
firms
to
reduce
their
costs
while
maintaining
their
effectiveness
n
some
cities
have
even
sought
to
go
further
than
such
collaborations
the
city
council
in
oakland
california
had
originally
voted
to
hire
private
armed
security
guards
to
patrol
high
crime
areas
of
the
city
but
the
contract
was
later
rescinded
when
the
company
with
whom
it
contracted
international

n
with
the
significant
cost
savings
in
private
security
officers
compared
to
sworn
public
police
officers
it
is
no
wonder
that
many
cities
are
exploring
how
they
might
use
or
partner
with
private
security
firms
other
police
departments
have
increased
the
duties
of
civilian
workers
by
assigning
them
tasks
that
deputized
police
officers
have
traditionally
performed
by
shifting
such
clerical
and
non
law
enforcement
activities
to
civilians
police
departments
can
deploy
their
sworn
officers
into
the
field
to
deal
with
more
pressing
crime
needs
n
some
cities
have
explored
responsibilities
for
civilians
beyond
the
traditional
clerical
activities
for
example
the
city
of
mesa
arizona
created
a
civilian
investigation
unit
in
to
respond
to
low
level
crimes
and
conduct
investigations
n
these
civilian
investigators
take
initial
reports
and
collect
dna
and
fingerprints
at
the
crime
scene
but
they
are
not
armed
and
do
not
have
the
authority
to
make
an
arrest
n
the
city
of
chicago
illinois
has
similarly
sought
to
cut
costs
by
civilianizing
traditional
police
work
hiring
civilian
detention
aides
at
city
jails
and
transferring
the
police
officers
stationed
there
to
beat
patrols
n
such
civilianization
has
helped
many
cities
save
money
in
an
era
of
dwindling
budgets
n
combining
or
regionalizing
police
service
some
cities
and
suburbs
have
explored
the
idea
of
combining
or
regionalizing
police
service
modeled
after
regional
police
service
approaches
in
san
francisco
california
denver
colorado
las
vegas
nevada
and
san
antonio
texas
many
communities
have
sought
to
either
merge
city
police
departments
and
county
sheriff
departments
or
merge
small
suburban
police
forces
into
a
regional
police
force
n
in
one
survey
twenty
six
percent
of
responding
police
departments
reported
that
their
county
partnered
with
a
neighboring
county
to
consolidate
police
service
while
another
thirty
one
percent
of
respondents
have
had
discussions
with
other
localities
regarding
such
consolidation
n
other
cities
have
even
disbanded
their
police
departments
and
contracted
with
their
local
sheriff
s
department
for
police
services
n
while
such
proposals
to
combine
or
regionalize
police
services
are
often
met
with
resistance
and
controversy
because
of
concerns
about
centralizing
a
government
service
as
community
tailored
as
policing
and
crime
prevention
consolidation
regionalization
or
even
outsourcing
policing
services
to
the
local
sheriff
s
department
may
be
the
most
cost
effective
way
for
some
communities
to
deal
with
the
current
economic
times
cost
cutting
measures
and
new
revenue
sources
some
cities
are
attempting
to
counter
budget
reductions
through
various
cost
saving
measures
for
example
chicago
is
seeking
to
curtail
the
police
department
s
current
sick
leave
policy
and
to
close
underutilized
police
stations
n
many
police
departments
have
been
forced
to
cut
back
or
eliminate
plans
to
acquire
technology
to
aid
in
their
work
n
other
local
governments
have
sought
to
reduce
expenses
at
their
jails
given
that
medical
costs
are
the
largest
service
costs
for
most
local
government
jails
it
is
unsurprising
that
cities
have
sought
to
save
money
on
these
expenses
n
some
counties
have
begun
treating
patients
inside
of
the
jails
instead
of
transferring
them
to
external
facilities
switching
from
name
brand
medications
to
generic
ones
and
creating
better
monitoring
of
inmate
medication
distribution
and
use
to
decrease
the
amount
of
unused
medicine
n
other
local
governments
have
privatized
the
medical
services
that
they
provide
in
their
jails
in
an
attempt
to
save
money
n
some
counties
have
sought
to
reduce
the
cost
of
feeding
their
inmates
for
example
fourteen
counties
in
new
york
are
saving
money
by
purchasing
cook
chill
food
products
that
allow
a
mere
reheating
of
the
food
to
be
served
to
inmates
n
the
switch
to
this
type
of
food
preparation
model
is
estimated
to
save
these
counties
an
average
of
per
inmate
per
year
n
sauk
county
wisconsin
no
longer
provides
warm
breakfast
for
inmates
and
instead
serves
only
cold
cereal
saving
approximately
per
year
n
polk
county
florida
eliminated
peanut
butter
and
jelly
sandwiches
cornbread
coffee
and
juice
from
its
jail
menu
to
save
money
n
the
sandusky
county
jail
in
ohio
grows
produce
in
a
garden
to
use
for
meals
in
the
jail
an
effort
that
has
saved
in
food
costs
n
some
counties
have
also
pursued
privatization
of
their
food
services
which
will
save
one
county
at
least
per
year
n
local
governments
have
also
attempted
a
hodgepodge
of
other
cost
cutting
measures
to
address
the
financial
strains
their
budgets
face
to
save
on
electricity
costs
hays
county
jail
in
texas
moved
lights
out
from
a
m
to
p
m
n
the
barrow
county
detention
center
in
georgia
mandated
that
all
incoming
and
outgoing
mail
be
in
the
form
of
postcards
to
reduce
the
time
spent
on
opening
and
inspecting
mail
n
some
localities
have
used
inmates
for
general
labor
such
as
mowing
lawns
shoveling
snow
picking
up
litter
weeding
maintaining
parks
and
caring
for
buildings
which
enables
them
to
cut
the
costs
of
these
services
from
their
respective
budgets
n
finally
some
localities
are
considering
consolidating
jails
and
jail
services
in
order
to
save
money
n
these
are
just
some
examples
of
the
lengths
that
local
governments
are
going
to
in
order
to
cut
costs
given
the
current
budget
cuts
to
public
safety
spending
cities
are
also
looking
to
nontraditional
revenue
sources
in
an
attempt
to
maintain
current
staffing
and
service
levels
for
example
chicago
proposes
raising
million
in
new
revenue
through
the
reallocation
of
tax
increment
financing
tif
funds
in
order
to
hire
new
police
officers
n
many
localities
have
used
fundraising
and
community
philanthropic
efforts
to
raise
additional
revenue
n
several
counties
in
michigan
wood
county
in
wisconsin
and
riverside
county
in
california
have
all
started
billing
inmates
for
their
stay
in
jail
n
polk
county
florida
now
charges
male
inmates
for
underwear
a
move
that
has
an
estimated
savings
of
per
year
n
riverside
county
california
also
plans
on
charging
inmates
for
using
public
defenders
n
b
creative
alternatives
to
traditional
incarceration
other
local
governments
are
using
the
current
budget
crises
to
rethink
their
traditional
approaches
to
policing
including
the
broken
windows
approach
to
community
policing
which
have
focused
heavily
on
incarceration
indeed
the
financial
realities
of
an
incarceration
dominant
approach
to
policing
pose
an
expensive
challenge
for
most
local
governments
to
illustrate
the
point
a
city
or
county
often
spends
or
more
per
day
to
house
a
criminal
or
someone
accused
of
a
crime
a
daunting
figure
given
the
increase
in
the
number
of
incarcerated
individuals
in
most
jails
n
it
is
no
wonder
then
that
many
localities
are
rethinking
an
incarceration
dominated
approach
to
community
policing
but
to
simply
look
at
the
creative
alternatives
described
below
as
solely
money
based
would
be
to
oversimplify
these
cities
and
counties
motivations
as
this
sub
section
and
the
milwaukee
county
experience
detailed
below
demonstrate
those
in
the
criminal
justice
system
in
many
localities
are
seeking
to
approach
the
problems
of
crime
and
disorder
in
a
smarter
and
arguably
more
effective
manner
than
the
traditional
tough
on
crime
ethos
that
has
pervaded
the
criminal
justice
system
and
political
discourse
more
generally
for
decades
while
the
costs
of
the
current
system
may
be
a
significant
motivating
factor
for
why
these
communities
are
rethinking
their
approach
to
the
criminal
justice
system
the
communities
impetus
also
stems
from
a
desire
to
better
achieve
their
goals
for
a
safe
community
and
to
help
those
who
may
need
social
service
support
to
avoid
recidivism
and
problems
in
the
future
many
localities
are
using
house
arrest
for
pretrial
detainees
for
parolees
and
even
as
a
criminal
sentence
n
local
governments
design
these
programs
to
enable
those
who
commit
or
are
accused
of
committing
certain
low
level
nonviolent
crimes
to
serve
their
sentences
at
home
monitored
by
an
electronic
ankle
bracelet
n
one
obvious
benefit
for
these
localities
comes
in
the
form
of
cost
savings
such
as
not
having
to
pay
for
an
inmate
s
health
care
food
and
other
related
expenses
in
this
regard
the
results
have
been
promising
thus
far
scottsdale
arizona
for
example
saved
in
the
first
five
weeks
of
its
electronic
monitoring
program
for
drunk
driving
cases
and
cook
county
illinois
cut
its
cost
per
detainee
from
per
day
to
with
electronic
monitoring
n
however
such
programs
also
seek
to
avoid
substantially
disrupting
the
lives
of
those
accused
of
crimes
or
those
who
have
committed
low
level
crimes
in
doing
so
these
programs
aim
to
help
these
people
avoid
a
downward
spiral
of
more
frequent
and
more
serious
criminal
acts
because
they
have
lost
their
jobs
and
support
systems
for
example
house
arrest
and
electronic
monitoring
programs
aim
to
allow
these
low
risk
criminals
to
hold
or
continue
to
hold
jobs
and
enjoy
the
help
and
support
of
their
families
factors
that
can
help
these
criminals
avoid
recidivism
n
for
example
dallas
county
texas
saved
in
the
first
year
of
its
house
arrest
program
and
it
also
saw
out
of
the
offenders
successfully
complete
the
program
n
through
such
programs
local
governments
seek
to
help
ensure
that
those
accused
or
convicted
of
minor
crimes
who
are
not
serious
threats
to
the
community
can
maintain
some
semblance
of
their
normal
lives
and
thus
avoid
the
significant
costs
and
disruptions
that
often
come
with
being
arrested
or
convicted
of
such
low
level
crimes
localities
are
also
adopting
or
expanding
alternatives
to
traditional
incarceration
such
as
work
release
and
halfway
houses
work
release
programs
allow
nonviolent
misdemeanor
and
low
level
felony
offenders
to
maintain
jobs
in
the
community
while
serving
their
ordered
jail
sentence
n
in
order
to
be
eligible
for
and
complete
a
work
release
program
the
convicted
criminal
must
obtain
a
written
order
from
a
judge
comport
with
the
rules
of
the
program
and
maintain
a
job
n
some
counties
have
used
weekend
incarceration
and
work
release
in
conjunction
with
electronic
monitoring
to
enable
inmates
to
work
at
county
facilities
such
as
the
zoo
or
veterans
cemetery
and
also
allow
them
to
sleep
at
home
after
work
n
other
counties
have
linked
work
release
with
halfway
homes
a
scenario
where
inmates
sleep
at
the
halfway
house
at
night
but
leave
during
the
day
for
their
court
approved
work
n
finally
some
counties
have
established
day
reporting
centers
for
nonviolent
offenders
usually
alcohol
and
drug
abusers
who
cannot
make
bail
n
under
a
traditional
system
these
offenders
would
spend
weeks
in
jail
waiting
for
court
hearings
for
failure
to
post
bail
under
the
day
reporting
center
programs
these
offenders
report
daily
to
the
center
and
are
subject
to
random
drug
tests
n
in
addition
these
offenders
receive
vocational
training
and
if
they
complete
the
program
successfully
they
can
avoid
jail
altogether
and
hopefully
avoid
recidivism
in
the
future
n
counties
have
similarly
adopted
specialty
courts
to
complement
such
diversion
programs
in
an
attempt
to
help
offenders
with
their
underlying
problems
through
social
service
programs
and
to
avoid
recidivism
many
counties
set
up
these
courts
to
help
channel
those
whose
criminal
acts
stem
from
drug
addiction
or
mental
health
issues
into
treatment
programs
that
will
help
them
deal
with
their
underlying
problem
these
programs
serve
as
alternatives
to
simply
incarcerating
these
individuals
and
then
in
all
likelihood
releasing
them
to
commit
the
same
types
of
crimes
because
their
underlying
disorder
was
not
addressed
while
in
jail
n
for
example
the
city
of
greenwood
minnesota
uses
a
program
in
which
substance
abusers
enter
a
recovery
court
program
where
the
abuser
lives
at
home
but
cannot
use
drugs
or
alcohol
and
cannot
live
with
anyone
who
uses
drugs
n
recovery
court
supervisors
randomly
show
up
at
the
participant
s
house
to
check
for
alcohol
or
drug
use
and
ensure
compliance
with
the
program
s
requirements
n
the
program
also
forbids
participants
from
going
to
locations
where
drugs
or
alcohol
are
used
n
if
participants
break
these
rules
they
become
subjected
to
more
restrictive
rules
and
may
ultimately
be
sent
to
jail
n
as
this
example
demonstrates
the
purpose
of
such
specialty
courts
is
to
reduce
recidivism
by
helping
treat
the
criminal
offender
s
underlying
problem
while
at
the
same
time
saving
money
by
keeping
them
out
of
jail
initially
n
as
described
further
below
some
local
governments
are
moving
to
evidence
based
practices
to
make
smarter
decisions
as
to
how
to
police
their
communities
and
how
to
administer
their
criminal
justice
system
for
example
napa
county
california
designed
a
matrix
program
that
rates
prisoners
on
certain
factors
to
determine
who
is
too
dangerous
to
release
before
their
sentences
end
and
who
is
truly
nonviolent
and
could
be
eligible
for
diversion
or
early
release
programs
n
graduates
of
the
napa
county
matrix
program
have
a
employment
rate
and
only
a
recidivism
rate
compared
to
the
statewide
recidivism
rate
of
approximately
n
the
napa
county
model
has
been
so
successful
that
the
american
civil
liberties
union
has
called
upon
other
california
counties
to
develop
evidence
based
solutions
for
alternatives
to
incarceration
and
reentry
instead
of
adding
jail
beds
n
finally
many
local
governments
have
shifted
their
operational
models
to
include
enhanced
technology
that
allows
police
departments
to
improve
their
outcomes
and
increase
efficiency
n
some
police
departments
have
begun
to
use
certain
public
surveillance
systems
such
as
closed
circuit
televisions
and
light
based
intervention
systems
that
can
act
as
force
multipliers
through
incident
intervention
and
crime
prevention
without
requiring
the
immediate
presence
of
an
officer
n
other
police
departments
are
using
geographical
technology
such
as
the
tactical
automatic
vehicle
locator
which
reduces
response
times
by
providing
the
locations
of
patrol
cars
and
allowing
commanders
to
dispatch
the
closest
patrol
car
with
far
greater
precision
and
efficiency
n
other
police
departments
have
taken
greater
leaps
of
faith
with
technology
due
to
severe
budget
cuts
for
example
the
santa
cruz
police
department
scpd
has
lost
twenty
percent
of
its
force
since
due
to
budget
cuts
n
to
help
meet
the
needs
of
its
community
the
scpd
started
experimenting
with
a
predictive
policing
model
n
based
on
technology
that
helps
predict
aftershocks
of
earthquakes
this
predictive
policing
model
uses
crime
data
to
identify
specific
areas
and
even
specific
times
in
which
crime
is
most
likely
to
occur
n
this
model
enables
the
scpd
to
send
patrols
to
certain
hotspots
each
day
which
it
believes
serves
as
a
deterrent
and
allows
for
better
responsiveness
and
thus
likelihood
of
arrest
when
a
crime
occurs
n
based
on
the
perceived
success
of
the
scpd
s
predictive
policing
model
other
cities
such
as
los
angeles
are
hoping
to
develop
similar
models
including
ones
that
model
both
property
crimes
and
violent
crimes
n
in
an
era
of
budget
cuts
and
reduced
staffing
such
technological
advances
and
other
evidence
based
strategies
may
help
evolve
community
policing
from
its
historical
model
to
an
approach
similar
in
theory
but
different
in
execution
vii
evidence

milwaukee
county
a
evidence
based
decision
making
with
the
changes
and
challenges
that
they
have
faced
during
the
past
several
years
some
localities
have
concluded
that
they
must
change
their
approach
to
community
policing
to
continue
to
be
effective
in
the
future
the
economic
realities
of
the
great
recession
coalesced
with
a
national
sentencing
reform
movement
led
by
the
national
center
for
state
courts
ncsc
entitled
getting
smarter
about
sentencing
n
two
of
the
key
objectives
to
this
movement
were
to
reduce
reliance
on
long
term
incarceration
as
a
criminal
sanction
for
those
not
posing
a
substantial
danger
to
the
community
or
committing
the
most
serious
offenders
and
to
promote
the
development
funding
and
utilization
of
community
based
alternatives
to
incarceration
for
appropriate
offenses
n
at
the
same
time
the
national
institute
of
corrections
nic
launched
its
evidence
based
decision
making
in
local
criminal
justice
systems
initiative
n
the
nic
s
initiative
was
driven
by
the
belief
that
research
could
better
inform
decision
making
in
the
criminal
justice
system
and
that
it
would
lead
to
better
outcomes
for
public
safety
and
the
community
more
generally
n
in
this
regard
the
confluence
of
these
events
helped
bring
greater
clarity
to
the
problems
challenges
and
needs
of
many
communities
and
their
criminal
justice
systems
the
goals
were
also
similar
and
clear
keeping
communities
safe
reducing
recidivism
being
mindful
of
the
costs
of
an
incarceration
first
approach
to

n
in
short
how
can
communities
be
smarter
about
running
their
criminal

systems
given
the
changes
and
movements
in
the
criminal
justice
system
evidenced

decision
making
began
to
gain
traction
in
some
localities
n
evidence
based
decision
making
in
policing
and
in
the
criminal
justice
system
is
modeled
on
the
concept
of
evidence
based
medicine
that
has
been
popular
in
the
health
care
field
and
human
services
fields
more
broadly
n
evidence
based
decision
making
seeks
to
apply
the
best
available
evidence
from
empirically
sound
social
science
research
to
decision
making
in
policing
and
the
criminal
justice
system
more
generally
n
through
experimentation
data
collection
and
qualitative
and
quantitative
analysis
evidence
based
decision
making
seeks
to
identify
the
exact

propose
possible
solutions
that
will
address
the
problem
and
analyze
and
weigh
the
costs
and
impacts
of
the
different
solutions
before
implementation
n
in
this
regard
evidence
based
decision
making
seeks
to
use
data
and
research
of
historical
outcomes
of
previous
cases
and
decisions
such
as
releasing
an
offender
on
bail
and
on
what
terms
and
then
using
this
information
and
those
outcomes
to
improve
decision
making
in

cases
in
the
future
n
by
using
empirical
findings
to
drive
better
informed
policies
and
practices
in
the
criminal
justice
system
localities
can
use
evidence
based
decision
making
in
all
aspects
of
public
safety
from
policing
to
arrest
to
final
disposition
and
discharge
to
alter
and
in
some
cases
retool
long
held
approaches
that
are
no
longer
economically
sustainable
nor
perhaps
normatively
desirable
n
in
order
to
thoroughly
inculcate
evidence
based
decision
making
in
this
manner
local
governments
must
foster
meaningful
collaboration
between
the
partners
in
the
criminal
justice
system
and
those
entities
providing
various
social
services
to
the
community

there
are

that
may
have
important

by
their

and
community

such
as
civic
leaders
faith

and
the
like
n
given
these
various
and
interconnected
decision
points
and
the
significant
number
of
decision
makers
and
stakeholder
groups
a
locality
s
emphasis
on
collaboration
is
critical
to
achieving
the
effectiveness
and
efficiency
sought
by
evidence
based
decision
making
such
collaboration
may
involve
the
police
working
with
prosecutors
and
other
law
enforcement
professionals
to
solve
a
problem
oftentimes
a
solution
along
the
lines
of
a
traditional
enforcement
strategy
such
as
arresting
an
individual
and
prosecuting
a
crime
n
however
under
the
evidence
based
decision
making
approach
law
enforcement
will
also
look
to
other
governmental
agencies
for
assistance
in
solving
various
problems
for
example
a
community
prosecutor
might
work
with
a
city
s
building
department
to
identify
code
violations
when
targeting
a
drug
house
n
however
under
this
model
interagency
collaboration
also
seeks
to
be
proactive
to
solve
a
community
s
problems
before
they
occur
or
in
a
manner
that
addresses
the
underlying
cause
of
the
externalized
problems
so
that
they
dissipate
over
time
for
example
having
identified
that
almost
half
of
the
violent
crime
victims
in
the
city
are
teenagers
chicago
has
sought
to
expand
after
school
and
summer
programs
to
engage
at
risk
youth
in
positive
activities
n
moreover
as
discussed
above
the
alternatives
to
incarceration
for
those
offenders
who
are
mentally
ill
or
suffer
from
drug
or
alcohol
addiction
also
provide
examples
of
such
collaboration
between
those
in
the
criminal
justice
system
and
social
service
providers
finally
and
perhaps
most
relevant
from
a
macro
level
perspective
these
various
stakeholders
and
decision
makers
must
collaborate
to
determine
how
the
research
they
have
compiled
and
analyzed
guides
their
decision
making
at
the
various
decision
points
in
the
criminal
justice
system
to
further
their
goals
set
their
priorities
and
allocate
their
resources
such
collaboration
can
lead
to
many
of
the
types
of
alternatives
to
incarceration
described
above
that
localities
have
implemented
there
is
no
doubt
that
part
of
what
drives
this
evidence
based
decision
making
approach
is
the
recognition
that
with
declining
revenues
and
budget
cuts
police
departments
and
criminal
justice
systems
must
stretch
their
resources
to
do
more
with
less
n
in
doing
so
evidence
based
decision
making
strives
to
improve
the
outcomes
and
the
efficiency
and
effectiveness
of
the
criminal
justice
system
while
also
saving
money
in
this
regard
evidence
based
decision
making
may
help
local
governments
remain
consistent
with
the
broken
windows
theory
of
community
policing
while
addressing
the
problems
presented
by
the
great
recession
n
b
questions
concerns
criticisms
and
challenges
to
be
sure
with
evidence
based
decision
making
still
in
its
infancy
in
policing
and
in
the
criminal
justice
system
there
are
still
many
questions
concerns
and
challenges
that
must
be
answered
and
resolved
n
for
example
politics
still
plays
and
will
likely
continue
to
play
a
critical
role
in
policing
and
the
criminal
justice
system
as
politicians
do
not
want
to
be
labeled
soft
on
crime
political
decision
making
on
public
safety
matters
does
not
always
comport
with
decisions
based
on
social
science
research
indeed
political
decisions
regarding
public
safety
matters
can
be
spurred
by
irrational
public
moral
panics
that
is
a
horrible
crime
that
leads
to
an
emotional
wave
of
public
repugnance
and
a
demand
for
quick
political
action
n
such
reactive
political
decision
making
may
not
always
be
grounded
in
social
science
research
but
rather
a
popular
political
fix
that
assures
the
community
that
its
public
officials
are
doing
what
constituents
think
is
best
whether
or
not
the
data
and
research
support
that
reaction
another
challenge
for
the
adoption
of
evidence
based
decision
making
either
from
a
normative
and
or
logistical
standpoint
is
that
there
are
such
divergent
visions
and
philosophies
for
the
optimal
approach
to
public
safety
and
the
criminal
justice
system
n
this
reality
is
exacerbated
by
the
fact
that
there
is
a
power
imbalance
among
the
various
agencies
and
stakeholders
in
the
criminal
justice
system
which
makes
the
collaboration
described
above
even
more
challenging
n
to
add
to
this
difficulty
there
is
systemic
fragmentation
in
the
way
that
various
states
and
local
governments
choose
to
structure
and
run
their
respective
criminal
justice
systems
n
this
lack
of
uniformity
creates
a
logistical
impediment
to
the
emergence
of
a
broad
evidence
based
decision
making
movement
as
one
model
cannot
be
so
easily
replicated
in
most
if
not
every
jurisdiction
n
finally
evidence
is
not
always
clear
and
can
even
be
contradictory
at
times
so
there
is
still
a
need
for
good
old
fashioned
judgment
in
making
decisions
involving
policies
programs
resources
and
the
like
in
policing
and
the
criminal
justice
system
judgment
that
will
no
doubt
draw
criticism
from
those
who
do
not
favor
the
decisions
made
moreover
in
the
criminal
justice
field
there
has
not
been
a
deeply
embedded
research
and
knowledge
based
culture
which
may
lead
to
great
resistance
in
adopting
evidence
based
decision
making
n
even
if
desired
such
a
cultural
shift
may
prove
even
more
difficult
because
the
leadership
in
many
criminal
justice
organizations
do
not
have
the
training
necessary
to
effect
organizational
change
n
nevertheless
despite
these
criticisms
questions
and
challenges
for
the
reasons
detailed
above
several
localities
have
moved
to
adopt
evidence
based
decision
making
in
their
police
departments
and
criminal
justice
systems
more
generally
as
part
of
an
evolution
of
their
approach

community
policing

milwaukee
county

in
evidence

making
milwaukee
county
in
wisconsin
milwaukee
is
one
of
three
local
governments
from
around
the
country
that
won
a
grant
competition
sponsored
by
the
u
s
department
of
justice
s
national
institute
of
corrections
nic
to
encourage
and
help
fund
the
adoption
of
more
evidence
based
decision
making
in
the
local
criminal
justice
system
n
through
the
milwaukee
county
community
justice
council
mccjc
a
collaboration
and
partnership
between
the
various
partners
in
the
criminal
justice
system
milwaukee
has
sought
to
adopt
and
implement
evidence
based
decision
making
over
the
past
few
years
n
the
mccjc
s
guiding
principle
in
this
endeavor
has
been
the
following
i
n
assessing
an
offender
s
risk
of
reoffense
and
criminogenic
needs
and
in
matching
offenders
with
the
appropriate
supervision
treatment
and
jail
resources
systems
like
ours
should
employ
instruments
built
on
actuarial
data
as
opposed
to
professional
judgment
alone
n
indeed
by
using
data
and
research
described
further
below
milwaukee
believes
it
can
reduce
the
number
of
people
being
held
in
jails
or
prisons
save
significant
amounts
of
money
and
maintain
or
even
improve
the
level
of
public
safety
to
which
the
community
is
accustomed
n
moreover
consistent
with
one
of
the
key
tenets
of
evidence
based
decision
making
the
mccjc
brings
together
a
vast
array
of
partners
and
stakeholders
in
the
milwaukee
criminal
justice
system
the
chief

of
the
milwaukee

n
while
the
collaborative
group
s
members
have
not
agreed
on
all
matters
at
all
times
they
are
united
in
advancing
a
meaningful
and
ambitious
evidence
based
decision
making
approach
to
the
criminal
justice
system
n
with
the
nic
grant
milwaukee
seeks
to
dramatically
expand
its
evidence
based
decision
making
particularly
in
four
key
areas
first
based
on
promising
results
from
pilot
projects
in
previous
years
the
milwaukee
police
department
will
train
more
of
its
field
officers
booking
officers
and
dispatchers
as
to
how
to
respond
effectively
to
those
who
are
mentally
ill
and
to
improve
communication
with
others
in
the
criminal
justice
system
those
in
jails
prosecutors
defense
attorneys
and
court
officials
regarding
the
challenges
that
these
individuals
will
face
as
they
progress
through
the
system
n
the
mccjc
will
also
be
able
to
identify
those
chronic
offenders
with
mental
illness
who
account
for
the
majority
of
police
service
calls
and
help
them
seek
treatment
for
their
underlying
condition
to
avoid
future
problems
n
to
gauge
its
success
in
this
effort
the
mccjc
has
set
a
goal
that
by
the
end
of
it
will
have
reduced
by
those
suffering
from
a
mental
illness
who
lose
their
benefits
or
housing
for
being
jailed
and
increase
by
those
who
have
a
mental
illness
who
reconnect
with
services
they
need
within
twenty
days
of
arrest
n
second
the
mccjc
intends
to
use
and
enhance
the
information
it
has
to
help
identify
cases
that
will
likely
be
successful
in
a
diversion
program
or
in
a
deferred
prosecution
scenario
n
the
mccjc
will
use
assessment
tools
to
gauge
the
risks
and
needs
of
offenders
and
negotiate
the
diversion
or
deferred
prosecution
agreement
accordingly
n
in
addition
it
will
create
an
evidence
based
matrix
that
delineates
incentives
and
sanctions
to
ensure
compliance
with
this
approach
n
to
evaluate
the
efficacy
of
this
program
the
mccjc
has
set
a
three
fold
goal
by
the
end
of
increasing
by
the
number
of
pretrial
detainees
safely
released
and
or
supervised
in
the
community
as
opposed
to
jail
saving
million
in
the
process
and
reducing
by
a
minimum
of
the
number
of
defendants
who
fail
to
follow
pretrial
rules
n
third
the
mccjc
seeks
to
aggressively
change
its
risk
needs
management
of
its
pretrial
population
currently
milwaukee
s
bail
hearings
are
done
in
an
ad
hoc
fashion
where
decisions
are
made
largely
on
the
basis
of
the
current
charge
the
defendant
s
criminal
history
and
the
judge
s
intuition
and
professional
judgment
n
the
mccjc
has
studied
other
jurisdictions
approaches
to
pretrial
decisions
and
has
developed
a
new
protocol
for
conducting
a
risk
assessment
for
each
individual
as
he
or
she
enters
the
criminal
justice
system
n
based
on
the
data
and
evidence
from
other
jurisdictions
this
protocol
will
award
points
to
a
person
based
on
factors
such
as
the
number
of
previous
criminal
cases
in
which
the
person
was
involved
the
person
s
record
for
appearing
in
court
in
those
cases
and
whether
he
or
she
is
employed
or
is
a
primary
caregiver
n
depending
on
the
number
of
points
the
person
gets
he
or
she
will
fall
into
one
of
four
categories
that
represents
the
risk
level
associated
with
that
person
under
the
protocol
n
this
categorization
will
then
be
considered
against
the
nature
of
the
crime
the
person
allegedly
committed
n
judges
will
be
equipped
with
a
grid
that
helps
them
determine
whether
and
at
what
amount
to
set
bail
and
what
conditions
if
any
should
be
placed
on
a
defendant
s
release
n
the
mccjc
envisions
this
type
of
informed
evidence
based
decision
making
will
ensure
maximization
of
the
various
pretrial
supervision
and
detention
options
n
in
order
to
gauge
whether
it
has
been
successful
with
this
program
the
mccjc
has
set
a
goal
of
increasing
by
ten
percent
the
number
of
successful
diversions
or
deferred
prosecutions
and
saving
a
minimum
of
in
doing
so
by
the
end
of
n
finally
the
mcjcc
wants
to
adopt
a
dosage
based
probation
plan
n
based
on
research
demonstrating
that
probation
services
are
unnecessary
after
a
certain
period
of
time
milwaukee
seeks
to
begin
a
pilot
program
that
provides
early
termination
of
probation
for
probationers
who
accomplish
certain
risk
reducing
objectives
n
the
mccjc
will
do
so
by
creating
a
program
based
on
evidence
from
this
research
developing
a
profile
of
the
type
of
probationer
that
might
be
successful
in
such
a
program
tracking
the
group
and
comparing
it
to
other
probationers
to
test
the
efficacy
of
the
program
n
probation
then
would
be
terminated
early
once
the
offender
received
sufficient
treatment
as
defined
by
this
program
to
measure
its
success
with
this
plan
the
mccjc
has
set
a
goal
to
be
able
to
prove
by
the
end
of
that
milwaukee
can
cut
probation
costs
and
reduce
recidivism
by
a
minimum
of
fifty
percent
n
in
these
regards
milwaukee
seeks
to
not
just
be
tough
on
crime
but
also
be
smart
on
crime
n
for
example
twenty
six
percemt
of
those
in
milwaukee
county
jails
awaiting
trial
have
bail
set
at
or
less
but
they
cannot
afford
to
pay
it
to
be
released
n
however
it
costs
milwaukee
per
person
per
night
to
keep
these
individuals
in
jail
n
moreover
and
perhaps
more
importantly
the
evidence
collected
by
the
mccjc
demonstrates
that
these
individuals
would
not
pose
even
a
moderate
risk
to
the
community
if
released
as
demonstrated
by
their
incredibly
low
bail
n
this
problem
demonstrates
economic
inefficiencies
in
the
current
system
that
do
not
protect
the
community
from
any
meaningful
risk
the
aforementioned
reforms
in
pretrial
decision
making
attempt
to
create
a
smarter
criminal
justice
system
in
milwaukee
based
on
evidence
that
informs
those
in
the
system
as
to
how
to
treat
on
the
one
hand
the
large
majority
of
cases
that
involve
low
level
non
dangerous
offenders
and
on
the
other
hand
those
that
involve
violent
or
dangerous
defendants
n
in
this
regard
the
mccjc
endeavors
to
protect
the
public
but
make
sensible
cost
effective
and
evidence
based
decisions

milwaukee
strives
to
stay
consistent
with
the
broken
windows
approach
to
community
policing
while
also
grappling
with
the
financial
realities
it
faces
viii
conclusion
will
the
great
recession
mark
the
beginning
of
the
end
of
community
policing
and
the
broken
windows
theory
it
is
highly
unlikely
on
the
other
hand
there
is
no
doubt
that
the
financial
and
budgetary
realities
that
cities
and
police
departments
currently
face
and
may
face
for
some
time
pose
challenges
to
continuing
a
broken
windows
theory
approach
to
community
policing
in
most
localities
while
some
of
the
non
essential
cost
cutting
measures
may
help
maintain
a
good
portion
of
the
police
and
criminal
justice
infrastructure
necessary
to
continue
this
approach
in
some
communities
the
reality
is
that
most
cities
are
experiencing
deep
enough
cuts
in
their
officer
ranks
non
officer
personnel
and
other
resources
that
some
impact
will
occur
police
departments
may
have
to
do
more
with
less
but
they
may
also
have
to
determine
that
certain
aspects
of
police
services
that
they
used
to
provide
e
g
responses
to
non
bodily
injury
traffic
accidents
illegal
parking
every
burglar
alarm
whether
it
is
confirmed
that
a
burglar
entered
the
home
or
building
and
the
like
are
no
longer
sustainable
at
current
staffing
and
funding
levels
an
interesting
possibility
to
watch
in
the
coming
years
is
whether
the
police
s
non
responsiveness
to
such
low
level
crimes
and
signs
of
disorder
wind
up
signaling
a
lack
of
social
order
in
those
communities
that
have
adopted
such
policies
and
whether
that
leads
to
a
devolution
in
crime
consistent
with
the
broken
windows
theory
these
difficult
economic
times
pose
such
a
challenge
for
many
communities
because
the
broken
windows
approach
to
community
policing
is
a
resource
and
time
intensive
model
for
dealing
with
crime
while
some
question
whether
this
approach
has
contributed
to
or
is
responsible
for
the
reduction
in
crime
during
the
past
two
decades
it
is
clear
that
the
law
enforcement
community
has
embraced
this
approach
and
is
likely
unwilling
to
abandon
it
unless
absolutely
necessary
n
however
as
detailed
above
changes
in
police
structuring
and
practices
have
already
begun
and
they
may
continue
for
years
into
the
future
as
the
effects
of
the
economic
downturn
are
still
impacting
local
governments
today
n
these
tumultuous
times
may
provide
an
opportunity
for
many
communities
to
rethink
their
broken
windows
theory
approach
to
community
policing
and
restructure
it
in
a
manner
that
remains
consistent
with
the
theory
but
properly
balances
the
economic
realities
that
they
face
the
evidence
based
decision
making
approach
in
milwaukee
is
by
no
means
a
singular
example
of
the
types
of
creative
and
potentially
more
efficacious
responses
to
the
criminal
justice
and
social
service
needs
in
a
community
that
attempt
to
comport
with
tighter
and
smaller
budgets
indeed
it
is
one
of
many
examples
that
could
become
a
trend
given
current
circumstances
for
in
such
challenges
may
lie
opportunity
for
police
departments
and
the
criminal
justice
and
social
service
systems
more
generally
to
innovate
become
more
efficient
and
still
remain

n

n

this
point
underscores
a
lesser
known
foundational
premise
of
the
broken
windows
theory
that
is
that
people
do
consider
disorder
when
making
a
judgment
about
how
safe
their
neighborhood
is
n
id
n
id
the
broken
windows
moniker
derived
from
an
experiment
conducted
by
philip
zimbardo
where
he
left
a
car
sitting
in
the
bronx
in
new
york
city
new
york
and
another
in
palo
alto
california
id
the
bronx
at
the
time
was
filled
with
disorder
and
crime
and
the
car
was
vandalized
within
ten
minutes
the
car
left
in
palo
alto
an
affluent
community
with
low
crime
and
minimal
disorder
was
left
untouched
for
more
than
a
week
until
zimbardo
broke
one
of
its
windows
with
a
sledgehammer
within
hours
of
zimbardo
doing
so
the
car
was
entirely
ruined
by
others
id
a
similar
metaphor
is
an
abandoned
manufacturing
plant
building
that
remains
untouched
until
a
window
is
broken
which
triggers
more
windows
being
broken
followed
by
vandalism
and
other
crimes
and
eventually
the
building
being
burned
to
the
ground
both
metaphorical
examples
serve
to
demonstrate
the
theory
that
even
in
an
orderly
neighborhood
once
there
are
visible
signs
of
acceptance
of
disorder
further
disorder
and
greater
crime
will
inevitably
follow

manner

may

effective
in

local

open
up
possibilities

re
integrative

strengthen

jharkhand
police
is
adopting
predictive
policing
an
ambitious
futuristic
crime
control
method
which
will
allow
the
police
to
foretell
not
just
the
nature
of
crime
but
also
indicate
the
place
where
such
a
felony
is
to
take
place
as
understood
by
the
layman
post
adoption
of
the
method
the
police
would
be
able
to
reach
the
crime
scene
before
the
crime
is
committed
quite
naturally
the
state
police
appears
to
be
excited
about
the
project
and
have
indicated
that
the
pilot
project
could
take
off
in
the
next
eight
months
and
the
plan
for
the
entire
state
could
be
a
reality
by
for
the
staunch
believers
in
and
practitioners
of
conventional
policing
the
project
which
allows
computers
to
predict
crime
is
a
wasteful
exercise
it
is
being
argued
that
the
computers
would
be
ineffective
instruments
of
peeping
into
the
unpredictable
human
nature
of
the
criminals
it
has
been
made
out
that
there
is
no
alternative
to
the
strengthening
of
the
police
station
the
basic
structure
of
policing
and
empowering
the
beat
constable
while
some
of
these
arguments
are
valid
to
write
off
the
role
of
technology
in
future
crime
prevention
may
not
be
a
good
idea
the
futuristic
policing
system
being
implemented
in
jharkhand
in
consultation
with
the
ranchi
campus
of
the
indian
institute
of
management
is
based
on
sophisticated
algorithms
and
behavioural
science
which
complies
crime
related
data
of
past
years
the
software
then
analyses
the
data
and
produces
results
predicting
future
crime
in
terms
of
locations
and
the
nature
of
crime
the
method
does
sound
incredible
is
yet
not
without
successes
several
of
the
police
departments
of
the
developed
world
are
gradually
taking
help
of
software
for
predictive
policing
with
impressive
returns
for
example
use
of
the
software
predpol
has
resulted
in
a
per
cent
drop
in
burglaries
in
areas
under
the
los
angeles
police
department
a
similar
software
developed
by
the
ibm
for
the
south
carolina
police
has
also
led
to
a
decrease
in
crime
rates
the
scotland
yard
in
britain
has
popularised
facewatch
a
smart
phone
application
that
provides
the
viewers
the
pictures
of
suspects
who
may
be
in
their
areas
coming
across
such
a
suspect
people
can
alert
the
police
department
by
simply
tapping
on
the
suspect
s
image
critiques
of
the
futuristic
policing
models
argue
that
the
analytic
capacities
of
the
software
infuses
no
additional
expertise
police
officials
use
past
data
and
their
own
analysis
to
identify
crime
patterns
while
that
is
true
it
is
also
a
fact
that
the
ability
to
identify
crime
patterns
is
intrinsically
linked
to
capacity
of
the
individual
officers
which
is
not
a
standard
quality
associated
with
all
police
officers
benefits
from
the
software
thus
could
be
immense
especially
for
states
which
have
dearth
of
officials
and
ground
level
personnel
vacancies
at
times
running
as
high
as
per
cent
the
software
would
provide
instantaneous
analyses
free
from
the
vagaries
of
delays
and
follies
associated
with
the
human
planning
the
system
would
thus
release
more
personnel
to
hit
the
road
tackling
crime
rather
than
being
busy
in
crime
trend
analyses
in
an
age
of
diminishing
budgets
police
departments
would
be
able
to
optimise
force
deployment
the
biggest
challenge
would
however
come
not
from
the
believers
in
conventional
policing
but
from
inside
the
police
establishment
and
the
legal
system
can
the
system
work
without
a
highly
responsive
and
alert
police
force
which
wholeheartedly
believes
in
the
new
operating
environment
would
the
courts
prosecute
suspects
arrested
on
the
basis
of
a
software
prediction
would
the
system
prevent
crimes
in
new
areas
the
fact
that
answer
to
all
these
questions
is
in
the
negative
does
not
take
away
anything
from
the
need
for
policing
to
go
futuristic
and
tech
savvy
the
predictive
policing
software
does
not
replace
the
conventional
policing
but
acts
as
an
enabler
it
facilitates
the
seamless
integration
of
the
merits
of
technology
with
the
skills
of
the
police
personnel
it
does
not
aim
at
solving
crimes
but
preventing
them
more
number
of
crimes
being
prevented
would
produce
less
criminals
in
the
court
and
aid
the
over
burdened
judiciary
of
all
the
states
jharkhand
is
probably
the
best
positioned
to
experiment
with
predictive
policing
carved
out
in
november
it
is
a
relatively
new
state
thereby
burdened
with
comparatively
less
data
to
be
fed
into
the
system
its
a
theatre
where
organised
crime
has
mixed
dangerously
with
extremism
and
conventional
criminal
activities
it
is
also
the
state
which
has
performed
exceptionally
well
in
terms
of
police
modernisation

officers
can
use
this

baskin
said
this
can
help
direct
the

patrol

so
they
can
deter

actually
catch
someone
in

predpol
the

is
based
on
an

model
developed
by
a
group
of

including
mathematician
george
mohler
of

the
model
used
data
gleaned
from
a

at

the

the
attention
of

nationwide
many
asking
how
they
can
get
the

based

friend
helped
coordinate
a

the

has
already
signed

deputy

her

is
excited
about
having
a

we
have
issues
with
dwindling

and
we

mcsorley
said
the
real

will
be
a

for

the

generates
projections
about
when

where
future
crimes
are
likely
to
occur
crime
statistics
are
computed
daily
and
fresh
data
is
fed
into
the

officers
are
shown
digital
maps
at
the
beginning
of
each
shift
marked
with
boxes
representing
square
foot
areas
that
are
of
highest
risk
for
future
crime
they
re
encouraged
to
drive
through
those
areas
while
on
patrol
ladies
whatever
you
do
don
t
cheat
on
your
husband
if
you
re
in
warwickshire
you
could
end
up
having
to
sit
on
the
back
of
a
ram
in
front
of
a
courtroom
full
of
people
reciting
a
humiliating
ditty
while
you
hang
on
to
its
tail
and
that
s
not
all
you
need
to
be
wary
of
in
the
leafy
midland
shire
county
if
you
try
to
sell
shoes
before
pm
you
could
be
fined
p
that
goes
for
men
too
you
could
also
incur
a
p
fine
if
you
play
tennis
and
bowls
too
early
in
the
day
there
s
a
recession
on
don
t
you
know
such
pastimes
are
considered
a
waste
of
time
and
if
you
miss
church
but
manage
to
make
it
to
the
pub
and
you
re
caught
by
a
warden
you
could
also
face
a
fine
a
bigger
one
than
the
others
ten
whole
english
shillings
to
be
precise
oh
hang
on
a
minute
i
thought
it
sounded
a
bit
odd
these
were
laws
that
the
county
was
ruled
by
back
in
the
middle
ages
they
don
t
exist
anymore
the
national
archives
manorial
documents
register
put
them
online
for
the
first
time
last
week
in
other
news
we
learned
west
midlands
police
is
set
to
trial
predictive
policing
on
midland
streets
just
like
tom
cruise
did
in
minority
report
and
this
is
for
real
i
ve
double
and
triple
checked
in
case
you
can
t
remember
the
hit
film
had
a
special
police
unit
which
was
able
to
arrest
murderers
before
they
committed
their
crimes
west
midlands
police
have
not
mentioned
murder
though
their
predictive
policing
scheme
will
deal
with
burglars
it
will
forecast
who
is
about
to
be
burgled
then
officers
can
go
round
and
warn
the
potential
victim
the
officers
won
t
just
tell
the
residents
that
they
re
under
threat
they
ll
check
to
see
if
their
door
locks
are
in
fully
working
order
and
see
if
they
ve
got
an
alarm
fitted
cops
are
also
going
to
check
the
routes
burglars
take
to
see
if
there
are
any
common
patterns
superintendent
alex
murray
who
is
leading
the
experiment
said
predictive
policing
is
about
understanding
where
crime
is
going
to
happen
before
it
s
taken
place
we
re
launching
two
experiments
to
see
if
we
can
make
an
impact
on
the
burglary
rates
before
burglary
has
actually
happened
apparently
previous
trials
took
place
in
the
suburbs
of
los
angeles
in
the
us
and
showed
promising
results
i
know
times
are
tough
but
does
the
force
really
think
this
type
of
tactic
is
going
to
make
up
for
axing
members
of
staff
in
a
bid
to
balance
budgets
the
home
office
seems
to
think
so
they
re
part
funding
the
scheme
it
might
be
dressed
up
as
some
kind
of
hi
tech
crime
fighting
gizmo
but
in
reality
this
has
got
all
the
originality
and
flair
of
discovering
that
bears
go
to
the
woods
to
relieve
themselves
apparently
the
pope
is
a
catholic
as
well
perhaps
instead
of
looking
to
the
future
they
should
look
at
those
ancient
laws
for
effective
ideas
to
help
burglary
victims
many
of
whom
feel
unsafe
in
their
own
homes
and
are
denied
the
right
to
protect
themselves
apparently
it
s
still
legal
to
shoot
a
welshman
with
a
longbow
as
long
as
you
re
in
hereford
s
cathedral
close
on
a
sunday
police
are
trying
to
stay
one
step
ahead
of
villains
by
using
a
com
puter
program
to
predict
where
they
will
strike
next
it
sounds
like
an
episode
of

channel
series

rs
in
which
fbi
agent
don
eppes
recruits
his
mathematical
genius
brother
char

to
help
him
catch
crooks
however
the
predictive
policing
method
is
real
and
having
great
success
in
america
los
angeles
police
say
it
has
cut
crime
rates
by
per
cent
while
their
colleagues
along
the
coast
in
santa
cruz
say
their
figures
are
down
per
cent
last
week
kent
police
officers
began
a
pilot
study
using
a
com
puter
to
draw
up
maps
of
those
areas
in
which
crimes
are
most
likely
to
be
committed
predictions
are
made
using
a
complex
algorithm
to
process
crime
details
such
as
the
time
place
and
method
the
software
is
similar
to
that
which
predicts
after
shocks
following
earthquakes
kent
police
are
using
the
method
in
secretly
selected
areas
detec
tive
chief
superintendent
john
sutton
said
we
are
looking
at
all
types
of
crime
and
anti
social
behaviour
two
staff
went
to
los
angeles
to
learn
about
it
and
we
have
rolled
it
out
in
the
north
of
the
county
for
three
months
and
after
that
it
will
be
used
county
wide
for
months
zach
friend
a
crime
analyst
with
the
santa
cruz
police
depart
ment
said
we
have
per
cent
more
calls
for
service
but
per
cent
less
staff
than
in
so
we
have
to
deploy
our
resources
in
a
more
effective
way
los

police

the
pro
gram
has
saved
over
million

i

i
m
not
going

i
have
to
be
better
at

i

and
that
s
what
predic

is
about
if
this
old

cop
can
change

police
in
medway
are
now
tackling
crime
even
before
it
has
happened
in
a
radical
new
approach
officers
in
the
towns
and
other
parts
of
the
north
division
which
includes
gravesend
dartford
and
swale
are
piloting
the
ground
breaking
scheme
which
has
reduced
crime
rates
in
parts
of
the
united
states
by
up
to
from
this
week
officers
have
been
using
the
predictive
policing
tactic
which
analyses
data
to
identify
places
where
crime
and
anti
social
behaviour
are
most
likely
to
occur
using
advanced
mathematics
and
analysis
of
human
behaviour
along
with
historic
crime
data
it
is
more
sophisticated
than
hot
spot
policing
and
intelligence
led
tactics
the
force
has
been
working
closely
with
police
departments
across
america
such
as
the
los
angeles
police
department
which
has
been
using
the
initiative
with
success
along
with
prof
jeff
brantingham
from
the
university
of
california
who
helped
invent
the
scheme
kent
is
the
first
force
in
the
country
to
use
it
it
is
being
led
by
det
chief
supt
jon
sutton
who
said
the
approach
is
good
news
for
people
in
medway
he
said
what
it
does
is
look
at
evidence
based
crime
which
is
likely
to
occur
in
an
area
and
officers
go
there
to
prevent
it
from
happening
they
would
look
at
vulnerable
targets
such
as
garages
or
cars
being
left
unlocked
and
contact
the
owners
so
they
can
get
them
locked
up
this
will
help
stop
opportunist
thieves
targeting
people
s
property
since
monday
officers
in
the
gravesend
area
have
already
caught
a
suspected
burglar
in
the
act
by
going
to
area
highlighted
by
using
the
scheme
officers
in
medway
also
identified
some
vehicles
which
had
been
left
unsafe
and
were
able
to
contact
the
owners
to
get
them
to
lock
them
before
opportunist
thieves
struck
det
ch
supt
sutton
said
its
exciting
to
be
working
on
it
as
it
will
reduce
the
number
of
victims
of
crime
it
is
a
mixture
of
traditional
policing
and
data
we
ve
had
the
americans
over
and
we
ve
been
working
with
them
and
we
expect
the
initiative
will
reduces
crime
by
about
the
pilot
will
last
three
months
and
the
results
will
be
reviewed
it
is
set
to
be
rolled
out
across
the
rest
of
the
county
in

ian
learmonth
kent
police
s
chief
constable
said
predictive
policing
helps
address
the
root
causes
of
crime
rather
than
looking
solely
at
the
symptoms
it
is
the
best
example
of
old
fashioned
policing
but
using
st
century
technology
it
maps
a
small
geographic
area
in
a
neighbourhood
officers
are
sent
to
deal
with
what
they
find
and
disrupt
any
criminal
activity

replace

introduction
significant
change
is
afoot
in
u
s
criminal
law
there
remain
roughly
seven
million
people
incarcerated
on
probation
or
on
parole
in
the
united
states
n
a
quantum
of
criminal
law
oversight
roundly
condemned
by
commentators
across
the
political
spectrum
and
around
the
world
n
but
by
the
turn
of
the
twenty
first
century
largely
in
response
to
growing
censure
and
in
the
face
of
escalating
costs
states
across
the
country
committed
to
decrease
reliance
on
incarceration
n
alongside
state
initiated
reforms
federal
prison
conditions
litigation
contributed
further
incentives
to
decarcerate
most
notably
the
u
s
supreme
court
in
brown
v
plata
affirmed
an
order
of
a
specially
convened
three
judge
district
court
which
mandated
that
california
reduce
its
prison
population
by
prisoners
over
two
years
to
eliminate
unconstitutional
conditions
n
yet
while
pressures
to
decarcerate
mount
it
remains
unclear
how
it
will
be
possible
to
achieve
the
larger
scale
shifts
necessary
to
reach
and
sustain
markedly
lower
levels
of
criminal
prosecution
criminal
supervision
and
incarceration
n
as
one
part
of
a
broader
effort
to
reduce
reliance
on
conventional
probation
and
carceral
sentencing
beginning
in
the
early
s
state
court
judges
began
to
convene
specialized
criminal
courts
from
florida
to
california
michigan
to
texas
drug
courts
mental
health
courts
veterans
courts
and
reentry
courts
among
others
n
these
increasingly
popular
specialized
criminal
courts
of
which
there
are
approximately
in
the
united
states
and
its
territories
assume
various
legal
institutional
forms
and
divergent
jurisprudential
approaches
n
nonetheless
despite
considerable
variation
what
most
of
the
courts
share
in
common
is
the
goal
of
reducing
reliance
on
conventional
jail
and
prison
based
sentencing
in
favor
of
problem
oriented
alternatives
n
the
courts
also
empower
judges
to
adopt
neo
realist
problem
oriented
roles
embrace
less
adversarial
criminal
procedures
and
aspire
to
more
effectively
protect
public
safety
and
prevent
crime
n
it
is
uncertain
though
what
specialized
criminal
courts
actually
portend
are
these
courts
configured
in
a
manner
that
is
likely
to
facilitate
the
intended
goals
of
reduced
or
more
efficacious
criminal
supervision
and
reduced
incarceration
or
as
some
critics
charge
do
specialized
criminal
courts
improve
judges
experience
in
the
courts
by
emphasizing
anti
formalist
problem
oriented
proceedings
without
tending
to
resolve
the
legal
systemic
and
social
problems
the
courts
purport
to
address
n
this
article
offers
an
account
of
how
specialized
criminal
courts
may
enable
substantially
reduced
reliance
on
incarceration
as
well
as
more
general
transformative
criminal
law
reform
by
embracing
a
criminal
law
reformist
framework
which
i
term
a
decarceration
model
however
this
article
will
argue
that
in
their
currently
predominant
institutional
forms
specialized
criminal
courts
threaten
to
produce
a
range
of
unintended
and
undesirable
outcomes
unnecessarily
expanding
criminal
surveillance
diminishing
procedural
protections
and
potentially
even
increasing
incarceration
the
existing
scholarship
on
specialized
criminal
courts
treats
particular
substantively
specialized
criminal
courts
drug
courts
for
example
as
a
largely
undifferentiated
category
either
celebrating
or
proposing
the
abandonment
of

criminal
law
administration
across
the
board
on
the
one
hand
some
commentators
commend
specialized
criminal
courts
for
facilitating
a
quiet
revolution
among
american
criminal
courts
n
and
the
emergence
of
a
new
criminal
justice
paradigm
n
also
among
the
courts
supporters
are
those
who
herald
specialized
criminal
courts
as
experimentalist
governance
mechanisms
enabling
much
needed
social
and
legal
change
not
achievable
through
more
conventional
judicial
or
legislative
intervention
n
on
the
other
hand
the
courts
detractors
criminal
law
scholars
and
criminal
defense
lawyers
alike
have
called
for
the
abandonment
or
marked
scaling
back
of
specialized
criminal
courts
as
contraindicated
and
anathema
to
the
reformist
goals
the

to
achieve

on
account

both
of
these

divided
responses
approach
each
type

court
as
internally

and
either
entirely
praiseworthy
or

dangerous
accordingly
there
has
been

both
to
the
remarkable
variation
between
specialized
criminal
courts
and
to
the
different
consequences
potentially
associated
with
the
courts
divergent
approaches
this
article
demonstrates
instead
that
specialized
criminal
courts
have
become
the
locus
of
an
ongoing
contest
between
four
primary
competing
models
of
reformist
criminal
law
administration
these
models
are
characterized
by
dissimilar
legal
institutional
features
and
distinct
ideological
and
theoretical
commitments
and
these
divergent
approaches
push
in
quite
different
directions
in
terms
of
their
likely
effects
on
incarceration
practices
levels
of
criminal
supervision
and
other
desired
criminal
law
reforms
consider
this
motley
assortment
of
specialized
criminal
courts
and
the
various
criminal
offenses
sentences
ideologies
and
possible
outcomes
associated
with
each
first
the
veterans
court
of
okemos
michigan
and
the
case
of
staff
sergeant
brad
eifert
a
veteran
of
the
iraq
war
armed
with
a
caliber
pistol
eifert
initiated
a
shoot
out
with
police
in
the
woods
adjacent
to
his
home
the
police
were
out
there
somewhere
and
one
way
or
the
other
eifert
was
ready
to
die
he
raised
the
gun
to
his
head
and
then
lowered
it
then
he
fired
nine
rounds
leaving
his
weapon
he
ran
into
the
driveway
shouting
shoot
me
shoot

shoot

the
police
officers
subdued
him
with
a
taser
and
arrested
him
a
few
hours
later
he
sat
in
a
cell
at
the
ingham
county
jail
charged
with
five
counts
of
assault
with

having
pleaded

the
strict
regimen
of
treatment
through
the
veterans
affairs
hospital
in
battle
creek
and

set
by
the
court
the
charge
could
be
dismissed
or
reduced
to
a

n
compare
eifert
s
case
and
the
okemos
veterans
court
to
florida
s
broward
county
mental
health
court
in
the
words
of
broward
county
s
judge
ginger
lerner
wren
t
he
mental
health
court
is
a
strategy
to
bring
fairness
to
the
administration
of
justice
for
persons
being
arrested
on
minor
offenses
who
suffer
from
major
mental
disability
persons
with
major
psychiatric
disorders
and
or
mental
disabilities
can
live
and
thrive
in
the
community
with
individualized
care
treatment
and
community
support
n
whereas
eifert

case
involved
a
more
serious
weapons
charge
carrying
a
potentially
lengthy
prison
sentence
judge
lerner
wren
s
mental
health
court
concentrates
on
individuals
accused
of
minor
crimes
yet
both
the
broward
county
mental
health
court
and
the
okemos
veterans
court
rely
on
alternative
sanctions
that
entail
treatment
primarily
outside
the
specialized
criminal
court
other
specialized
criminal
courts
rely
heavily
on
judicial
monitoring
as
part
and
parcel
of
alternative
sentencing
rather
than
primarily
on
referral
to
social
services
outside
the
criminal
court
effectively
tasking
the
judge
with
the
work
of
a
probation
or
parole
officer
for
example
the
syracuse
new
york
drug
treatment
court
significantly
expands
judicial
surveillance
of
minor
drug
offenders
and
uses
arrest
and
incarceration
as
routine
sanctions
for
noncompliance
with
court
mandates
as
sociologist
james
nolan
explains
in
one
instance
a
participant
in
judge
mckinney
s
syracuse
new
york
drug
court
lost
his
job
mckinney
called
the
employer
and
learned
that
the
client
was
regarded
as
a
damn
good
employee
and
that
the
boss
would
hire
him
back
in
a
heartbeat
if
the
judge
could
guarantee
that
he
was
drug
free
and
that
he
wouldn
t
miss
any
work
so
the
judge
made
a
deal
with
the
employer
he
said
to
him
okay
i
ll
make
a
deal
with
you
you
take
him
back
and
i
ll
add
another
weapon
to
your
arsenal
if
he
doesn
t
come
to
work
when
he
is
supposed
to
doesn
t
come
to
work
on
time
i
ll
put
him
in
jail
on
your
say
so
the
judge
relayed
the
arrangement
to
the
defendant
telling
him
i
ll
get
your
job
back
for
you
but
you
ve
got
to
promise
you
ll
be
at
work
when
you
are
supposed
to
your
employer
is
now
on
the
team
of
people
who
are
reporting
to
me
when
he
calls
up
and
tells
me
that
you
are
late
or
that
you
re
not
there
i
m
going
to
send
the
cops
out
to
arrest
you
n
this
approach
may
extend
criminal
supervision
into
new
domains
such
as
the
employment
context
and
in
so
doing
may
increase
levels
of
at
least
short
term
incarceration
quite
distinctly
the
mental
health
and
veterans
courts
approaches
just
related
are
characterized
by
a
combination
of
diversionary
treatment
strategies
that
do
not
necessarily
rely
heavily
on
judicial
surveillance
or
other
forms
of
direct
criminal
supervision
by
the
court
these
examples
illustrate
some
of
the
considerable
diversity
in
the
institutional
configurations
and
conceptual
orientations
of
specialized
criminal
courts
these
courts
may
focus
on
more
minor
offenses
or
more
serious
ones
they
may
rely
primarily
on
referrals
to
social
service
organizations
or
on
direct
judicial
oversight
the
court
proceedings
themselves
may
aim
to
facilitate
behavioral
modification
or
social
service
intervention
may
occur
entirely
outside
the
court
context
and
diversion
may
take
place

alternative
to
begin
to
make
sense
of
this
diverse
landscape
this
article
introduces
a
typology
and
critical
theoretical
account
of
four
criminal
law
reformist
models
at
work
in
specialized
criminal
courts
a
therapeutic
jurisprudence
model
a
judicial
monitoring
model
an
order
maintenance
model
and
a
decarceration
model
n
the
first
three
of
these
models
i
argue
possess
characteristics
that
pose
a
considerable
risk
of
deepening
and
extending
existing
pathologies
in
criminal
law
administration
exacerbating
overcriminalization
and
potentially
expanding
incarceration
but
the
fourth
model
a
decarceration
model
promises
to
begin
to
reduce
levels
of
criminalization
and
incarceration
and
to
develop
experimentalist
and
sociologically
informed
alternatives
to
criminal
law
intervention
these
four
models
consist
of
generally
interconnected
institutional
features
and
ideological
commitments
on
which
the
courts
draw
although
numerous
courts
reflect
some
characteristics
of
more
than
one
model
the
models
are
prototypes
to
which
existing
courts
roughly
adhere
in
identifying
these
basic
contrasting
approaches
this
typology
serves
to
illuminate
some
of
the
underappreciated
variation
between
and
among
different
specialized
criminal
courts
thereby
distinguishing
the
specific
risks
associated
with
distinct
bundles
of
legal
institutional
and
ideological
features
facilitating
more
informed
empirical
analysis
and
clarifying
the
contours
of
various
possible
reform
agendas
being
tested
in
the
specialized
courts
context
before
delving
in
greater
depth
into
the
four
models
and
their
associated
aspirations
risks
and
limitations
a
brief
overview
of
each
model
will
help
to
set
the
stage
for
the
analysis
to
follow
courts
operating
on
a
therapeutic
jurisprudence
model
adopt
a
neo
rehabilitative
approach
convening
courts
to
therapeutically
treat
offenders
and
in
some
instances
victims
n
on
a
therapeutic
jurisprudence
model
the
judge
personally
attempts
to
facilitate
a
therapeutic
process
in
court
through
routine
proceedings
intermediate
sanctions
and
in
some
instances
jail
or
prison
based
sentencing
substantial
efforts
are
devoted
to
making
court
proceedings
themselves
part
of
ongoing
psychotherapeutic
interventions
aimed
at
behavioral
modification
the
second
model
relies
upon
intensive
judicial
monitoring
focusing
on
deterrence
defendant
accountability
and
expanded
judicial
surveillance
as
an
alternative
or
adjunct
to
incarceration
n
a
court
operating
solely
in
conformity
with
a
judicial
monitoring
model
eschews
the
court
centered
rehabilitative
psychotherapeutic
ambitions
that
are
central
to
the
therapeutic
jurisprudence
model
and
instead
emphasizes
deterrent
judicially
administered
surveillance
a
third
model
emphasizing
order
maintenance
operates
largely
in
community
courts
which
address
relatively
minor
public
order
violations
through
locally
administered
intermediate
sanctions
such
as
community
service
n
courts
reflecting
an
order
maintenance
model
are
characterized
primarily
by
their
focus
on
low
level
quality
of
life
offenses
inspired
by
a
broken
windows
theory
of
policing
and
do
not
necessarily
embrace
either
therapeutic
or
judicially
surveillant
features
then
there
is
the
fourth
less
common
model
the
theoretical
orientation
and
reformist
potential
of
which
this
article
will
elaborate
a
decarceration
model
specialized
criminal
courts
adopting
a
decarceration
model
are
experimental
diversionary
programs
that
assign
otherwise
likely
jail
or
prison
bound
defendant
mental
health
and
drug
treatment
job
and
housing
placement
along
with
other
services
in
lieu
of
incarceration
n
on
a
decarceration
model
integration
within
social
institutions
outside
the
criminal
court
substitutes
for
the
surveilling
function
of
criminal
supervision
and
incarceration
n
the
significant
reformist
possibility
in
a
decarceration
model
arises
principally
from
its
directly
diversionary
orientation
coupled
with
rigorous
ongoing
empirical
monitoring
of
court
experimentation
to
establish
whether
and
if
so
how
non
carceral
sentencing
may
be
applied
in
particular
contexts
without
undue
risk
to
public
safety
n
the
models
are
distinct
from
though
often
overlapping
with
the
self
definitions
and
names
of
the
courts
in
other
words
the
models
are
composed
of
bundles
of
legal
institutional
and
ideological
features

my
research
in
preparation
of

through

core
argument
is
that
the
therapeutic
jurisprudence

monitoring
and
order
maintenance
models
may
fall
short
in
reducing
criminal
supervision
and
incarceration
and
threaten
to
produce
otherwise
harmful
outcomes
a
decarceration
model
however
stands
to
facilitate
broader
transformative
criminal
law
reform
setting
in
motion
change
processes
that
could
over
time
reduce
reliance
on
criminal
prosecution
and
incarceration
as
a
way
of
regulating
an
array
of
complex
social
problems
the
risks
attributed
by
critics
to
any
one
particular
type
of
specialized
criminal
court
drug
courts
for
instance
are
thus
better
understood
as
potential
problems
with
particular
models
bundles
of
legal
institutional
and
ideological
features
of
reformist
criminal
law
administration
certain
of
which
may
even
tend
to
extend
surveillance
diminish
procedural
protections
and
expand
incarceration
n
due
to
this
variation
coming
to
terms
with
the
shifts
in
criminal
law
manifest
in
specialized
criminal
courts
will
not
be
achieved
either
by
simply
embracing
or
by
rejecting
the
turn
to
criminal
court
specialization
rather
the
effects
of
specialized
criminal
courts
will
depend
on
an
ongoing
competition
over
the
shape
and
ambition
of
these
courts
and
a
decarceration
focused
criminal
law
reform
agenda
emerging
in
specialized
criminal
courts
that
attempt
to
navigate
the
perils
and
harness
the
possibilities
identified
in
the
pages
to
follow
holds
the
promise
of
enabling
a
form
of
criminal
law
administration
more
narrowly
tailored
to
address
that
conduct
for
which
criminal
law
intervention
is
most
suited
allocating
to
other
sectors
the
management
of
a
range
of
social
concerns
from
addiction
to
mental
illness
importantly
then
the
impact
of
these
reformist
models
reaches
beyond
the
context
of
specialized
criminal
courts
at
this
moment
of
increasing
bipartisan
interest
in
criminal
law
reform
aimed
at
reducing
incarceration
the
models
at
work
in
specialized
criminal
courts
are
likely
to
take
on
wider
significance

more
general
criminal

reform
strategies
for
this
reason
attention
to
these
contrasting
reformist
approaches

concerned
about
the

about

institutions
this
article
consists
of
four
parts
part
i
situates
the
contemporary
explosion
of
specialized
criminal
courts
within
a
range
of
ongoing
criminal
law
reforms
implemented
to
reduce
levels
of
criminal
supervision
and
incarceration
part
i
proposes
that
as
states
and
the
federal
government
aim
to
decrease
reliance
on
incarceration
specialized
criminal
courts
contribute
an
array
of
criminal
law
reformist
frameworks
that
may
inform
the
wide
ranging
largely
ad
hoc
changes
occurring
more
generally
in
u
s
criminal
law
part
ii
provides
a
typology
and
critical
analysis
of
four
criminal
law
reformist
models
reflected
in
the
rapidly
multiplying
assortment
of
specialized
criminal
courts
part
ii
considers
not
only
whether
these
models
are
likely
to
fulfill
their
stated
purposes
but
also
some
of
their
possible
broader
effects
an
implication
of
the
analysis
in
part
ii
is
that
the
study
of
specialized
criminal
courts
ought
to
proceed
in
a
different
way
than
it
has
to
date
by
attending
carefully
to
the
legal
institutional
and
conceptual
differences
between
the
various
criminal
law
reformist
models
that
the
typology
introduced
here
identifies
part
ii
contends
that
in
certain
legal
institutional
configurations
specialized
criminal
courts
may
well
thwart
the
courts
overarching
shared
ambition
of
countering
overcriminalization
and
overincarceration
and
that
they
may
cause
other
underappreciated
harms
yet
if
differently
configured
the
courts
contain
considerable
broader
reaching
reformist
possibilities
part
iii
explores
three
strategies
that
may
enable
a
decarceration
model
to
realize
its
reformist
potential
to
reduce
reliance
on
conventional
criminal
supervision
and
incarceration
as
well
as
to
facilitate
other
transformative
shifts
in
u
s
criminal
law
part
iii
proposes
that
though
it
is
unlikely
and
possibly
undesirable
that
specialized
criminal
courts
would
be
brought
to
scale
n
even
in
relatively
small
numbers
a
decarceration
model
may
effect
farther
reaching
reform
by
facilitating
cognitive
reframing
of
particular
categories
of
crime
and
punishment
engaging
in
institutional
reinvention
and
enabling
systemic
change
finally
part
iv
considers
the
perils
of
a
specialized
criminal
courts
law
reform
approach
more
generally
and
begins
to
respond
to
anticipated
objections
the
analysis
in
parts
i
through
iv
is
informed
by
observation
of
proceedings
in
an
array
of
specialized
criminal
courts

judges

administrators

unexamined
studies
of
the

entities
n
i
a
shifting
criminal
law
dissatisfaction
with
the
status
quo
in
u
s
criminal
law
administration
has
led
to
a
range
of
attempts
to
establish
alternatives
the
precise
contours
of
what
such
alternatives
should
entail
are
uncertain
this
part
will
first
take
stock
of
the
broad
shifts
ongoing
in
u
s
criminal
law
although
these
shifts
lack
an
orienting
conceptual
framework
specialized
criminal
courts
have
become
grounds
for
elaborating
different
criminal
law

models

of
the
most
significant
of
which

as

a

uncertainty
about
how

as
to
depart
significantly
from

perhaps
more
critically
how
to
expand

of
what
is
lacking
is
what
criminologist
mary

describes
as
a
coordinated
conceptual

penal
institutions

dismayed
with
the
miscarriages
of
justice
they
witnessed
daily
in
their
courts
although
the
progenitors
of
specialized
criminal
courts
sought
initially
only
to
devise
different
solutions
for
their
respective
local
jurisdictions
the
specialized
courts
approach
took
off
and
the
courts
influence
expanded
nationally
as
specialized
criminal
courts
spread
across
the
united
states
the
courts
came
to
reflect
considerable
institutional
diversity
of
the
approximately
specialized
criminal
courts
in
the
united
states
the
original
and
most
numerous
are
drug
courts
beginning
in
the
late
s
and
early
s
judges
dissatisfied
with
their
role
in
processing
drug
cases
began
to
convene
drug
courts
to
reduce
reliance
on
incarceration
in
favor
of
treatment
and
other
monitoring
processes
for
drug
related
offenses
among
the
first
contemporary
adult
specialized
criminal
courts
the
miami
dade
drug
court
was
established
in
to
reduce
reliance
on
jail
and
prison
in
dealing
with
low
level
drug
offenders
n
to
promote
these
initiatives
state
court
judges
collaborated
with
prosecutors
public
defense
counsel
and
ultimately
state
legislatures
and
the
federal
government
former
attorney
general
janet
reno
when
she
was
a
local
prosecutor
in
florida
was
instrumental
in
establishing
the
miami
dade
drug
court
and
then
when
reno
became
attorney
general
of
the
united
states
she
used
her
control
over
federal
criminal
justice
spending
to
urge
other
states
to
adopt
similar
initiatives
n
subsequently
drug
courts
have
received
overwhelming
bipartisan
support
n
at
the
national
drug
court
conference
in
judge
jeffrey
tauber
oakland
california
s
first
drug
court
judge
and
then
president
of
the
national
association
of
drug
court
professionals
addressed
his
audience
of
more
than
drug
court
professionals
predicting
the
growing
influence
that
drug
courts
would
wield
in
coming
years
w
e
have
clearly
proven
through
the
work
that
we
ve
done
through
our
numbers
through
the
effectiveness
of
our
courts
that
this
field
this
movement
this
organization
is
ready
to
take
center
stage
is
ready
to
move
its
own
agenda
forward
on
the
local
state
and
national
levels
n
indeed
in
the
years
to
follow
drug
courts
sprung
up
around
the
country
as
the
number
of
drug
courts
increased
their
institutional
configurations
came
to
vary
substantially
like
the
first
miami
dade
drug
court
program
drug
courts
generally
aim
to
help
narcotics
involved
offenders
to
stay
off
drugs
by
offering
the
opportunity
to
enter
drug
rehabilitation
rather
than
incarceration
but
many
drug
courts
increasingly
address
a
range
of
other
crimes
presumably
associated
with
drug
use
such
as
shoplifting
prostitution
and
burglary
n
some
drug
courts
admit
defendants
with
lengthy
and
serious
felony
records
while
others
limit
eligibility
to
those
with
nonviolent
minor
charges
n
shortly
after
the
advent
of
the
drug
court
movement
mental
health
courts
community
courts
domestic
violence
courts
and
later
veterans
courts
sex
offense
courts
and
reentry
courts
emerged
in
jurisdictions
around
the
united
states
each
of
these
categories
of
specialized
criminal
courts
represents
a
largely
judicially
innovated
attempt
to
work
around
perceived
inadequacies
in
the
conventional
criminal
law
administrative
approach
in
the
area
in
question
whether
arrests
and
prosecutions
of
mentally
ill
individuals
veterans
persons
accused
of
domestic
violence
alleged
sex
offenders
or
parolees
criminal
law
administration
within
specialized
criminal
courts
generally
adopts
a
neo
realist
jurisprudence
which
its
proponents
call
problem
solving
justice
or
to
my
mind
more
accurately
problem
oriented
justice
n
this
has
led
some
commentators
to
label
all
specialized
criminal
courts
interchangeably
problem
solving
courts
n
a
term
that
connotes
an
aim
on
the
part
of
the
courts
to
address
problems
both
in
the
legal
system
and
in
the
lives
of
defendants
appearing
before
the
courts
n
it
is
noteworthy
that
judges
themselves
have
been
the
primary
driving
force
behind
the
specialized
criminal
courts
movement
working
cooperatively
with
prosecutors
defense
counsel
and
other
interested
elected
officials
to
convene
specialized
criminal
courts
as
criminal
law
enforcement
expanded
during
the
latter
decades
of
the
twentieth
century
and
many
more
cases
entered
the
criminal
courts
dockets
swelled
n
more
cases
meant
more
pressure
on
judges
to
resolve
cases
quickly
leading
to
reduced
judicial
morale
n
in
response
to
their
deep
dissatisfaction
with
their
own
role
in
criminal
law
administration
judges
sought
to
devise
an
alternative
legal
institutional
framework
for
at
least
some
categories
of
criminal
cases
obtaining
initially
the
support
of
locally
elected
prosecutors
and
subsequently
as
the
specialized
criminal
court
initiatives
expanded
broader
legislative
support
n
in
promoting
specialized
court
programs
as
a
criminal
law
reform
standard
judges
and
other
court
advocates
increasingly
have
collaborated
with
specialized
court
consultants
such
as
the
center
for
court
innovation
a
new
york
city
based
organization
and
with
legal
academics
n
state
legislatures
and
the
u
s
congress
have
endorsed
the
specialized
courts
approach
by
incorporating
diversionary
specialized
court
sentencing
into
statutory
provisions
and
by
authorizing
state
and
federal
funding
for
specialized
criminal
courts
in
this
regard
the
specialized
courts
movement
may
be
understood
as
a
widely
endorsed
work
around
of
political
process
defects
whereas
tough
on
crime
norms
make
decriminalization
or
other
downscaling
of
punishment
less
available
specialized
criminal

to
appear

on

to
the
conduct
of

the

generation
of

n
veterans
courts
convened
beginning

the
mid

specialized

established
to

socially

the
part
of

of
whom
are
suffering

in
some
instances

participate
in
veterans

rely
on
alternative
sentences

mental

courts
domestic

courts
generally
operate
with
less
reference
to
rehabilitative
goals
instead
domestic

and
sex

courts
for
the
most
part
seek
to
provide
individually
tailored
monitoring
of
defendants
charged
and
or
convicted
in
domestic

or
sex
offense
cases
and
in
some
instances
more
meaningful

some
domestic

also
seek
to
reduce

domestic

with
an

reduction
mission
intend
for
monitoring
and
services
to
serve
as
an
alternative
to
jail
or
prison
based
sentencing
and
to
work
to
break
preexisting
cycles
of
violence
and
abuse
so
as
to
limit
levels
of
reincarceration
as
brooklyn
s
felony
domestic
violence
court
judge
john
leventhal
explained
i
saw
people
going
to
jail
for
two
years
for
not
paying
child
support
which
is
a
condition
of
their
order
of
protection
and
i
was
surprised
to
see
such
a
large
violation
and
probation
calendar
i
wanted
to
cut
that
down
how
do
we
cut
that
down
we
bring
them
back
while
they
re
on
probation
before
they
re
really
violating
in
a
bad
way
to
keep
them
on
the
right
track
for
the
first
four
years
or
five
years
that
we
were
doing
it
we
had
half
the
violation
rate
of
the
general
probation
population
which
is
incredible
considering
that
you
have
targeted
victims
and
people
who
know
each
other
since
then
i
think
our
violation
rate
has
gone
down
even
further
n
so
in
domestic
violence
courts
such
as
judge
leventhal
s
judicial
monitoring
aims
to
reduce
carceral
sentencing
reoffending
and
reincarceration
even
though
these
goals
were
not
the
explicit
initial
motivations
for
convening
most
domestic
violence
courts
likewise
sex
offense
courts
have
been
promoted
to
more
effectively
monitor
persons
accused
or
convicted
of
sex
offenses
n
yet
some
of
these
courts
simultaneously
seek
to
shift
criminal
law
administration
in
sex
offense
cases
to
make
the
criminal
supervisory
regime
more
reasonable
and
less
likely
to
result
in
reincarceration
for
technical
violations
contrary
to
public
perception
most
convicted
sex
offenders
receive
little
prison
time
in
their
initial
sentence
and
are
subject
primarily
to
terms
of
probation
or
a
short
carceral
sentence
followed
by
parole
n
still
in
many
jurisdictions
the
vast
majority
of
convicted
sex
offenders
even
those
charged
only
with
an
offense
stemming
from
public
exposure
or
sex
with
a
person
just
a
few
years
younger
than
the
accused
are
subject
to
sex
offender
registration
and
residential
restrictions
that
make
life
extremely
difficult
and
may
encourage
criminal
behavior
by
socially
isolating
sex
offenders
n
sex
offense
courts
permit
modifications
of
certain
of
these
restrictions
where
doing
so
is
thought
to
be
reasonable
so
that
the
response
to
persons
charged
and
convicted
of
sex
offenses
may
unfold
with
greater
moderation
and
rationality
n
as
judge
james
mccarthy
the
first
presiding
judge
of
the
oswego
county
sex
offense
court
in
new
york
has
explained
the
ambition
of
his
court
in
offering
a
more
individualized
monitoring
regime
for
convicted
sex
offenders
is
in
part
to
make
it
such
that
the
sex
offender
can
live
somewhere
and
work
somewhere
without
being
demonized
while
still
being
closely
supervised
n
the
sex
offense
courts
may
also
be
conceptualized
in
some
instances
then
as
an
attempt
to
work
around
existing
criminal
law
regimes
that
appear
to
judges
and
other
interested
persons
to
be
irrational
or
excessively
harsh
where
more
thoroughgoing
legislative
modification
is
unavailable
the
courts
aim
to
devise
an
alternative
regime
to
mitigate
the
perceived
ill
effects
of
the
conventional
processes
and
to
develop
a
different
approach
that
may
have
as
an
important
side
effect
reduced
reliance
on
incarceration
in
response
to
technical
violations
n
there
are
as
of
this
writing
in
jurisdictions
across
the
united
states
approximately
mental
health
courts
n
domestic
violence
courts
and
thirty
community
courts
more
than
drug
courts
and
in
excess
of
other
specialized
criminal
courts
including
sex
offense
and
veterans
courts
n
those
states
with
numerous
specialized
criminal
courts
span
the
country
including
jurisdictions
as
diverse
as
alaska
california
indiana
and
new
york
n
there
is
no
single
foundational
document
to
which
all
specialized
criminal
courts
refer
and
no
unified
theory
that
captures
their
complicated
interrelationships
and
diverse
projects
but
although
the
initial
impetuses
for
convening
specialized
criminal
courts
differed
most
of
their
founders
share
in
common
the
hope
of
devising
better
substantially
non
carceral
approaches
to
criminal
law
administration
at
least
for
certain
categories
of
offenders
n
specialized
criminal
courts
have
now
reached
some
measure
of
maturity
and
there
are
at
least
four
legal
institutional
and
conceptual
reformist
models
to
which
the
existing
courts
roughly
correspond
in
fact
what
may
make
specialized
criminal
courts
politically
palatable
is
also
what
makes
their
eventual
outcome
uncertain
their
form
is
sufficiently
open
so
as
to
incorporate
any
or
several
of
these
four
often
quite
divergent
reformist
approaches
n
as
a
result
what
specialized
criminal
courts
ultimately
portend
for
u
s
criminal
law
remains
ambiguous
a
matter
over
which
there
should
be
much
more
rigorous
and
reasoned
debate
than
has
occurred
to
date
ii
four
reformist
models
at
work
in
specialized
criminal
courts
this
part
introduces
a
typology
and
critical
theoretical
analysis
of
four
criminal
law
reformist
models
at
work
in
specialized
criminal
courts
a
a
therapeutic
jurisprudence
model
b
a
judicial
monitoring
model
c
an
order
maintenance
model
and
d
a
decarceration
model
with
particular
emphasis
on
the
models
respective
aspirations
potential
unintended
harms
and
reformist
possibilities
this
part
argues
that
whereas
the
first
three
more
predominant
models
possess
characteristics
that
threaten
a
range
of
unintended
and
harmful
consequences
the
fourth
model
a
decarceration
model
holds
considerable
promise
to
facilitate
broader
transformative
criminal
law
reform
n
the
following
part
part
iii
explores
in
greater
detail
three
criminal
law
reform
strategies
that
a
decarceration
model
may
set
in
motion
a
therapeutic
jurisprudence
model
specialized
criminal
courts
adopting
a
therapeutic
jurisprudence
model
are
at
work
in
every
state
in
the
country
and
increasingly
in
a
wide
range
of
foreign
jurisdictions
n
this
model
draws
heavily
on
a
theoretical
framework
developed
by
law
professors
david
wexler
and
bruce
winick
n
wexler
and
winick
s
fundamental
premise
is
that
law
may
operate
in
ways
that
are
therapeutic
or
anti
therapeutic
so
as
to
improve
or
undermine
people
s
psychological
well
being
n
according
to
wexler
and
winick
all
other
things
being
equal
legal
actors
should
seek
to
promote
therapeutic
outcomes
over
anti
therapeutic
ones
in
urging
attention
to
the
therapeutic
consequences
of
legal
arrangements
wexler
and
winick
recommend
w
e
should
see
if
the
law
could
be
reshaped
to
make
it
into
more
of
a
healing
force
a
therapeutic
force
n
in
a
certain
respect
in
the
criminal
law
context
a
therapeutic
jurisprudence
model
is
a
repackaging
of
a
rehabilitative
theory
of
sentencing
that
also
borrows
from
restorative
justice
approaches
but
therapeutic
jurisprudence
is
farther
reaching
n
the
judge
in
a
therapeutic
specialized
criminal
court
does
not
simply
assign
a
sentence
that
aims
to
rehabilitate
or
serve
a
therapeutic
or
restorative
function
instead
the
court
proceedings
themselves
whether
through
the
judge
s
warm
encouragement
or
tough
love
are
intended
to
promote
therapeutic
outcomes
the
entire
legal
process
in
fact
the
entire
institutional
operation
of
the
court
as
such
is
to
be
reconceived
on
the
therapeutic
model
although
wexler
and
winick
make
clear
that
therapeutic
concerns
ought
not
necessarily
take
precedence
over
other
considerations
they
do
not
provide
any
concrete
manner
to
evaluate
or
rank
therapeutic
priorities
relative
to
other
matters
leading
their
adherents
in
therapeutic
criminal
courts
to
prioritize
therapeutic
concerns
over
others
in
at
least
certain
contexts
when
conflicts
between
contending
values
emerge
n
accordingly
to
the
extent
earlier
critiques
leveled
against
rehabilitative
punishment
and
indeterminate
sentencing
may
apply
to
a
therapeutic
jurisprudence
model
they
apply
with
even
greater
force
because
on
a
therapeutic
jurisprudence
model
the
rehabilitative
or
therapeutic
ambition
stretches
beyond
sentencing
and
punishment
to
nearly
every
aspect
of
the
court
proceedings
n
once
a
defendant
opts
into
a
specialized
therapeutic
criminal
court
all
of
the
major
players
in
the
courtroom
judge
prosecutor
and
defense
attorney
explicitly
acknowledge
that
the
goal
is
to
change
the
defendant
s
behavior
moving
the
defendant
from
addiction
to
sobriety
and
from
a
life
of
crime
to
law
abiding
behavior
n
in
contrast
to
the
traditional
adversarial
model
of
the
disengaged
dispassionate
judge
whose
primary
task
is
to
decide
cases
fairly
and
impartially
n
therapeutic
judges
are
active
and
engaged

in
acquiring
expertise
regarding
the
problems

explains
that

is
to

of

though
it
carries
no

judge
davis
asks

judge
davis
for
instance
who
was
once
a
public
defender
at
d
c
s
public
defender
service
conducts
her
court
in
a
therapeutic
manner
that
appears
eminently
humane
though
she
has
no
formal
psychotherapeutic
expertise
illustrating
the
bizarre
quality
and
uncertain
psychotherapeutic
impact
of
merging
judicial
and
therapeutic
roles
one
afternoon
in
mental
health
court
judge
davis
greeted
a
defendant
client
with
smiles
and
congratulations
telling
the
mentally
ill
defendant
client
how
proud
she
was
of
her
and
how
the
defendant
client
was
really
doing
well
about
which
the
judge
relayed
delight
but
the
clerk
interrupted
the
exchange
to
point
out
to
the
judge
that
the
day
prior
the
defendant
client
had
tested
positive
for
cocaine
judge
davis
then
desisted
in
her
praise
extended
the
defendant
client
s
term
in
the
criminal
supervisory
program
issued
a
stern
warning
about
noncompliance
and
ordered
the
defendant
client
to
talk
to
the
assigned
therapist
about
the
relapse
the
mentally
ill
defendant
client
looked
visibly
pleased
at
the
judge
s
initial
encouraging
approval
and
then
visibly
distraught
by
the
abrupt
turn
of
events
the
defendant
client
reported
to
the
judge
directly
not
through
counsel
having
difficulty
finding
an
available
individual
therapist
to
comply
with
the
court
s
orders
as
none
were
available
and
she
related
that
she
was
hanging
out
with
drug
users
which
made
it
hard
for
her
to
resist
using
drugs
it
appeared
unclear
whether
the
defendant
client
understood
that
the
role
of
the
judge
was
distinct
from
that
of
a
mental
health
care
provider
or
other
counselor
the
judge
listened
in
front
of
the
full
courtroom
and
then
called
the
next
defendant
client
whatever
uncertainties
attend
judge
davis
s
therapeutic
courtroom
methodology
and
indeed
she
appears
compassionate
and
well
intentioned
in
her
dealings
with
the
defendants
clients
who
appear
before
her
an
additional
potential
problem
posed
by
the
therapeutic
jurisprudence
model
is
that
in
promoting
itself
as
a
useful
treatment
approach
it
may
cause
other
criminal
justice
system
actors
particularly
police
and
prosecutors
to
likewise
view
the
court
as
a
treatment
outlet
this
may
lead
relatively
minor
cases
to
go
forward
offenses
that
perhaps
ought
not
to
be
prosecuted
in
the
first
instance
but
these
cases
come
to
the
court
for
extended
court
proceedings
rather
than
just
being
dropped
or
the
defendants
simply
referred
for
treatment
because
the
court
itself
rather
than
the
social
service
organization
conducting
therapeutic
treatment
is
understood
to
be
a
central
part
of
the
therapeutic
process
this
potential
net
widening
n
effect
of
a
therapeutic
model
of
specialized
criminal
law
administration
underscores
that
criminal
courts
are
part
of
a
working
institutional
and
social
system
not
simply
sites
for
interpersonal
conduct
modification
n
as
criminal
law
scholar
guyora
binder
has
persuasively
argued
punishment
is
not
a
behavior
but
an
institution
it
is
part
of
a
system
that
involves
conduct
norms
an
authoritative
procedure
for
generating
these
norms
an
authoritative
procedure
for
decisions
to
impose
sanctions
and
some
measure
of
practical
power
over
persons
or
resources
n
when
specialized
criminal
courts
operate
on
a
therapeutic
model
they
exert
system
wide
institutional
effects
likely
shaping
what
cases
are
brought
to
criminal
court
and
to
which
agencies

resources
are
allocated

all
the
while

judges
exercise
substantial
power
over

a
further
set
of
problems
may
arise
if

therapeutic
model
believe
themselves
to
be
acting
in
the
therapeutic
interests
of
the
defendants

are
not
as
humane

davis

of
the
glynn

that

iron

came
to
the
attention
of
the
jail
authorities
when
she
attempted
suicide
after
weeks
in
isolation
by
cutting
open
her
wrists
n
judge
williams
s
interest
in
starting
a
drug
court
was
personal
she
had
addiction
in
her
own
family
and
believed
in
tough
love
n
although
the
national
association
of
drug
court
professionals
discourages
such
a
punitive
approach
the
malleability
of
therapeutic
jurisprudence
when
administered
by
lay
therapist
judges
makes
it
all
too
likely
that
judges
will
confuse
therapy
with
punishment
and
that
their
unchecked
retributive
impulses
will
be
brought
to
bear
under
the
guise
of
therapeutic
jurisprudence
n
such
potential
miscarriages
of
therapeutic
jurisprudence
expose
another
significant
overlooked
feature
of
specialized
criminal
courts
operating
on
a
therapeutic
model
therapeutic
courts
attempt
to
rid
themselves
of
the
various
traditional
approaches
to
criminal
law
administration
and
punishment
retribution
deterrence
incapacitation
n
in
favor
of
a
therapeutic
approach
while
conventional
criminal
courts
generally
at
least
in
principle
administer
criminal
law
with
self
conscious
reference
to
a
compound
of
retributive
deterrent
and
other
punishment
approaches
specialized
criminal
courts
adopting
a
therapeutic
cast
seek
to
purify
the
administration
of
criminal
law
to
one
putatively
rehabilitative
therapeutic
variant
n
the
risk
of
this
attempted
purification
is
that
it
is
difficult
to
disentangle
deterrent
therapeutic
and
retributive
impulses
in
criminal
punishment
n
and
so
cordoning
off
certain
courts
as
purely
involved
in
therapeutic
interventions
may
both
misstate
what
is
actually
occurring
in
those
courts
and
undermine
judicial
self
consciousness
about
whether
the
punitive
effects
of
particular
decisions
are
proportional
to
the
offending
conduct
and
no
greater
than
necessary
to
deter
offending
behavior
n
indeed
some
judges
administering
specialized
criminal
courts
on
a
therapeutic
model
label
their
courts
sanctions
smart
punishment
but
propose
that
s
mart
punishment
is
not
really
punishment
at
all
but
a
therapeutic
response
n
although
the
problem
of
disproportionate
punitiveness
might
in
principle
be
resolved
by
having
all
specialized
criminal
courts
adopt
sentencing
ceilings
for
technical
violations
courts
operating
on
a
therapeutic
model
embrace
an
anti
formalist
problem
oriented
discretionary
approach
that
rejects
such
externally
imposed
pre
fixed
constraints
this
model
when
it
comes
to
predominate
over
other
approaches
to
criminal
law
administration
thus
threatens
to
place
judges
with
extraordinary
power
in
a
position
where
they
act
in
what
they
perceive
to
be
defendants
clients
therapeutic
interests
but
with
unchecked
potentially
punitive
effects
unimpeded
by
principles
of
proportionality
characteristic
of
a
retributive
theory
of
punishment
this
is
all
the
more
troubling
because
these
judges
may
lack
formal
psychotherapeutic
expertise
and
many
are
likely
exhausted
by
the
undoubtedly
difficult
work
of
dealing
with
criminally
accused
addicted
or
mentally
ill
individuals
often
in
under
resourced
environments
the
relaxation
of
procedural
safeguards
as
part
of
an
anti
formalist
team
based
therapeutic
approach
only
stands
to
exacerbate
these
problems
if
judges
are
not
particularly
conscientious
a
further
limitation
of
the
therapeutic
jurisprudence
model
has
to
do
with
the
difficulty
of
bringing
a
therapeutic
court
based
approach
to
scale
even
were
that
to
be
a
desirable
outcome
a
matter
on
which
the
preceding
analysis
should
cast
some
doubt
although
the
reformist
potential
of
a
therapeutic
model
rests
on
being
able
to
administer
therapy
to
individual
defendants
through
the
courts
these
courts
only
address
a
small
fraction
of
drug
cases
or
other
relevant
categories
of
cases
in
the
system
as
of
the
number
of
individuals
in
drug
court
programs
was
as
compared
to
a
population
on
probation
of
about
four
million
individuals
many
of
whom
are
drug
involved
offenders
n
to
reach
even
ten
percent
of
individuals
serving
a
probationary
sentence
the
number
of
therapeutic
drug
courts
would
need
to
increase
enormously
n
the
akron
mental
health
court
as
of
handled
at
one
time
approximately
clients
only
a
small
fraction
of
the
many
thousands
of
mentally
ill
individuals
likely
to
be
caught
up
in
ohio
s
criminal
justice
system
n
the
louisiana
mental
health
court
as
of
had
eighty
five
participants
and
operated
one
day
per
week
n
administering
therapeutic
jurisprudence
through
convening
separate
specialized
criminal
courts
is
also
relatively
costly
further
decreasing
the
likelihood
that
it
will
be
possible
to
bring
this
model
to
scale
even
were
this
to
be
a
sought
after
result
in
any
event
there
is
considerable
cause
to
question
whether
specialized
criminal
courts
adopting
a
therapeutic
jurisprudence
model
ought
to
be
brought
to
scale
given
that
proceedings
in
these
courts
appear
to
possess
certain
inherent
features
that
may
tend
to
exacerbate
some
of
the
most
troubling
problems
associated
with
the
adjudication
of
criminal
cases
in
conventional
courts
including
unnecessary
terms
of
incarceration
for
minor
or
technical
violations
and
prevalent
procedural
irregularities
on
a
therapeutic
model
any
judicial
tendencies
in
these
directions
are
more
likely
to
be
unchecked
worse
still
on
a
therapeutic
jurisprudence
model
procedural
shortcutting
or
unnecessary
incarceration
may
be
defended
as
therapeutic
rendering
it
less
susceptible
to
critical
engagement
n
for
instance
when
california
drug
court
judges
wished
to
amend
the
california
penal
code
to
reduce
the
privacy
rights
of
drug
court
defendants
clients
one
judge
defended
the
practice
as
follows
i
support
a
search
clause
for
drug
treatment
court
clients
because
i
think
a
search
clause
is
therapeutic
i
don
t
see
a
search
clause
as
a
sanction
so
much
as
an
additional
therapeutic
intervention
that
will
help
them
succeed
n
the
potentially
problematic
effects
of
this
curtailment
of
privacy
are
obscured
by
a
therapeutic
justificatory
approach
that
is
difficult
for
non
experts
to
critically
confront
on
its
own
terms
and
even
if
on
balance
relinquishing
some
privacy
protections
may
be
socially
desirable
because
it
serves
to
reduce
recidivism
casting
the
argument
for
this
approach
in
vague
psychotherapeutic
terms
obscures
rather
than
illuminates
the
relevant
considerations
at
stake
a
therapeutic
jurisprudence
model
thus
does
little
by
itself
to
reduce
reliance
on
criminal
supervision
and
incarceration
unless
administered
by
a
judge
already
inclined
to
reduce
carceral
sentencing
and
enable
other
positive
interventions
and
in
fact
in
the
wrong
judge
s
hands
a
therapeutic
approach
may
cause
significant
harm
reliance
on
jail
sentences
as
a
sanction
for
noncompliance
with
treatment
or
other
technical
requirements
can
actually
result
in
substantial
carceral
penalties
n
potential
net
widening
effects
associated
with
placing
criminal
courts
in
the
role
of
administering
therapeutic
interventions
also
threatens
to
increase
criminal
case
filings
and
hence
overall
levels
of
criminal
supervision
and
quite
possibly
incarceration
n
although
a
therapeutic
jurisprudence
model
nonetheless
appeals
to
many
because
it
repackages
and
resurrects
a
rehabilitative
sentencing
approach
it
does
so
with
considerable
risk
of
engendering
a
variety
of
unintended
and
undesirable
consequences
both
for
rule
of
law
principles
and
for
the
persons
it
is
intended
to
benefit
the
answer
to
these
problems
is
to
disentangle
reformist
criminal
law
administration
from
a
particular
set
of
predefined
therapeutic
jurisprudential
commitments
and
instead
to
experiment
with
jurisprudential
content
so
as
to
reduce
reliance
on
incarceration
and
to
divert
cases
to
other
sectors
that
may
more
meaningfully
address
social
goals
the
appropriate
reconceptualization
for
the
courts
is
as
a
strategy
to
enable
decarceration
their
unifying
feature
being
that
they
are
experimenting
with
criminal
law
administration
to
reduce
carceral
sentencing
in
favor
of
preferable
approaches
rather
than
adapting
a
therapeutic
methodology
for
criminal
law
but
before
turning
to
a
decarceration
model
it
remains
in
the
following
sections
to
explore
the
other
predominant
reformist
models
at
work
in
specialized
criminal
courts
b
judicial
monitoring
model
the
defining
characteristic
of
specialized
criminal
courts
operating
on
a
judicial
monitoring
model
is
that
they
rely
primarily
on
judges
to
engage
in
monitoring
of
defendants
or
participants
who
may
be
asked
to
submit
to
urine
tests
and
curfews
and
to
attend
court
appointments
as
often
as
several
times
per
week
n
the
theoretical
basis
of
the
judicial
monitoring
model
is
that
intensified
judicially
administered
criminal
surveillance
will
reduce
future
misconduct
at
lesser
cost
than
incarceration
and
with
greater
efficacy
than
conventional
probation
or
parole
as
distinct
from
the
therapeutic
jurisprudence
model
specialized
criminal
courts
operating
exclusively
on
a
judicial
monitoring
model
do
not
aim
to
generate
therapeutic
outcomes
through
courtroom
proceedings
instead
the
judge
is
empowered
to
closely
monitor
defendants
compliance
with
court
mandates
in
a
manner
akin
to
a
probation
or
parole
officer
on
the
judicial
monitoring
model
the
court
retains
jurisdiction
to
monitor
the
defendant
participant
during
pretrial
proceedings
and
when
the
court
assigns
a
non
carceral
sentence
the
judge
mandates
reporting
back
to
the
court
on
a
regular
basis
the
impetus
for
judicial
monitoring
courts
arose
largely
due
to
an
acute
sense
of
the
limits
of
conventional
probation
and
other
non
carceral
forms
of
criminal
supervision
although
probation
is
by
far
the
most
common
criminal
sanction
in
the
united
states
n
with
caseloads
of
up
to
probationers
per
officer
the
degree
of
supervision
is
frequently
minimal
n
judicial
monitoring
aims
to
improve
supervision
by
transferring
authority
to
judges
to
monitor
defendants
this
transfer
it
is
hoped
will
reduce
recidivism
and
thereby
reduce
incarceration
two
examples
of
specialized
criminal
courts
operating
primarily
on
the
judicial
monitoring
model
are
domestic
violence
courts
and
sex
offense
courts
though
certain
drug
courts
and
other
specialized
criminal
courts
also
function
primarily
as
judicial
monitoring
bodies
intensive
monitoring
of
defendants
in
domestic
violence
cases
aims
to
encourage
greater
compliance
with
protective
orders
and
attendance
of
anger
management
trainings
n
judicial
monitoring
sex
offense
courts
likewise
supervise
defendants
compliance
with
court
mandates
and
mandatory
treatment
n
a
judicial
monitoring
model
as
applied
to
drug
courts
extends
judicial
supervision
over
drug
offenders
in
some
jurisdictions
drug
courts
judicial
monitoring
is
coupled
with
a
therapeutic
jurisprudential
approach
in
other
jurisdictions
it
is
not
n
although
judicial
monitoring
relies
in
part
on
technological
devices
to
facilitate
monitoring
the
judicial
role
shifts
in
these
courts
in
ways
that
pose
considerable
risks
of
judicial
overreaching
expanded
surveillance
and
increased
incarceration
for
technical
violations
due
to
the
large
numbers
of
criminal
cases
disposed
of
with
probationary
sentences
and
the
tremendous
capacity
of
the
defense
computer
and
electronic
industries
there
is
an
extensive
market
for
electronic
monitoring
voice
verification
systems
and
inexpensive
on
site
drug
testing
on
which
monitoring
may
rely
n
but
the
central
feature
of
judicial
monitoring
as
opposed
to
probation
or
parole
is
that
the
judge
plays
an
active
role
in
overseeing
surveillance
of
defendants
and
once
a
judge
becomes
the
monitor
of
defendants
compliance
with
court
orders
the
judge
s
role
changes
from
one
of
at
least
in
principle
adjudicative
neutrality
to
more
active
investigative
supervision
on
behalf
of
the
state
simultaneously
a
judicial
monitoring
model
threatens
to
expand
rather
than
reduce
levels
of
criminal
supervision
and
at
least
short
term
incarceration
because
more
intensive
supervision
increases
the
likelihood
of
identifying
technical
violations
which
increases
the
likelihood
of
short
term
incarceration
this
increased
likelihood
is
true
particularly
because
in
many
judicial
monitoring
courts
incarceration
is
the
default
penalty
for
technical
violations
that
do
not
even
rise
to
the
level
of
criminally
chargeable
misconduct
n
one
particularly
striking
example
of
the
judicial
role
transformation
and
expanded
criminal
surveillance
associated
with
the
judicial
monitoring
model
can
be
found
in
the
ethnographic
work
of
sociologist
james
nolan
who
undertook
several
multi
year
studies
of
drug
courts
and
other
specialized
criminal
courts
as
related
in
this
article
s
introduction
in
judge
mckinney
s
syracuse
new
york
drug
court
nolan
found
that
judicial
monitoring
empowered
the
judge
to
delegate
reporting
authority
to
the
defendant
s
employer
to
whom
judge
mckinney
promised
a
deal
y
ou
take
the
defendant
back
and
i
ll
add
another
weapon
to
your
arsenal
if
he
doesn
t
come
to
work
when
he
is
supposed
to
doesn
t
come
to
work
on
time
i
ll
put
him
in
jail
on
your
say
so
n
invasive
judicial
monitoring
of
this
sort
may
result
in
part
from
the
court
s
understanding
of
itself
as
engaged
purely
in
deterrent
conduct
shaping
monitoring
rather
than
punishment
as
on
the
therapeutic
jurisprudence
model
which
is
ostensibly
solely
rehabilitative
in
its
focus
on
the
judicial
monitoring
model
specialized
criminal
courts
seek
to
purify
their
approach
to
a
solely
deterrence
based
framework
but
as
with
the
neo
rehabilitative
approach
of
the
therapeutic
jurisprudence
model
the
judicial
monitoring
model
is
unconstrained
by
concerns
of
proportionality
and
operates
without
self
consciousness
of
its
potentially
punitive
and
overreaching
rather
than
purely
deterrent
effects
also
because
the
judicial
monitoring
model
treats
the
unconstrained
authority
of
the
judge
to
solve
problems
as
central
to
its
mission
it
is
no
solution
simply
to
constrain
sanctions
for
technical
violations
to
those
that
would
have
been
available
had
the
defendant
gone
through
the
conventional
process
or
to
those
that
would
otherwise
be
proportional
to
particular
sorts
of
violations
further
because
a
judicial
monitoring
model
is
frequently
dominant
in
specialized
courts
where
retributive
responses
are
likely
to
be
triggered
such
as
domestic
violence
and
sex
offense
courts
the
threat
of
punitive
judicial
overreaching
in
carrying
out
purportedly
purely
deterrent
monitoring
is
of
special
concern
n
in
other
words
whereas
the
therapeutic
approach
tends
to
dominate
in
courts
addressing
more
sympathetic
cases
those
involving
drug
addicts
veterans
or
the
mentally
ill
the
punitive
excesses
of
judicial
monitoring
threaten
to
surface
with
particular
force
given
that
the
model
plays
a
central
role
in
courts
with
less
conventionally
sympathetically
received
defendants
there
is
even
a
risk
that
the
monitoring
courts
will
become
partially
insulated
from
conventional
adversarial
advocacy
because
they
are
specialized
anti
formalist
team
oriented
courts
and
judicial
monitoring
will
serve
as
a
vehicle
for
enhanced
punitiveness
for
unpopular
classes
of
defendants
those
charged
with
domestic
violence
or
sex
offenses
for
example
in
addition
to
the
liberty
infringing
risks
posed
by
courts
operating
on
a
judicial
monitoring
model
there
remain
fundamental
questions
about
the
ability
of
such
courts
to
reduce
recidivism
and
achieve
other
desired
ends
n
part
of
the
motivation
for
court
specialization
is
that
judges
in
a
specialized
judicial
monitoring
court
may
become
experts
with
regard
to
the
particular
offense
at
issue
n
but
problems
arise
when
judges
believe
they
possess
special
expertise
about
a
single
best
approach
to
monitoring
an
issue
when
in
fact
there
is
profound
uncertainty
as
to
how
best
to
handle
such
matters
for
example
there
is
preliminary
empirical
evidence
that
a
judicial
monitoring
approach
is
less
effective
than
might
be
anticipated
in
reducing
recidivism
in
domestic
violence
cases
a
study
of
the
bronx
misdemeanor
domestic
violence
court
tracked
randomly
assigned
groups
of
offenders
who
received
varying
combinations
of
judicial
monitoring
and
batterer
s
intervention
n
the
differential
rates
of
recidivism
of
violent
conduct
among
the
groups
including
those
who
received
no
judicial
monitoring
or
other
intervention
were
not
statistically
significant
n
this
result
suggests
that
the
routine
judicial
monitoring
interventions
of
the
domestic
violence
court
batterer
s
intervention
and
court
monitoring
may
have
limited
success
in
reducing
the
incidence
of
domestic
violence
n
so
while
in
at
least
one
jurisdiction
domestic
violence
recidivism
remained
unchanged
substantial
resources
were
devoted
to
a
judicial
monitoring
regime
that
threatens
to
significantly
transform
the
role
of
the
judge
with
other
uncertain
and
potentially
undesirable
effects
n
what
is
more
in
the
reentry
context
at
least
a
judicial
monitoring
model
has
been
associated
with
substantial
increases
in
reincarceration
for
technical
violations
a
study
of
the
harlem
parole
reentry
court
s
initial
judicial
monitoring
program
found
that
t
echnical
revocations
occurred
more
frequently
for
reentry
court
participants
than
comparison
parolees
for
all
three
years
of
the
study
an
effect
the
court
s
researchers
ascribe
to
a
supervision
effect
n
that
is
increased
discovery
of
punishable
violations
produced
by
increased
supervision
thus
the
harlem
parole
reentry
court
study
reflects
that
a
judicial
monitoring
approach
threatens
to
increase
incarceration
for
technical
violations
such
as
missed
curfews
or
other
failures
to
conform
with
the
court
s
monitoring
orders
n
these
findings
are
consistent
with
the
best
available
evidence
regarding
intensive
supervision
programs
isp
during
an
earlier
period
of
experimentation
with
intensive
criminal
surveillance
monitoring
aimed
at
deterrence
when
uncoupled
from
a
substantial
rehabilitative
component
tends
strongly
to
expand
incarceration
with
little
in
the
way
of
countervailing
benefits
according
to
stanford
criminologist
joan
petersilia
who
is
among
the
country
s
leading
experts
on
intermediate
sanctions
the
e
mpirical
evidence
regarding
intermediate
sanctions
is
decisive
without
a
rehabilitation
component
reductions
in
recidivism
are
elusive
in
sum
programs
were
seldom
used
for
prison
diversion
but
rather
to
increase
accountability
and
supervision
of
serious
offenders
on
probation
in
addition
programs
did
not
reduce
new
crimes
but
instead
increased
the
discovery
of
technical
violations
and
ultimately
increased
incarceration
rates
and
system
costs
n
the
ineffectiveness
of
judicial
monitoring
may
be
further
aggravated
if
judicial
monitoring
negatively
influences
defendants
perceptions
of
legitimacy
of
the
courts
diminished
perceptions
of
procedural
fairness
on
the
part
of
defendants
in
judicial
monitoring
courts
may
actually
undermine
compliance
with
court
orders
by
fostering
resentment
and
exacerbating
recidivism
n
so
as
with
the
therapeutic
jurisprudence
model
on
the
judicial
monitoring
model
the
role
of
the
judge
expands
potentially
dramatically
beyond
its
traditional
bounds
surveillance
increases
procedural
protections
are
curtailed
to
enable
judicial
monitoring
and
there
is
no
overriding
commitment
to
avoid
incarceration
in
the
instance
of
discovery
of
technical
violations
as
a
consequence
increased
periods
of
at
least
short
term
incarceration
threaten
to
follow
even
if
only
as
a
product
of
technical
violations
and
the
reach
of
the
criminal
law
threatens
to
radically
expand
n
monitoring
that
is
not
merely
extending
surveillance
for
its
own
sake
must
attend
to
what
forms
of
surveillance
actually
promote
socially
desirable
outcomes
by
eliminating
crime
and
reducing
incarceration
this
is
in
significant
part
the
ambition
of
a
decarceration
model
to
which
we
will
turn
after
exploring
the
order
maintenance
model
the
final
criminal
law
reformist
model
commonly
at
work
in
specialized
criminal
courts
c
order
maintenance
model
the
third
widely
occurring
criminal
law
reformist
model
operative
in
specialized
criminal
courts
seeks
to
advance
order
maintenance
by
convening
local
tribunals
devoted
to
prosecutions
of
relatively
minor
quality
of
life
crimes
although
the
general
goal
of
specialized
criminal
courts
was
to
address
the
impacted
and
poor
quality
of
conventional
criminal
law
administration
by
shifting
cases
out
of
conventional
courts
into
specialized
courts
in
the
view
of
some
advocates
in
many
cases
the
current
system
works
just
fine
such
as
in
handling
murders
rapes
and
robberies
they
believed
that
alternatives
for
prosecution
of
more
serious
offenses
would
be
inappropriate
n
consequently
efforts
focused
on
minor
crimes
prostitution
low
level
drug
possession
and
disorderly
conduct
that
conventional
criminal
courts
were
otherwise
inclined
to
ignore
n
the
theoretical
framework
underlying
the
order
maintenance
model
is
largely
derived
from
the
broken
windows
approach
to
policing
the
broken
windows
or
order
maintenance
hypothesis
maintains
that
minor
physical
and
social
disorder
turnstile
jumping
marijuana
use
public
drinking
if
not
addressed
contributes
to
more
serious
crime
n
a
specialized
order
maintenance
criminal
court
responds
to
public
order
violations
by
initially
assigning
intermediate
sanctions
such
as
community
service
it
is
hoped
that
imposition
of
these
sanctions
in
turn
will
improve
perceptions
of
the
law
s
legitimacy
and
hence
social
order
the
theory
as
applied
to
specialized
criminal
courts
holds
that
as
a
consequence
of
prosecuting
public
order
offenses
crime
overall
will
decline
and
with
it
more
general
reliance
on
criminal
arrests
and
incarceration
n
along
these
lines
community
courts
the
quintessential
order
maintenance
courts
aim
to
improve
social
order
by
providing
a
venue
for
the
prosecution
of
relatively
minor
quality
of
life
offenses
occurring
in
a
delimited
geographic
area
n
incarceration
is
imposed
only
if
a
defendant
is
noncompliant
with
intermediate
sanctions
or
if
his
offense
is
relatively
serious
generally
misdemeanor
defendants
are
able
to
opt
in
to
courts
operating
on
an
order
maintenance
model
rather
than
being
mandatorily
assigned
n
in
addition
to
community
courts
other
specialized
criminal
courts
may
also
operate
on
an
order
maintenance
model
for
example
drug
courts
operating
on
an
order
maintenance
approach
provide
a
local
forum
for
prosecuting
lower
level
drug
offenses
that
would
otherwise
receive
minimal
attention
in
conventional
criminal
courts
there
are
three
supposed
advantages
to
an
order
maintenance
model
of
specialized
criminal
court
administration
all
of
which
fail
to
withstand
close
scrutiny
first
proponents
suggest
that
these
courts
will
increase
potential
offenders
perceptions
of
the
criminal
law
s
legitimacy
and
hence
will
increase
law
abiding
behavior
overall
n
this
is
thought
to
be
the
case
because
the
courts
assign
presumably
more
meaningful
non
carceral
sanctions
n
but
order
maintenance
courts
are
often
perceived
as
harsher
and
less
legitimate
than
conventional
courts
in
their
response
to
public
order
violations
community
courts
are
less
inclined
to
dismiss
cases
with
time
served
sentences
and
where
jail
time
is
imposed
it
is
for
longer
periods
n
further
community
service
sentences
will
not
necessarily
be
perceived
as
more
legitimate
than
jail
sentences
one
sex
worker
sentenced
at
the
midtown
community
court
explained
community
service
is
all
day
cleaning
toilets
and
stuffing
envelopes
n
rather
than
improving
perceptions
of
legitimacy
routine
reliance
on
community
service
of
this
sort
as
a
sanction
may
reduce
opportunities
for
paid
work
in
a
jurisdiction
and
cause
further
economic
hardship
for
defendants
the
onerous
requirements
of
unpaid
community
service
work
coupled
with
associated
fines
may
even
increase
pressures
to
participate
in
criminalized
markets
a
second
purported
advantage
of
an
order
maintenance
model
is
that
it
will
reduce
reliance
on
conventional
carceral
sentencing
instead
introducing
more
effective
and
beneficial
intermediate
sanctions
like
community
service
but
when
defendants
fail
to
comply
with
intermediate
sanctions
they
are
often
punished
with
at
least
short
term
incarceration
indeed
empirical
analyses
establish
that
increased
short
term
incarceration
is
the
unintended
outcome
of
at
least
some
courts
operating
on
an
order
maintenance
model
n
additionally
in
a
manner
distinct
from
that
of
therapeutic
courts
order
maintenance
courts
widen
the
net
of
infractions
addressed
by
criminal
courts
because
they
focus
primarily
on
low
level
misdemeanor
offenses
which
otherwise
would
receive
less
attention
disorderly
conduct
prosecutions
are
commonplace
in
order
maintenance
courts
for
pedicab
drivers
obstruction
of
crosswalks
or
unlicensed
vending
of
t
shirts
or
otherwise
licit
goods
n
this
net
widening
tendency
is
consistent
with
the
findings
of
professors
michael
tonry
and
norval
morris
who
demonstrated
in
their
famous
study
of
intermediate
sanctions
that
w
hen
an
intermediate
choice
is
offered
it
will
tend
to
be
filled
more
by
those
previously
treated
more
leniently
than
by
those
previously
treated
more
severely
n
this
is
not
to
suggest
that
intermediate
sanctions
are
never
appropriate
but
rather
that
there
is
a
risk
of
net
widening
where
such
sanctions
are
made
available
and
order
maintenance
courts
stand
to
considerably
expand
the
class
of
offenses
subject
to
criminal
prosecution
by
emphasizing
offenses
that
would
otherwise
be
unlikely
targets
for
prosecution
as
a
result
of
this
net
widening
tendency
an
order
maintenance
model
threatens
to
expand
criminal
supervision
and
increase
short
term
incarceration
when
individuals
are
unable
to
comply
with
intermediate
sanctions
whether
other
beneficial
effects
on
local
neighborhoods
follow
from
this
net
widening
criminal
law
enforcement
remains
uncertain
according
to
portland
s
district
attorney
mike
schrunk
a
proponent
of
portland
s
order
maintenance
specialized
criminal
court
as
a
prosecutor
y
ou
tend
to
blow
off
turnstile
jumping
or
petty
shoplifting
because
they
are
not
as
important
as
rape
and
robbery
n
yet
schrunk
justifies
emphasis
on
these
minor
offenses
in
order
maintenance
courts
on
the
grounds
that
what
really
drives
people
out
of
a
neighborhood
or
makes
a
neighborhood
rot
from
the
inner
core
is
the
small
petty
stuff
n
but
it
is
not
entirely
clear
why
turnstile
jumping
unless
absolutely
pervasive
and
reckless
would
undermine
the
quality
of
life
in
a
particular
neighborhood
although
petty
shoplifting
is
perhaps
more
harmful
to
local
businesses
it
is
not
apparent
why
such
offenses
must
be
prosecutorial
priorities
in
order
to
obtain
a
satisfactory
level
of
respect
for
private
property
in
targeted
neighborhoods
for
instance
local
business
organizations
could
instead
encourage
store
owners
to
adopt
store
policies
that
render
goods
less
readily
subject
to
theft
in
fact
the
available
evidence
indicates
that
police
arrest
less
than
one
percent
of
all
shoplifters
n
shoplifters
are
most
likely
to
steal
products
such
as
clothing
cds
and
dvds
which
are
concealable
removable
available
valuable
enjoyable
and
disposable
n
placing
unremovable
security
tags
on
these
products
and
or
storing
them
in
locked
shelving
units
along
with
other
store
design
and
stock
control
measures
substantially
reduce
the
opportunity
to
shoplift
n
for
these
reasons
store
owners
and
the
public
at
large
would
likely
be
better
served
by
adopting
environmental
and
business
practices
that
reduce
the
incidence
of
shoplifting
rather
than
investing
large
sums
of
public
resources
in
prosecuting
some
small
percentage
of
these
offenses
that
are
so
minor
as
to
otherwise
command
little
prosecutorial
attention
in
specialized
order
maintenance
courts
of
course
this
alternative
approach
transfers
the
costs
of
addressing
petty
crime
in
part
from
tax
payers
to
business
owners
but
the
business
costs
of
merchandising
and
related
policies
are
not
prohibitive
and
there
is
strong
reason
to
believe
they
would
prove
both
more
effective
and
less
costly
overall
n
what
s
more
although
there
may
be
positive
effects
associated
with
devoting
attention
to
disruptive
conduct
that
residents
of
affected
areas
care
about
for
instance
the
prevalence
of
street
prostitution
may
cause
more
sexual
harassment
of
all
women
and
girls
there
are
also
significant
potential
negative
systemic
consequences
generated
by
bringing
more
people
under
criminal
supervision
than
would
otherwise
occur
in
particular
net

cause

to
become
further
impacted
in
denver
colorado
for
example
the
number
of

filed
in
the
denver

grew
radically
after
the
introduction
of
a
drug
court
program
dedicated
to
prosecuting
low
level

offenses
effectively
an
order

for

abandoned

a
final
benefit
noted
by
supporters
of
an

and
of
community

in

involves
the

revival
of
local
democratic
participation

democracy
is
not
an
unqualified
good
for
criminal

indeed
democratic
processes
have
often
resulted
in
later
regretted
criminal

and
policy
outcomes
democratic
excesses
could
in
principle
be
restrained
by
confining
community
participation
to
discrete
localities
in
which
the
members
would
themselves
internalize
the
costs
of
favored
policies
n
the
local
democratic
potential
of
community

is
thought
to
derive
from
the
involvement
of
community

in
setting
the
courts
priorities
the
local
access
to
community
court
judges
and
more
general
increased
accessibility
and
transparency
of
the

yet
the
actual
democratic
potential
of
order
maintenance
community
courts
is
unclear
given
that
as
multiple
studies
indicate
only
a
small
number
of
often
relatively
wealthy
or
unusually
vocal
individuals
participate
actively
in
community
court
programs
n
in
fact
there
is
some
evidence
that
these
courts
may
serve
to
advance
the
interests
of
a
moneyed
minority
interest
group
in
furthering
gentrification
to
improve
property
values
n
and
while
gentrification
may
be
a
positive
force
in
these
neighborhoods
engendering
improved
neighborhood
quality
of
life
and
increasing
property
values
it
is
nonetheless
questionable
whether
associated
court
reform
desirably
reconstitutes
local
democratic
practices
in
criminal
law
administration
control
of
a
local
criminal
law
enforcement
agenda
by
a
few
relatively
powerful
outspoken
community
members
hardly
represents
a
robust
form
of
local
democratization
of
criminal
law
whatever
may
or
may
not
be
the
other
advantages
of
gentrification
n
in
summary
the
criminal
law
reformist
benefits
ascribed
to
an
order
maintenance
model
are
uncertain
and
this
approach
poses
a
significant
risk
of
generating
otherwise
harmful
consequences
d
decarceration
model
a
decarceration
model
is
committed
foremost
to
reducing
reliance
on
incarceration
and
to
a
sociologically
and
empirically
informed
framework
that
links
court
participants
to
local
social
services
and
other
institutions
shifting
the
management
of
socially
disruptive
conduct
in
part
from
criminal
courts
to
other
sectors
the
ultimate
aim
of
a
decarceration
model
as
applied
to
specialized
criminal
courts
is
to
isolate
those
crimes
for
which
conventional
criminal
law
administration
may
be
most
fitting
contributing
gradually
to
the
de
facto
decriminalization
of
certain
categories
of
conduct
and
enabling
alternative
non
carceral
regulatory
approaches
to
a
range
of
social
ills
where
criminalization
remains
appropriate
the
basic
premise
underlying
a
decarceration
model
in
the
specialized
courts
context
is
that
overcriminalization
and
overincarceration
are
in
part
structural
problems
which
specialized
criminal
courts
may
begin
to
address
because
a
decarceration
model
aims
to
reduce
reliance
on
incarceration
while
achieving
other
social
goals
the
model
endeavors
to
respond
to
the
forces
that
led
incarceration
rates
to
rise
so
precipitously
in
the
first
instance
and
that
cause
them
to
remain
so
high
the
explanations
for
large
scale
incarceration
are
various
but
there
is
general
agreement
that
criminal
law
and
policy
contributed
significantly
to
the
growth
in
incarceration
n
expanded
sentences
for
drug
convictions
perpetuated
a
significant
portion
of
the
increase
in
state
prisoners
beginning
in
the
late
s
and
subsequently
much
of
that
growth
has
been
attributable
to
increased
penalties
for
violent
crimes
predominantly
robbery
and
assaults
and
public
order
offenses
n
as
a
result
criminal
law
and
policy
changes
stand
to
contribute
substantially
to
decarceration
but
one
single
policy
intervention
will
be
insufficient
to
bring
about
any
extensive
decrease
in
imprisonment
instead
the
scholarly
consensus
suggests
that
prison
commitments
must
be
reduced
and
prison
release
increased
and
return
to
prison
after
parole
failure
decreased
n
obstacles
to
achieving
these
ends
which
i
will
touch
upon
only
briefly
because
they
are
thoroughly
explored
elsewhere

the
difficulty
of
legislatively
retreating
from
the
pathological
politics
of
overcriminalization
and
overincarceration

the
organizational
cultures
of
police
and
prosecutors

encourage
vigorous
enforcement
of
existing

a
decarceration
model
may
function
to
circumvent
and
begin
to
reshape
some
of
these
barriers
courts
operating
predominately
on
a
decarceration
model
circumvent
some
of
the
legislative
impediments
to
changing
substantive
criminal
law
by
working
cooperatively
with
prosecutors
police
defense
counsel
and
elected
officials
at
the
local
level
to
shift
cases
out
of
the
conventional
criminal
courts
without
requiring
legislative
repeal
of
particular
criminal
statutes
these
courts
provide
a
venue
for
suspending
or
dropping
criminal
charges
in
drug
cases
a
range
of
misdemeanor
cases
and
in
some
instances
even
in
cases
involving
more
serious
felony
charges
as
well
as
in
a
range
of
matters
involving
mentally
ill
offenders
and
veterans
a
decarceration
approach
seeks
to
locate
alternative
fora
for
responding
to
these
matters
and
then
when
the
courts
have
obtained
a
certain
measure
of
broad
based
support
legislators
are
able
to
enact
statutes
that
legitimize
and
institutionalize
the
decarceration
regime
this
method
has
proven
to
be
more
politically
viable
than
seeking
directly
to
decriminalize
particular
conduct
and
alternative
diversionary
court
approaches
have
garnered
considerable
public
support
n
in
their
day
to
day
operations
on
a
decarceration
model

act
as
diversionary
clearinghouses
for

resources

of

defendants
to
those
resources

ensure
that
incarceration
is
actually
reduced
and
to
ascertain
the
effect
of
various
alternative
sanctions
and
services
on
participants
and
other
relevant
variables
n
at
least
in
some
jurisdictions
courts
adopting
a
decarceration
model
assume
jurisdiction
over
those
charged
with
or
convicted
of
more
serious
felony
offenses
n
this
is
critical
to
reducing
reliance
on
incarceration
and
avoiding
net
widening
because
many
nonviolent
misdemeanor
offenses
are
already
dealt
with
through
non
carceral
sentences
in
the
conventional
courts
n
to
the
extent
courts
adopting
a
decarceration
approach
address
accused
offenders
who
might
otherwise
receive
probationary
sentences
the
diversionary
programming
orders
issued
may
make
it
less
rather
than
more
likely
that
defendants
will
be
subject
to
incarceration
in
the
future
by
facilitating
opportunities
for
law
abiding
livelihoods
the
theoretical
framework
that
informs
the
decarceration
model
focuses
on
deploying
social
structures
separate
from
criminal
law
administrative
components
such
as
local
neighborhood
networks
business
organizations
and
mental
health
public
health
job
training
and
other
social
services
to
reduce
criminal
offending
and
to
foster
socially
constructive
citizenship
behaviors
the
foundational
idea
is
that
social
institutions
outside
the
criminal
law
context
are
critical
to
the
maintenance
of
social
order
and
to
organizing
informal
surveillance
correspondingly
a
shift
away
from
current
carceral
practices
will
be
enabled
by
bolstering
opportunities
for
social
integration
and
institutional
involvement
particularly
for
those
persons
with
otherwise
limited
access
to
such
conventional
social
institutions
n
there
is
wide
ranging
empirical
and
theoretical
support
for
this
structural
approach
one
interesting
early
contribution
comes
from
the
work
of
sheldon
and
eleanor
glueck
married
co
authors
employed
at
harvard
law
school
from
the
late
s
to
the
s
who
conducted
a
seminal
study
of
the
lives
of
boston
juvenile
delinquents
n
the
gluecks
found
that
although
most
of
the
cohort
ceased
committing
crime
after
turning
twenty
five
a
small
minority
persisted
in
criminal
involvement
decades
later
harvard
sociologist
robert
sampson
and
criminologist
john
laub
reexamined
the
gluecks
data
to
determine
if
there
were
any
criteria
distinguishable
from
the
early
lives
and
criminal
offending
of
those
men
who
went
on
to
become
persistently
criminally
involved
over
the
course
of
their
lives
n
sampson
and
laub
could
not
identify
any
factors
present
during
childhood
or
adolescence
that
differentiated
those
young
men
who
would
pose
a
continuing
menace
and
those
who
would
desist
from
criminal
activity
following
adolescence
n
there
were
however
turning
points
in
the
men
s
lives
obtaining
and
maintaining
employment
and
establishing
contacts
with
conventional
institutions
and
groups
that
distinguished
those
who
continued
to
commit
crime
from
those
that
did
not
n
further
men
who
had
been
incarcerated
in
prison
were
substantially
more
likely
to
continue
to
offend
than
men
who
served
only
local
jail
time
or
probation
n
these
factors
rather
than
personality
characteristics
early
offense
characteristics
childhood
experiences
or
other
factors
appeared
to
differentiate
the
perpetual
offenders
from
those
that
went
on
to
lead
relatively
law
abiding
lives
n
additional
support
for
the
hypothesis
that
social
engagement
and
institutional
involvement
or
group
level
effects
cause
reduced
criminal
offending
derives
from
a
significant
body
of
further
studies
linking
structural
context
and
the
prevalence
of
effective
social
organizations
with
decreased
interpersonal
violence
and
neighborhood
disorder
n
as
important
this
theory
accords
with
known
social
facts
about
the
world
social
institutions
employers
community
organizations
families
convey
social
expectations
and
informally
surveil
those
who
participate
in
them
in
a
neighborhood
where
these
institutions
are
functioning
effectively
people
tend
to
be
discouraged
and
inhibited
from
engaging
in
criminalized
pursuits
and
they
will
tend
to
have
access
to
social
supports
in
the
event
they
find
themselves
struggling
with
addiction
or
other
personal
challenges
n
nevertheless
it
is
important
to
acknowledge
that
social
institutional
engagement
will
not
serve
to
dissuade
all
persons
from
criminal
conduct
and
some
conventional
social
institutions
may
even
be
criminogenic
n
indeed
employed
persons
operating
in
firmly
established
institutional
contexts
perpetrate
fraud
embezzle
funds
and
harm
others
n
but
conventional
institutional
engagement
provides
some
significant
constraint
on
particular
sorts
of
criminal
offending
and
lacks
the
criminogenic
and
other
harmful
characteristics
associated
with
prison
or
jail
on
a
decarceration
model
then
given
the
severe
harms
associated
with
large
scale
incarceration
and
the
compelling
evidence
that
social
institutional
engagement
may
address
certain
commonly
criminally
prosecuted
forms
of
socially
disruptive
conduct
more
effectively
than
incarceration
non
carceral
sentencing
is
preferred
the
only
circumstances
under
which
a
carceral
sentence
would
be
imposed
in
a
specialized
criminal
court
adopting
a
pure
decarceration
model
would
be
where
there
is
substantial
reason
to
believe
incarceration
is
necessary
to
protect
public
safety
or
is
otherwise
necessary
in
the
interests
of
justice
and
to
the
extent
there
is
doubt
as
to
this
determination
on
a
pure
decarceration
model
that
doubt
would
be
resolved
in
favor
of
non
carceral
sentencing
unless
and
until
incarceration
becomes
necessary
n
in
such
instances
for
example
in
cases
of
serious
violent
crime
where
the
defendant
is
adjudged
mentally
well
and
that
individual
s
prior
record
and
most
recent
criminal
conduct
suggests
a
serious
ongoing
risk
to
public
safety
it
is
unlikely
a
defendant
would
be
referred
to
a
specialized
diversionary
court
in
the
first
place
were
that
to
occur
however
the
case
would
be
referred
back
to
the
conventional
court
though
these
determinations
are
inevitably
complicated
and
involve
assessment
of
uncertain
risks
serious
violent
and
dangerous
defendants
who
would
continue
to
pose
a
grave
threat
even
if
subject
to
an
alternative
socially
integrative
sentencing
regime
of
mental
health
treatment
job
placement
and
social
service
reporting
are
a
substantially
smaller
demographic
than
that
of
the
current
population
incarcerated
in
the
united
states
n
a
decarceration
model
of
specialized
criminal
law
administration
operates
with
reference
to
this
framework
seeking
to
facilitate
greater
non
carceral
social
institutional
integration
of
persons
accused
of
an
array
of
criminal
offenses
but
apart
from
this
commitment
to
attempting
to
reduce
criminal
involvement
by
improving
access
to
other
social
institutions
a
decarceration
model
is
untethered
from
any
highly
specified
jurisprudential
or
institutional
content
its
sole
unifying
feature
is
that
of
closely
empirically
monitored
experimentation
with
criminal
law
administrative
alternatives
so
as
to
reduce
reliance
on
incarceration
consistent
with
maintenance
of
public
safety
and
to
forge
a
more
sociologically
and
empirically
oriented
criminal
justice
framework
courts
adopting
a
pure
decarceration
approach
would
reject
the
court
based
therapeutic
methods
of
certain
specialized
criminal
courts
and
the
commitment
to
judicial
monitoring
as
a
scalable
manner
of
deterring
criminal
conduct
a
focus
on
order
maintenance
is
abandoned
too
on
a
decarceration
model
along
with
the
associated
commitment
to
broken
windows
policing
the
purpose
of
a
decarceration
approach
more
conducive
to
adoption
by
conventional
courts
than
reformist
approaches
that
entail
providing
therapy
in
a
courtroom
context
or
transforming
judges
into
probation
officers
though
certainly
not
typical
of
traditionally
conceived
courts
is
to
oversee
the
adequate
provision
of
services
to
the
class
of
defendants
referred
to
those
services
and
appearing
before
the
diversionary
courts
predominately
by
monitoring
the
service
providers
this
is
a
role
somewhat
familiar
to
courts
from
the
structural
reform
litigation
context
n
critically
courts
adopting
a
decarceration
model
are
experimentalist
institutions
that
are
open
to
revision
in
light
of
ongoing
empirical
feedback
they
are
unfinished
self
correcting
reformist
organizations
the
aspiration
of
a
decarceration
model
of
specialized
criminal
law
administration
is
to
bring
about
criminal
law
reform
incrementally
revising
policies
in
response
to
input
from
defendants
judges
prosecutors
public
defenders
and
empirical
monitoring
entities
n
in
this
sense
a
decarceration
model
is
decidedly
unfinished
promising
gradual
reform
rather
than
a
bold
new
program
fully
specified
in
advance
n
a
further
advantage
of
a
decarceration
model
is
that
it
works
to
reduce
reliance
on
incarceration
while
closely
attending
to
the
particular
needs
and
risks
associated
with
specific
populations
of
defendants
the
hope
is
that
this
will
free
up
resources
currently
allocated
to
criminal
law
administration
and
make
them
available
for
other
sectors
better
suited
to
addressing
the
relevant
underlying
problems
this
may
help
to
negotiate
if
not
to
entirely
avoid
the
decarceration
trap
that
professors
robert
weisberg
and
joan
petersilia
have
cautioned
against
the
grave
risk
of
backfire
if
advocates
attempt
to
reduce
mass
incarceration
simply
for
the
sake
of
reduction
rather
than
coupling
advocacy
with
a
full
consideration
of
the
causes
of
recidivism
n
because
as
weisberg
and
petersilia
warn
even
if
small
increases
in
crime
by
released
prisoners
are
not
statistically
meaningful
they
may
reignite
the
political
demagoguery
that
contributed
to
mass
incarceration
in
the
first
place
n
a
decarceration
model
functions
in
an
incrementalist
fashion
to
reduce
reliance
on
incarceration
by
experimenting
with
alternatives
closely
tailored
to
the
needs
of
populations
currently
subject
to
criminal
supervision
while
attending
to
the
causes
of
recidivism
and
creating
a
record
of
demonstrated
positive
results
a
decarceration
model
also
promises
to
attend
to
the
risk
of
transinstitutionalization
which
professor
bernard
harcourt
has
identified
with
regard
to
mentally
ill
incarcerated
persons
n
transinstitutionalization
refers
to
the
disastrous
experience
encountered
during
the
earlier
attempt
to
deinstitutionalize
persons
living
in
mental
hospitals
without
accounting
in
any
meaningful
way
for
their
integration
elsewhere
following
the
deinstitutionalization
of
hospitals
for
the
mentally
ill
in
the
s
and
s
many
persons
released
from
mental
institutions
either
became
homeless
or
were
later
reinstitutionalized
in
prisons
and
jails
n
a
decarceration
model
works
to
avoid
this
outcome
of

that
in

to
sectors
outside

a
decarceration
approach
should
be
understood
as
a

for

as

to
the
problems
of

and
overincarceration
rather
the
decarceration
model
s
more
modest
goal
is
to
shift
the
management
of
social
disorder
where
possible
from
criminal

probation
or
parole

to
a
range
of
other

violent
and
otherwise
criminal
conduct
will
continue
to
intrude
upon
people
s

and
conventional
criminal
law

will
play
a
role
however

in
responding
to
that

to
minimize

where
they
seem
most
plainly
called
for

to

to
the

by
enlisting
other
social

the
basis
for

in

although
many
mental

mental

courts
operating
on
a
decarceration
model
seek
to
remove
mentally
ill
individuals
from
conventional
criminal
processing
to
a
forum
where
the
focus
is
on
addressing
holistically
relevant
needs
so
as
to
prevent
subsequent
criminal
offending
there
is
tremendous
potential
to
accomplish
significant
decarceration
by
addressing
mentally
ill
individuals
socially
disruptive
conduct
outside
the
context
of
conventional
criminal
law
administration
roughly
mentally

people
are
incarcerated
in
prisons
and

in
the
united
states
n
among
the
most
common
mental
illnesses
u

prisoners
suffer
are
schizophrenia
and
bipolar
disorder
both
of
which
are
amenable
in
many
cases
to
effective
psychiatric
intervention
n
for
the
mentally
ill
incarceration
is
frequently
brutal
and
devastating
and

of

n
the
service

need
to

to
develop

and

is
used
only
as
a
last
resort
when
all

lenient
policies
relating
to
noncompliance
have
failed
n
there
is
evidence
that
diversionary
mental

courts
may
reduce
reliance
on
incarceration
in
managing
mentally
ill
persons
reduce
reliance
on
in

n
veterans

operating
on
a
decarceration
model
would
similarly
obtain
local
cooperation
to
manage
the
cases
of
referred
veterans
through
non

sentencing
such
as
through
referral
to
veterans
affairs
programs
as
in
the
case
of
eifert
recounted
in
this
article
s
introduction
n
if
community
courts
are
to
function
on
a
decarceration
model
they
would
need
to
limit
their
jurisdiction
to
matters
in
which
defendants
would
otherwise
likely
be
subject
to
incarceration
n
drug
courts
may
function
on
a
decarceration
model
accomplishing
some
measure
of
de
facto
decriminalization
by
sentencing
drug
involved
defendants
to
treatment
and
non

or

limited
probation
when
state
legislatures
pass
drug
court
acts
or
related
legislation
authorizing
this
non
carceral
drug
court
approach
the
effect
is
to
bypass
political
barriers
to
more
explicit
decriminalization
and
to
lend
democratic
legitimacy
to
drug
courts
efforts
n
reentry
courts
may
also
operate
on
a
decarceration
model
parole
or
probation
violators
constitute
approximately
of
people
admitted
to
state
prison
and
about
half
of
these
individuals
are
re
incarcerated
for
technical
violations
n
reentry
courts
may
facilitate
access
to
social
services
and
employment
and
rely
on
those
referral
sources
for
notification
of
extremely
concerning
noncompliance
but
otherwise
sharply
limit
reincarceration
for
technical
violations
n
although
most
domestic
violence
courts
function
on
a
judicial
monitoring
model
of
limited
effectiveness
and
with
substantial
associated
rights
eviscerating
risks
domestic
violence
courts
could
shift
to
a
decarceration
model
for
certain
cases
arising
from
relatively
less
serious
and
less
violent
incidents
alternative
sentences
could
still
be
onerous
and
require
among
other
conditions
considerable
financial
support
of
and
physical
separation
from
the
complainant
these
provisions
might
better
serve
the
interests
of
the
complainant
spouse
than
incarceration
for
short
periods
of
a
spouse
who
is
the
primary
source
of
financial
support
for
the
family
n
courts
could
also
work
to
facilitate
services
for
complainants
as
do
many
domestic
violence
courts
currently
particularly
because
the
availability
of
alternative
living
arrangements
employment
opportunities
or
vocational
or
educational
training
may
empower
survivors
of
domestic
violence
to
leave
or
transform
abusive
relationships
and
hence
in
the
long
run
reduce
reoffending
re
arrests
and
reincarceration
sex
offense
courts
are
generally
conceptualized
primarily
on
a
judicial
monitoring
model
but
could
also
shift
to
a
decarceration
model
by
identifying
those
individuals
whose
convictions
are
such
that
carceral
sentencing
seems
unnecessary
for
instance
individuals
convicted
on
the
basis
of
public
urination
certain
other
forms
of
indecent
exposure
or
consensual
sex
with
a
person
not
significantly
younger
than
the
accused
n
in
all
of
these
separate
specialized
criminal
court
contexts
a
decarceration
model
does
not
purport
to
be
capable
of
solving
the
underlying
problems
instead
a
decarceration
model
frees
up
resources
that
might
be
allocated
to
sectors
better
able
to
address
relevant
problems
even
if
the
problems
ultimately
remain
in
some
measure
intractable
at
least
without
further
reaching
intervention
a
decarceration
model
is
minimalist
in
its
mission
as
compared
to
competing
criminal
law
reformist
models
at
least
with
regard
to
the
degree
of
intervention
taking
place
in
the
court
itself
empirical
monitoring
may
establish
the
basis
for
transferring
this
framework
outside
the
specialized
courts
context
facilitating
farther
reaching
transformative
criminal
law
reform
gradually
in
an
incremental
experimentalist
fashion
a
decarceration
model
may
begin
to
reform
criminal
law
more
broadly
by
working
to
address
the
compound
problem
of
the
criminal
law
s
relationship
to
social
order
maintenance
and
the
social
conditions
associated
with
targeted
conduct
moving
the
regulation
of
certain
matters
outside
criminal
law
administration
to
other
sectors
in
summary
the
upshot
of
the
article
s
analysis
to
this
point
is
that
if
specialized
criminal
courts
aim
to
begin
to
reduce
harshness
and
brutality
in
criminal
law
administration
and
to
limit
reliance
on
criminal
supervision
and
incarceration
while
addressing
socially
disruptive
conduct
they
should
organize
themselves
predominantly
on
a
diversionary
minimalist
experimental
sociologically
oriented
decarceration
model
the
therapeutic
judicial
monitoring
and
order
maintenance
models
represent
distinct
criminal
law
reformist
strategies
that
threaten
to
exacerbate
rather
than
unwind
existing
problems
in
criminal
law
administration
because
they
each
possess
inherent
features
that
tend
to
increase
reliance
on
criminal
supervision
and
that
may
even
expand
incarceration
radically
transforming
the
judicial
role
and
diluting
procedural
protections
more
significantly
than
on
a
decarceration
model
without
generating
other
demonstrated
desirable
outcomes
the
following
part
will
explore
in
more
detail
three
criminal

reform
strategies
that
courts
adopting
a
decarceration
model
may
set
in

iii
possibilities
of
a
decarceration
model
much
of
the
reformist
promise
of
a
decarceration
model
lies
in
the
associated
courts
ability
to
begin
to
redirect
criminal
law
administration
more
generally
through
three
primary
strategies
cognitive
reframing
institutional
reinvention
and
systemic
change
the
following
subsections
attend
to
each
of
these
three
strategies
in
turn
a
cognitive
reframing
specialized
criminal
courts
adopting
a
decarceration
model
hold
the
potential
to
reframe
shared
understandings
of
criminalized
conduct
developing
alternative
approaches
to
an
array
of
matters
currently
managed
in
large
part
through
criminal
supervision
and
incarceration
reframing
common
conceptions
of
crime
and
punishment
is
a
critical
component
of
any
decarceration
strategy
because
to
shift
the
management
of
social
order
from
criminal
law
administration
to
other
institutions
will
require
changed
public
understandings
of
when
incarceration
is
called
for
and
what
viable
alternatives
might
entail
before
turning
to
the
mechanisms
by
which
courts
adopting
a
decarceration
model
may
reframe
the
criminal
law
s
response
to
various
forms
of
criminally
charged
conduct
a
brief
detour
into
the
literature
on
framing
is
in
order
framing
is
a
process
explored
widely
in
psychological
n
political
science
n
sociological
n
and
legal
scholarship
n
so
i
will
only
quickly
define
the
dimensions
of
framing
relevant
for
present
purposes
in
short
a
frame
is
a
mental
structure
through
which
we
understand
the
world
and
which
serves
to
organize
perception
n
frames
are
generated
through
interactive
social
processes
n
and
they
shape
how
people
construct
meaning
identify
problems
and
determine
to
resolve
those
problems
often
operating
unconsciously
to
inform
individual
and
collective
decision
making
n
how
a
particular
problem
or
choice
is
framed
significantly
influences
the
way
in
which
people
proceed
to
address
the
situation
n
for
example
a
public
health
framing
of
the
problem
of
drug
use
might
suggest
drug
treatment
as
a
preferred
solution
a
moralistic
framing
of
drug
use
as
an
unethical
failure
of
will
might
suggest
a
criminally
punitive
response
likewise
a
mental
health
framing
of
veterans
or
mentally
ill
persons
antisocial
conduct
might
suggest
a
coordinated
reaction
of
clinical
treatment
and
social
service
provision
whereas
a
framing
of
such
persons
as
dangerous
and
unmanageable
criminals
likely
would
suggest
a
carceral
response
despite
the
powerful
influence
exerted
by
existing
frames
reframing
occurs
routinely
contributing
to
shifting
social
understandings
in
effect
reframing
reorganizes
intuitions
and
understanding
generating
different
frames
often
by
introducing
alternative
ways
of
speaking
about
and
approaching
and
regulating
the
dimension
of
the
world
in
question
n
social
psychologist
john
m
darley
explains
one
way
in
which
intuitions
may
change
as
abstract
reasoning
overrides
less
reflective
judgment
n
cognitive
psychologists
refer
to
this
as
dual
processing
one
process
produced
rapidly
takes
place
non
optionally
the
second
set
of
processes
involves
abstract
reasoning
areas
of
the
brain
and
is
not
always
triggered
into
action
w
hen
this
reasoning
system
is
activated
it
sometimes
overrides
intuitions
n
over
time
cognitive
frames
may
shift
through
the
contestation
embrace
and
repetition
of
competing
frames
in
different
social
and
cultural
contexts
in
the
criminal
law
context
frames
are
routinely
invoked
in
ways
that
shape
how
people
imagine
particular
forms
of
disfavored
conduct
ought
to
be
managed
n
in
a
provocative
article
on
what
he
called
interpretive
construction
in
the
substantive
criminal
law
mark
kelman
revealed
how
certain
frames
shape
whether
the
conduct
of
a
criminally
accused
person
is
understood
as
morally
blameworthy
as
an
appropriate
subject
of
criminal
punishment
or
as
excusable
n
though
kelman
did
not
himself
rely
on
the
conceptual
apparatus
of
cognitive
framing
his
analysis
offered
an
account
of
how
framing
occurs
in
the
context
of
criminal
law
administration
through
the
selection
of
time
frames
narrow
or
broad
and
intentionalist
versus
determinist
interpretations
of
behavior
among
other
interpretive
schemes
n
narrow
versus
broad
time
framing
influences
perceptions
of
the
degree
of
culpability
of
a
defendant
enabling
or
undermining
the
view
of
that
defendant
as
morally
responsible
on
an
intentionalist
account
or
as
significantly
constrained
and
hence
less
responsible
in
some
relevant
respect
a
determinist
interpretation
n
a
decarceration
model
of
specialized
criminal
law
administration
offers
an
alternative
perspective
on
the
necessity
of
incarceration
on
structural
neighbor
hood
level
mechanisms
that
may
inhibit
crime
as
well
as
on
time
framing
moral
responsibility
and
blaming
practices
in
criminal
law
and
it
asserts
these
alternative
frames
in
local
state
and
national
contexts
the
process
by
which
courts
adopting
a
decarceration
model
reframe
understandings
of
particular
categories
of
crime
and
offenders
begins
with
a
dialogue
between
architects
of
specialized
criminal
courts
prosecutors
public
defenders
and
defendants
n
collectively
these
actors
forge
a
different
account
of
the
causes
and
consequences
of
certain
criminal
offenses
for
example
veterans
courts
and
mental
health
courts
have
made
considerable
headway
in
advancing
a
regime
of
treatment
rather
than
incarceration
in
response
to
socially
disruptive
conduct
on
the
part
of
veterans
and
mentally
ill
persons
other
specialized
criminal
courts
have
introduced
with
substantial
success
a
revised
approach
to
drug
offenses
involving
treatment
and
irrevocable
or
rarely
revocable
probation
over
time
this
understanding
is
embraced
at
least
to
some
extent
by
those
who
interact
with
the
specialized
criminal
court
itself
and
by
other
relevant
criminal
law
administrative
actors
police
prosecutors
defense
counsel
and
judges
these
alternative
frames
are
diffused
through
the
court
to
the
various
individuals
that
come
into
contact
with
the
court
eventually
the
reconfigured
framework
may
be
taken
up
by
actors
outside
the
specialized
court
the
publication
and
dissemination
of
empirical
analyses
of

framing
of

at

that
his
case
involved
the
use
of
a

and
threat
of

to

advocated
for

s
admission
and
ultimately
convinced
the

initially
though
the
prosecutor
s
office
was
not
going
to
play
at
all
according
to
eifert
s
counsel
but
eventually
as
eifert
s
lawyer
introduced
a
differently
framed
interpretation
of
the
case
calling
attention
to
the
severity
of
eifert
s
post

and
his
decision
not
to
harm
the
officers
when
as
a
trained
marksman
he
could
have
done
so
the
prosecution
adjusted
its
position
then
the
assistant

had
to
engage
the
police
officers
who
had
been
in
the
woods
that
night
when
eifert
was
firing

the
case
had
been
debated
in

some
arguing
that
eifert
should
receive

and
others
urging
a
more
lenient
response
in

end
the
officers
were
persuaded
to
agree
to
eifert
s

to
the
veterans
court
and
in
public
comment
one
officer
who
stated
he
feared
for
his
life
that
night
concluded
i
don
t
think
any
of
us
would
not

there
s
a
difference
between
somebody
who
s
a

and
someone
who
s
just
in

n
the
line
between
those
two
figures
the
criminal
and
the
person
in
a
perfect
storm
of
things
going
wrong
may
not
in
fact
be
clear
at
all
in
the
vast
majority
of
criminal
cases
but
veterans
courts
reintroduce
a
determinist
frame
a
collectivist
frame
and
a
broader
time
frame
for
a
range
of
conduct
in
ways
that
shift
public
understandings
of
a
significant
group
of
defendants
veterans
and
a
variety
of
criminalized
conduct
ongoing
media
attention
to
specialized
criminal
courts
carries
the
reframed
understandings
in
particular
jurisdictions
such
as
in
okemos
michigan
where
eifert
s
case
unfolded
to
a
broader
national
audience
judges
operating
in
specialized
criminal
courts
understand
that
they
are
engaged
in
a
strategic
undertaking
focused
in
large
part
on
shifting
public
perceptions
about
the
appropriate
scope
of
criminal
law
and
punishment
as
judge
ginger
lerner
wren
of
the
broward
county
mental
health
court
relayed
in
comments
excerpted
in
this
article
s
introduction
we
view
the
mental
health
court
as
a
strategy
to
bring
fairness
to
the
administration
of
justice
for
persons
being
arrested
on
minor
offenses
who
suffer
from
major
mental
disability
n
this
strategy
of
reframing
particular
defendants
and
criminalized
behaviors
as
suited
for
alternative
forms
of
social
response
apart
from
the
criminal
law
is
a
crucial
part
of
the
work
of
a
veterans
or
mental
health
court
and
of
a
decarceration
approach
more
generally
it
is
important
to
note
however
that
this
strategy
is
not
without
important
limits
the
success
of
reframing
and
of
admission
to
the
programs
depends
on
the
zealous
advocacy
of
defense
counsel
and
on
the
openness
of
the
judge
and
prosecutor
while
measures
could
and
perhaps
should
be
taken
to
limit
prosecutorial
discretion
in
the
referral
process
the
cooperation
of
prosecutors
contributes
to
the
reframing
work
in
which
the
court
is
engaged
in
any
case
despite
its
limits
through
this
strategy
specialized
criminal
courts
have
generated
some
significant
reconceptualization
of
how
to
approach
particular
categories
of
offenses
and
offenders
these
changes
generally
begin
with
judges
and
lawyers
working
within
the
courts
chief
judge
jonathan
lippman
of
the
new
york
court
of
appeals
for
instance
has
suggested
that
when
it
comes
to
non
violent
crime
we
have
changed
how
judges
and
lawyers
measure
success
no
longer
by
the
number
of
dispositions
convictions
or
acquittals
but
by
whether
we
are
able
to
break
the
cycle
of
addiction
and
crime
and
improve
public
safety
n
judge
clinton
deveaux
reports
that
although
his
judicial
colleagues
used
to
deride
his
specialized
criminal
court
work
as
that
of
a
social
worker
on
the
bench
in
due
course
other
judges
started
to
refer
cases
to
his
court
and
reported
adopting
some
similar
approaches
in
their
own
conventional
courts
acknowledging
that
this
is
the
only
way
to
deal
with
this
stuff
if
you
re
going
to
actually
stop
the
recidivism
and
actually
solve
some
of
the
problems
that
are
bringing
these
people
to
the
court
n
transfer
of
reframed
conceptions
also
is
likely
to
occur
through
the
transfer
of
judges
from
the
specialized
criminal
court
back
to
the
conventional
court
when
judges
move
between
a
specialized
criminal
court
and
a
conventional
court
many
report
that
they
continue
to
apply
in
part
the
approach
developed
in
the
alternative
court
context
to
the
extent
allowable
n
beyond
the
level
of
reshaping
the
perspectives
of
individual
court
personnel
judges
and
other
institutional
actors
frequently
adapt
the
courtroom
to
function
as
public
theatre
and
publicize
through
the
media
the
aspirations
of
their
respective
courts
as
a
consequence
large
numbers
of
cases
are
not
necessarily
required
for
the
courts
to
shift
understandings
on
a
broader
scale
n
this
addresses
one
challenge
for
specialized
criminal
courts
namely
that
they
cannot
reasonably
be
brought
to
scale
active
engagement
of
judges
lawyers
and
social
scientists
involved
with
diversionary
courts
in
reframing
certain
of
the
criminal
law
problems
at
stake
in
the
courts
allows
the
courts
broader
reach
than
that
provided
by
the
relatively
limited
number
of
cases
they
are
able
to
process
at
any
given
time
additionally
through
empirical
monitoring
of
the
courts
a
decarceration
model
helps
determine
whether
incarceration
is
necessary
or
advisable
for
certain
kinds
of
crimes
and
defendants
balancing
important
concerns
about
public
safety
and
criminal
law
reform
goals
many
administrators
of
specialized
criminal
courts
often
alongside
external
empirical
monitoring
entities
closely
track
the
outcomes
regarding
recidivism
and
other
variables
for
participants
in
non
carceral
programming
relative
to
similarly
situated
persons
subject
to
conventional
criminal
supervision
and
or
incarceration
if
a
decarceration
approach
is
able
to
demonstrate
that
reliance
on
incarceration
can
be
diminished
without
imperiling
public
safety
this
approach
may
reframe
public
attitudes
regarding
incarceration
more
broadly
providing
the
basis
for
a
large
scale
reasoned
rethinking
of
prison
and
jail
based
social
order
maintenance
n
the
process
of
disseminating
empirical
analyses
is
well
underway
with
drug
courts
in
a
quasi
experimental

released
in
june
a
team
of
social
scientists
working
with
the
urban
institute
and
funded
by
the
u

department
of
justice
examined
the
outcomes
regarding

recidivism
and

relapse
for
participants
in
twenty
three
drug
courts
and
six

sites

of
statistical
techniques
to
correct
for
potential
selection

and
clustering
of
outcomes
within

the
study
s
authors
found
that
drug
courts
significantly
reduce
criminal
recidivism
and
drug
use
after
eighteen
months
as
compared
to
the
outcomes
for
similar
individuals
in
the
comparison
sites
n
in
july
the
senate
judiciary
committee
convened
hearings
regarding
this
and
related
studies
to
explore
expanded
funding
for
specialized
criminal
courts
relying
on
alternatives
to
incarceration
with
specific
emphasis
on
drug
courts
and
veterans
courts
n
in
time
empirical
analyses
of
this
sort
may
facilitate
alternative
framings
that
would
enable
legislative
reforms
markedly
scaling
back
sentence
lengths
across
the
board
though
specialized
criminal
courts
have
generally
started
with
jurisdiction
only
over
a
very
limited
class
of
offenders
or
offenses
typically
the
courts
authority
expands
and
an
increasing
range
of
cases
come
before
the
courts
for
example
drug
courts
began
by
accepting
drug
possession
cases
but
over
time
have
expanded
to
include
individuals
arrested
for
forgery
burglary
and
other
crimes
believed
to
be
associated
with
drug
addiction
n
this
occurs
in
part
due
to
the
cognitive
reframing
that
the
courts
enable
drug
crime
is
characterized
to
include
not
only
narcotics
possession
and
sales
offenses
but
also
conduct
motivated
by
drug
addiction
once
diversionary
specialized
criminal
courts
have
become
an
established
alternative
means
of
addressing
drug
offenses
and
the
socially
disruptive
conduct
of
veterans
or
the
mentally
ill
broader
shifts
in
social
understanding
may
be
set
in
motion
the
diversionary
alternatives
introduce
a
new
institutional
framework
for
managing
the
problems
in
question
the
existence
of
these
programs
normalizes
the
alternative
responses
and
the
availability
of
a
parallel
diversionary
alternative
for
a
significant
class
of
cases
makes
available
a
set
of
reasons
why
diversion
may
be
preferable
in
other
contexts
a
potentially
transposable
reasoned
override
to
the
automatic
invocation
of
conventional
criminal
law
frameworks
n
the
contagion
of
the
diversionary
approach
is
confirmed
by
the
experience
of
the
past
decade
during
which
time
diversionary
courts
have
rapidly
multiplied
in
numerous
areas
and
expanded
to
cover
more
serious
offenses
the
alternative
framings
of
crime
and
punishment
emerging
through
the
work
of
specialized
criminal
courts
particularly
those
adopting
a
diversionary
decarceration
approach
hold
the
promise
to
shift
considerably
and
broadly
public
conceptions
of
various
problems
currently
managed
through
criminal
prosecution
and
incarceration
b
institutional
reinvention
along
with
reframing
social
understandings
of
crime
and
punishment
a
decarceration
model
may
also
reshape
criminal
law
administrative
institutions
by
introducing
additional
tasks
for
judges
defense
counsel
and
prosecutors
further
a
decarceration
model
incorporates
novel
players
into
specialized
criminal
courts
work
in
part
by
facilitating
partnerships
with
local
organizations
and
social
service
providers
n
the
roles
of
the
judge
and
the
parties
on
a
decarceration
model
are
all
in
flux
but
unlike
on
the
therapeutic
jurisprudence
or
judicial
monitoring
models
these
role
shifts
are
relatively
consistent
with
preservation
of
conventional
values
respectively
associated
with
these
roles
the
primary
work
of
the
judge
on
a
decarceration
model
is
to
convene
the
parties
and
service
providers
to
oversee
the
negotiation
of
a
diversion
plan
to
monitor
performance
of
diversion
programs
and
then
to
be
available
to
adjudicate
motions
for
sanctions
should
major
noncompliance
become
an
issue
the
judge
on
a
decarceration
model
plays
a
far
less
active
role
than
on
a
therapeutic
judicial
monitoring
or
order
maintenance
model
requiring
only
one
or
two
days
of
work
per
week
in
the
specialized
court
the
courts
institutional
design
facilitates
conscientiousness
about
procedural
protections
particularly
in
sanctions
proceedings
and
it
aims
to
make
transparent
the
reasons
behind
court
orders
n
on
a
decarceration
model
the
judge
also
often
serves
as
a
spokesperson
for
a
decarceration
strategy
and
for
experimental
empirically
informed
criminal
law
administration
n
defense
counsel
s
role
shifts
too
such
that
his
or
her
most
critical
function
involves
negotiating
the
terms
on
which
a
defendant
opts
into
the
diversionary
court
because
specialized
criminal
courts
are
configured
differently
with
regard
to
the
consequences
of
failure
in
terms
of
sentence
penalties
informed
counsel
at
this
stage
is
extremely
important
defense
counsel
continues
to
play
a
role
in
safeguarding
a
defendant
s
procedural
rights
and
other
interests
throughout
the
process
especially
when
motions
for
sanctions
arise
defense
counsel
may
play
a
critical
part
as
well
in
ensuring
that
the
court
actually
reduces
carceral
sentencing
as
opposed
to
on
a
therapeutic
approach
where
defense
counsel
may
acquiesce
in
a
carceral
sentence
for
its
presumed
therapeutic
effect
or
in
conventional
courts
where
much
defense
work
involves
brokering
plea
deals
and
rarely
actively
contesting
evidence
let
alone
conducting
trials
n
the
role
shift
on
a
decarceration
model
is
perhaps
most
dramatic
for
prosecutors
embracing
a
decarceration
approach
for
prosecutors
entails
that
their
offices
operate
not
simply
by
seeking
the
toughest
charges
and
sentences
for
criminal
defendants
but
that
they
work
also
on
strengthening
public
safety
and
advancing
justice
in
a
broader
context
n
prosecutors
on
a
decarceration
model
focus
their
conventional
prosecutorial
resources
on
more
serious
violent
or
property
crimes
where
conventional
criminal
proceedings
are
most
warranted
and
refer
to
specialized
courts
or
drop
charges
in
those
matters
where
non
carceral
sentencing
is
possible
prosecutors
committed
to
decarceration
also
devote
their
resources
in
part
to
enabling
alternatives
to
incarceration
taking
up
in
some
significant
manner
a
decarceration
agenda
the
brooklyn
district
attorney
s
office
for
example
has
pioneered
several
alternatives
to
incarceration
programs
these
initiatives
emerged
before
the
proliferation
of
specialized
criminal
courts
suggesting
that
a
decarceration
approach
may
have
broader
potential
to
restructure
a
prosecutorial
agenda
beyond
specialized
courts
n
in
brooklyn
s
d
a
charles
joe
hynes
introduced
a
diversion
program
that
allowed
nonviolent
drug
offenders
to
enter
substance
abuse
treatment
instead
of
receiving
a
conventional
criminal
sentence

organizing
community
group
gatherings
across
brooklyn
to
link
individuals
on

probation
to

housing
and
treatment
programs
n
this
work
does
not
require
prosecutors
to
cease
prosecuting
cases
of
serious
crime
but
it
suggests
that
prosecutors
can
play
an
important
part
in
decarceration
strategies
by
augmenting
the
prosecutorial
function
and
organizational
mission
beyond
reshaping
the
roles
of
existing
players
in
criminal
courts
a
decarceration
model
introduces
additional
players
one
notable
new
player
is
the

coordinator

institutionalized

link
defendants
to

treatment
and

and
they
work
to
address
other
related
cross
sector
collaborative
efforts
of
the
courts
finally
specialized
criminal
courts
operating
on
a
decarceration
model
may
work
to
shift
the
institutional
form
and
function
of
the
courts
themselves
as
it
has
begun
to
adopt
to
a
greater
extent
a
decarceration
mission
the
reentry
court
in
harlem
for
example
has
appropriated
the
form
of
the
parole
revocation
court
but
has
become
less
court
like
functioning
simultaneously
as
a
clearinghouse
for
job
placement
mental
health
care
and
legal
advice
aiming
to
change
local
opportunities
for
ex
offenders
and
to
facilitate
more
general
economic
development
programs
in
east
harlem
n
over
time
as
these
courts
become
resource
clearinghouses
rather
than
primarily
sites
for
processing
guilty
pleas
or
parole
revocations
this
may
work
to
transform
diversionary
courts
from
criminal
courts
into
different
institutions
altogether
focusing
conventional
criminal
law
resources
on
the
most
serious
forms
of
violent
and
property
crime
and
lending
support
to
a
range
of
different
local
social
and
economic
development
initiatives
c
systemic

these

also
bring
about
systemic
change
by
influencing
how

confronting

as
in
cities

of

through

the

aim

encourage

advocate
for
example
to
make
sure
there
are
enough
treatment
beds
treatment
slots
in
order
to
make
these

n
as
specialized
criminal
court
judges
and
advocates
run
up
against
the
limits
of
social
service
providers
to
accommodate
the
need
for
the
relevant
services
the
effect
in
many
instances
may
be
a
politicization
of
judges
and
other
court
advocates
regarding
the
structural
problems
afflicting
the
demographic
served
by
the
court
part
of
the
reformist
potential
of
a
decarceration
model
then
is
that
it
may
lead
court
participants
to
galvanize
broader
support
for
reallocation
of
resources
to
better
address
these
problems
some
mental
health
court
personnel
have
begun
this
process
by
locating
resources
for
housing
subsidies
and
by
serving
as
advocates
for
court
participants
with
potential
landlords
n
it
is
important
to
acknowledge
though
that
in
some
perhaps
even
in
many
circumstances
a
decarceration
model
may
run
up
against
a
sense
of
tragic
futility
and
the
court
and
related
diversionary
programs
may
be
unable
to
address
adequately
the
matters
at
hand
even
with
more
extensive
resources
for
treatment
and
other
social
service
alternatives
n
after
all
simply
improving
the
employment
and
life
prospects
of
particular
individuals
and
shifting
resources
to
institutions
that
may
support
those
individuals
to
become
more
socially
integrated
is
unlikely
to
do
a
great
deal
to
shift
the
structures
of
opportunity
in
blighted
urban
and
rural
neighborhoods
when
fundamentally
the
problems
the
courts
aim
to
address
are
deep
seated
systemic
problems
n
yet
under
such
circumstances
the
limitations
of
specialized
criminal
courts
may
facilitate
larger
scale
legislative
reform
that
support
effective
decriminalization
of
certain
offenses
reduced
incarceration
regarding
others
and
reinvestment
in
under
resourced
areas
for
instance
the
limited
capacity
of
drug
courts
in
california
to
address
treatment
and
other
needs
in
that
state
helped
to
facilitate
legislative
reform
along
these
lines
in
when
california
voters
passed
proposition
the
substance
abuse
and
crime
prevention
act
permitting
drug
arrestees
to
receive
probation
with
drug
treatment
instead
of
incarceration
the
public
was
responding
in
part
to
criticism
of
drug
courts
that
they
served
too
few
drug
offenders
and
involved
too
much
judicial
oversight
n
while
california
s
drug
courts
provided
treatment
to
approximately
individuals
annually
before
under
proposition
approximately
drug
offenders
each
year
were
receiving
probation
with
drug
treatment
by
n
further
supervision
is
delegated
from
the
judge
to
probation
officers
and
revocation
of
probation
is
only
considered
under
limited
specified
conditions
flash
incarceration
short
term
incarceration
for
technical
violations
is
not
permitted
n
the
utah
drug
offender
reform
act
provides
another
intriguing
window
on
to
the
systemic
shifts
set
in
motion
by
the
relatively
limited
capacity
of
specialized
criminal
courts
according
to
dan
becker
utah
s
state
court
administrator
the
focus
that
drug
courts
have
put
on
treatment
gave
rise
to
a
lot
of
interest
on
the
part
of
the
larger
criminal
justice
community
in
utah
all
of
the
criminal
justice
agencies
got
together
and
worked
for
several
years
on
crafting
legislation
that
s
called
the
drug
offender
reform
act
which
provides
for
screening
and
assessment
for
every
single
person
charged
with
a
felony
where
there
s
a
drug
offense
involved

last
year
stepped
forward
and
funded
about
half
of
the
cost
of
implementation
they
ll
fund
the
other
half
next
year
hopefully
and
that
s
a
complete
shift
in
public
policy
i
suspect
you
could
trace
that
back
to
the
roots
of
drug
courts
putting
the
emphasis
on
treatment
n
as
court
personnel
struggle
against
structural
barriers
such
as
a
lack
of
adequate
public
health
and
mental
health
services
lack
of
affordable
housing
and
geographically
concentrated
underemployment
the
result
may
be
some
measure
of
consciousness
raising
and
potentially
responsive
legislative
change
but
also
an
acute
sense
of
the
impossible
situation
in
which
many
subjects
of
the
criminal
law
find
themselves
part
of
the
reformist
potential
of
a
decarceration
model
is
that
this
experience
will
lead
court
participants
to
work
to
address
more
comprehensively
the
structural
problems
at
issue
and
to
disseminate
more
widely
the
truth
that
criminal
courts
cannot
serve
as
a
cure
all
for
social
insecurity
social
risk
and
the
underlying
social
problems
the
courts
routinely
confront
moreover
specialized
criminal
courts
operating
on
a
decarceration
model
begin
to
expose
the
complexity
of
the
problems
at
hand
and
the
unavailability
of
a
complete
resolution
of
that
complexity
they
can
help
all
of
us
to
see
that
the
problems
that
have
found
their
way
to
criminal
courts
are
often
ones
for
which
there
is
no
ideal
solution
even
though
there
are
better
more
humane
responses
or
worse
more
brutal
carceral
means
of
imperfectly
addressing
these
problems
in
these
various
respects
through
reframing
understandings
of
criminally
charged
conduct
shifting
the
roles
of
key
systemic
players
and
institutions
and
catalyzing
resource
reallocation
and

change

begin
to
bring
about
substantial

how

iv
perils
of
specialized
criminal
law
reform
it
remains
to
consider
the
perils
presented
by
a
specialized
criminal
courts
reform
agenda
generally
as
distinct
from
the
potential
risks
addressed
above
with
regard
to
the
more
predominant
criminal
law
reformist
models
at
work
in
specialized
criminal
courts
specialized
criminal
courts
generally
pose
a
number
of
significant
and
concerning
risks
excessive
reliance
on
legal
frameworks
to
address
complex
social
concerns
dilution
of
the
expressive
retributive
or
deterrent
force
of
criminal
law
broadly
diminished
procedural
protections
inefficiently
proliferating
specializations
and
legitimation
of
harshness
in
conventional
courts
for
less
sympathetic
racial
minority
or
otherwise
stigmatized
defendants
this
part
will
begin
to
address
these
risks
and
the
ability
of
courts
adopting
a
decarceration
model
to
respond
to
them
a
excessive
legalism
critics
of
specialized
criminal
courts
reject
the
overarching
premise
that
criminal
courts
can
be
relied
upon
to
address
complex
social
problems
professor
jane
m
spinak
has
argued
that
court
based
approaches
will
be
incapable
of
managing
either
the
structural
problems
the
specialized
criminal
courts
aim
to
address
such
as
crippling
caseloads
in
conventional
criminal
courts
or
the
difficult
social
issues
the
courts
seek
to
handle
such
as
addiction
and
social
dislocation
n
specialized
criminal
courts
will
be
unable
to
manage
the
courts
structural
problems
spinak
contends
because
those
problems
are
produced
by
legislatures
and
public
policies
over
which
the
courts
exercise
little
control
simply
put
so
long
as
police
persist
in
arresting
and
prosecutors
persist
in
prosecuting
drug
offenders
the
volume
of
drug
offenders
in
the
criminal
courts
will
remain
high
moreover
spinak
maintains
the
societal
and
personal
problems
the
courts
seek
to
address
are
multifaceted
and
socially
entrenched
and
will
be
difficult
if
not
impossible
for
courts
to
mitigate
absent
broader
structural
shifts
to
substantiate
these
arguments
spinak
explores
the
history
of
the
early
family
courts
which
like
contemporary
specialized
criminal
courts
had
problem
oriented
ambitions
and
fell
short
in
resolving
the
relevant
problems
largely
because
of
the
complicated
socially
ingrained
character
of
family
dysfunction
n
spinak
concludes
that
we
need
to
develop
resources
beyond
the
court
and
focus
on
more
client
oriented
solutions
rather
than
therapeutic
or
court
interventions
n
in
spinak
s
view
though
any
conceptual
reorientation
within
the
courts
toward
building
resources
beyond
the
court
and
developing
client
oriented
solutions
is
not
enough
to
stem
the
tide
of
judicial
activism
that
situates
problem
solving
in
the
court
itself
rather
than
in
the
broader
structure
of
how
people
in
need
are
served
by
our
society
n
professor
mae
c
quinn
has
advanced
a
related
argument
against
the
legalist
orientation
of
a
criminal
law
reform
strategy
located
in
specialized
criminal
courts
quinn
s
analysis
draws
on
the
failure
of
another
earlier
progressive
era
attempt
to
address
a
range
of
social
problems
through
procedurally
informal
specialized
courts
quinn
provides
a
fascinating
history
of
how
one
progressive
era
female
judge
the
honorable
anna
kross
convened
specialized
courts
to
address
the
problems
of
domestic
violence
and
juvenile
delinquency
but
ultimately
judge
kross
s
experiments
were
disbanded
and
derided
as
failures
because
they
were
so
expensive
that
they
could
never
be
brought
to
scale
additionally
the
treatment
methods
coordinated
by
the
court
were
unable
to
address
the
broader
social
issues
at
hand
and
the
outsourcing
of
treatment
tasks
resulted
in
overreaching
and
privatization
of
the
judicial
system
n
the
progressive
era
endeavor
to
address
social
problems
through
specialized
courts
was
dismantled
legal
protections
for
accused
persons
were
expanded
and
observers
concluded
that
while
social
work
intervention
might
be
helpful
to
persons
in
distress
this
would
be
best
achieved
outside
the
context
of
criminal
law
administration
the
troubled
juvenile
courts
are
the
one
continuing
institutional
component
of
this
progressive
era
legacy
quinn
draws
from
this
historical
experience
to
suggest
that
contemporary
criminal
court
reformers
should
be
much
more
skeptical
than
they
are
about
the
claimed
newness
of
their
interventions
and
the
capacity
of
court
coordinated
treatment
to
resolve
the
targeted
legal
systemic
or
social
problems
n
spinak
and
quinn
s
respective
critiques
apply
with
particular
force
to
therapeutic
judicial
monitoring
and
order
maintenance
models
of
specialized
criminal
law
administration
a
decarceration
model
however
is
primarily
invested
in
shifting
problems
and
resources
to
other
extralegal
sectors
making
it
less
susceptible
to
the
charge
of
nai
xfe
ve
legalism
and
on
a
decarceration
model
the
diversionary
programs
are
open
to
all
persons
not
just
those
referred
through
the
court
so
it
is
not
principally
the
courts
themselves
that
are
determining
the
scope
of
the
populations
served
or
the
precise
content
of
the
service
providers
interventions
to
the
extent
courts
remain
involved
they
aim
to
ensure
some
measure
of
accountability
for
the
service
providers
in
response
to
the
concern
raised
by
spinak
that
the
structural
problems
at
issue
emanate
from
police
practices
legislatures
prosecutorial
prerogatives
and
the
desolation
of
poor
urban
and
rural
neighborhoods
and
so
cannot
be
resolved
by
court
innovation
a
decarceration
model
directs
attention
to
reframing
understandings
of
crime
and
punishment
in
ways
that
promise
to
shift
police
practices
and
prosecutorial
prerogatives
as
explored
earlier
in
part
iii
a
decarceration
model
does
not
purport
to
use
the
court
directly
to
resolve
the
broader
problems
but
in
reframing
and
publicizing
a
conception
of
drug
dependency
mental
illness
and
other
matters
as
structural
and
social
challenges
a
decarceration
model
a
makes
available
other
ways
of
conceiving
and
managing
these
concerns
and
b
actively
enlists
police
and
prosecutors
in
the
courts
work
thereby
influencing
those
agencies
perspectives
and
conduct
empirical
documentation
of
the
courts
progress
may
ultimately
provide
the
basis
for
legislative
change
as
described
earlier
in
part
iii
a
decarceration
model
thus
promises
to
effect
change
in
policing
prosecution
and
to
do
so
through
legislation
rather
than
assuming
that
a
legalist
court
based
strategy
on
its
own
will
effect
desired
change
finally
in
galvanizing
resources
for
blighted
social
service
sectors
and
neighborhoods
a
decarceration
model
may
begin
to
address
invariably
only
partially
some
of
the
broader
structural
deficits
to
which
therapeutic
judicial
monitoring
or
order
maintenance
models
are
less
attuned
due
to
the
almost
exclusive
focus
of
these
approaches
on
the
presumed
pathologies
of
individuals
a
decarceration
model
also
begins
to
account
for
quinn
s
objections
regarding
the
implausibility
due
to
cost
of
bringing
specialized
criminal
courts
to
scale
as
well
as
the
threat
of
judicial
overreaching
on
a
decarceration
model
the
courts
are
part
of
an
interim
decarceration
strategy
carried
out
by
reframing
particular
conceptions
of
crime
punishment
and
its
alternatives
by
partially
reshaping
the
institutional
roles
of
judges
defense
counsel
prosecutors
and
criminal
courts
and
by
shifting
resources
a
decarceration
model
need
not
be
brought
to
scale
to
stimulate
some
significant
measure
of
cognitive
reframing
institutional
reinvention
and
systemic
change
as
certain
specialized
criminal
courts
have
already
begun
to
do
the
problem
of
judicial
overreaching
to
which
quinn
attends
and
which
is
in
part
a
product
of
excessive
faith
in
legal
fora
to
facilitate
change
is
mitigated
on
a
decarceration
model
due
to
the
minimalist
diversionary
approach
characteristic
of
the
model
the
central
aspiration
of
courts
adopting
a
decarceration
model
is
to
divert
cases
to
other
social
sectors
which
fulfill
some
less
formal
surveillant
function
and
provide
social
services
without
enlisting
judges
in
that
work
although
as
with
any
court
based
reform
strategy
a
decarceration
model
runs
some
risk
of
excessive
legalism
the
experimental
empirically
and
sociologically
oriented
diversionary
approach
of
a
decarceration
model
mitigates
this
risk
considerably
one
might
wonder
then
why
involve
the
courts
at
all
if
a
decarceration
model
is
primarily
diversionary
the
answer
lies
in
the
fact
that
the
matters
at
issue
are
currently
lodged
in
criminal
courts
and
political
process
defects
have
left
the
task
of
addressing
these
matters
largely
to
judges
in
criminal
courts
themselves
judges
devised
specialized
criminal
courts
as
a
creative
work
around
of
these
political
process
defects
at
this
point
the
courts
hold
considerable
advantages
as
sites
for
reshaping
public
understandings
of
crime
and
punishment
for
shifting
institutional
roles
and
for
reallocating
resources
to
other
sectors
further
as
professor
michael
dorf
has
argued
specialized
criminal
courts
have
convening
power
as
well
as
disentrenching
capacity
to
impose
a
penalty
default
so
unpalatable
to
all
parties
that
they
have
no
choice
but
to
hammer
out
some
solution
n
also
courts
are
perceived
as
relatively
neutral
and
morally
authoritative
institutions
lending
greater
force
to
the
experimental
and
empirical
work
ongoing
there
finally
courts
may
provide
some
mechanism
through
which
to
render
service
providers
accountable
in
the
transition
to
a
diversionary
regime
along
these
lines
then
a
decarceration
model
may
navigate
some
of
the
excessive
legalism
potentially
associated
with
specialized
criminal
courts
and
underscored
by
spinak
and
quinn
while
taking
advantage
of
the
institutional
authority
of
the
courts
to
initiate
broader
transformative
criminal
law
reform
b
criminal
justice
a
separate
question
regarding
specialized
criminal
courts
is
whether
they
undermine
the
expressive
force
of
criminal
justice
conveying
blame
and
or
deterring
wrongdoing
are
arguably
the
most
important
features
of
the
criminal
law
n
plus
tying
moral
blame
to
criminal
sanctions
may
play
a
critical
role
in
realizing
the
criminal
law
s
deterrent
potential
n
furthermore
richard
c
boldt
has
argued
that
criminal
law
does
more
than
simply
express
an
intentionalist
perspective
a
perspective
that
affirms
human
agency
and
moral
responsibility
but
additionally
it
is
a
vital
societal
mechanism
by
which
that
perspective
is
created
and
maintained
and
the
causal
or
objective
perspective
obscured
n
for
this
reason
boldt
contends
it
is
a
mistake
to
medicalize
addiction
and
thereby
excuse
it
instead
decriminalization
is
preferable
to
excusing
categories
of
conduct
which
are
ill
suited
for
criminal
prosecution
in
part
because
appropriate
excusing
factors
would
undermine
the
fundamentally
intentionalist
perspective
of
the
criminal
law
n
from
this
vantage
point
specialized
criminal
courts
might
be
understood
to
weaken
the
moral
condemnatory
dimension
of
criminal
justice
and
hence
to
undercut
its
deterrent
force
insofar
as
moral
prohibition
is
necessary
to
make
deterrence
effective
in
beginning
to
address
these
concerns
at
first
blush
it
may
appear
that
retributivism
is
a
theory
of
punishment
irreconcilably
at
odds
with
the
express
mission
of
decarceration
the
crux
of
a
retributive
approach
is
to
punish
offenders
proportionally
to
their
moral
blameworthiness
based
on
the
crime
committed
leniency
and
harshness
both
violate
the
principle
of
proportionality
yet
upon
closer
examination
there
may
be
a
retributive
defense
of
a
decarceration
model
after
all
a
retributive
account
of
a
decarceration
model
would
proceed
on
the
following
premises
first
if
retributivist
criminal
law
administration
is
to
impart
moral
blame
and
assign
proportionate
punishment
it
ought
to
focus
on
those
forms
of
misconduct
for
which
blame
is
apt
not
on
conduct
for
which
victims
are
absent
or
where
moral
agency
is
seriously
in
question
courts
adopting
a
decarceration
approach
focus
in
large
part
though
not
entirely
on
what
professor
sanford
kadish
has
characterized
as
morally
neutral
criminal
offenses
or
on
offenders
whose
moral
blameworthiness
is
otherwise
mitigated
n
for
these
categories
of
offense
and
offender
the
retributive
concern
with
imparting
moral
blame
through
criminal
law
holds
less
sway
still
in
cases
involving
both
morally
neutral
as
well
as
more
morally
charged
offenses
courts
adopting
a
decarceration
approach
limit
defendants
liberty
in
significant
ways
which
are
surely
experienced
by
defendants
as
constraining
sanctioning
and
in
those
respects
punitive
for
example
a
drug
addict
mandated
by
the
court
to
undergo
treatment
or
a
person
with
mental
illness
mandated
to
comply
with
a
mental
health
regimen
both
have
their
liberty
undermined
in
the
throes
of
addiction
or
a
psychotic
manic
episode
most
persons
would
prefer
to
use
drugs
or
experience
their
mania
specialized
criminal
courts
punish
those
persons
by
limiting
their
liberty
and
mandating
by
force
of
law
a
socially
preferred
course
of
action
in
other
words
social
service
intervention
and
punishment
are
not
necessarily
diametrically
opposed
such
intervention
may
be
experienced
as
punitive
and
in
fact
such
intervention
can
actually
provide
the
ideological
basis
whereby
the
state
exercises
greater
control
over
the
individual
than
is
typical
of
a
normal
criminal
court
n
in
this
regard
from
a
retributive
standpoint
specialized
criminal
courts
may
enable
more
meaningful
punitiveness
than
conventional
criminal
courts
according
to
former
kansas
city
drug
court
prosecutor
claire
mccaskill
the
diversionary
programs
required
of
participants
in
her
jurisdiction
are
tougher
than
the
alternatives
n
in
contrast
conventional
jail
prison
and
probationary
sentencing
often
fail
on
a
retributive
theory
either
because
of
disproportionate
harshness
when
an
inmate
will
be
physically
harmed
and
subject
to
brutal
conditions
or
when
prison
jail
and
probation
function
as
part
of
the
anticipated
life
course
not
as
especially
stigmatizing
punishment
for
certain
demographics
of
criminally
convicted
persons
n
in
this
regard
diversionary
sentencing
may
provide
more
meaningful
proportionate
and
significantly
liberty
constraining
punishment
from
a
retributive
standpoint
than
conventional
sentencing
n
additionally
because
a
decarceration
model
maintains
no
commitment
to
a
purely
therapeutic
neo
rehabilitative
or
purely
deterrent
judicial
monitoring
approach
there
is
nothing
to
prevent
specialized
criminal
court
teams
from
incorporating
proportional
sentencing
constraints
in
devising
diversionary
sentences
a
decarceration
model
need
not
fundamentally
undermine
an
agency
focused
intentionalist
perspective
of
the
sort
boldt
addresses
but
merely
reorganizes
society
s
response
to
particular
defendants
and
offenses
preferring
mandatory
social
institutional
integration
to
jail
or
prison
sentencing
criminal
prohibitions
remain
intact
until
they
are
legislatively
altered
so
the
expressive
moral
condemnation
function
of
criminal
law
remains
in
that
regard
unchanged
the
sentence
assigned
in
response
merely
shifts
from
prison
jail
and
conventional
criminal
supervision
to
other
sectors
this
shift
occurs
on
a
decarceration
model
in
part
in
the
interests
of
a
larger
concern
for
justice
for
maintaining
the
legitimacy
of
a
legal
order
that
is
deeply
compromised
by
overcriminalization
and
overincarceration
even
on
a
kantian
retributive
theory
it
may
be
that
some
measure
of
lenience
is
warranted
to
preserve
the
legal
order
on
which
justice
depends
n
though
much
more
could
surely
be
said
for
now
that
concludes
the
retributive
defense
of
a
decarceration
model
from
the
perspective
of
deterrence
a
decarceration
approach
dissuades
for
the
same
reasons
that
it
may
be
experienced
as
punishment
from
a
retributive
standpoint
diversionary
sentences
still
substantially
constrain
defendants
liberty
a
potential
offender
aware
that
apprehension
may
lead
to
a
court
ordered
diversion
program
will
be
inclined
to
desist
from
being
apprehended
for
conduct
that
will
lead
to
a
diversionary
sentence
something
that
individual
would
prefer
to
avoid
critically
on
a
decarceration
model
referral
services
are
open
to
all
comers
not
just
those
referred
through
diversionary
courts
so
there
is
no
incentive
to
offend
in
order
to
obtain
services
should
those
services
be
desired
further
for
most
eligible
defendants
mentally
ill
persons
drug
addicts
veterans
suffering
severe
post
traumatic
stress
their
socially
disruptive
conduct
is
unlikely
to
be
carried
out
following
reflective
cost
benefit
analysis
so
the
deterrent
potential
of
any
criminal
law
administrative
arrangement
is
questionable
n
it
must
of
course
be
acknowledged
that
a
diversionary
sentence
will
not
deter
those
individuals
who
wish
both
to
commit
an
offense
subject
to
the
jurisdiction
of
a
specialized
criminal
court
and
who
wish
to
enter
diversionary
programming
but
as
noted
above
in
reference
to
retributive
concerns
this
same
problem
arises
with
respect
to
conventional
jail
prison
and
probationary
sentencing
for
many
criminal
defendants
criminal
law
involvement
has
become
an
anticipated
part
of
the
life
course
a
life
stage
through
which
certain
demographics
of
defendants
expect
to
pass
and
in
this
regard
a
diversionary
approach
may
not
be
appreciably
less
stigmatizing
and
less
deterrent
than
conventional
sentencing
one
reason
a
decarceration
model
is
preferable
to
a
more
jurisprudentially
specified
model
of
specialized
criminal
law
administration
such
as
therapeutic
jurisprudence
is
because
this
jurisprudentially
underspecified
form
permits
the
courts
to
engage
multiple
complex
meaning
imparting
functions
involved
in
criminal
law
administration
in
certain
criminal
cases
the
ideal
role
of
the
court
may
be
simultaneously
to
condemn
a
given
offense
and
the
possibly
reprehensible
motivations
behind
it
to
reaffirm
the
worth
of
the
victim
to
aim
to
craft
a
sanction
that
will
deter
the
offender
and
others
from
such
conduct
in
the
future
but
also
to
act
mercifully
this
is
a
complex
undertaking
to
be
sure
and
one
that
cannot
be
easily
captured
under
a
single
criminal
law
jurisprudential
theory
whether
a
therapeutic
jurisprudential
approach
or
an
instrumentally
deterrent
model
as
dan
m
kahan
and
martha
c
nussbaum
have
proposed
a
disposition
that
purports
to
answer
only
a
single
abstract
question
did
the
defendant
s
background
cause
his
crime
or
even
does
the
defendant
deserve
to
be
punished
will
never
be
rich
enough
to
convey
all
of
these
meanings
n
in
this
respect
courts
adopting
a
decarceration
approach
have
overdetermined
meanings
rendering
them
potentially
consistent
with
a
range
of
differing
ideological
and
legal
precommitments
retributivists
may
favor
diversionary
courts
because
they
enable
a
tough
and
intrusive
form
of
criminal
law
administration
that
is
proportional
to
wrongdoing
and
lenient
where
in
the
interests
of
justice
having
the
potential
to
both
deter
and
prevent
future
offending
and
others
may
be
drawn
to
diversionary
courts
for
their
rehabilitative
and
humanitarian
potential
regardless
of
one
s
criminal
law
theoretical
commitments
a
decarceration
model
promises
to
reduce
criminal
law
administrative
costs
increase
efficacy
and
reduce
reliance
on
incarceration
for
the
time
being
a
decarceration
approach
is
best
suited
to
misconduct
for
which
there
is
some
considerable
collective
interest
among
legal
actors
and
the
public
in
experimental
alternative
social
response
but
perhaps
over
time
a
growing
class
of
offenses
and
offenders
will
come
to
seem
suitable
candidates
for
decarceration
there
are
surely
some
crimes
of
violence
that
will
not
be
amenable
to
decarceration
processing
at
all
though
it
is
not
entirely
clear
what
those
offenses
are
in
the
abstract
the
conduct
of
the
person
who
murders
who
rapes
who
robs
by
violent
means
may
not
be
subject
to
redirection
through
court
or
other
intervention
and
the
only
politically
and
socially
viable
response
may
be
moral
condemnation
and
incapacitation
as
sociologist
jack
katz
explains
in
his
studies
in
seductions
of
crime
certain
violent
acts
may
emerge
from
a
dizziness
in
which
conformity
is
the
greatest
spiritual
challenge
and
deviance
promises
the
peace
of
transcendent
significance
n
but
for
others
who
have
killed
their
deviant
conduct
may
never
again
be
repeated
it
may
have
occurred
in
a
drug
induced
haze
that
following
recovery
would
no
longer
threaten
others
and
for
which
moral
culpability
is
lacking
the
experimental
unfinished
character
of
a
decarceration
model
allows
this
question
be
resolved
incrementally
over
time
n
c
reduced
procedural
protections
specialized
criminal
courts
frequently
adopt
a
collaborative
approach
that
entails
at
certain
stages
reduced
adversarialism
and
reduced
procedural
protections
an
approach
that
critics
charge
raises
numerous
due
process
concerns
n
criminal
defense
attorneys
object
to
these
relaxed
procedures
on
the
grounds
that
reduced
procedural
protections
lead
to
outcomes
that
are
bad
for
their
clients
and
that
more
generally
are
corrosive
of
the
legitimacy
and
integrity
of
criminal
law
n
this
line
of
objection
continues
that
when
defense
counsel
works
as
part
of
a
diversionary
sentencing
team
they
may
be
less
than
vigilant
in
seeking
to
have
illegally
obtained
evidence
excluded
and
less
willing
to
challenge
the
legal
or
factual
bases
of
the
government
s
charges
n
defendants
interactions
with
social
service
providers
outside
the
presence
of
counsel
also
may
entail
due
process
violations
as
any
incriminating
statements
may
affect
the
defendant
s
revocation
sentence
n
in
certain
drug
courts
for
instance
judges
may
rely
on
progress
reports
from
substance
abuse
programmers
in
determining
whether
to
apply
sanctions
to
court
participants
domestic
violence
courts
similarly
rely
on
reports
from
anger
management
programs
to
assess
compliance
n
this
information
is
obtained
in
a
treatment
context
and
is
not
subject
to
any
measures
that
would
ensure
procedural
fairness
or
regularity
n
unlike
on
a
therapeutic
jurisprudence
judicial
monitoring
or
order
maintenance
model
on
a
decarceration
approach
there
is
considerable
room
to
incorporate
robust
procedural
protections
thereby
responding
to
most
procedural
objections
leveled
generally
against
specialized
criminal
courts
even
if
there
remain
inevitably
some
procedural
rights
trade
offs
because
the
legal
process
itself
is
not
understood
to
have
a
therapeutic
or
other
nonconventional
orientation
on
a
decarceration
model
full
due
process
protections
should
and
have
been
applied
at
the
stage
of
revocation
n
to
accommodate
concerns
regarding
judicial
neutrality
courts
adopting
a
decarceration
model
could
readily
assign
two
separate
judges
one
to
handle
supervision
and
a
separate
judge
to
handle
revocation
n
the
due
process
problems
posed
by
labeling
defendants
in
judicial
monitoring
courts
sex
offenders
prior
to
adjudication
are
so
obvious
as
to
require
little
explanation
on
a
decarceration
model
preadjudication
judicial
monitoring
need
not
occur
an
additional
substantial
ground
for
procedural
objections
is
the
often
substantial
disparity
in
specialized
criminal
courts
between
the
relatively
light
sentence
a
defendant
would
have
received
in
the
conventional
court
and
the
disproportionately
harsh
jail
or
prison
sentence
a
defendant
will
receive
if
he
or
she
fails
in
the
diversionary
program
because
a
decarceration
model
s
primary
aim
is
to
reduce
reliance
on
incarceration
consistent
with
maintaining
public
safety
such
courts
do
not
seek
to
obtain
leverage
by
imposing
disproportionately
harsh
revocation
sentences
in
fact
empirical
analyses
suggest
that
the
severity
of
sanctions
in
drug
courts
does
not
appear
to
reduce
the
subsequent
number
of
crimes
committed
or
days
of
drug
use
n
beyond
these
more
obvious
modifications
on
a
decarceration
model
to
account
for
procedural
justice
concerns
diversionary
courts
may
operate
in
accord
with
any
of
several
different
procedural
configurations
courts
may
be
pretrial
pre
plea
post
plea
presentencing
or
post
conviction
sentencing
alternatives
for
example
some
drug
court
programs
provide
for
placement
in
a
drug
court
following
adjudication
but
if
the
terms
of
the
program
are
violated
probation
is
revoked
and
the
court
will
sentence
the
defendant
anew
or
based
on
a
predetermined
revocation
sentence
n
in
contrast
in
other
specialized
criminal
courts
failure
to
comply
merely
leads
to
the
reinstatement
of
criminal
proceedings
not
to
a
previously
bargained
conviction
or
sentence
n
the
decision
to
take
a
plea
is
a
serious
one
and
making
an
informed
and
rational
choice
about
pleading
guilty
is
particularly
difficult
when
the
alternative
is
a
possibly
much
lengthier
prison
sentence
and
when
the
defendant
is
drug
addicted
or
suffering
from
mental
illness
n
one
way
to
attempt
to
circumvent
the
procedural
concerns
that
arise
under
such
circumstances
is
to
have
the
diversionary
alternative
process
occur
prior
to
a
plea
being
entered
on
this
approach
a
defendant
would
elect
whether
to
opt
in
to
the
specialized
criminal
court
and
upon
successful
completion
of
the
diversionary
program
any
charges
would
be
dropped
egregious
misconduct
while
in
the
program
would
result
in
referral
to
the
conventional
criminal
process
for
the
prior
criminal
conduct
but
evidence
from
the
diversionary
period
obtained
through
treatment
or
other
social
service
intervention
could
be
excluded
the
defendant
would
then
choose
whether
to
plead
guilty
at
the
outset
pursue
any
motions
practice
or
proceed
to
trial
the
due
process
concerns
on
this
approach
relate
principally
to
the
fact
that
the
diversionary
alternative
to
the
extent
it
is
intrusive
and
limiting
of
the
defendant
s
liberty
is
mandated
prior
to
a
finding
of
guilt
but
the
defendant
s
participation
is
optional
no
more
constrained
than
any
choice
made
in
light
of
the
background
criminal
law
regime
and
the
specialized
court
participant
may
at
any
point
opt
out
and
return
to
the
conventional
process
n
still
the
choice
of
the
participant
does
not
eliminate
concerns
about
coercion
because
any
choice
takes
place
against
the
coercive
pressures
of
the
criminal
law
regime
and
the
broader
social
and
political
setting
in
which
the
defendant
finds
himself
or
herself
and
if
specialized
criminal
courts
increase
pressures
to
arrest
or
for
arrestees
to
enter
diversion
programs
they
will
have
constrained
individuals
options
in
a
significant
sense
rather
than
having
expanded
them
but
the
coercion
at
work
in
determining
whether
to
enter
the
specialized
criminal
court
is
no
more
than
the
coercion
in
play
at
any
other
critical
phase
of
proceedings
in
which
a
defendant
decides
to
plead
guilty
or
go
to
trial
and
the
potential
benefits
to
the
participant
are
considerable
the
other
available
approach
is
to
employ
the
diversionary
court
as
a
post
conviction
sentencing
alternative
with
egregious
offending
while
in
the
program
punished
by
an
alternative
pre
agreed
upon
sentence
this
avoids
the
due
process
problems
associated
with
court
mandates
prior
to
a
finding
of
guilt
but
increases
the
risk
of
coercive
less
than
voluntary
pleas
as
far
as
the
post
conviction
configuration
is
concerned
due
process
and
coercion
concerns
may
be
mitigated
if
there
is
not
too
harsh
a
pre
agreed
upon
or
subsequently
determined
revocation
sentence
that
is
if
the
revocation
sentence
is
standardized
to
what
the
defendant
would
have
received
had
he
or
she
not
opted
into
the
specialized
court
the
procedural
concerns
could
be
further
mitigated
on
a
post
conviction
model
if
both
those
convicted
following
trial
and
those
who
pled
guilty
were
eligible
for
alternative
sentencing
this
latter
post
conviction
approach
would
attend
to
the
procedural
rights
of
defendants
and
would
likely
reduce
incarceration
and
associated
costs
expanding
the
ability
of
defendants
to
remain
out
of
prison
protects
their
interests
in
avoiding
carceral
sentencing
and
their
due
process
rights
so
long
as
defendants
are
still
able
to
challenge
any
illegally
obtained
evidence
at
the
outset
of
the
case
elect
to
go
to
trial
and
not
be
subject
to
a
disproportionately
harsh
sentence
upon
revocation
n
in
sum
the
trade
off
is
between
a
pretrial
pre
plea
model
that
potentially
avoids
criminal
proceedings
altogether
and
more
closely
renders
participation
a
choice
and
a
post
conviction
model
that
avoids
certain
due
process
problems
by
making
the
specialized
criminal
court
program
effectively
a
part
of
the
defendant
s
sentence
but
unless
the
post
conviction
approach
allows
defendants
to
enter
following
trial
it
applies
substantial
pressure
to
plead
guilty
to
retain
the
option
to
avoid
jail
or
prison
even
under
circumstances
where
the
defendant
may
contest
guilt
the
advantage
of
the
experimental
quality
of
a
decarceration
model
is
that
jurisdictions
may
test
the
various
procedural
configurations
and
determine
which
best
serves
the
range
of
interests
at
stake
and
raises
fewer
due
process
and
other
problems
not
merely
in
theory
but
in
terms
of
participants
experiences
on
the
ground
n
finally
it
is
also
critical
to
consider
whether
procedural
protections
are
the
panacea
their
proponents
assume
for
fairness
in
conventional
criminal
law
administration
n
because
there
is
such
great
pressure
on
the
conventional
courts
due
to
high
case
volumes
the
vast
majority
of
cases
are
handled
through
guilty
pleas
often
public
defenders
have
little
time
to
investigate
a
case
before
a
client
is
advised
to
plead
guilty
but
if
greater
numbers
of
cases
were
removed
from
the
conventional
criminal
courts
to
specialized
criminal
courts
and
other
sectors
fewer
cases
would
remain
in
conventional
courts
provided
that
specialized
courts
manage
to
avoid
a
net
widening
enforcement
effect
this
would
permit
more
robust
procedural
protections
and
investigations
in
the
conventional
criminal
courts
oddly
then
it
is
plausible
that
the
removal
of
cases
to
a
less
adversarial
specialized
criminal
context
may
enhance
procedural
justice
overall
improving
procedural
safeguards
in
conventional
courts
rather
than
the
outcome
feared
by
proceduralists
d
specialization
for
good
or
for
ill
a
further
peril
of
a
specialized
criminal
courts
law
reform
strategy
is
that
it
may
require
a
profusion
of
specialized
courts
to
address
the
myriad
problems
requiring
reform
convening
a
separate
court
for
each
separate
area
in
which
substantive
criminal
law
reform
is
desired
would
be
enormously
costly
n
additionally
reliance
on
criminal
court
specialization
might
well
threaten
to
undermine
rule
of
law
values
centered
on
a
model
of
judges
as
neutral
generalists
n
although
these
are
legitimate
objections
to
certain
forms
of
criminal
court
specialization
a
decarceration
model
is
less
likely
to
entail
these
troubling
features
of
specialization
for
two
primary
reasons
first
a
decarceration
model
is
an
interim
strategy
for
criminal
law
reform
focused
specifically
on
reducing
reliance
on
incarceration
by
setting
in
motion
broader
reform
processes
as
discussed
previously
in
section
ii
d
and
part
iii
diversionary
courts
need
not
aspire
to
become
a
permanent
criminal
law
administrative
fixture
thus
a
diversionary
decarceration
model
poses
a
less
significant
threat
of
proliferating
courts
endlessly
in
response
to
every
criminal
law
problem
requiring
reform
as
a
consequence
this
approach
stands
to
intrude
less
upon
the
predominant
norm
of
generalist
adjudication
second
courts
adopting
a
decarceration
approach
need
not
be
particularly
substantively
specialized
a
decarceration
model
could
incorporate
within
one
court
jurisdiction
over
a
range
of
different
matters
for
which
non
carceral
sentencing
is
preferred
this
too
stands
to
reduce
the
risk
of
endlessly
proliferating
specialized
criminal
courts
and
positions
specialized
criminal
court
judges
in
a
role
more
akin
to
the
prototypical
generalist
judge
n
e
legitimation
costs
finally
specialized
criminal
courts
threaten
to
impose
significant
legitimation
costs
first
specialized
criminal
courts
may
legitimate
increased
harshness
in
conventional
criminal
courts
once
more
sympathetic
criminal
defendants
have
been
removed
with
the
removal
of
presumably
more
vulnerable
or
less
blameworthy
individuals
from
conventional
criminal
courts
and
prisons
one
might
well
envision
an
increase
in
punitive
attitudes
toward
those
remaining
this
is
so
even
though
it
may
be
profoundly
unfair
to
allow
some
criminal
law
breakers
access
to
specialized
criminal
courts
because
we
perceive
them
to
be
more
worthy
of
our
understanding
when
others
are
really
no
more
blameworthy
n
a
related
risk
is
that
in
removing
more
purportedly
sympathetic
defendants
from
conventional
criminal
courts
racial
and
class
disproportion
will
increase
with
more
defendants
of
color
and
materially
poor
defendants
remaining
in
the
conventional
courts
n
indeed
that
is
precisely
what
occurred
under
deinstitutionalization
in
the
s
when
the
racialization
of
mental
hospitals
increased
n
and
preliminary
results
from
mental
health
courts
suggest
this
trend
is
a
problem
in
that
context
too
as
a
study
of
case
processing
in
seven
mental
health
courts
found
overrepresentation
at
the
point
of
referral
of
older
individuals
white
persons
and
women
as
compared
to
their
proportion
in
the
criminal
justice
system
generally
n
though
empirical
monitoring
enables
identification
of
the
point
at
which
racial
disparities
emerge
identification
of
the
locus
of
the
problem
does
not
by
any
stretch
guarantee
its
elimination
the
convergence
of
interest
between
wealthier
white
defendants
with
mental
health
or
addiction
problems
and
similarly
addicted
or
mentally
ill
poorer
defendants
of
color
an
interest
convergence
that
likely
contributed
in
large
measure
to
the
emergence
and
widespread
popularity
of
specialized
criminal
courts
will
be
able
to
sustain
a
legitimate
alternative
sentencing
regime
only
if
all
defendants
irrespective
of
socioeconomic
status
or
race
have
equal
access
to
favorable
diversionary
sentences
n
separately
there
is
the
problem
of
potentially
legitimating
the
management
of
particular
social
challenges
through
criminal
law
by
vesting
more
authority
in
specialized
criminal
courts
to
address
social
problems
n
these
are
all
genuine
and
profoundly
concerning
problems
associated
with
a
specialized
criminal
courts
law
reform
strategy
there
are
several
ways
in
which
a
decarceration
model
may
attempt
to
address
these
issues
at
the
outset
awareness
of
and
careful
attention
to
the
associated
risks
may
help
to
minimize
their
occurrence
and
impact
in
the
event
the
problems
identified
come
to
pass
for
example
ongoing
empirical
monitoring
may
track
any
racial
or
class
disproportion
as
it
arises
and
direct
attention
to
the
areas
where
the
problem
is
greatest
so
that
it
might
be
addressed
explicitly
focusing
institutional
actors
on
confronting
racial
disparities
in
referral
termination
or
wherever
else
they
are
occurring
ultimately
many
of
the
pathologies
in
u
s
criminal
law
administration
have
to
do
with
race
and
with
racialization
of
the
category
of
the
criminal
defendant
or
incarcerated
person
so
meaningful
criminal
law
reform
will
almost
certainly
require
grappling
intensively
with
the
racial
dimensions
of
criminal
law
enforcement
n
insofar
as
a
decarceration
model
seeks
to
unwind
harsh
punishment
and
incarceration
generally
this
approach
may
serve
more
broadly
to
call
into
question
exceedingly
punitive
criminal
law
frameworks
both
for
those
defendants
in
specialized
courts
and
those
in
conventional
courts
movement
of
judges
between
conventional
and
specialized
criminal
courts
may
also
serve
to
limit
stratification
of
the
two
systems
n
admittedly
however
these
cautionary
efforts
may
prove
inadequate
even
so
in
taking
stock
of
these
legitimation
costs
as
well
as
the
other
problems
considered
in
this
part
it
is
crucial
to
compare
the
problems
presented
on
a
decarceration
model
with
a
the
limits
of
the
other
competing
reformist
models
of
specialized
criminal
law
administration
considered
earlier
in
this
article
and
then
to
compare
each
of
these
to
b
the
status
quo
in
conventional
criminal
case
processing
in
the
united
states
that
is
the
limits
of
a
decarceration
model
or
other
specialized
criminal
law
reformist
model
should
be
considered
as
compared
not
just
to
the
objector
s
preferred
utopian
alternative
but
relative
to
the
status
quo
in
u
s
criminal
law
administration
n
procedural
protections
may
be
found
wanting
on
a
decarceration
model
but
are
these
protections
more
meaningfully
enforced
in
the
standard
criminal
courts
where
well
over
ninety
percent
of
criminal
cases
end
in
a
plea
following
proceedings
the
character
of
which
malcolm
feeley
powerfully
captured
in
his
book
the
process
is
the
punishment
n
is
the
liberty
infringing
character
of
surveillance
on
a
decarceration
model
more
onerous
than
in
prisons
and
jails
where
many
more
specialized
court
participants
might
well
be
were
the
courts
to
be
disbanded
retributivists
must
consider
too
the
relative
achievement
of
retributive
goals
in
the
specialized
criminal
court
setting
as
compared
to
the
standard
criminal
process
which
feeley
described
decades
ago
as
follows
and
which
remains
in
these
respects
unimproved
t
rials
are
rare
events
and
even
protracted
plea
bargaining
is
an
exception
jammed
every
morning
with
a
new
mass
of
arrestees
t
hese
courts
are
chaotic
and
confusing
officials
communicate
in
a
verbal
short
hand
wholly
unintelligible
to
the
accused
and
accuser
alike
and
they
seem
to
make
arbitrary
decisions
sending
one
person
to
jail
and
freeing
the
next
but
for
the
most
part
they
are
lenient
they
sentence
few
people
to
jail
and
impose
few
large
fines
judges
bored
by
their
jobs
become
callous
toward
defendants
who
are
so
different
from
themselves
prosecutors
dulled
by
their
repetitive
work
appear
to
be
vindictive
defense
attorneys
depressed
by
feelings
that
their
efforts
are
not
appreciated
can
easily
begin
to
treat
their
clients
carelessly
n
and
this
picture
is
not
unique
to
the
second
half
of
the
twentieth
century
when
feeley
wrote
his
study
of
the
new
haven
criminal
courts
decades
earlier
roscoe
pound
decried
a
similar
set
of
ills
which
persist
after
what
is
now
approaching
a
century
of
efforts
to
improve
conventional
criminal
law
administration
the
bad
physical
surroundings
the
confusion
the
want
of
decorum
the
undignified
offhand
disposition
of
cases
at
high
speed
the
frequent
suggestion
of
something
working
behind
the
scenes
create
in
the
minds
of
observers
a
general
suspicion
of
the
whole
process
of
law
enforcement
n
more
recently
in
his
study
of
the
chicago
criminal
courts
investigative
journalist
steve
bogira
sounded
strikingly
similar
notes
every
day
chicago
police
wagons
swing
onto
the
grounds
of
the
cook
county
criminal
courthouse
and
deposit
their
cargo
at
a
rear
door
the
prisoners
being
unloaded
are
here
for
the
usual
reasons
they
tried
to
buy
heroin
from
an
undercover
cop
they
pocketed
a
fifth
of
booze
at
a
grocery
and
failed
to
outrun
the
security
guard
the
courtroom
staff
works
reflexively
not
reflectively
the
workers
have
no
time
to
give
much
thought
to
any
but
the
most
extraordinary
case
or
to
examine
what
they
are
doing
j
ustice
miscarries
every
day
by
doing
precisely
what
we
ask
it
to
n
the
bottom
line
is
that
the
status
quo
to
which
a
decarceration
model
should
be
compared
absent
a
viable
alternative
reform
proposal
is
a
status
quo
that
is
deeply
inadequate
whether
one
is
concerned
about
procedural
justice
liberty
racial
disproportionality
or
retributive
punishment
because
these
challenges
are
not
unique
to
specialized
criminal
courts
but
rather
reflect
problems
associated
with
conventional
criminal
law
administration
it
is
no
answer
to
simply
jettison
specialized
criminal
courts
and
revert
to
conventional
criminal
law
frameworks
still
given
the
myriad
perils
associated
with
the
competing
models
of
specialized
criminal
courts
elaborated
in
part
i
the
question
invariably
comes
to
mind
are
the
potential
benefits
of
a
decarceration
model
worth
the
risks
identified
in
specialized
criminal
courts
in
the
preceding
pages
this
article
s
short
answer
is
yes
yes
that
is
if
the
courts
are
able
to
employ
the
three
strategies
elaborated
here
and
in
which
some
specialized
criminal
courts
are
actively
engaged
reframing
social
understandings
of
crime
punishment
and
its
alternatives
institutionally
reshaping
the
courts
and
associated
agencies
themselves
and
effecting
systemic
change
shifting
a
wide
range
of
social
concerns
to
other
sectors
better
equipped
to
address
the
problems
at
hand
conclusion
in
this
moment
of
increased
openness
to
thoroughgoing
criminal
law
reform
after
decades
of
escalating
criminal
sentences
thousands
of
specialized
criminal
courts
have
emerged
across
the
country
and
around
the
globe
these
courts
have
become
the
location
of
a
contest
between
competing
criminal
law
models
certain
models
at
work
in
specialized
criminal
courts
are
configured
in
such
a
way
that
threatens
to
produce
a
series
of
unintended
and
undesirable
consequences
increased
and
unnecessary
criminal
supervision
diminished
procedural
safeguards
and
potentially
even
increased
incarceration
but
a
less
predominant
criminal
law
reformist
model
a
decarceration
model
may
provide
a
way
of
developing
different
approaches
to
certain
of
the
social
problems
currently
managed
through
criminal
law
the
greatest
promise
of
a
decarceration
model
if
it
succeeds
at
engendering
a
certain
degree
of
cognitive
reframing
institutional
reinvention
and
systemic
change
is
to
remove
particular
categories
of
offenses
and
offenders
from
conventional
criminal
courts
to
be
addressed
both
more
effectively
and
more
humanely
elsewhere
primary
candidates
for
such
removal
through
existing
specialized
criminal
courts
include
drug
offenders
mentally
ill
persons
and
individuals
suffering
the
post
traumatic
stress
of
war
removal
of
these
matters
to
other
sectors
would
reduce
volume
pressures
on
conventional
criminal
courts
so
that
they
might
more
meaningfully
and
fairly
address
the
relatively
few
cases
of
serious
violent
and
property
crime
for
which
alternative
processes
seem
inappropriate
or
would
be
exceedingly
unpopular
these
more
serious
criminal
matters
may
not
be
handled
best
in
the
standard
criminal
process
either
but
we
have
yet
to
identify
a
better
approach
in
due
course
if
specialized
criminal
courts
set
in
motion
some
measure
of
systemic
change
in
criminal
law
administration
they
may
both
focus
and
improve
responses
in
cases
of
serious
crime
and
simultaneously
improve
community
economic
development
accessible
public
health
services
employment
and
more
generally
human
well
being
it
is
also
possible
that
specialized
criminal
courts
will
achieve
none
of
these
things
that
their
perils
rather
than
their
possibilities
will
be
their
legacy
but
given
the
grave
inadequacies
and
injustices
of
the
status
quo
in
u
s
criminal
law
administration
these
courts

sociologist
robert
sampson
and
criminologist
john
laub
found
that
the
majority
of
men
we
interviewed
desisted
from
crime
largely
because
they
were
able
to
capitalize
on
key
structural
and
situational
circumstances
they
often
selected
these
structural
and
situational
circumstances
for
example
they
decided
to
get
married
get
that
job
hang
out
with
those
friends
but
those
institutions
and
relations
in
turn
influenced
the
men
as
well
men
who
desisted
from
crime
were
embedded
in
structured
routines
socially
bonded
to
others
and
were
virtually
and
directly
supervised
and
monitored
in
other
words
structures
situations
and

is
that
