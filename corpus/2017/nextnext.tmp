introduction
a
major
law
and
policy
debate
shaping
the
contemporary
landscape
of
racial
inequality
today
concerns
police
whom
critics
assail
as
a
major
source
of
racial
inequity
and
whose
unions
are
said
to
be
the
major
obstacle
to
reform
critics
often
cite
a
recent
instance
in
which
a
police
officer
who
engaged
in
appalling
misconduct
escapes
firing
or
discipline
through
the
intervention
of
a
union
or
by
invoking
a
statutory
or
contractual
job
protection
the
many
recent
instances
of
police
killing
civilians
when
darren
wilson
shot
michael
brown
in
ferguson
missouri
n
or
when
daniel
pantaleo
choked
eric
garner
to
death
on
a
staten
island
street
n
or
when
baltimore
police
officers
killed
freddie
gray
while
driving
him
to
jail
n
or
when
peter
liang
shot
akai
gurley
in
the
stairwell
of
a
new
york
apartment
building
n
or
when
jeronimo
yanez
shot
philando
castile
during
a
traffic
stop
in
suburban
st
paul
n
or
when
jeffrey
cook
and
omar
thyme
shot
alexia
christian
in
the
back
of
an
atlanta
police
car
n
or
when
five
police
officers
shot
and
killed
kisha
michael
in
her
car
while
she
was
unconscious
n
have
sparked
calls
to
fire
and
prosecute
the
officers
involved
and
outrage
at
the
difficulty
and
delays
in
doing
so
and
at
the
union
s
resistance
to
summary
discipline
people
rightly
wonder
why
the
union
conceives
of
its
obligation
as
protecting
cops
who
appear
to
have
engaged
in
clear
misconduct
rather
than
protecting
the
interests
of
good
ones
by
allowing
bad
ones
to
be
disciplined
fired
or
prosecuted
under
this
analysis
public
employee
unions
are
a
major
impediment
to
the
kinds
of
reforms
that
would
eliminate
pervasive
racism
toward
people
of
color
and
the
urban
poor
n
for
their
part
many
rank
and
file
police
officers
see
the
union
as
an
important
protection
against
endemic
arbitrariness
in
discipline
as
we
discuss
in
part
ii
police
union
leaders
believe
they
are
legally
and
morally
obliged
to
advocate
for
their
members
including
those
accused
of
misconduct
and
to
resist
efforts
to
strengthen
the
power
of
management
to
discipline
officers
in
part
because
union
leaders
are
elected
by
the
membership
many
are
reluctant
to
publicly
question
the
legality
of
their
members
behavior
and
some
dismiss
criticisms
as
reflecting
anti
police
attitudes
if
police
union
officials
have
any
private
reservations
they
feel
constrained
by
their
role
to
remain
publicly
silent
at
the
very
least
and
often
describe
criminal
punishment
of
officers
who
kill
as
being
politically
motivated
efforts
to
scapegoat
individual
officers
for
systemic
problems
n
in
their
view
what
appears
to
outsiders
to
be
egregious
police
violence
is
in
fact
a
justifiable
reaction
to
dangerous
suspects
bad
management
and
difficult
working
conditions
and
the
union
s
role
is
to
protect
hard
working
officers
from
a
witch
hunt
so
that
officers
can
protect
the
public
in
depth
investigations
of
police
departments
in
the
wake
of
highly
publicized
incidents
of
police
violence
since
provide
support
for
the
views
of
both
police
union
critics
and
police
union
leaders
for
instance
in
january
the
department
of
justice
doj
issued
a
scathing
report
doj
chicago
report
finding
among
other
things
that
the
chicago
police
department
cpd
engaged
in
a
pattern
and
practice
of
unreasonable
uses
of
force
and
that
there
is
no
meaningful
systemic
accountability
for
officers
who
use
force
in
violation
of
the
law
or
cpd
policy
n
in
part
these
accountability
failures
are
due
to
collective
bargaining
agreements
between
the
city
and
the
unions
that
contain
provisions
impeding
the
investigation
of
alleged
police
misconduct
n
however
the
doj
concluded
that
the
cpd
bears
some
responsibility
for
these
accountability
failures
among
other
things
the
doj
chicago
report
states
that
the
contracts
allow
cpd
to
override
some
of
the
problematic
contract
provisions
but
management
rarely
does
so
n
the
august
report
of
the
doj
investigation
of
the
baltimore
city
police
department
doj
baltimore
report
faults
both
the
rank
and
file
and
supervisors
for
the
pattern
of
unconstitutional
stops
searches
arrests
and
excessive
force
the
severe
and
unjustified
racial
disparities
harming
african
americans
and
retaliation
against
civilians
and
police
officers
who
speak
out
about
abuses
n
the
doj
baltimore
report
criticizes
certain
statutory
and
contractual
job
protections
which
police
unions
fought
hard
to
attain
and
vigorously
defend
but
it
also
describes
shocking
incidents
of
managerial
neglect
and
retaliation
of
the
sort
that
prompt
employees
to
join
and
defend
unions
in
the
first
place
n
although
the
doj
baltimore
report
takes
no
position
on
that
city
s
police
union
as
we
explain
below
in
section
ii
b
past
doj
civil
rights
interventions
and
consent
decrees
have
encountered
unions
as
obstacles
to
implementation
of
reform
many
proposed
reforms
entail
creating
mechanisms
of
institutionalized
cooperation
between
rank
and
file
and
management
that
unions
may
be
uniquely
capable
of
delivering
as
we
argue
below
in
section
iii
b
such
reforms
will
not
succeed
if
they
fail
to
consider
why
unions
have
not
previously
advocated
such
mechanisms
or
why
they
might
resist
them
the
debates
over
police
unions
are
part
of
a
larger
legal
and
policy
debate
over
whether
public
employee
unions
are
agents
of
or
obstacles
to
government
reform
particularly
because
local
government
employees
including
police
are
among
the
most
densely
unionized
in
the
country
n
a
standard
criticism
of
government
employee
unions
is
that
they
exercise
disproportionate
influence
in
setting
government
policy
n
until
the
passing
of
justice
scalia
the
supreme
court
appeared
to
be
on
the
path
to
reduce
union
power
n
and
the
court
with
justice
gorsuch
is
expected
to
continue
down
that
path
n
moreover
legislatures
in
many
states
have
eliminated
the
ability
of
some
government
employees
to
bargain
collectively
and
narrowed
the
permissible
subjects
of
bargaining
for
those
employees
who
retain
union
rights
at
all
and
these
reductions
in
the
power
of
public
employee
unions
are
often
described
as
being
necessary
to
reduce
the
cost
and
improve
the
quality
of
government
service
n
concern
about
the
influence
of
public
employee
unions
is
not
confined
to
the
political
right
as
activists
and
scholars
have
focused
criticism
on
union
contractual
provisions
protecting
officers
investigated
for
excessive
use
of
force
n
perhaps
no
issue
has
been
more
controversial
in
the
discussion
of
police
union
responses
to
allegations
of
excessive
force
than
statutory
and
contractual
protections
for
officers
accused
of
misconduct
as
critics
have
assailed
such
protections
and
police
unions
defend
them
n
police
in
most
states
enjoy
significantly
more
procedural
and
substantive
protections
against
discipline
for
on
the
job
and
off
the
job
misconduct
than
do
private
sector
employees
as
government
employees
police
have
constitutional
due
process
rights
if
as
a
matter
of
state
or
local
law
or
practice
they
have
an
expectation
of
continued
employment
sufficient
to
create
a
property
interest
in
the
job
n
they
have
constitutional
immunity
from
use
in
a
criminal
prosecution
of
a
statement
made
during
an
internal
administrative
investigation
when
the
officer
was
compelled
to
speak
under
penalty
of
job
discipline
n
they
also
have
a
limited
first
amendment
right
to
be
free
from
retaliation
for
political
activity
off
the
job
unless
the
municipality
has
adopted
a
valid
nondiscriminatory
law
prohibiting
partisan
political
activity
n
in
at
least
sixteen
states
police
additionally
have
statutory
rights
to
certain
procedures
in
the
investigation
of
misconduct
under
law
enforcement
officers
bills
of
rights
leobors
as
well
as
civil
service
protections
in
many
other
states
n
supplementing
these
constitutional
and
statutory
protections
are
police
union
contracts
which
contain
additional
procedural
and
substantive
protections
against
discipline
n
the
public
controversy
gives
new
urgency
to
consideration
of
the
role
of
police
unions
in
promoting
or
thwarting
police
reform
n
scholars
of
policing
have
debated
police
professionalization
and
community
policing
and
have
discussed
the
relationship
between
policing
and
democracy
but
have
as
police
scholar
samuel
walker
put
it
seriously
neglected
police
unions
n
the
substantial
social
science
literature
on
policing
and
police
unions
has
rarely
engaged
with
public
sector
labor
law
other
than
to
note
that
collective
bargaining
rights
are
positively
correlated
with
increased
compensation
and
job
protections
n
although
labor
law
provides
important
opportunities
for
and
constraints
on
organizational
change
in
police
departments
n
police
unions
and
police
union
contractual
protections
have
been
neglected
in
labor
law
scholarship
n
a
particular
concern
of
labor
law
has
been
whether
and
how
unionization
can
improve
the
quality
of
work
for
the
benefit
of
consumers
of
goods
and
services
while
simultaneously
protecting
the
dignity
and
standard
of
living
of
workers
n
but
more
work
remains
to
be
done
in
thinking
about
police
unions
and
public
sector
labor
law
as
offering
leverage
or
resistance
to
change
in
short
although
there
is
a
general
scholarly
consensus
that
police
unions
play
an
important
role
in
policing
and
politics
there
is
no
agreement
concerning
their
proper
role
and
there
has
been
almost
no
sustained
analysis
of
the
role
they
might
play
in
police
reform
n
the
scholarly
deficit
has
substantial
public
policy
consequences
as
groups
ranging
from
black
lives
matter
to
the
u
s
doj
are
proposing
legal
changes
that
will
require
the
cooperation
of
police
labor
organizations
to
implement
notwithstanding
a
long
history
of
police
rank
and
file
resistance
to
imposition
of
reforms
without
their
input
n
in
public
policy
debates
and
in
the
nascent
legal
scholarship
on
policing
in
the
wake
of
the
recent
spate
of
police
violence
that
spawned
the
black
lives
matter
movement
many
have
advocated
restricting
the
job
protections
for
police
officers
in
order
to
facilitate
the
detection
and
punishment
of
criminal
police
violence
reform
is
essential
but
reform
will
not
be
accomplished
simply
by
eliminating
job
protections
even
if
that
were
politically
feasible
without
support
from
unions
and
some
police
rank
and
file
the
kinds
of
reforms
that
are
now
being
proposed
e
g
public
involvement
in
union
management
negotiation
of
disciplinary
procedures
n
are
unlikely
to
be
enacted
or
implemented
rather
police
need
to
be
involved
in
improving
police
practices
and
that
involvement
requires
the
cooperation
of
some
kind
of
police
labor
representative
this
article
explains
how
public
sector
labor
law
might
be
changed
to
enable
activists
outside
of
police
departments
to
find
allies
within
police
departments
to
support
reforms
it
does
not
propose
specific
policy
reforms
about
policing
rather
it
proposes
structural
reform
to
police
union
representation
and
the
duty
to
meet
and
confer
in
order
to
enable
policy
reforms
to
be
adopted
and
importantly
implemented
in
particular
this
article
proposes
that
state
public
sector
labor
law
be
amended
to
require
police
departments
to
meet
and
confer
with
labor
representatives
other
than
the
certified
police
union
this
modified
form
of
minority
union
bargaining
would
ideally
enable
the
minority
of
officers
in
a
department
who
favor
reform
to
discuss
police
practices
even
if
the
majority
union
prefers
not
to
or
is
legally
prohibited
from
negotiating
over
those
practices
the
minority
union
could
be
any
organization
the
officers
choose
to
represent
them
it
might
be
an
existing
police
officers
affinity
group
e
g
the
local
or
national
black
latino
women
s
or
other
officers
association
or
a
black
lives
matter
chapter
or
any
other
group
whom
a
significant
number
of
officers
in
a
department
select
the
scope
of
the
duty
to
confer
would
encompass
topics
that
are
not
mandatory
subjects
of
bargaining
under
most
state
s
labor
law
including
use
of
force
policing
techniques
and
community
relations
the
minority
union
would
have
no
authority
to
modify
the
terms
of
the
collective
bargaining
agreement
negotiated
by
the
majority
union
the
point
of
minority
union
bargaining
would
be
to
give
the
rank
and
file
a
voice
in
policing
policy
without
undermining
the
economic
and
other
terms
that
management
negotiated
with
the
majority
union
n
a
limited
form
of
minority
union
bargaining
a
reform
that
has
been
advocated
in
other
contexts
by
both
the
political
left
and
the
political
right
at
various
points
in
recent
history

create
an
institutional
structure
enabling
diverse
representatives
of
police
rank
and
file
to
meet
and
confer
with
police
management
over
policing
practices
although
it
might
weaken
the
power
of
the
majority
union
as
any
form
of
minority
or
dual
unionism
necessarily
does
it
would
facilitate
rank
and

support
of
the
kinds
of

little

in
part
due

will
remain
at
this

careers
n
this
hierarchy
has
important
implications
for
unions
we
argue
because
officers
turn
to
unions
to
protect
their
interests
since
they
otherwise
have
little
voice
in
the
operation
of
the

the
prevailing

n
the
prevailing
belief
is
that
the
rank

be
strictly
controlled
and
monitored
in

to
ensure
compliance
n
police
managers
worry
about
laziness
corruption
racial
profiling
and
excessive
force

they
do
not
trust
rank

officers
on
any
of
those
dimensions
n
in
the
face
of
continued
scandals
and
charges
of
inequity
police
administrators
tend
to
maintain
an
almost
phobic
preoccupation
with
accountability
and
conformity
n
although
management
focuses
intensely
on
control
and
conformity
with
policy
police
work
inevitably
requires
the
exercise
of
discretion
n
the
judgment
and
discretion
that
most
police
officers
and
management
would
agree
is
essential
to
good
policing
means
that
precise
rules
cannot
always
be
followed
general
rules
do
not
provide
meaningful
guidance
n
and
policies
are
therefore
not
consistently
enforced
flexibility
opens
the
door
to
arbitrariness
and
discrimination
this
is
one
reason
why
the
relationship
between
line
officers
and
management
has
been
described
as
one
dominated
by
a
feeling
of
uncertainty
n

fear
punitive
enforcement
of
policy

often
perceive

as
being
not
on

to
blame
them
when
things
go
wrong
n
rank
and

officers
in

departments
do
not
trust

mete
out

rampart
division
n
the
league
did
not
trust
the
lapd
to
conduct
a
fair
and
thorough
investigation
and
feared
the
union
and
some
officers
might
be
scapegoated
for
a
corruption
scandal
that
they
thought
was
a
symptom
of
a
larger
problem
professor
chemerinsky
s
analysis
of
the
lapd
s
report
on
the
rampart
division
found
that
virtually
everyone
except
the
chief
of
police
and
the
board
of
inquiry
is
dissatisfied
with
the
current
disciplinary
system
n
concerns
included
perceptions
that
the
chief
controlled
the
system
and
used
it
to
protect
command
staff
and
persecute
whistleblowers
and
minority
officers
n
nearly
fifteen
years
later
similar
perceptions
persist
in
an
overwhelming
number
of
lapd
rank
and
file
officers
still
believed
that
management
s
disciplinary
decisions
revolved
around
an
officer
s
rank
and
whether
he
or
she
was
well
liked
by
their
superiors
in
the
department
officers
believed
that
c
ommand
level
officers
routinely
received
slaps
on
the
wrist
or
no
punishment
while
lower
ranking
officers
were
suspended
for
similar
misconduct
n
similarly
in
the
doj
found
that
the
baltimore
police
department
failed
to
apply
discipline
consistently
throughout
our
interviews
and
ride
alongs
with
officers
we
heard
officers
express
that
discipline
is
only
imposed
if
an
incident
makes
it
into
the
press
or
if
you
were
on
the
wrong
side
of
a
supervisor
not
because
of
the
magnitude
of
the
misconduct
n
empirical
studies
of
police
stress
find
that
the
indignities
of
poor
employment
practices
arbitrary
decision
making
poor
working
conditions
feeling
lack
of
support
from
supervisors
cause
more
stress
to
officers

other
potentially
traumatic
events
involving
police
work

commentary
on
police
legitimacy

publicly
reprimanded
for
playing
football

youngsters
at
a
fourth
of
july
celebration
at
a
low
income
housing
project
observed
that
police
officers
react
to
arbitrary
power
in
the
same
way
that
citizens
do
when
they
are
policed
with
ambivalence
about
the
institution
and
resistance
or
hostility
toward
the
rules
of
that
institution
n
as
one
policing
scholar
observed
officers
come
to
find
out
that
when
they
are
recognized
it
is
usually
for
something
that
they
have
done
wrong
procedurally
rather
than
for
something
they
have
done
well
substantively
officers
are
constrained
working
within
an
organization
that
demands
that
all
problems
be
handled
on
the
street
with
efficiency
and
certainty
yet
held
to
excessive
scrutiny
by
watchful
administrators
at
a
later
date
n
in
sum
police
scholars
note
that
rank
and
file
officers
often
perceive
their
departments
as
a
mock
bureaucracy
capricious
unpredictable
and
punitive
rather
than
democratic
and
fair
n
although
the
reality
is
that
both
management
and
the
rank
and
file
understand
that
rules
cannot
guide
their
behavior
in
all
instances
any
violation
no
matter
how
small
can
still
result
in
punishment
n
thus
the
rank
and
file
views
management
s
fixation
on
rule
following
in
the
face
of
these
contradictions
as
illegitimate
n
the
result
is
that
management
officers
are
perceived
as
mere
disciplinarians
and
are
often
viewed
by
the
line
personnel
with
distrust
and
even
contempt
n
in
light
of
this
focus
on
control
and
discipline
of
rank
and
file
officers
for
conduct
like
playing
football
with
kids
that
seems
desirable
or
at
least
benign
police
unions
often
focus
their
bargaining
and
contract
enforcement
efforts
toward
protecting
officers
from
discipline
and
arbitrary
work
assignments
fighting
for
compensation
and
ensuring
compliance
with
seniority
rules
among
other
labor
interests
n
although
these
negative
perceptions
of
management
s
motives
could
be
tempered
by
contact
rank
and
file
officers
have
few
opportunities
to
interact
with
top
command
outside
of
the
context
of
punishment
n
they
have
little
direct
communication
with
top
level
management
because
the
information
flow
is
almost
exclusively
downwards
through
the
chain
of
command
and
not
the
opposite
n
this
isolation
from
top
command
increases
the
risk
of
miscommunication
misunderstandings
and
resentment
and
it
also
leads
police
unions
to
adopt
a
highly
defensive
approach
to
union
management
relations
n
the
rank
and
file
s
shared
perception
that
management
s
exercises
of
power
are
illegitimate
coupled
with
their
isolation
from
top
command
facilitates
the
creation
of
a
subculture
amongst
the
rank
and
file
with
its
own
political
life
that
remains
largely
hidden
from
management
n
amongst
the
rank
and
file
there
is
a
rare
degree
of
camaraderie
and
group
loyalty
n
that
is
partly
the
result
of
having
to
confront
unpredictable
and
punitive
supervisory
oversight
n
in
short
scholars
agree
that
management
and
the
rank
and
file
have
their
own
distinct
cultures
n
and
that
the
relationship
between
them
is
often
characterized
by
mutual
suspicion
and
mistrust
n
as
will
be
explored
below
in
section
i
c
police
officers
responded
to
this
kind
of
hierarchical
and
punitive
supervisory
structure
by
forming
unions
and
many
police
officers
are
quite
dedicated
unionists
precisely
because
they
see
the
union
as
necessary
to
protect
their
interests
in
fair
process
and
in
having
a
voice
in
the
workplace
b
from
professionalism
to
community
policing
the
contemporary
emphasis
on
hierarchy
and
adherence
to
rules
was
the
product
of
mid
twentieth
century
reforms
that
attempted
to
combat
police
corruption
by
professionalizing
police
work
in
the
late
nineteenth
century
police
were
closely
tied
to
their
communities
were
under
the
control
of
local
political
machines
engaged
in
foot
patrols
and
often
lived
in
the
communities
they
policed
n
the
close
connection
to
the
community
and
its
political
machinery
was
believed
to
lead
to
police
corruption
n
to
sever
police
hiring
promotion
and
control
from
the
local
political
machine
early
twentieth
century
local
government
reformers
sought
to
professionalize
the
police
n
professionalism
did
not
refer
to
giving
individual
rank
and
file
officers
more
autonomy
and
discretion
n
rather
it
referred
to
reducing
political
influence
over
police
and
improving
police
efficiency
n
a
crucial
aspect
of
the
professionalism
project
was
to
define
the
core
mission
of
the
police
as
crime
control
thereby
insulating
officers
from
political
influence
and
corruption
by
distancing
them
from
the
community
n
once
the
official
function
of
the
police
was
crime
control
departments
moved
away
from
crime
prevention
except
as
an
outcome
of
arrest
peacekeeping
order
maintenance
and
the
provision
of
social
and
emergency
services
n
this
along
with
the
isolation
of
officers
from
citizens
that
was
thought
necessary
to
combat
corruption
contributed
to
what
various
scholars
characterize
as
officer
alienation
from
the
citizens
they
serve
officers
self
conception
as
crime
fighters
and
the
thin
blue
line
and
a
warrior
mentality
n
an
important
goal
of
the
professionalism
era
was
to
control
rank
and
file
officers
leading
to
extensive
and
strict
rules
to
govern
their
conduct
increased
surveillance
and
oversight
of
officers
and
reduced
rank
and
file
officer
discretion
n
the
control
of
the
rank
and
file
did
not
end
with
their
work
related
duties
police
management
also
attempted
to
control
the
personal
lives
of
officers
in
order
to
reduce
the
opportunities
for
corruption
n
officers
were
prohibited
from
living
in
the
areas
they
policed
from
incurring
debts
or
from
being
involved
in
businesses
in
their
areas
as
well
as
required
to
declare
the
business
interests
of
their
families
n
some
departments
went
even
further
to
de
personalize
policing
by
frequently
reassigning
patrol
officers
to
new
neighborhoods
far
removed
from
the
neighborhoods
where
officers
lived
n
these
and
a
host
of
other
controls
helped
spur
the
creation
of
police
unions
n
a
new
model
of
policing
known
as
community
policing
emerged
in
the
late
s
and
early
s
n
to
put
officers
back
into
relationships
with
the
community
and
to
transform
rank
and
file
officers
into
problem
solvers
n
community
policing
is
a
broad
concept
used
to
describe
a
wide
variety
of
policing
approaches
n
two
common
themes
among
them
are
that
power
is
pushed
to
officers
at
the
lower
levels
of
the
organization
and
that
there
is
increased
involvement
with
the
community
n
some
versions
of
community
policing
embrace
the
idea
that
the
social
work
aspects
of
policing
are
important
n
and
encourage
officers
to
attempt
to
determine
the
root
causes
of
crime
and
to
look
beyond
the
criminal
justice
system
to
solve
them
n
today
most
departments
claim
that
they
are
engaged
in
community
policing
n
yet
police
continue
to
follow
professionalism
era
practices
for
a
variety
of
reasons
including
the
growth
in
quantitative
measures
of
job
performance
and
the
so
called
war
on
drugs
n
the
set
of
legal
and
policy
changes
known
as
the
war
on
drugs
sought
to
eliminate
drug
sales
and
use
through
massive
drug
arrests
and
other
proactive
policing
strategies
as
many
scholars
observed
the
war
on
drugs
fueled
racial
disparities
in
arrest
rates
and
exacerbated
negative
relationships
between
the
police
and
communities
of
color
n
both
community
policing
and
the
proactive
policing
strategies
associated
with
drug
enforcement
policy
required
departments
to
gather
information
in
order
to
analyze
problems
and
technological
change
enabled
police
departments
to
collect
data
and
use
data
analysis
in
personnel
management
on
an
unprecedented
scale
n
this
had
significant
consequences
for
how
police
departments
managed
line
officers
and
how
officers
responded
n
quantitative
measures
rapidly
became
one
of
the
most
significant
elements
of
contemporary
evaluation
of
police
officer
job
performance
the
reliance
on
counting
stops
arrests
and
other
measures
of
law
enforcement
vigor
originated
in
new
york
under
the
leadership
of
william
bratton
a
proponent
of
the
broken
windows
theory
of
policing
n
the
broken
windows
idea
was
that
the
police
could
cut
down
on
serious
crimes
by
making
it
clear
that
even
the
trivial
ones
wouldn
t
go
unpunished
n
to
ensure
that
the
rank
and
file
implemented
this
philosophy
especially
in
neighborhoods
inhabited
by
indigent
people
of
color
the
new
york
police
department
nypd
developed
a
management
system
that
kept
careful
track
of
arrest
and
crime
statistics
throughout
the
city
the
system
was
called
compstat
short
for
compare
statistics
n
the
sharp
decline
in
the
number
of
murders
in
new
york
in
the
late
s
coincided
with
the
adoption
of
compstat
and
so
cities
across
the
united
states
embraced
it
and
hired
chiefs
and
consultants
committed
to
implementing
it
with
the
result
that
most
large
american
cities
now
use
some
form
of
compstat
n
although
some
credited
compstat
for
falling
murder
and
violent
crime
rates
by
the
early
s
doubters
began
to
question
whether
broken
windows
policing
and
the
compstat
measure
of
police
work
was
the
cause
and
some
voiced
doubts
about
the
effects
it
had
on
police
behavior
n
eli
silverman
a
police
studies
professor
at
john
jay
college
of
criminal
justice
who
had
been
an
early
supporter
of
compstat
had
received
a
number
of
letters
from
nypd
officers
saying
that
compstat
was
not
all
that
it
seemed
n
silverman
and
a
fellow
criminologist
and
retired
nypd
captain
john
eterno
set
out
to
study
how
the
system
worked
n
they
surveyed
more
than
retired
nypd
officers
in
and
and
found
that
compstat
had
a
substantial
effect
on
police
work
but
it
was
not
uniformly
positive
n
they
learned
that
during
the
compstat
era
officers
were
twice
as
likely
as
their
predecessors
to
say
that
they
had
been
under
pressure
to
increase
arrests
and
three
times
as
likely
to
say
they
experienced
pressure
to
issue
more
summonses
n
most
of
this
activity
took
place
in
minority
neighborhoods
in
predominantly
black
bedford
stuyvesant
brooklyn
for
example
officers
issued
more
than
summonses
a
year
between
and
to
people
riding
their
bicycles
on
the
sidewalk
but
an
average
of
eight
bike
tickets
a
year
in
predominantly
white
and
notably
bike
friendly
park
slope
n
the
new
york
civil
liberties
union
calculated
that
between
and
black
and
hispanic
people
were
more
than
four
times
as
likely
as
whites
to
receive
summonses
for
minor
violations
n
the
emphasis
on
evaluating
officers
according
to
arrests
summonses
and
stops
and
frisks
had
the
perhaps
unintended
consequence
of
dissuading
officers
from
using
innovative
approaches
to
crime
reduction
even
when
the
innovations
appeared
to
work
for
example
instead
of
praising
the
officer
who
developed
a
program
that
appeared
to
reduce
shoplifting
the
chief
told
him
to
get
more
numbers
n
as
one
officer
complained
you
don
t
get
recognized
and
rewarded
for
helping
a
homeless
person
get
permanent
housing
but
you
get
recognized
for
arresting
them
again
and
again
and
again
n
the
confluence
of
compstat
broken
windows
policing
and
the
war
on
drugs
not
only
created
increasingly
negative
relationships
between
the
police
and
communities
of
color
but
it
also
negatively
influenced
the
relationship
between
the
rank
and
file
and
police
management
compstat
with
the
pressure
it
put
on
management
to
reduce
the
crime
rate
led
to
management
pressure
on
rank
and
file
officers
to
perform
in
ways
that
could
be
measured
management
exercised
more
control
and
scrutiny
over
the
daily
work
behaviors
of
rank
and
file
officers
and
as
discussed
below
rank
and
file
officers
who
expressed
dissatisfaction
with
these
practices
were
threatened
with
poor
performance
evaluations
given
unpleasant
work
assignments
and
subjected
to
involuntary
transfers
and
other
negative
consequences
to
their
daily
work
life
for
all
these
reasons
rank
and
file
officers
turned
to
their
unions
for
protection
c
police
unions
as
a
response
to
police
management
and
police
department
structure
police
officers
today
belong
to
a
wide
array
of
organizations
to
represent
their
interests
although
in
labor
law
a
union
is
a
membership
organization
that

the

developed
from

are
typically
not

with
the

not
be
certified

the

also
belong
to
identity

police
organizations

sometimes
have
close

do
not
have
the
legal
right

bargain
collectively

their

does

they
may
nevertheless
play
an
informal
role
in
speaking
for
their
members
both
within

and

terms

and
the
involvement
of
police

in
the
political
and
policymaking
process
history
of
police
unions
police
officers
in
many
cities
began
joining
unions
in
the
late
nineteenth
and
early
twentieth
centuries
when
workers
in
every
industry
unionized
and
for
the
same
reasons
to
improve
pay
and
working
conditions
and
to
gain
some
measure
of
control
over
their
work
lives
n
police
in
boston
in
for
example
worked
regular
shifts
of
between
seventy
three
and
ninety
eight
hours
a
week
were
sometimes
required
to
remain
on
duty
seventeen
hours
a
day
had
to
buy
their
own
uniforms
and
did
not
receive
a
raise
between
and
even
though
the
cost
of
living
had
doubled
n
station
houses
were
unsanitary
n
supervisors
restricted
where
officers
could
go
on
their
scarce
free
time
n
equally
as
important
to
police
officers
and
government
reformers
was
the
idea
that
unions
might
reduce
endemic
corruption
in
local
government
n
john
commons
the
leading
labor
economist
of
the
early
twentieth
century
found
that
labor
organizing
among
municipal
employees
was
the
leading
antidote
to
political
machines
and
corruption
because
they
aided
reformers
in
local
government
to
set
wages
hours
and
working
conditions
without
regard
to
the
personal
economic
and
political
self
interest
of
city
leaders
n
but
business
and
anti
labor
groups
feared
that
unionized
police
would
strike
and
more
important
would
not
stop
other
employees
from
striking
and
picketing
when
boston
police
formed
a
union
and
affiliated
with
the
american
federation
of
labor
afl
in
august
n
the
chief
of
police
suspended
seventeen
union
leaders
and
two
policemen
the
chief
mistakenly
believed
were
union
leaders
in
protest
nearly
three
quarters
of
the
boston
police
walked
out
the
next
day
n
violence
and
looting
ensued
n
governor
calvin
coolidge
called
out
troopers
who
after
firing
into
the
crowd
killing
nine
and
wounding
twenty
three
more
stopped
the
looting
and
prevented
support
for
the
striking
police
from
turning
into
a
citywide
general
strike
n
the
violence
caused
a
panic
about
strikes
by
police
or
any
other
government
employees
which
resulted
in
the
collapse
of
all
afl
affiliated
police
union
locals
and
a
huge
backlash
against
government
employee
unions
generally
and
police
unions
in
particular
n
as
a
result
the
unionization
of
government
employees
that
had
begun
in
the
progressive
era
ground
to
a
halt
only
to
really
pick
up
steam
in
the
post
world
war
ii
period
as
government
employees
earnings
were
outstripped
by
factory
and
skilled
labor
earnings
and
the
growth
of
private
sector
unionization
eventually
made
it
seem
that
government
employee
unions
were
both
desirable
and
inevitable
n
police
officers
formed
local
unions
in
various
cities
in
the
s
and
some
police
unions
affiliated
with
national
labor
federations
including
the
american
federation
of
state

and

founded
in

some
with
the
national
federations
of
police
officers

the

order

founded
in

to
enact
laws

collective
bargaining

late

wisconsin
was
the
first
in

however
well
into
the
s
police
departments
routinely
fired
officers
who
attempted
to
unionize
n
and
courts
upheld
the
power
of
cities
to
ban
officers
from
joining
unions
n
in
the
absence
of
any
legal
right
to
unionize
or
bargain
collectively
government
employee
unions
became
adept
at
securing
their
members
interests
through
political
activity
and
negotiating
informal
agreements
with
public
officials
n
unions
finally
succeeded
in
gaining
a
lasting
foothold
in
american
police
departments
in
the
late
s
as
rank
and
file
officers
felt
attacked
by
the
civil
rights
movement
s
focus
on
police
brutality
and
racism
and
by
federal
court
decisions
limiting
police
officers
investigatory
and
arrest
powers
n
officers
also
did
not
have
protection
within
the
department
when
they
were
investigated
or
accused
of
misconduct
and
felt
they
had
no
way
to
present
grievances
to
management
n
furthermore
they
feared
that
civilian
review
boards
would
scapegoat
individual
rank
and
file
officers
for
practices
that
management
encouraged
or
even
required
n
then
as
now
officers
believed
that
discipline
was
meted
out
only
to
those
who
criticized
management
n
not
surprisingly
unions
representing
rank
and
file
officers
negotiated
for
contractual
protections
against
discipline
and
lobbied
legislators
to
incorporate
these
protections
in
legislation
including
leobors
n
they
sought
to
protect
officer
autonomy
effectiveness
and
safety
by
opposing
constitutional
criminal
procedure
restrictions
on
police
conduct
and
by
blocking
civilian
oversight
of
police
discipline
n
the
legacy
of
the
s
is
collective
bargaining
agreements
and
leobors
which
make
it
difficult
to
investigate
and
punish
officers
and
limited
civilian
oversight
all
of
which
can
impede
reform
efforts
n
elements
of
police
union
contracts
police
union
contracts
contain
provisions
regarding
wages

and
discipline
n
police
officers
like
all
government
employees
have
statutory
and
constitutional
rights
to
fair
treatment
in
personnel
decisions

police
protection
exceeds
that
provided
to
workers
in
other
industries
in

to
the
rights
enjoyed
by
all

employees
police

at

sixteen

special
statutory
protections
from

in

that
have
not
enacted

leobor
similar
provisions
are
often
included
in
union
contracts
n
as
a
matter
of
labor
law
in
most
states
unions
are
selected
and
govern
on
a
majority
rule
principle

that
principle
the

chosen
by
the
majority
of
employees
in
a
job
classification
or
department
what
is
generally
known
as
a
bargaining
unit
is
the
exclusive
representative
of
all
the
employees
in
that
unit
n
the
purpose
of
majority
rule
and
exclusive
representation
is
to
strengthen
and
legitimize
the
employee
representative
by
enabling
it
to
speak
with
one
voice
and
to
enable
the
employees
within
their
union
to
agree
on
priorities
and
resolve
differences
n
law
limits
the
ability
of
the
majority
representative
to
sacrifice
the
interests
of
the
minority
by
imposing
a
duty
of
fair
representation
which
requires
the
union
to
represent
all
employees
in
the
unit
fairly
and
competently
and
prohibits
the
union
and
its
officers
from
engaging
in
arbitrary
action
or
invidious
discrimination
against
individuals
or
the
minority
n
when
police
officers
gained
the
right
to
unionize
and
bargain
collectively
in
the
s
union
leadership
embraced
the
language
of
professionalism
that
police
management
and
an
earlier
generation
of
police
reformers
had
used
insisting
that
the
purpose
of
the
police
was
to
control
crime
n
however
police
unions
responded
to
the
extensive
rules
and
regulations
controlling
rank
and
file
behavior
by
negotiating
their
own
set
of
rules
and
regulations
to
protect
rank
and
file
officers
from
arbitrary
exercises
of
management
power
n
unions
challenged
exercises
of
managerial
prerogative
through
grievance
arbitration
and
protected
members
economic
interests
and
working
conditions
by
advocating
for
favorable
wages
and
benefits
job
security
hiring
retention
promotion
and
disciplinary
processes
and
access
to
good
jobs
shifts
assignments
and
overtime
n
as
one
labor
lawyer
opined
it
is
nearly
impossible
to
have
a
situation
in
which
a
creative
police
organizer
cannot
find
a
rule
regulation
guideline
budget
provision
benefit
program
rule
or
personnel
procedure
which
cannot
be
exploited
to
significantly
increase
the
rights
and
benefits
of
working
officers
n
professionalism
era
reforms
with
its
host
of
controls
not
only
helped
spur
the
creation
of
police
unions
but
also
were
directly
responsible
for
the
shape
and
functions
of
police
unions
as
well
n
police
collective
bargaining
agreements
look
in
part
like
the
labor
agreements
negotiated
by
a
wide
range
of
public
and
private
sector
unions
they
contain
provisions
governing
economic
terms
of
employment
including
wages
hours
sickness
and
vacation
leave
pensions
health
insurance
death
benefits
and
so
forth
n
there
are
typically
detailed
provisions
governing
overtime
compensation
payment
when
called
to
testify
compensation
for
purchasing
uniforms
and
the
right
to
have
protective
equipment
like
bullet
proof
vests
n
they
prohibit
discrimination
on
the
basis
of
union
membership
race
religion
gender
and
so
on
and
generally
require
just
cause
for
discipline
and
discharge
n
they
create
a
grievance
process
usually
culminating
in
arbitration
n
given
the
history
of
rank
and
file
concern
about
arbitrary
management
discipline
for
violations
of
detailed
rules
it
is
unsurprising
that
many
union
contracts
include
quite
specific
provisions
protecting
police
officers
in
discipline
cases
n
but
union
contracts
have
little
to
say
about
how
police
officers
actually
do
their
job
this
is
in
part
because
police
unions
like
other
public
and
private
sector
unions
in
the
s
focused
on
gaining
the
power
to
bargain
over
economic
issues
promotions
and
discipline
n
but
it
is
also
because
state
legislatures
courts
and
public
employee
relations
boards
insisted
that
it
is
the
province
of
management
to
decide
the
mission
and
methods
of
public
work
and
the
only
things
on
which
labor
has
a
right
to
negotiate
are
pay
promotion
and
protection
against
discipline
n
that
police
unions
adopted
a
narrow
conception
of
the
union
s
role
in
collaborating
with
management
about
policing
policy
and
tactics
is
not
surprising
given
the
dominant
conception
of
policing
and
the
business
unionism
of
the
mid
twentieth
century
the
top
down
hierarchy
in
police
departments
allowed
for
little
input
by
the
rank
and
file
and
labor
law
and
labor
policy
excluded
employees
from
meaningful
voice
in
the
goals
of
the
organization
n
an
example
of
this
hierarchy
in
practice
is
the
meyers
milias
brown
act
mmba
n
the
california
statute
governing
police
labor
relations
that
is
relatively
typical
of
state
labor
relations
statutes
n
the
scope
of
the
union
s
right
to
negotiate
and
represent
public
employees
includes
all
matters
relating
to
employment
conditions
and
employer
employee
relations
including
but
not
limited
to
wages
hours
and
other
terms
and
conditions
of
employment
except
however
that
the
scope
of
representation
shall
not
include
consideration
of
the
merits
necessity
or
organization
of
any
service
or
activity
provided
by
law
or
executive
order
n
the
two
clauses
conflict
read
alone
they
could
respectively
encompass
practically
any
conceivable
bargaining
proposal
or
swallow
the
whole
provision
for
collective
negotiation
and
relegate
determination
of
all
labor
issues
to
the
city
s
discretion
n
even
if
an
employer
s
action
or
policy
has
a
significant
and
adverse
effect
on
the
employees
wages
hours
and
working
conditions
the
employer
may
be
exempt
from
the
duty
to
meet
and
confer
with
the
union

the
subject
is
the
merits

or
organization

action

added
in
the
limitation
on
the

to
confer
over
these
matters

intended
to
forestall
any
expansion
of
the
language
of
wages
hours
and
working
conditions
to
include
more
general
managerial
policy
decisions
n
police
officers
in
california
therefore
are
able
to
bargain
for
the
right
to
consult
with

union
representative

report
concerning

incident
because
previous
instances
had
resulted
in
interference
with
the
department
s
investigation
n
the
court
found
the
right
to
consult
was
a
working
condition
under
the
collective
bargaining
agreement
rather
than
a
matter
reserved
for
management
which
would
permit
the
department
to
change
practices
without
prior
written
agreement
or
compliance
with
statutory
meet
and
confer
procedures

however
although
a
police
officer
is
allowed
to
have
a
representative
after
a
shooting
has
occurred

not

the
police
chief
s
issuance
of
a
new
policy
governing
the
use
of
force
without
meeting
and
conferring
with
the
association
did
not
violate
the
mmba

change
on
the
policy
governing
a
police
officer
s
ability
to
fire
at
a
suspected
criminal
has
some
effect
on
safety
it
is
equally
true
that
the
use
of
force
policy
is
as
closely
akin
to
a
managerial
decision
as
any
decision
can
be
in
running
a
police
department
surpassed
only
by
the
decision
as
to
whether
force
will
be
used
at
all
n
according
to
the
court
there
are
few
decisions
more
managerial
in
nature
than
the
one
which
involves
the
conditions
under
which
an
entity
of
the
state
will
permit
a
human
life
to
be
taken

decision
n
finally
in
a
recent
case
a
county
s

of
a
policy
to
limit
a
deputy
sheriff
s
access
the
internal
investigative
file
before
being
interviewed
by
an
internal
affairs
investigator
was
found
not
to
be
a
working
condition
subject
to
bargaining
under
the
mmba
n
while
it
is
understandable
that
california
like
other
states
would
want
to
free
police
departments
from
the
leverage
a
union
might
have
to
block
reforms
through
prolonged
bargaining
and
through
inclusion
of
contract
terms
that
could
thwart
new
policies
the
consequence
of
the
limited
duty
to
bargain
has
been
perverse
if
employees
and
their
union
are
excluded
from
participation
in
policy
setting
they
often
feel
compelled
to
oppose
new
policies
for
fear
that
the
policy
will
be
implemented
punitively
or
unfairly
as
a
way
to
discipline
rank
and
file
who
are
unpopular
with
management
n
in
the
case
of
police
as
scholars
have
shown
unions
become
reflexively
opposed
to
policies
when
they
cannot
participate
in
policy
design
and
focus
instead
simply
on
protecting
their
members
from
discipline
for
violating
the
policy
n
thus
both
the
law
and
the
dominant
theory
of
policing
compel
union
leadership
to
focus
their
attention
on
rectifying
the
abuses
of
management
arbitrary
dismissals
scheduling
and
work
assignments
informal
discipline
citation
and
arrest
quotas
cronyism
in
promotions
and
incursions
into
officers
personal
lives
police
unions
and
the
political
process
while
police
unions
adopted
a
narrow
view
of
labor
s
role
in
setting
criminal
justice
policy
in
the
workplace
apart
from
officer
pay
and
discipline
they
embraced
a
broad
view
of
how
they
could
advocate
for
police
officers
interests
as
labor
they
do
not
just
bargain
and
enforce
labor
agreements
they
are
involved
in
electoral
politics
in
litigation
and
in
the
media
attacking
the
restrictions
imposed
on
them
by
the
supreme

criticizing
groups
ranging
from
the
black

matter
movement
to
the
communist
party
to
the
american
civil

union
aclu
and
opposing
civilian
oversight
n
and
in
advocating
for
police
interests
as
labor
to
be
protected
from
civilian
intervention
and
unfair
discipline
of
course
they
did
have
a
substantial
impact
on
criminal
justice
policy
that
is
although
unions
did
not
contest
management
efforts
to
adopt
the
militarized
style
of
urban
policing
instead
of
a
more
social
service
or
community
oriented
style
they
did
demand
that
officers
be
protected
from
discipline
when
that
harsh
style
of
policing
resulted
in
civilian
injuries
or
deaths
police
unions
negotiated
for
contractual
protections
in
the
disciplinary
process
and
also
lobbied
for
state
or
municipal
laws
giving
officers
procedural
protections
during
discipline
n
police
unions
also
actively
opposed
reform
oriented
chiefs
and
civilian
review
boards

for
reasons
of
conservative
and
sometimes
racist
ideology
and
to
protect
police
officers

and
butter
interests
like
pay
benefits
and
job
security

in
several
cities
police
unions
have
challenged
police
chiefs
brought
in
to
enact
reforms
that
they
consider
threatening
to
officer
safety
or
economic
interests
or
that
they
believe
weaken
public
safety
unions
challenged
city
officials
over
issues
like
staffing
and
job
protection
many
have
taken
openly
partisan
stands
such
as
recent
police
protests
in
new
york
against
politicians
who
they
claim
adopt
policies
that
weaken
public
safety
n
because
police
officers
have
long
felt
at
risk
of
arbitrary
or
unfair
discipline
they
have
fought
hard
to
retain
union
involvement
in
internal
investigations
into
employee
misconduct
and
therefore
have
stymied
efforts
to
reform
police
culture
n
the
january
doj
chicago
report
for
example
noted
that
a
effort
to
use
data
to
identify
patterns
of
problematic
officer
behavior
was
opposed
by
the
union
because
officers
felt
discipline
was
imposed
arbitrarily
and
unfairly
the
system
was
abandoned
after
just
two
years
and
all
the
data
and
reports
it
produced
went
missing
n
a
effort
to
analyze
data
and
create
an
early
intervention
system
is
in
the
works
but
the
doj
chicago
report
stated
the
project
managers
are
taking
guidance
from
the
city
on
how
and
when
to
do
so
and
union
involvement
has
not
yet
occurred
there
is
no
evidence
that
the
city
or
cpd
engaged
with
the
unions
early
on
before
beginning
this
new
effort
to
determine
whether
cpd
s
unions
will
support
the
new
effort
n
as
these
examples
suggest
unions
have
been
blocked
by
labor
law
by
the
hierarchical
management
structure
and
by
short
sighted
union
leaders
own
narrow
conception
of
role
from
adopting
a
more
proactive
and
collaborative
approach
to
management
labor
cooperation
over
police
goals
and
tactics
in
sum
police
unions
see
their
mission
as
protecting
the
interests
of
police
officers
including
protecting
officers
from
discipline
ensuring
good
working
conditions
and
protecting
seniority
when
police
union
leaders
defend
officers
involved
in
what
appear
to
be
egregious
instances
of
violence
toward
suspects
critics
assert
that
the
solidarity
that
enables
a
union
to
function
and
that
is
encouraged
by
the
quasi
militaristic
culture
in
many
police
forces
has
become
pathological
n

are
thought
by
their
defenders
to
be
an
institutional
mechanism
to
create
and
sustain

democracy
in

are
perceived
as
irredeemably

police
unions
as
obstacles
to
reform
police
unions
in
new
york
city
ferguson
baltimore
cleveland
chicago
and
other
cities
have
at
least
initially
publicly
come
to
the
defense
of
officers
accused
of
shooting
and
killing
civilians
insisting
that
it
is
important
to
avoid
a
rush
to
judgment
n
reponses
have
gone
beyond
offering
a
public
defense
to
include
fundraising
for
accused
officers
in
ferguson
baltimore
and
cleveland
n
and
in

it
is
time
to
stop

uses
extreme
rhetoric
in
his
defense
of
officers

refusing
to
publicly
concede
that
an
officer
was
wrong
even
when
the
officer
in
question
went
to
jail
n
his
milder
statements
about
the
role
of
the
police
union
are
not
unusual
among
police
union
leaders
he
says
what
most
do
our
job
as
an
advocate
for
police
officers
is
to
speak
out
for
them
whether
it
s
getting
them
a
contract
or
defending
them
when
they
re
wrongfully
accused
or
explaining
exactly
how
and
why
we
do
our
job
that
s
our
role
and
we
proudly
do
it
n
although
it
is
understandable
that
elected
union
leaders
come
to
the
defense
of
employees
accused
of
misconduct
the
zeal
and
leverage
that
police
unions
bring
to
the
defense
is
considerable
as
a
result
of
contractual
and
statutory
substantive
and
procedural
protections
the
expense
and
hassle
necessary
to
discipline
an
officer
is
greater
than
if
the
officer
could
be
fired
at
will
n
this
combined
with
the
fact
that
labor
arbitrators
sometimes
reduce
punishment
makes
supervisors
less
likely
to
impose
disciplinary
sanctions
because
while
a
supervisor
faces
a
possible
headache
for
not
disciplining
a
misbehaving
subordinate
they
face
a
certain
headache
if
they
do
n
one
study
of
discipline
imposed
in
the
cpd
in
the
early
s
found
that
arbitrators
routinely
cut
in
half
the
severity
of
discipline
n
experience
with
the
personnel
system
prompted
tom
nolan
a
veteran
of
the
boston
police
department
and
professor
of
criminology
to
say
the
number
one
impediment
to
reforming
policing
in
the
united
states
are
police
unions
n
similarly
in

chicago
police
accountability
task
force
issued
a
report
concluding
that
the
collective
bargaining
agreements
between
the
police
unions
and
the
city
have
essentially
turned
the
code
of
silence
into
official
policy
n
as
explained
in
this
part
statutory
and
contractual
protections
for
police
officers
do
have
an
effect
on
police
accountability
and
the
transparency
of
police
disciplinary
systems
n
for
instance
collective
bargaining
agreements
often
contain
provisions
that
protect
officers
accused
of
misconduct
shield
them
from
civilian
oversight
and
limit
the
ability
to
change
officers
conditions
of
employment

also
makes
it
difficult
to
enact
reforms

in
the
approximately
twenty
states
with
statutory
leobors
many
of
these
protections
exist
as
a
matter
of
state

is
at
the
core

state
leobors
outline
the
process
for
investigating
allegations
of
officer
misconduct

the
process
varies

maryland
for
example
provides
that
no
officer
may
be
questioned
without
having
been
given
the
opportunity
to
secure
legal
counsel
and
gives
officers
ten
days
to
do
so
n
this
provision
has
been
criticized
for
giving
officers
plenty
of
time
to
delay
interrogations
and
concoct
an
account
of
the
incident
that
exonerates
the
officer
n
other
provisions
on
officer
interrogation

regulation
of
the
location

n
handling
of

concerning
those
files
include
whether
the
public
should
have
access
to
any
of
them
and
if
so
what
information
should
be
disclosed
additional
issues
include
whether
records
should
be
expunged
after
a
period
of
time
and
if
so
which
records
and
for
what
length
of
time
n
proposed
legislation
that
failed
to
pass
in
california
in
would
have
increased
public
access
to
police
disciplinary
records
that
have
been
restricted
by
state
law
and
limited
by
court
decisions
n
the
bill
would
have
required
public
access
to
records
of
all
investigations
into
uses
of
force
that
result
in
death
or
serious
injury
n
the
records
would
be
open
even
if
the
officer
involved
eventually
was
found
to
have
complied
with
a
department
s
policy
n
currently
the
lapd
only
releases
summaries
and
some
departments
don
t
even
provide
a
summary

findings
be
made
public
when
officers
are

in
misconduct
that
violates
the
legal
rights

public
n
a
similar
bill
failed
to

in
after
dozens
of
peace
officers

to
lawmakers
that
permitting

files
would
endanger

according
to
a
news
report
there
has
been
no
reported
case
where
an
officer
was
harmed
based
on
release
of
this
information
n
other
police
departments
including
baltimore
similarly
do
not
release
notice
of
disciplinary
actions
and
their
disposition
n
in
contrast
at
least
ten
states

texas
and
florida
already
provide

access
to
investigative
details

actions
when

number
race
and
gender
of

the
challenge
with
public
access
to
disciplinary
records
is
balancing
transparency
with
protection
of
legitimate
privacy
and
safety
interests
of
police
officers
from
one
point
of
view
transparency
is
clearly
desirable
as
the
public
should
be
able
to
monitor
how
public
employees
are
disciplined
and
this
is
especially
important
to
restoring
public
trust
in
police
n
from
another
the
value
of
transparency
is
a
function
of
the
reliability
of
the
records
police
officers
who
feel
that
discipline
is
used
unfairly
to
punish
officers
or
is
meted
out
based
on
favoritism
or
for
other
nonmeritorious
reasons
would
conclude
that
public
accessibility
of
the
records
will
only
compound
the
harm
of
the
unfair
discipline
by
stigmatizing
an
officer
and
might
facilitate
reprisals
if
the
officer
s
name
and
home
address
are
released
n
conversely
officers
who
feel
that
discipline
is
fair
might
still
be
reluctant
to
allow
their
name
to
be
publicized
but
at
least
recognize
that
public
awareness
is
not
unreasonable
or
grossly
unfair
n
as
for
expungement
many
cities
allow
for
expungement
of
complaints
n
baltimore
s
union
contract
allows
officers
to
request
expungement
of
formal
complaints
that
are
found
to
be
unfounded
or
as
to
which
the
officer
was
exonerated
after
three
years
n
some
policing
scholars
assert
that
expungement
of
unfounded
complaints
is
undesirable
because
such
records
are
part
of
early
intervention
systems
mandated
by
doj
consent
decrees
these
systems
create
a
computerized
record
of
multiple
performance
indicators
including
uses
of
force
and
citizen
complaints
that
allow
supervisors
and
oversight
entities
to
have
a
full
picture
of
every
officer
s
job
performance
n
civilian
complaints
and
oversight
some
leobors
and
contracts
impose
short
statutes
of
limitations
on
the
prosecution
of
discipline
n
in
maryland
for
example
no
complaint
alleging
brutality
will
be
investigated
or
be
the
basis
of
discipline
if
filed
more
than
ninety
days
after
the
alleged
incident
n
others
treat
citizen
complaints
differently
than
complaints
initiated
by
other
officers
n
other
provisions
limit
civilian
oversight
n
for
many
police
unions
limiting
civilian
oversight
is
one
of
their
most
important
issues
n
misconduct
investigations
several
types
of
contractual
and
statutory
provisions
governing
investigations
have
been
criticized
one
provision
concerns
the
timing
of
such
investigations
and
who
should
conduct
them
n
other
constellations
of
concerns
focus
on
control
of
the
hearing
boards
that
determine
whether
officers
have
committed
misconduct
n
in
los
angeles
in
the
decades
before
the
rampart
scandal
rank
and
file
officers
believed
that
the
board
of
rights
was
controlled
by
the
chief
who
used
it
to
punish
whistleblowers
and
dissenters
n
in
baltimore
perhaps
for
a
similar
reason
the
union
negotiated
a
contractual
provision
requiring
that
one
member
of
every
hearing
board
be
a
peer
officer
of
the
accused
n
a
critic
however
insisted
that
including
a
peer
officer
as
a
member
of
the
hearing
board
serves
to
protect
misconduct
because
giving
the
rank
and
file
a
direct
voice
in
disciplinary
investigation
necessarily
lowers
the
standards
for
police
conduct
inasmuch
as
officers
have
a
vested
interest
in
shielding
all
officers
from
meaningful
investigations
and
discipline
n
other
provisions
concern
whether
the
public
should
receive
notice
of
the
disposition
of
investigations

the
provisions
highlighted
above
can
be
obstacles
to
reforms

that
they
make
it
harder
for
supervisors
civilian
oversight
boards
and
the
public
to
determine
the
nature
and
extent
of
police
misconduct
to
develop
early
intervention
systems
to
help
officers
who
are
at
risk
of
committing
future
abuse
and
to
remove
officers
who
have
committed
egregious
misconduct
police
unions
however
have
defended
these
provisions
the
fop
for
example
said
these
types
of
provisions
are
necessary
to
protect
officers
from
unfounded
citizen
complaints
n
as
the
former
president
of
the
federal
agents
police
benevolent
association
and
founder
of
the
national
police
defense
foundation
a
nonprofit
that
provides
legal
services
to
members
of
law
enforcement
put
it
what
is
happening
now
is
police
are
second
guessing
their
instincts
and
training
they
have
because
they
re
scared
to
get
indicted
that
they
may
have
to
go
to
jail
for
doing
their
job
n
this
alleged
reluctance
to
do
the
job
which
some
have
called
the
ferguson
effect
n
is
the
latest
iteration
of
a
longstanding
argument
that
unions
are
necessary
to
protect
police
from
the
anti
police
rhetoric
as
explained
further
in
parts
iii
and
iv
police
unions
have
fought
hard
for
many
of
these
procedural
and
substantive
protections
because
they
do
not
trust
the
process
of
adopting
and
implementing
policies
but
reform
will
not
be
accomplished
simply
by
eliminating
job
protections
even
if
that
were
politically
feasible
nor
will
reform
be
accomplished
simply
by
involving
the
public
in
negotiating
over
job
protections
at
least
so
long
as
the
rank
and
file
retain
the
collective
will
to
resist
reforms
discipline
is
subject
to
grievance
arbitration
and
negotiating
disputes
are
subject
to
interest
arbitration
and
it
is
politically
infeasible
and
may
well
be
unwise
to
eliminate
a
process
to
appeal
discipline
rather
rank
and
file
need
to
be
involved
in
improving
police
practices
and
that
involvement
very
likely
requires
the
cooperation
of
some
kind
of
officer
labor
representative
b
other
limits
on
reform
changing
conditions
of
employment
in
addition
to
protection
against
discipline
accountability
and
transparency
many
states
have
laws
that
require
management
to
collectively
bargain
over
any
changes
to
conditions
of
employment
n
this
requirement
can
also
stymie
reform
efforts
for
instance
federal
law
empowers
the
doj
to
bring
structural
reform
litigation
against
police
departments
engaged
in
a
pattern
or
practice
of
civil
rights
abuses
n
most
of
the
investigations
conducted
by
the
doj
have
resulted
in
consent
decrees
that
are
approved
and
overseen
by
federal
courts
n
an
investigation
of
seventeen
of
these
consent
decrees
negotiated
between
and
found
that
in
at
least
seven
of
them
the
union
contract
with
the
city
hindered
the
reforms
contained
in
the
consent
decree
n
unsurprisingly
unions
and
sometimes
classes
of
union
members
have
filed
grievances
when
these
reforms
change
working
conditions
in
seattle
for
instance
two
police
unions
filed
a
lawsuit
in
arguing
that
certain
topics
that
have
long
been
subjected
to
bargaining
including
conditions
for
employment
could
be
severely
curtailed
by
the
city
s
proposed
police
reform
plan
n
the
plan
included
provisions
that
the
seattle
police
department
spd
would
be
monitored
to
determine
whether
all
use
of
force
is
reported
tracked
and
properly
classified
and
thoroughly
and
objectively
investigated
and
reviewed
to
a
reasonable
and
unbiased
conclusion
and
also
whether
disciplinary
results
on
founded
complaints
reflect
the
seriousness
of
the
underlying
event
with
biased
policing
excessive
force
failure
to
report
force
or
dishonesty
meriting
appropriate
discipline
n
the
lawsuit
asked
the
court
to
permanently
block
the
city
and
court
monitor
from
making
any
changes
to
police
officers
wages
hours
or
working
conditions
n
doj
consent
decrees
aimed
at
reform
of
police
departments
often
include
language
providing
that
any
reforms
can
only
occur
to
the
extent
that
they
do
not
conflict
with
the
union
contract
n
these
provisions
can
delay
or
permanently
hinder
reform
efforts
n
union
structure
unions
are
run
by
an
elected
president
and
board
of
directors
n
in
large
departments
the
individuals
holding
these
full
time
paid
positions
control
a
multimillion
dollar
budget
amassed
from
union
dues
n
this
gives
them
enormous
power
to
influence
public
policy
because
they
can
donate
a
portion
of
these
funds
to
politicians
viewed
as
friendly
to
their
interests
n
a
case
in
point
is
seattle
the
seattle
police
officers
guild
spog
the
union
of
rank
and
file
officers
endorsed
ed
murray
for
mayor
in
and
contributed
to
his
campaign
n
upon
his
taking
office
one
of
his
first
acts
was
to
demote
the
interim
chief
of
the
department
a
man
who
had
enacted
numerous
reforms
that
had
been
praised
in
a
report
by
the
federal
court
monitor
of
the
doj
consent
decree
n
additionally
the
report
praised
an
assistant
chief
who
also
retired
suddenly
n
the
mayor
then
appointed
the
former
vice
president
of
spog
harry
bailey
as
interim
police
chief
n
bailey
immediately
attempted
to
overturn
misconduct
findings
of
numerous
officers
found
guilty
of
using
excessive
force
n
the
perception
that
spog
captured
the
mayor
existed
not
only
amongst
reformers
but
also
amongst
some
members
of
the
rank
and
file
the
mayor
s
actions
created
an
atmosphere
of
fear
n
one
officer
opined
that
the
former
chief
and
assistant
chief
who
the
mayor
forced
out
were
people
who
have
a
deep
institutional
knowledge
of
the
organization
have
been
there
a
long
time
and
earned
their
way
to
the
top
and
have
been
chipping
away
at
deficiencies
for
three
years
after
a
long
struggle
to
make
this
a
better
organization
boom
they
are
all
gone
you
bring
in
new
people
who
are
less
experienced
and
you
give
them
the
same
task
but
you
have
erased
that
last
few
years
of
work
n
another
officer
who
wanted
to
remain
anonymous
to
avoid
the
possibility
of
retribution
stated
if
the
people
who
have
been
opposing
the
federal
court
monitor
and
reform
are
elevated
there
is
a
risk
in
working
hard
to
achieve
reform
it
sends
a
message
that
is
at
best
confusing
about
whether
they
want
reform
to
be
successful
why
would
you
put
the
fox
in
charge
of
the
henhouse
any
risk
they
take
may
piss
off
the
folks
who
are
in
charge
i
think
a
lot
of
us
were
quite
stunned
the
mood
was
shock
complete
shock
because
everyone
who
was
involved
in
reform
was
gone
or
buried
people
just
stopped
talking
n
these
quotes
reveal
how
union
leadership
can
stymie
reform
by
stifling
the
voices
of
rank
and
file
members
who
may
support
reform
efforts
the
perception
that
the
mayor
was
in
bed
with
the
union
and
his
actions
in
demoting
and
forcing
out
individuals
who
were
working
with
the
doj
to
institute
reforms
created
fear
silenced
more
progressive
voices
amongst
the
rank
and
file
and
made
them
reluctant
to
engage
in
reform
oriented
efforts
similar
suppression
of
rank
and
file
voices
occurred
in
san
francisco
according
to
a
blue
ribbon
panel
appointed
by
the
district
attorney
after
it
was
discovered
that
members
of
the
police
department
had
exchanged
racist
and
homophobic
text
messages
n
among
the
panel
s
findings
was
that
the
union
dissuaded
officers
from
speaking
to
the
panel
and
many
who
did
speak
to
the
panel
did
so
anonymously
because
they
feared
retaliation
from
the
union
and
had
concerns
about
their
physical
safety
n
the
union
can
also
hinder
reforms
by
capturing
police
management
thereby
eliminating
any
checks
and
balances
with
the
department
this
arguably
occurred
in
seattle
when
the
former
vice
president
of
the
union
was
elevated
to
the
position
of
police
chief
n
in
san
francisco
the
blue
ribbon
panel
concluded
that
there
was
virtually
no
distinction
between
the
command
staff
of
the
department
and
the
police
officer
s
union
n
this
made
it
difficult
to
engage
in
reforms
because
the
union
was
essentially
running
the
department
and
it
had
historically
taken
antireformist
positions
n
finally
one
way
for
union
leadership
to
maintain
their
power
and
influence
is
to
convince
rank
and
file
officers
to
join
the
union
and
pay
union
dues
as
such
they
must
justify
why
the
union
is
important
for
officers
and
one
persuasive
way
to
do
so
is
to
encourage
the
rank
and
file
to
believe
that
they
cannot
trust
management
and
that
management
is
out
to
get
them
this
narrative
is
easy
to
maintain
because
the
hierarchical
structure
of
most
police
departments
limits
contact
between
command
staff
and
the
rank
and
file
n
in
sum
collective
bargaining
agreements
including
seniority
systems
union
power
over
conditions
of
work
and
the
structure
and
incentives
of
police
unions
can
all
be
barriers
to
reform
n
however
this
does
not
mean
that
unions
and
rank
and
file
officers
always
find
reform
efforts
problematic
next
this
article
provides
evidence
that
unions
can
be
important
partners
in
reform
efforts
iii
police
unions
as
agents
of
police
reform
in
theory
police
unions
could
be
agents
of
reform
in
at
least
two
ways
first
as
representatives
of
the
line
officers
who
have
daily
contact
with
the
community
whom
the
police
are
supposed
to
protect
and
serve
unions
could
help
improve
the
relationship
between
police
and
citizens
and
help
ensure
that
force
is
used
wisely
and
prudently
and
that
arrests
are
made
and
citations
issued
only
when
doing
so
actually
improves
life
for
the
community
second
unions
could
become
intermediaries
to
convey
the
concerns
of
line
personnel
to
management
in
a
way
that
will
improve
policing
but
to
do
either
of
those
unions
would
have
to
develop
genuine
and
sustained
enthusiasm
for
improving
the
quality
of
policing
n
given
the
prevailing
wisdom
that
police
unions
are
irredeemably
opposed
to
reforms
it
is
surprising
to
learn
that
while
unions
fight
hard
to
ward
off
discipline
for
some
members
n
doing
so
does
not
necessarily
equate
with
an
antireformist
position
when
it
comes
to
matters
unrelated
to
officer
discipline
there
is
evidence
of
police
unions
occasionally
working
to
facilitate
reforms
that
improve
the
quality
of
policing
here
we
offer
a
few
examples
and
then
draw
some
generalizations
from
them
a
examples
of
police
unions
as
agents
of
reform
a
number
of
cities
at
various
points
over
the
last
fifty
years
have
implemented
reforms
to
reduce
police
violence
and
improve
police
community
relations
all
of
them
involved
the
cooperation
of
the
rank
and
file
and
many
involved
active
cooperation
with
the
union
an
early
example
is
the
friday
crab
club
of
the
berkeley
police
department
which
was
organized
by
chief
august
vollmer
in
the
early
s
n
this
group
consisted
of
rank
and
file
officers
who
met
with
the
chief
on
a
weekly
basis
to
review
police
actions
including
uses
of
force
n
officers
who
had
used
force
were
required
to
explain
their
behaviors
and
the
group
would
decide
whether
the
force
was
justified
n
the
group
also
invited
experts
and
members
of
the
community
including
those
accused
of
criminal
conduct
to
address
them
n
advocates
of
community
policing
hold
up
the
friday
crab
club
as
a
paradigm
for
collegial
peer
review
that
will
unleash
the
human
potential
that
lies
at
the
core
of
community
policing
and
problem
oriented
policing
n
another
example
occurred
during
the
s
and
s
when
the
oakland
police
department
was
struggling
with
violent
encounters
with
citizens
n
chief
charles
gain
was
a
reformist
chief
who
had
strong
support
from
the
black
community
but
not
much
from
the
union
n
he
pushed
through
many
reforms
despite
union
opposition
n
many
officers
resigned
or
retired
under
his
leadership
and
the
newly
formed
union
issued
a
vote
of
no
confidence
n
despite
his
strong
leadership
style
chief
gain
created
the
violence
prevention
unit
with
the
help
of
social
psychologist
hans
toch
to
address
the
problem
of
violence
prone
officers
n
the
unit
diverged
from
the
otherwise
hierarchical
organization
of
the
police
department
and
chief
gain
maintained
a
hands
off
approach
and
allowed
the
unit
to
function
independently
n
the
unit
was
based
on
two
assumptions
first
that
patrol
officers
could
control
other
officers
and
second
that
those
officers
who
had
been
violent
in
the
past
would
be
in
the
best
position
to
help
officers
who
were
having
problems
in
the
present
n
the
unit
was
successful
in
two
ways
officers
participated
with
great
enthusiasm
and
caring
and
the
work
of
the
panel
reduced
violent
confrontations
between
the
police
and
citizens
n
as
with
many
such
reforms
however
it
was
discontinued
due
to
department
budget
cuts
n
and
almost
as
soon
as
it
was
police
violence
problems
recurred
n
one
more
example
is
from
milwaukee
in
the
s
and
s
despite
the
fact
that
the
police
chief
harold
brier
had
no
interest
in
improving
relations
with
the
black
community
the
union
saw
things
differently
n
the
union
recognized
that
its
members
were
on
the
street
as
line
officers
and
that
they
were
the
ones
who
suffered
from
the
antagonism
from
the
black
community
n
so
the
union
organized
meetings
with
citizen
groups
using
community
relations
techniques
then
in
vogue
n
like
the
oakland
experiment
however
the
program
soon
faded
in
milwaukee
unlike
in
oakland
the
police
department
never
formalized
the
program
and
never
made
funds
available
to
reimburse
officers
for
time
spent
with
citizen
groups
n
although
the
government
s
law
enforcement
administration
assistance
leaa
program
used
to
give
grants
to
police
departments
that
were
interested
in
developing
community
relations
programs
it
excluded
unions
n
in
the
years
since
leaa
has
been
replaced
by
several
funding
bureaus
within
the
doj
but
these
new
bureaus
still
will
not
fund
union
projects
n
the
metro
dade
police
citizen
violence
reduction
project
is
another
example
of
rank
and
file
officer
involvement
in
police
reform
the
project
involved
a
task
force
made
up
of
officers
management
and
others
who
were
tasked
with
reviewing
a
random
sample
of
citizen
complaints
involving
police
abuse
officers
use
of
force
and
officer
injuries
during
police
citizen
interactions
n
based
on
the
lessons
they
learned
from
this
review
a
new
training
program
involving
role
plays
was
developed
and
implemented
n
the
preliminary
results
from
the
training
program
showed
a
thirty
to
fifty
percent
reduction
in
injuries
to
officers
officers
use
of
force
and
citizens
complaints
of
abuse
n
occasionally
police
unions
have
formed
alliances
with
civil
rights
leaders
or
their
organizations
in
los
angeles
the
police
protective
league
ppl
a
notoriously
inward
looking
organization
commissioned
a
report
by
law
professor
and
civil
liberties
activist
erwin
chemerinsky
n
they
did
so
because
the
union
s
members
feared
reprisals
by
the
controversial
new
chief
of
police
bernard
parks
whom
some
league
leaders
believed
would
draw
the
wrong
lessons
from
a
corruption
scandal
in
the
lapd
s
rampart
division
n
in
newark
new
jersey
union
president
james
stewart
helped
the
doj
during
its
investigation
of
the
police
department
according
to
him
the
union
s
attitude
was
come
on
in
and
it
helped
the
doj
uncover
problems
within
the
police
department
including
frequent
pedestrian
stops
that
violated
residents
civil
rights
three
out
of
every
four
times
they
occurred
n
stewart
even
indicated
that
he
approves
of
doj
mandated
reforms
related
to
the
department
s
officer
training
and
community
relations
n
simultaneously
however
stewart
strongly
opposed
any
reforms
that
would
create
a
civilian
review
board
n
the
union
threatened
to
bring
a
lawsuit
arguing
that
changes
to
officer
discipline
must
be
part
of
collective
bargaining
n
in
los
angeles
the
lapd
created
a
community
safety
partnership
unit
that
operates
in
some
of
the
most
dangerous
and
violent
housing
developments
n
the
officers
in
the
unit
patrol
the
neighborhoods
on
foot
and
know
residents
by
name
n
they
also
earn
the
trust
of
the
community
by
providing
social
services
to
residents
as
well
as
participating
in
neighborhood
activities
n
additionally
unlike
the
ubiquitous
practice
of
promoting
officers
based
on
the
numbers
of
arrests
they
make
officers
in
this
unit
are
rewarded
for
diverting
people
from
the
criminal
justice
system
and
fostering
positive
relationships
in
the
community
n
while
it
is
unclear
how
much
the
union
was
involved
in
these
efforts
it
did
not
file
any
grievances
to
stop
the
program
or
dissuade
rank
and
file
officers
from
participating
in
it
surprisingly
the
experience
in
seattle
also
provides
an
example
of
how
unions
can
work
to
facilitate
reforms
in
after
some
of
the
events
discussed
in
section
ii
c
ron
smith
was
elected
as
the
new
president
of
spog
during
his
time
in
office
from
to
spog
continued
to
vociferously
defend
and
protect
officers
who
were
accused
of
misconduct
n
however
smith
simultaneously
worked
closely
and
collaboratively
with
the
new
police
chief
kathleen
o
toole
and
with
reformers
outside
the
department
to
implement
doj
mandated
reforms
n
the
consent
decree
between
the
city
and
the
doj
which
was
in
place
for
two
years
by
the
time
smith
was
elected
required
the
adoption
of
extensive
reforms
to
curb
excessive
force
and
racially
biased
policing
n
in
a
move
that
was
remarkable
to
outside
observers
smith
told
his
membership
that
bias
free
policing
was
important
and
if
they
did
not
like
it
they
could
leave
and
go
to
a
place
that
serves
their
worldview
n
this
is
from
the
same
union
that
had
in
described
efforts
to
combat
racial
profiling
as
socialist
policies
from
the
enemy
and
argued
that
officers
should
be
able
to
call
citizens
bitch
and
n
a
n
negotiations
on
the
collective
bargaining
agreement
between
spog
and
the
city
began
in
n
these
negotiations
had
to
be
completed
before
reforms
under
the
consent
decree
could
continue
because
some
of
the
measures
to
improve
police
accountability
potentially
conflicted
with
the
current
contract
n
during
the
negotiations
spog
president
smith
was
supportive
of
adopting
some
accountability
measures
that
would
lead
to
more
transparency
for
instance
he
supported
changes
to
the
collective
bargaining
agreement
that
would
have
opened
disciplinary
hearings
to
certain
outsiders
including
a
citizen
observer
appointed
by
the
mayor
and
members
of
the
community
police
commission
cpc
n
the
cpc
is
a
group
created
by
the
doj
consent
decree
n
made
up
primarily
of
community
groups
including
the
aclu
and
the
national
association
for
the
advancement
of
colored
people
naacp
that
had
asked
the
doj
to
investigate
the
spd
n
the
cpc
also
has
a
guaranteed
spot
for
a
representative
from
spog
and
from
the
seattle
police
management
association
n
under
smith
s
leadership
spog
did
not
file
any
grievances
or
do
anything
else
to
block
any
of
the
reform
efforts
n
one
of
the
co
chairs
of
the
cpc
lisa
daugaard
noted
that
during
the
reform
process
things
could
have
gone
terribly
with
spog
but
didn
t
n
she
continued
to
the
surprise
of
many
including
me
spog
really
has
not
impeded
the
reform
process
there
were
many
points
along
the
way
when
many
police
unions
might
have
filed
grievances
or
unfair
labor
practice
complaints
about
the
changes
that
have
been
implemented
without
bargaining
they
ve
chosen
not
to
do
that
n
she
concluded
it
s
not
as
simple
as
the
labor
union
being
the
problem
tempting
as
that
idea
is
and
true
as
it
may
have
been
in
the
past
n
and
when
in
rank
and
file
officers
from
the
north
precinct
attempted
to
derail
the
new
use
of
force
policy
adopted
by
the
police
department
by
filing
a
lawsuit
spog
president
smith
publically
voiced
his
disapproval
and
the
union
did
not
join
the
lawsuit
n
the
relationship
between
the
cpc
and
the
police
union
has
been
described
as
among
the
healthiest
between
any
two
parties
in
the
reform
process
n
smith
notes
that
the
cpc
treats
the
spog
representative
with
respect
and
stated
that
while
spog
and
the
cpc
do
not
agree
on
everything
at
least
they
can
talk
to
each
other
n
he
further
shared
that
he
has
a
really
good
relationship
with
cpc
co
chair
lisa
daugaard
n
the
relationship
is
such
that
when
the
federal
district
court
judge
in
charge
of
overseeing
the
consent
decree
suggested
that
any
new
appeal
process
for
police
discipline
cases
created
through
ongoing
collective
bargaining
negotiations
must
get
approval
from
the
court
the
cpc
filed
an
amicus
brief
supporting
spog
s
resistance
to
this
suggestion
n
ironically
observers
note
that
most
of
the
tension
has
been
between
the
cpc
and
other
parties
to
the
consent
decree
namely
the
mayor
s
office
and
the
independent
monitor
team
n
unfortunately
the
rosy
situation
in
seattle
may
have
come
to
an
end
in
early
june
spog
president
ron
smith
resigned
after
a
scandal
involving
a
controversial
facebook
post
in
which
he
blamed
the
dallas
police
officer
shootings
on
what
he
termed
the
minority
movement
n
he
denies
that
he
was
referring
to
the
black
lives
matter
movement
claiming
instead
that
he
was
referring
to
the
small
segment
of
society
which
has
the
propensity
for
violence
toward
law
enforcement
n
however
he
resigned
because
the
negative
publicity
was
pulling
attention
away
from
the
reform
efforts
being
made
in
the
city
n
in
a
later
interview
however
smith
disclosed
that
he
also
resigned
because
the
executive
board
of
the
union
was
going
to
attempt
to
force
him
out
because
of
his
acceptance
of
police
accountability
measures
in
the
proposed
union
contract
and
for
being
too
conciliatory
to
outside
reformers
and
the
police
chief
n
he
had
been
described
as
a
bootlicker
because
of
his
relationship
with
the
chief
despite
the
fact
that
his
collaboration
with
chief
o
toole
was
crucial
to
his
ability
to
negotiate
improvements
to
officer
working
conditions
n
while
he
expected
that
he
could
win
the
fight
and
stay
in
office
because
of
support
he
had
amongst
some
members
of
the
executive
board
and
the
rank
and
file
he
did
not
want
the
controversy
over
his
facebook
post
to
distract
from
the
ongoing
reform
process
n
after
he
resigned
officers
voted
to
to
reject
the
contract
n
one
of
the
reasons
was
the
inclusion
of
civilian
review
in
the
proposed
agreement
n
b
drawing
lessons
from
experiences
one
of
the
most
important
lessons
from
the
examples
above
is
that
while
it
might
be
difficult
to
convince
unions
to
move
away
from
their
core
mission
to
protect
their
membership
from
discipline
their
defense
of
officers
does
not
necessarily
signal
a
lack
of
willingness
to
engage
in
other
reform
efforts
although
reformers
often
view
a
union
s
defense
of
officers
as
a
hindrance
sometimes
this
defense
can
even
facilitate
reforms
by
exposing
institutional
and
systemic
problems
for
instance
as
discussed
in
part
i
broken
windows
policing
the
war
on
drugs
and
compstat
have
together
created
intense
pressures
on
rank
and
file
officers
to
increase
summonses
arrests
and
stops
and
frisks
when
officers
complain
or
fail
to
meet
their
numbers
they
might
be
given
negative
performance
evaluations
affecting
their
ability
to
get
promoted
this
occurred
in
when
some
nypd
officers
believed
that
their
negative
performance
evaluations
were
the
result
of
their
complaints
about
their
precinct
s
quota
system
n
patrick
lynch
the
president
of
the
nypd
s
police
union
the
pba
brought
attention
to
these
problems
when
he
told
newspaper
reporters
that
these
quotas
were
a
department
wide
problem
n
a
new
york
times
magazine
article
on
the
persistence
of
arrest
quotas
reported
that
officers
who
shared
their
belief
that
the
emphasis
on
numbers
resulted
in
unnecessary
arrests
feared
retribution
from
the
brass
one
officer
said
that
the
rank
and
file
were
utterly
demoralized
and
critical
of
the
department
but
they
don
t
have
a
voice
if
they
speak
out
they
get
crushed
n
in
the
pba
challenged
the
department
s
obsession
with
numbers
in
a
case
involving
an
officer
employed
by
the
seventy
fifth
precinct
who
received
a
negative
evaluation
allegedly
based
on
his
failure
to
meet
the
unofficial
quota
n
years
later
on
may
the
pba
took
out
a
newspaper
ad
attacking
the
quotas
which
read
don
t
blame
the
cop
blame
nypd
management
for
pressure
to
write
summonses
and
the
pressure
to
convict
motorists
n
the
ad
claimed
the
department
punished
officers
who
did
not
write
enough
tickets
n
similarly
in
new
jersey
the
union
opposed
orders
from
police
management
to
meet
quotas
which
union
president
stewart
claims
created
pressure
on
officers
to
conduct
baseless
stops
and
strained
relations
with
community
members
n
additionally
a
union
s
defense
of
officers
can
also
facilitate
structural
reforms
for
instance
nypd
officers
who
spoke
out
against
the
department
s
controversial
stop
and
frisk
practices
did
so
anonymously
because
they
feared
retaliation
and
punishment
n
one
officer
said
that
punishments
for
falling
short
of
quotas
ranged
from
losing
a
longtime
partner
low
evaluation
scores
retraining
and
denial
of
days
off
or
overtime
requests
n
other
officers
shared
similar
stories
n
although
it
is
unclear
whether
the
union
played
any
role
in
protecting
these
officers
right
to
speak
out
against
prevailing
management
practices
doing
so
would
certainly
fall
within
the
union
s
function
another
lesson
from
the
examples
is
the
importance
of
giving
voice
to
rank
and
file
officers
in
reform
efforts
however
much
of
the
policing
literature
observes
that
most
reform
efforts
take
a
top
down
approach
police
chiefs
politicians
and
reformers
often
complain
that
the
union
and
the
collective
bargaining
agreement
are
obstacles
to
reform
and
many
police
reformers
have
long
accepted
the
idea
that
reform
can
only
be
accomplished
through
a
top
down
process
n
the
wariness
of
some
reformers
about
the
willingness
of
police
unions
to
embrace
reform
can
be
traced
to
the
political
activism
of
unions
during
the
late
s
n
when
unions
opposed
citizen
review
boards
and
reform
oriented
chiefs
n
in
addition
to
pursuing
improvements
in
wages
benefits
and
seniority
n
police
activism
during
this
time
often
took
the
form
of
rabid
knee
jerk
opposition
to
civilian
oversight
active
participation
in
far
right
wing
organizations
vigilante
attacks
on
black
activists
and
organized
brutality
against
political
protesters
n
today
statements
and
actions
by
police
unions
and
rank
and
file
officers
continue
to
lend
support
to
the
view
that
police
rank
and
file
share
a
monolithic
occupational
mindset
and
subculture
of
paranoia
insularity
and
intolerance
n
it
is
also
undoubtedly
true
that
the
crime
fighting
ideology
of
professionalism
in
policing
and
the
law
and
order
rhetoric
of
the
political
right
had
a
long
term
impact
on
police
officers
and
their
unions
even
though
most
police
union
leaders
now
are
in
the
middle
of
the
political
spectrum
n
additionally
some
resistance
to
reforms
can
be
explained
by
rank
and
file
opposition
to
policies
that
require
them
to
retreat
from
their
traditional
aggressive
crime
control
orientation
this
should
not
be
surprising
however
because
many
likely
joined
the
police
department
relying
upon
the
type
of
policing
that
is
currently
in
vogue
and
taught
in
most
police
academies
and
in
their
departments
thus
changes
to
policing
tactics
might
seem
like
a
bait
and
switch
especially
when
measures
of
officer
success
have
not
kept
pace
with
changes
in
policing
tactics
such
as
community
policing
however
attributing
resistance
solely
to
rank
and
file
intransigence
ignores
how
the
typical
top
down
approach
to
reforms
can
also
predictably
lead
to
resistance
resistance
often
stems
from
people
s
opposition
to
or
frustration
with
enactments
of
power
n
research
from
the
study
of
power
reveals
that
certain
exercises
of
authority
can
breed
deep
resentment
among
lower
level
employees
resulting
in
resistance
to
employer
mandated
policies
and
procedures
one
form
of
power
that
predictably
produces
frustration
is
failing
to
provide
employees
with
a
voice
in
decisionmaking
n
voice
is
important
because
it
expresses
to
workers
that
their
views
are
significant
enough
to
be
considered
n
failing
to
give
employees
voice
or
providing
them
with
illusory
voice
n
not
only
serves
as
a
sign
of
their
low
status
but
also
deprives
them
of
interactions
with
power
holders
that
can
favorably
influence
their
attitudes
n
these
studies
of
the
significance
of
voice
in
the
workplace
correspond
to
studies
of
police
culture
and
suggest
the
importance
of
police
union
involvement
in
police
reform
studies
of
the
successes
and
failures
of
community
policing
models
have
found
that
proper
training
of
officers
and
a
participatory
management
style
are
correlated
with
more
positive
officer
attitudes
about
community
policing
n
for
instance
street
officers
in
chicago
who
feel
well
trained
in
cop
community
oriented
policing
hold
much
more
positive
attitudes
about
their
jobs
than
officers
who
do
not
feel
well
trained
they
are
also
more
optimistic
about
the
impact
of
cop
on
crime
if
they
feel
a
part
of
the
decision
making
process
agencies
that
imposed
community
policing
and
maintained
a
top
down
paramilitary
decision
making
style
tended
to
meet
with
strong
officer
resistance
n
moreover
it
is
likely
that
the
insights
and
creativity
of
rank
and
file
officers
can
revolutionize
policing
line
personnel
are
a
powerful
and
important
resource
to
improve
policing
and
the
relationship
between
police
and
citizens
n
another
example
from
seattle
demonstrates
this
point
in
october
of
seattle
unveiled
an
ambitious
and
unique
four
year
pilot
program
to
address
the
major
problem
of
open
air
drug
markets
in
the
downtown
seattle
corridor
n
the
law
enforcement
assisted
diversion
lead
program
is
a
pre
booking
program
that
gives
police
officers
the
discretion
to
divert
individuals
engaged
in
low
level
drug
and
prostitution
crimes
to
community
based
services
instead
of
jail
and
prosecution
n
the
program
was
the
first
of
its
kind
in
the
country
and
resulted
from
a
successful
collaboration
between
unlikely
partners
including
the
public
defender
s
office
the
prosecutor
s
office
community
groups
nonprofit
organizations
such
as
the
aclu
and
top
command
from
the
spd
n
like
many
other
reform
efforts
that
seek
to
change
street
level
policing
practices
lead
policymakers
followed
a
top
down
approach
they
sought
input
from
high
level
police
officials
social
scientists
advocates
and
community
leaders
n
although
patrol
officers
from
one
precinct
of
the
spd
were
given
significant
responsibility
for
making
the
program
work
their
input
was
never
sought
n
rather
the
reformers
used
the
ubiquitous
top
down
approach
and
worked
only
with
top
command
in
developing
the
policy
n
the
new
program
was
poised
to
be
a
huge
success
n
command
level
officers
within
the
police
department
fully
supported
the
program
n
as
a
result
they
instituted
new
rules
and
policies
for
patrol
officers
to
follow
n
there
was
just
one
problem
despite
the
absence
of
overt
resistance
to
the
program
from
the
rank
and
file
officers
responsible
for
its
implementation
there
was
significant
opposition
behind
the
scenes
n
in
fact
not
only
did
patrol
officers
resent
the
program
but
middle
managers
within
the
department
were
also
suspicious
n
the
unique
and
groundbreaking
cooperation
between
top
command
and
outside
agencies
and
experts
may
have
aggravated
rank
and
file
resentments
as
two
policing
scholars
note
rank
and
file
officers
do
not
appreciate
being
told
what
to
do
by
outsiders
especially
outsiders
whom
they
perceive
as
unacquainted
or
at
least
out
of
touch
with
the
daily
demands
of
their
job
n
consequently
while
these
officers
did
not
publicly
voice
their
disapproval
of
lead
some
quietly
and
covertly
failed
to
implement
it
n
this
hidden
resistance
would
not
have
been
discovered
but
for
the
fact
that
the
program
s
evaluation
process
included
focus
groups
with
middle
management
n
it
is
unsurprising
that
the
rank
and
file
were
suspicious
of
the
policy
although
top
command
was
heavily
involved
in
working
out
its
final
details
this
was
unlikely
to
alleviate
rank
and
file
concerns
n
furthermore
failing
to
give
them
any
voice
likely
fueled
existing
resentments
because
it
communicated
to
them
just
how
unimportant
their
views
were
and
just
how
low
their
status
was
within
the
department
to
make
matters
worse
they
were
one
of
the
only
groups
excluded
from
policymaking
that
would
actually
be
affected
by
the
policy
members
of
the
community
and
other
organizations
throughout
the
city
gave
their
input
n
finally
because
the
rank
and
file
had
no
contact
with
the
civilian
reformers
they
had
no
opportunity
to
develop
a
different
opinion
about
their
motives
n
rank
and
file
resistance
to
lead
was
not
open
and
obvious
there
was
no
public
position
taken
by
the
union
against
the
policy
and
the
officers
did
not
publicly
voice
their
disapproval
rather
they
engaged
in
what
political
scientist
james
scott
refers
to
as
everyday
resistance
acts
of
resistance
that
are
meant
to
frustrate
or
defeat
formal
dictates
in
ways
that
are
designed
not
to
be
discernible
n
their
resistance
was
only
discovered
because
lead
s
evaluation
process
called
for
the
creation
of
focus
groups
made
up
of
sergeants
from
the
department
n
during
discussions
the
sergeants
not
only
disclosed
their
own
reservations
about
the
policy
but
they
also
shared
the
resentments
of
the
rank
and
file
n
these
resentments
and
mistrust
had
led
the
rank
and
file
to
quietly
and
covertly
undermine
the
policy
on
the
street
n
in
response
the
group
began
to
work
closely
with
the
sergeants
and
some
rank
and
file
officers
to
determine
what
the
problems
were
and
how
to
best
address
them
n
this
process
entailed
giving
these
groups
a
voice
and
the
ability
to
make
changes
to
lead
in
response
to
their
concerns
while
the
officers
were
initially
skeptical
about
whether
the
group
was
actually
interested
in
obtaining
their
input
they
slowly
came
around
n
today
not
only
has
the
program
improved
n
but
the
relationships
of
trust
that
were
formed
between
members
of
the
police
department
and
reformers
have
fostered
additional
gains
in
other
areas
importantly
it
is
not
that
all
rank
and
file
officers
bought
into
the
program
but
rather
that
while
some
still
questioned
the
substance
of
the
policy
they
also
worked
towards
improving
its
efficacy
n
giving
genuine
voice
to
officers
and
treating
them
with
respect
affected
their
attitudes
and
behaviors
towards
lead
n
this
occurred
even
though
many
continue
to
disagree
with
the
substance
of
the
policy
n
being
included
in
the
process
rather
than
being
marginalized
and
having
quality
interpersonal
interactions
with
reformers
helped
mitigate
feelings
of
distrust
and
skepticism
from
the
lower
ranks
n
according
to
one
of
the
reformers
who
founded
lead
the
program
is
having
an
important
and
positive
impact
in
the
community
due
to
innovations
from
rank
and
file
police
officers
and
sergeants
n
in
sum
the
seattle
experience
provides
some
evidence
that
rank
and
file
officers
can
play
a
significant
role
in
reform
oriented
policymaking
although
this
role
did
not
involve
the
union
per
se
the
union
also
did
not
file
grievances
and
other
collective
bargaining
challenges
that
they
could
have
brought
furthermore
the
relationships
of
trust
that
developed
between
some
members
of
the
rank
and
file
and
the
outside
reformers
have
facilitated
other
reform
efforts
with
this
type
of
close
contact
reformers
can
gain
a
better
understanding
of
the
major
concerns
of
the
rank
and
file
and
the
union
and
attempt
to
address
them
giving
the
rank
and
file
a
voice
in
implementing
reforms
can
also
facilitate
more
positive
relationships
between
the
rank
and
file
and
police
management
the
more
contact
management
has
with
the
rank
and
file
the
less
likely
union
leadership
can
successfully
paint
a
falsely
negative
picture
of
management
to
ensure
that
rank
and
file
officers
continue
to
join
the
union
increasing
the
power
influence
and
budget
of
union
leadership
policymakers
cannot
afford
to
disregard
the
dynamics
of
power
within
police
departments
for
at
least
two
reasons
first
the
way
that
power
is
exercised
within
departments
can
influence
whether
rank
and
file
officers
view
reforms
as
legitimate
and
entitled
to
deference
or
whether
they
attempt
to
undermine
them
through
acts
of
resistance
policymakers
should
recognize
that
when
they
work
solely
with
the
top
command
levels
of
police
departments
they
might
unintentionally
exacerbate
rank
and
file
frustrations
with
existing
power
arrangements
leading
to
resistance
to
any
new
policies
that
might
be
enacted
n
thus
although
reformers
may
believe
they
have
achieved
success
because
police
management
has
enacted
new
policies
and
procedures
in
response
to
their
concerns
their
failure
to
engage
the
rank
and
file
may
ultimately
doom
their
efforts
second
the
dynamics
of
power
also
reveal
that
resistance
may
occur
without
the
knowledge
of
police
management
or
outside
policymakers
hidden
acts
of
resistance
in
the
face
of
power
are
ubiquitous
because
open
opposition
by
subordinate
groups
often
has
adverse
consequences
especially
in
the
workplace
n
for
instance
an
employee
who
candidly
expresses
her
displeasure
and
disagreement
with
rules
and
policies
directly
to
her
supervisor
may
significantly
reduce
her
opportunities
for
promotion
or
other
discretionary
employment
benefits
because
street
officers
operate
primarily
out
of
sight
of
management
they
have
numerous
opportunities
to
engage
in
covert
resistance
to
reform
oriented
policies
when
resistance
is
subtle
rather
than
overt
management
and
reformers
may
be
unaware
that
the
new
policy
is
not
being
implemented
n
what
the
analysis
thus
far
has
shown
is
that
police
unions
have
strong
incentives
to
resist
policies
imposed
without
their
involvement
in
policy
development
but
also
that
when
they
are
involved
in
policy
development
and
when
the
reforms
are
not
simply
focused
on
harsher
and
swifter
punishment
of
officers
police
unions
have
supported
them
the
question
to
which
this
article
now
turn
is
whether
it
is
feasible
to
use
the
levers
of
labor
law
to
increase
the
incentives
for
departments
and
unions
to
collaborate
in
developing
and
implementing
reforms
iv
changing
police
unions
one
would
search
in
vain
for
any
account
of
the
problems
with
policing
or
the
avenues
for
reform
that
doesn
t
place
substantial
emphasis
on
changing
rank
and
file
police
culture
and
the
supervision
and
training
of
the
rank
and
file
as
the
doj
concluded
in
its
august
report
on
the
baltimore
police
department
bpd
the
constitutional
violations
described
in
the
findings
result
in
part
from
critical
deficiencies
in
the
bpd
s
systems
to
train
equip
supervise
and
hold
officers
accountable
n
doj
found
that
among
other
things
the
bpd
does
not
collect
and
analyze
reliable
data
to
allow
early
interventions
to
deal
with
problematic
officer
conduct
does
not
consistently
accept
investigate
or
respond
to
complaints
of
even
serious
misconduct
and
many
officers
are
reluctant
to
report
misconduct
for
fear
that
doing
so
is
fruitless
and
may
provoke
retaliation
n
the
set
of
best
practices
promulgated
by
the
international
association
of
chiefs
of
police
along
with
empirical
research
on
police
agree
that
rank
and
file
officers
should
be
involved
in
the
development
of
policies
and
in
depth
analyses
of
problematic
police
departments
often
find
that
the
rank
and
file
are
not
involved
in
policymaking
and
resist
the
implementation
of
reforms
n
although
scholars
and
commentators
urge
greater
public
involvement
and
transparency
more
will
be
required
than
just
public
involvement
and
transparency
to
get
police
culture
to
change
n
the
question
this
article
answers
is
whether
changing
certain
institutional
structures
of
employee
representation
including
police
unions
will
promote
rank
and
file
support
for
measures
that
would
improve
community
policing
transparency
and
accountability
in
short
yes
principles
of
labor
law
should
be
used
to
create
leverage
within
police
departments
for
officers
and
supervisors
who
support
reform
in
particular
organizations
of
officers
other
than
the
majority
union
should
be
empowered
to
meet
and
confer
with
department
leaders

and
implementation

on
the
labor
law
principle
of

section
b
then
addresses
the
specifics
of
the
proposal
this
part
concludes
by
addressing
some
potential
questions
a
why
empower
new
labor
organizations
in
police
departments
the
literature
on
policing
the
investigations
of
particular
police
departments
and
the
news
coverage
of
policing
since
ferguson
suggest
that
officers
throughout
the
hierarchy
in
many
police
departments
are
receptive
to
reform
and
willing
to
report
and
to
try
to
prevent
unconstitutional
conduct
n
but
most
accounts
of
supporters
of
reform
either
make
no
mention
of
the
police
union
or
suggest
that
the
union
was
at
best
indifferent
to
the
problems
and
at
worst
hostile
to
reform
efforts
and
whistleblowers
n
for
example
the
nypd
officer
profiled
in
the
february
new
york
times
magazine
for
his
efforts
to
challenge
the
persistence
of
racial
inequities
in
police
citizen
encounters
described
being
retaliated
against
and
seeking
support
not
from
the
police
union
but
from
an
association
of
black
nypd
officers
and
joining
a
class
action
suit
n
another
nypd
officer
adrian
schoolcraft
was
retaliated
against
by
management
when
he
exposed
the
crime
data
manipulation
occurring
due
to
the
department
s
unofficial
quota
policy
and
the
pba
did
nothing
to
protect
him
n
in
the
lapd
an
association
of
black
officers
supports
black
lives
matter
while
the
union
does
not
n
the
doj
report
on
the
bpd
states
that
investigators
met
with
leadership
of
the
baltimore
city
lodge
no
of
the
fop
which
represents
all
sworn
bpd
officers
and
repeatedly
cites
a
fop
report
critical
of
certain
aspects
of
bpd
the
doj
report
notes
a
few
provisions
of
the
union
contract
that
make
officer
discipline
more
difficult
but
says
relatively
little
about
how
the
fop
could
be
either
an
obstacle
to
or
an
agent
of
reform
n
the
doj
report
on
the
chicago
police
department
states
its
investigators
met
with
representatives
of
the
unions
for
rank
and
file
sergeants
lieutenants
and
captains
and
the
report
notes
that
although
there
are
obstacles
to
accountability
in
the
union
contracts
there
are
also
ways
to
override
these
contractual
impediments
that
the
city
rarely
invokes
n
if
the
reformers
at
the
top
of
a
police
department
had
institutionalized
connections
to
reform
supporters
at
the
bottom
of
the
hierarchy
things
might
change
in
theory
unions
could
facilitate
accountability
by
protecting
rank
and
file
officers
from
unfair
decisions
unions
could
enable
these
officers
to
exercise
discretion
and
judgment
assure
fairness
in
punishing
mistakes
and
enable
whistleblowing
unions
might
prevent
scapegoating
a
single
hapless
officer
when
blame
for
mistreatment
of
citizens
belongs
elsewhere
they
could
also
work
to
counter
management
s
insistence
on
dangerous
policies
such
as
the
case
of
nypd
officer
peter
liang
who
shot
an
unarmed
black
youth
in
a
stairwell
while
on
duty
in
accordance
with
a
policy
of
training
rookie
officers
by
placing
them
in
extremely
dangerous
situations
which
had
previously
been
identified
by
commissioner
bratton
as
a
ticking
time
bomb
n
yet
the
examples
above
and
in
part
ii
suggest
that
unions
do
not
always
play
this
role
changing
demographics
of
large
urban
police
forces
may
provide
a
path
forward
to
create
such
institutionalized
connections
among
reformers
throughout
the
hierarchy
as
police
departments
have
become
more
diverse
identity
based
groups
representing
officers
have
gained
members
and
influence
recent
work
shows
that
a
diverse
police
force
mitigates
group
threat
and
thereby
reduces
the
number
of
officer
involved
killings
n
the
diversity
of
the
police
force
is
thought
to
reduce
excessive
force
through
four
processes
it
increases
legitimacy
of
the
police
among
minority
communities
it
increases
the
number
of
officers
who
may
be
more
compassionate
toward
minority
communities
it
increases
opportunities
for
contact
between
police
and
citizens
and
perhaps
most
important
it
weakens
solidarity
within
the
police
community
when
confronted
with
threats
n
thus
although
data
remain
unclear
on
whether
the
representation
of
african
americans
in
the
police
directly
influences
the
number
of
officer
involved
killings
of
african
americans
it
is
linked
with
various
factors
associated
with
group
threat
and
thereby
eases
the
tensions
between
the
police
and
african
american
communities
n
a
diverse
workforce
is
less
likely
to
have
a
monolithic
attitude
toward
issues
but
it
is
necessary
to
have
a
mechanism
to
translate
the
diversity
of
perspectives
into
policymaking
and
implementation
that
institutional
mechanism
could
be
a
diversity
of
labor
organizations
such
organizations
already
exist
in
many
large
departments
the
next
step
is
to
make
them
more
effective
in
becoming
a
voice
for
reform
that
process
may
already
be
happening
as
some
mainstream
police
unions
are
staving
off
the
threat
to
their
dominance
as
the
police
labor
representative
by
building
their
own
bridges
to
civilian
groups
both
inside
and
outside
the
labor
movement
n
a
second
and
related
way
the
institutionalization
of
alternative
labor
organizations
might
transform
police
departments
is
by
combatting
the
proven
tendency
of
police
unions
toward
oligarchy
the
solidarity
that
is
essential
for
any
union
to
function
is
especially
powerful
in
a
workforce
in
which
officers
can
endanger
each
other
s
safety
by
refusing
to
respond
to
a
call
for
backup
the
duty
of
fair
representation
along
with
union
constitutions
and
bylaws
requiring
regular
democratic
elections
of
leadership
are
supposed
to
temper
the
tendency
toward
oligarchy
and
to
make
the
union
leadership
responsive
to
the
disparate
views
of
the
members
n
yet
as
labor
scholars
have
long
observed
oligarchy
remains
a
significant
issue
for
many
unions
and
police
unions
are
no
exception
n
but
the
problem
is
not
simply
oligarchy
in
the
sense
of
control
of
the
union
by
a
few
but
also
that
union
leadership
in
many
cities
seems
unresponsive
to
the
segment
of
the
rank
and
file
who
favor
greater
engagement
with
minority
communities
especially
for
example
as
discussed
above
in
a
number
of
circumstances
union
leadership
s
embrace
of
reform
elicited
a
threat
from
a
segment
of
the
membership
to
vote
the
reformers
out
of
union
office
as
happened
in
seattle
n
a
boston
police
department
veteran
noted
that
union
leaders
who
might
seek
a
collaborative
role
with
management
in
facilitating
reform
would
not
be
re
elected
to
office
n
alternatively
progressive
forces
within
police
departments
have
struggled
with
more
regressive
union
leadership
nypd
officers
attempted
to
oust
pba
president
lynch
after
his
hostile
comments
following
the
killings
of
eric
garner
and
others
but
they
were
unsuccessful
n
empowering
a
minority
union
might
either
goad
the
majority
union
into
supporting
reform
or
provide
an
alternate
channel
for
reform
oriented
officers
to
meet
and
confer
with
management
about
reform
with
legal
protection
from
retaliation
for
doing
so
third
minority
unionism
might
address
the
major
criticisms
of
public
employee
unions
one
criticism
is
that
they
are
not
responsive
to
the
views
of
the
full
range
of
public
employees
and
they
promote
bad
governance
n
another
is
that
public
employees
and
governments
agree
to
terms
that
are
not
in
the
public
interest
because
taxpayers
are
not
represented
in
bargaining
and
public
employee
unions
are
a
special
interest
with
disproportionate
influence
in
the
political
process
unions
are
able
to
get
legislators
and
executive
branch
officials
elected
and
to
lobby
for
legislation
e
g
the
construction
of
more
prisons
or
harsher
criminal
sentences
that
increase
employment
empirical
support
for
and
modeling
that
attempts
to
prove
this
argument
exist
but
the
evidence
is
mixed
n
these
criticisms
were
explored
in
a
classic
work
written
early
in
the
development
of
public
sector
unions
using
the
example
of
police
clyde
summers
a
thoughtful
scholar
of
labor
law
and
a
proponent
of
the
benefits
of
unionization
observed
that
government
employee
collective
bargaining
is
a
political
policymaking
process
and
that
the
bargaining
process
and
the
subjects
over
which
public
employees
bargain
should
be
regulated
by
law
to
produce
a
desirable
political
framework
in
which
to
make
policy
decisions
n
discussing
police
disciplinary
procedures
summers
postulated
that
a
police
union
probably
represents
the
consensus
of
officers
in
negotiating
to
foreclose
public
review
of
discipline
n
he
suggested
that
a
public
review
board
perhaps
ought
not
be
subject
to
bargaining
because
there
would
not
be
a
fair
airing
of
all
sides
of
the
issue
n
a
public
review
board
he
said
is
unlikely
to
be
opposed
by
those
interested
in
more
police
protection
or
by
the
chief
of
police
and
the
police
commissioners
who
sit
on
the
employer
s
side
of
the
bargaining
table
and
in
bargaining
between
the
union
and
the
brass
no
one
represents
the
interests
of
those
who
fear
that
policemen
will
act
abusively
or
unlawfully
and
that
their
superiors
will
not
take
appropriate
disciplinary
action
n
thus
he
concluded
collective
bargaining
does
not
provide
an
appropriate
political
process
for
full
discussion
of
the
issue
or
for
weighing
and
reconciling
the
competing
interests
n
the
labor
law
doctrinal
response
to
the
summers
argument
would
be
to
declare
that
citizen
review
boards
are
not
a
permissible
subject
of
bargaining
so
that
neither
management
nor
the
union
could
negotiate
away
the
public
s
right
to
review
some
police
policies
yet
for
the
reasons
given
above
and
in
the
literature
on
other
forms
of
institutional
reform
limiting
the
power
of
a
police
union
by
simply
taking
some
issues
off
the
negotiating
table
is
not
a
solution
to
the
problem
of
police
misconduct
it
is
essential
to
marshal
the
support
of
the
labor
force
to
implement
policy
and
the
more
discretion
skill
and
expertise
is
required
for
the
work
the
more
important
it
is
to
ensure
that
police
officers
at
the
bottom
of
the
organization
are
given
an
opportunity
to
voice
their
ideas
and
concerns
moreover
the
evidence
from
states
that
prohibit
public
employee
bargaining
does
not
suggest
that
having
no
union
produces
less
police
abuse
n
the
questions
of
accountability
of
police
officers
to
the
public
and
police
union
leadership
to
the
members
exist
even
where
there
is
no
institutionalized
collective
bargaining
as
in
north
carolina
n
in
north
carolina
which
prohibits
governments
from
collectively
bargaining
with
organizations
representing
public
employees
the
fop
which
claims
members
among
city
police
departments
statewide
decided
to
endorse
the
republican
candidate
for
governor
because
the
democratic
candidate
who
was
the
north
carolina
attorney
general
brought
criminal
charges
against
a
charlotte
mecklenburg
police
officer
who
shot
an
unarmed
black
man
in
n
the
absence
of
institutionalized
negotiating
relationships
in
north
carolina
means
that
the
decision
about
whom
the
fop
will
endorse
is
perhaps
one
of
the
most
important
things
that
the
fop
decides
there
is
no
legal
obstacle
to
police
officers
forming
other
groups
to
represent
a
different
point
of
view
and
collect
contributions
from
their
members
to
spend
on
political
activity
but
the
absence
of
such
a
tradition
and
the
absence
of
institutional
support
for
such
organizations
in
the
states
that
do
allow
public
employee
bargaining
give
the
fop
the
practical
ability
to
speak
for
all
north
carolina
police
officers
in
the
way
news
organizations
cover
the
event
what
if
there
were
an
alternative
organization
that
could
rally
the
members
and
engage
in
discussions
with
management
over
an
alternative
point
of
view
n
to
create
such
an
institutional
mechanism
without
producing
a
cacophony
of
voices
and
chaos
in
negotiations
would
require
some
mechanism
to
cause
organizations
to
merge
or
form
coalitions
in
order
to
match
the
leverage
a
long
established
police
union
can
exert
how
that
can
be
done
is
described
below
b
a
form
of
members
only
bargaining
one
old
criticism
of
unions
that
has
gained
recent
support
especially
among
conservatives
and
libertarians
asserts
that
collective
bargaining
by
a
union
chosen
by
the
majority
violates
the
rights
of
the
minority
who
disagree
with
the
union
s
position
n
this
objection
to
unions
has
particular
salience
in
the
case
of
police
unions
especially
in
departments
where
officers
disagree
about
how
to
police
minority
communities
and
whether
arrests
for
certain
relatively
minor
offenses
serve
the
public
interest
while
for
the
moment
public
employee
unions
chosen
by
the
majority
remain
the
exclusive
representative
of
all
employees
in
the
bargaining
unit
the
recent
litigation
and
legislative
efforts
to
dramatically
curtail
bargaining
rights
of
government
workers
have
invited
consideration
of
alternative
models
n
one
model
is
members
only
union
representation
with
some
kind
of
proportional
representation
rule
this
type
of
system
existed
for
some
government
employees
prior
to
the
development
of
modern
public
sector
labor
law
california
for
example
had
a
proportional
representation
system
for
some
public
employees
from
when
it
enacted
its
first
public
sector
labor
law
statute
to
when
it
adopted
new
public
sector
labor
statutes
providing
for
exclusive
representation
n
the
winton
act
n
as
the
old
statute
was
known
did
not
allow
public
employers
to
recognize
an
exclusive
bargaining
representative
chosen
by
the
majority
n
instead
employee
councils
consisting
of
representatives
from
the
gamut
of
employee
organizations
were
authorized
to
meet
with
employers
n
these
councils
were
ostensibly
to
save
time
for
government
agencies
allowing
them
to
hear
all
opinions
at
once
n
the
council
included
representatives
from
employees
in
the
form
of
organization
representatives
or
even
individuals
n
the
act
permitted
the
majority
employee
organization
to
articulate
the
official
position
of
the
employees
but
provided
a
forum
for
other
minority
organization
representatives
and
individuals
to
express
points
of
view
n
the
suggestions
gleaned
from
these
council
meetings
were
handled
by
the
employer
agency
i
e
the
school
board
because
the
winton
act
applied
to
teachers
n
the
employer
had
the
legal
right
under
the
winton
act
to
make
the
final
decision
on
all
matters
n
the
act
recommended
that
employers
incorporate
agreed
upon
items
into
written
resolutions
regulations
or
policies
but
these
directives
were
implemented
in
various
ways
across
the
state
and
council
procedures
differed
from
one
city
county
or
school
district
to
another
n
this
proportional
representation
system
was
replaced
in
california
in
and
in
other
states
by
the
early
s
for
a
variety
of
good
reasons
it
was
far
from
ideal
it
was
expensive
and
cumbersome
it
did
not
provide
an
organized
system
for
shared
decisionmaking
between
government
employees
and
public
administrators
because
decisionmaking
authority
was
left
in
the
hands
of
the
government
agency
n
it
instead
generated
conflict
among
different
groups
of
employees
and
it
was
an
obstacle
to
uniform
policies
across
governmental
units
n
majority
rule
through
exclusive
representation
in
contrast
can
be
more
efficient
as
a
system
of
governance
which
is
why
it
is
the
rule
in
every
democracy
but
sticking
with
political
analogies
many
parliamentary
democracies
have
governance
systems
that
involve
multiple
parties
that
form
coalitions
to
create
a
majority
and
that
might
be
a
pattern
worth
considering
for
police
unions
if
the
concern
is
that
union
leadership
are
systematically
excluding
voices
within
the
rank
and
file
a
variety
of
issues
would
need
to
be
addressed
depending
on
how
radical
a
change
in
the
existing
system
of
representation
a
state
chose
to
adopt
if
officers
chose
not
to
belong
to
the
existing
union
in
the
twenty
two
states
that
allow
employers
and
unions
to
negotiate
contracts
requiring
payment
of
agency
fees
to
a
recognized
labor
organization
n
would
employees
be
obligated
to
pay
an
agency
fee
to
the
majority
union
or
could
they
instead
pay
fees
to
their
own
would
the
majority
union
retain
the
duty
of
fair
representation
to
all
represented
employees
or
only
some
duty
to
its
members
n
would
the
same
collective
bargaining
agreement
apply
to
all
officers
or
only
to
the
members
for
the
moment
a
modest
change
is
the
best
course
of
action
because
it
is
the
only
one
that
might
conceivably
be
adopted
as
legislative
change
is
likely
necessary
because
it
might
allow
beneficial
changes
without
destroying
the
police
unions
that
function
well
and
because
incremental
changes
might
allow
governments
to
assess
the
impact
and
unintended
consequences
and
make
corrections
before
completely
upending
existing
bargaining
agreements
and
personnel
practices
to
prevent
undue
disruption
to
existing
unions
and
bargaining
relationships
the
same
principles
of
dues
and
fees
as
exist
under
current
law
would
apply
as
would
the
duty
of
fair
representation
and
all
the
labor
law
that
turns
on
the
duty
of
fair
representation
all
that
would
change
is
the
department
would
have
the
duty
to
meet
and
confer
with
a
minority
union
provided
it
demonstrated
a
minimum
level
of
support
say
membership
of
twenty
percent
or
more
of
the
officers
in
the
department
the
minimum
threshold
of
support
would
ideally
minimize
the
burden
on
police
departments
to
meet
and
confer
with
too
many
groups
and
would
provide
incentives
for
groups
of
employees
to
band
together
to
make
their
voices
heard
the
scope
of
that
duty
to
meet
and
confer
would
extend
to
any
topic
relating
to
conditions
of
police
employment
other
than
terms
in
the
existing
contract
in
labor
law
terms
the
duty
to
confer
would
cover
matters
of
policy
that
are
not
mandatory
subjects
of
bargaining
under
existing
law
the
purposes
of
this
limit
are
several
it
would
theoretically
reduce
majority
union
opposition
to
the
proposal
it
would
avoid
destabilizing
existing
bargaining
agreements
and
the
department
s
and
government
s
budget
expectations
resting
on
them
it
would
prevent
departments
from
cutting
officer
pay
and
benefits
by
trading
off
responsiveness
to
minority
unions
about
policing
practices
and
community
relations
for
economic
and
job
protections
enjoyed
by
all
officers
the
purpose
of
this
limited
duty
to
confer
is
to
create
an
institutional
mechanism
for
police
officers
to
be
involved
in
policymaking
and
problem
solving
n
that
is
why
the
scope
of
the
new
duty
omits
the
wages
and
working
conditions
as
to
which
public
sector
labor
law
currently
imposes
a
duty
to
bargain
but
it
is
not
intended
to
weaken
the
economic
and
disciplinary
protections
for
which
police
unions
have
bargained
the
proposal
resembles
some
that
have
been
made
for
the
reform
of
teaching
another
area
of
public
sector
employment
with
high
union
density
and
substantial
controversy
about
whether
unionization
serves
the
interests
of
the
government
employees
and
the
public
n
it
also
more
generally
resembles
proposals
to
create
institutions
of
labor
management
cooperation
that
have
been
made
many
times
for
different
industries
in
that
it
provides
a
framework
for
collective
discussion
of
issues
of
mutual
concern
outside
the
context
of
union
management
negotiations
over
wages
and
working
conditions
n
it
echoes
criticisms
of
labor
law
scholars
including
martin
malin
and
joseph
slater
concerning
the
scope
of
the
duty
to
meet
and
confer
in
the
public
sector
n
according
to
professor
malin
there
is
a
lot
of
evidence
that
when
workers
through
their
unions
are
given
a
voice
in
areas
where
they
have
no
right
to
bargain
the
union
s
role
is
transformed
and
better
policies
result
for
example
when
school
boards
unilaterally
impose
performance
standards
it
is
not
a
surprise
that
unions
do
what
they
can
to
protect
teachers
from
adverse
actions
based
on
failing
to
meet
those
standards
when
school
boards
opt
instead
to
work
with
the
union
to
develop
those
standards
and
use
peer
review
to
implement
them
the
unions
become
the
protectors
of
the
standards
rather
than
knee
jerk
opponents
union
involvement
in
teacher
peer
review
leads
to
greater
levels
of
attrition
among
poor
performers
than
traditional
methods
of
principal
observation
and
discipline
or
dismissal
for
failure
to
meet
the
standards
n
a
similar
phenomenon
occurred
in
the
s
when
president
clinton
by
executive
order
created
partnership
councils
and
thereby
spurred
the
creation
of
a
very
successful
partnership
between
the
customs
service
n
and
the
national
treasury
employees
union
that
represented
customs
agents
n
data
showed
a
substantial
improvement
in
job
performance
even
by
metrics
such
as
increased
drug
and
currency
seizures
n
similar
results
were
seen
in
oakland
when
the
police
department
developed
a
peer
review
system
for
reviewing
officer
uses
of
force
n
as
indicated
above
during
the
pendency
of
the
project
the
department
experienced
a
reduction
in
officer
use
of
force
n
this
proposal
also
incorporates
suggestions
that
labor
law
scholars
have
made
to
incorporate
identity
based
groups
into
unionized
workplaces
as
a
way
of
ensuring
that
the
majority
union
does
not
systematically
overlook
the
interests
of
minorities
n
officers
could
belong
both
to
the
minority
union
and
to
the
majority
union
so
that
they
would
not
have
to
give
up
the
benefits
of
majority
union
membership
including
the
ability
to
vote
on
leadership
and
contract
ratification
and
the
right
to
receive
insurance
and
legal
representation
paid
for
by
union
dues
officers
also
could
gain
the
benefits
of
membership
in
the
minority
union
principally
the
ability
to
have
a
voice
in
the
minority
union
s
governance
and
priority
setting
policies
this
proposal
solves
many
of
the
unique
problems
associated
with
police
unions
in
the
quest
for
reform
police
unions
have
been
isolated
from
the
rest
of
the
labor
movement
in
many
ways
but
particularly
in
their
disconnectedness
from
the
social
movement
unionism
principles
and
practices
that
have
reinvigorated
many
other
unions
a
police
minority
group
that
shares
a
self
interest
with
black
lives
matter
or
moral
mondays
is
ideally
situated
to
start
trying
to
transform
the
culture
of
the
police
department
and
the
police
union
a
minority
union
might
find
allies
among
the
activists
of
black
lives
matter
and
other
groups
which
might
empower
the
minority
union
to
stand
up
to
what
might
be
considerable
pressure
from
the
police
union
that
is
a
type
of
protection
for
whistleblowing
that
simply
cannot
be
legislated
or
enforced
by
contract
and
it
might
create
momentum
that
would
attract
quiescent
dissenters
from
among
the
rank
and
file
to
abandon
their
reflexive
support
for
the
union
and
its
defense
of
miscreant
officers
n
c
will
this
version
of
members
only
unionism
weaken
public
sector
unions
and
is
that
a
bad
thing
there
are
certain
large
and
small
objections
to
any
proposal
to
adopt
any
form
of
members
only
bargaining
even
one
as
minor
as
this
we
address
two
clusters
of
the
most
important
objections
below
one
major
concern
is
that
the
proposal
does
too
little
it
is
not
clear
that
adopting
this
limited
duty
to
meet
and
confer
with
minority
organizations
will
change
very
much
police
officers
have
shown
themselves
to
be
quite
loyal
to
their
unions
n
this
proposal
leaves
the
majority
union
in
charge
of
the
economic
contract
terms
and
the
disciplinary
system
at
least
in
the
jurisdictions
where
the
disciplinary
system
is
in
the
contract
rather
than
written
into
statute
n
these
are
the
two
top
priorities
for
police
n
and
the
disciplinary
system
is
the
biggest
concern
of
police
reformers
n
moreover
many
protections
are
written
into
statutes
and
no
system
of
union
representation
will
change
that
unless
the
majority
union
is
weakened
to
the
point
that
it
cannot
block
legislative
change
n
but
the
modesty
of
this
proposal
should
be
seen
as
a
feature
rather
than
a
bug
at
least
to
those
who
favor
some
reform
but
fear
that
radical
change
is
either
politically
impossible
or
would
wreak
havoc
on
public
employee
labor
relations
and
thereby
do
more
harm
than
good
as
a
modest
development
it
would
not
change
too
much
too
fast
which
might
allow
for
innovation
in
the
fertile
pockets
of
progressive
police
activism
that
do
exist
without
destabilizing
existing
bargaining
relationships
in
departments
that
are
not
already
dysfunctional
a
second
major
concern
is
that
the
minority
union
would
be
easily
undermined
given
the
radioactive
nature
of
some
of
the
issues
the
minority
union
might
wish
to
discuss
with
management
e
g
civilian
review
boards
the
officers
practice
of
huddling
before
making
reports
on
violence
racial
disparities
in
arrests
for
minor
infractions
n
a
minority
union
would
face
considerable
pressure
from
the
majority
union
and
its
members
unlike
those
faced
by
other
caucuses
within
unionized
workplaces
in
some
low
wage
workers
unions
for
example
few
members
of
the
union
show
up
at
meetings
because
union
meetings
take
free
time
that
many
workers
juggling
jobs
and
family
do
not
have
and
many
probably
do
not
care
much
about
non
core
contractual
issues
n
but
one
can
imagine
police
having
intense
interest
in
these
non
core
contractual
issues
once
minority
unions
have
real
power
unlike
the
minority
caucuses
now
it
is
easy
to
imagine
a
police
minority
union
being
quickly
co
opted
or
sabotaged
by
internal
union
confederates
minority
unions
would
under
this
proposal
have
the
right
and
responsibility
to
discuss
contentious
issues
like
use
of
force
statistical
measures
of
police
productivity
and
other
policing
tactics
that
have
become
extremely
divisive
one
could
imagine
officers
who
are
hostile
to
reform
having
intense
interest
in
preventing
the
minority
union
from
persuading
management
to
make
any
significant
changes
officers
opposed
to
reform
might
sign
up
en
masse
to
join
the
minority
union
precisely
to
take
it
over
and
kill
it
or
minority
union
members
might
face
intense
pressure
to
defect
to
the
majority
union
so
that
the
minority
union
would
dissolve
there
are
ways
to
design
a
minority
union
system
to
address
these
concerns
perhaps
minority
union
membership
could
be
confidential
leaving
the
job
of
physically
meeting
and
conferring
with
the
brass
to
the
most
courageous
few
who
felt
they
could
publicly
stand
the
pressure
or
the
minority
union
might
rely
on
the
labor
law
principles
that
have
allowed
unions
to
fire
stewards
when
they
believe
the
steward
has
become
ideologically
opposed
to
the
union
n
public
sector
labor
law
in
most
jurisdictions
already
protects
union
activists
from
retaliation
or
harassment
n
and
such
protection
would
need
to
be
extended
to
supporters
of
the
minority
union
as
well
as
the
majority
union
to
the
extent
that
a
system
of
representation
gained
traction
it
could
produce
the
kind
of
chaos
and
cacophony
that
led
to
criticisms
of
the
proportional
representation
system
in
california
before
n
it
could
lead
to
expensive
and
slow
discussions
rather
than
any
real
change
in
policy
management
could
play
the
two
unions
off
against
each
other
thus
weakening
both
those
concerns
could
be
ameliorated
by
careful
design
the
system
could
be
limited
to
just
one
majority
and
one
minority
union
moreover
to
the
extent
that
the
change
gave
a
minority
union
power
to
negotiate
any
kind
of
binding
agreement
on
any
terms
currently
subject
to
the
duty
to
bargain
with
the
exclusive
representative
some
complex
problems
would
arise
courts
or
public
employee
relations
boards
would
have
to
decide
how
to
recalibrate
the
mandatory
subjects
of
bargaining
to
enable
participation
of
the
minority
union
significantly
they
would
have
to
decide
whether
discipline
remains
a
mandatory
subject
of
bargaining
because
so
much
of
the
controversy
over
police
violence
focuses
on
the
appropriate
disciplinary
process
if
it
is
they
would
have
to
determine
how
to
allow
the
minority
union
to
play
a
role
in
negotiation
over
the
disciplinary
system
if
the
minority
union
were
empowered
to
be
at
the
bargaining
table
over
design
of
the
disciplinary
system
then
questions
would
arise
over
how
to
involve
the
minority
union
in
the
interest
arbitration
or
fact
finding
process
that
often
resolves
bargaining
disputes
over
mandatory
subjects
of
bargaining
d
the
benefits
of
the
proposal
outweigh
the
risks
the
advantage
this
proposal
has
over
most
others
being
offered
is
that
this
one
has
the
possibility
of
garnering
support
from
some
rank
and
file
police
officers
who
are
dissatisfied
with
their
union
but
see
a
wholesale
assault
on
police
unionism
as
worse
than
the
status
quo
of
course
if
even
the
mildest
version
of
this
proposal
were
offered
as
legislation
it
may
be
impossible
to
enact
or
implement
precisely
to
the
extent
it
would
weaken
extant
unions
in
when
wisconsin
eliminated
bargaining
rights
for
most
public
sector
employees
it
did
not
eliminate
such
rights
for
public
safety
employees
n
ohio
in
contrast
tried
to
eliminate
bargaining
for
every
public
employee
and
the
voters
repealed
the
law
by
referendum
n
both
of
these
are
reminders
of
the
power
of
public
safety
unions
even
in
climates
that
have
a
strong
antiunion
strain
advocates
of
the
benefits
of
police
unions
to
police
reform
in
the
s
insisted
that
police
unions
could
train
officers
in
the
values
of
democracy
and
could
remedy
the
alienated
and
repressive
mentality
of
the
police
by
involving
as
many
policemen
as
possible
in
decision
making
on
all
aspects
of
the
department
s
job
n
creating
an
institutional
mechanism
that
gives
space
for
minority
unions
to
voice
their
concerns
would
create
incentives
for
existing
unions
to
account
for
these
opposing
views
this
might
facilitate
the
development
of
the
values
of
trust
cooperation
communication
leadership
and
respect
n
working
through
inevitable
disagreements
would
provide
opportunities
for
officers
to
learn
these
important
values
n
officers
might
gain
maturity
patience
and
tolerance
for
different
points
of
view
that
can
translate
into
better
relationships
and
engagements
with
the
communities
they
serve
n
additionally
deliberating
through
disputes
and
coming
to
a
successful
resolution
will
involve
creativity
and
problem
solving
skills
that
are
consonant
with
abilities
they
will
have
to
develop
to
successfully
engage
in
community
policing
n
the
reasons
for
encouraging
a
multitude
of
voices
in
reform
oriented
policymaking
is
not
simply
to
increase
buy
in
and
reduce
resistance
rather
their
contributions
can
help
make
the
reforms
themselves
more
effective
n
there
are
two
reasons
for
this
first
policymakers
both
within
and
outside
the
department
often
believe
that
their
expertise
makes
them
better
equipped
than
the
rank
and
file
to
determine
what
reforms
are
necessary
and
how
best
to
bring
them
to
fruition
they
may
be
completely
unaware
of
their
own
limitations
and
information
gaps
this
fallacy
of
expertise
n
causes
policymakers
to
overlook
the
benefits
of
obtaining
input
from
the
individuals
who
will
be
tasked
with
executing
their
vision
n
however
as
previously
discussed
rank
and
file
officers
will
have
insights
to
share
based
upon
their
day
to
day
engagement
in
street
policing
involving
top
command
in
policymaking
is
not
an
adequate
substitute
for
the
expertise
and
knowledge
of
the
rank
and
file
because
high
level
police
managers
might
have
lost
touch
with
changed
circumstances
on
the
street
furthermore
top
command
officers
may
be
disconnected
from
the
actual
experiences
of
officers
on
the
street
and
thus
may
be
unaware
of
the
challenges
posed
by
the
reform
to
street
officers
daily
work
it
would
be
more
efficient
to
identify
these
issues
prior
to
implementation
rather
than
after
policies
and
procedures
have
been
changed
the
second
reason
to
create
mechanisms
to
ensure
that
a
multitude
of
voices
are
heard
is
that
involvement
of
the
rank
and
file
in
decisionmaking
can
help
mitigate
inevitable
misunderstandings
and
miscommunications
that
occur
when
new
policies
are
explained
to
them
the
rank
and
file
will
undoubtedly
encounter
unexpected
problems
during
the
process
of
implementation
this
implementation
gap
n
can
occur
even
if
officers
are
attempting
to
apply
the
reform
in
good
faith
policymakers
cannot
anticipate
every
circumstance
that
officers
will
confront
when
they
attempt
to
put
a
new
policy
into
practice
thus
they
cannot
possibly
create
rules
that
govern
every
situation
n
as
a
consequence
officers
inevitably
interpret
and
modify
policy
n
this
process
of
interpretation
can
have
both
unforeseen
and
unintended
consequences
not
contemplated
by
the
reformers
n
also
if
officers
were
not
involved
in
conceiving
the
policy
they
may
not
appreciate
its
goals
and
intent
hence
their
choices
and
judgments
will
not
be
informed
by
a
deep
understanding
of
the
policy
s
purpose
as
a
result
of
the
implementation
gap
policies
may
not
work
as
reformers
intended
even
when
the
rank
and
file
are
doing
their
best
to
abide
by
them
if
the
rank
and
file
are
not
given
a
voice
reformers
may
not
find
out
about
the
problems
furthermore
top
command
and
policymakers
may
attribute
the
gap
between
theory
and
practice
to
rank
and
file
obstinacy
n
in
response
top
command
may
increase
rank
and
file
surveillance
in
order
to
control
their
behavior
and
punish
them
for
transgressions
not
realizing
that
the
problems
are
due
to
their
own
inability
to
anticipate
how
the
policy
would
actually
work
in
practice
n
ironically
this
increased
surveillance
and
control
can
lead
to
resistance
that
may
not
have
existed
in
the
first
place
n
thus
the
failure
to
involve
the
rank
and
file
not
only
deprives
the
reform
of
being
more
effective
but
it
may
also
have
the
unintended
effect
of
generating
resistance
as
reformers
attribute
the
failure
of
the
policy
solely
to
rank
and
file
resistance
two
scholars
observe
all
too
often
this
whole
process
becomes
reiterative
the
reforms
meet
with
police
skepticism
the
way
the
police
respond
to
them
generates
unintended
consequences
the
negative
consequences
then
inspire
another
set
of
reforms
that
again
meets
with
local
skepticism
and
so
on
the
continuous
process
of
reform
soon
will
reach
a
point
where
police
are
so
weary
of
reform
that
they
become
increasingly
immovable
constant
reform
undermines
morale
and
breeds
ever
greater
skepticism
about
reform
n
engaging
the
rank
and
file
in
policymaking
could
help
to
avoid
some
of
the
problems
caused
by
the
fallacy
of
expertise
and
the
implementation
gap
with
involvement
rank
and
file
officers
could
make
reformers
aware
of
the
challenges
posed
by
the
policies
both
ex
ante
and
ex
post
rank
and
file
officers
inevitably
make
policy
on
the
street
through
their
day
to
day
interactions
with
the
public
n
involving
the
rank
and
file
in
formal
policymaking
might
enhance
the
effectiveness
of
the
reform
by
improving
information
flows
and
rank
and
file
compliance
n
this
proposal
can
also
help
to
change
the
notoriously
entrenched
culture
of
police
departments
n
research
suggests
that
people
often
engage
in
behaviors
that
they
believe
others
are
also
engaged
in
n
in
other
words
people
imitate
those
around
them
psychologists
refer
to
this
as
social
proof
n
however
often
assumptions
about
another
s
beliefs
are
based
on
inaccurate
information
n
one
way
to
overcome
mistaken
beliefs
about
what
others
are
thinking
is
to
make
other
views
salient
and
public
minority
union
representation
will
show
rank
and
file
officers
that
their
potentially
more
open
minded
and
progressive
views
are
shared
by
others
additionally
this
minority
unionism
would
give
outside
reformers
the
opportunity
to
understand
that
there
are
officers
within
the
department
who
support
their
proposals
and
this
could
lead
to
the
forging
of
partnerships
between
police
reformers
and
officers
within
the
department
that
can
facilitate
reforms
moreover
if
decisionmakers
are
truly
considering
input
from
the
rank
and
file
it
is
likely
that
the
policies
that
are
eventually
enacted
will
incorporate
some
of
their
suggestions
rank
and
file
officers
have
knowledge
and
expertise
to
share
given
their
familiarity
with
the
street
n
they
will
have
ideas
that
policymakers
did
not
consider
and
they
can
also
highlight
unanticipated
problems
additionally
reformers
may
be
unaware
that
their
ideas
as
initially
proposed
are
simply
unworkable
for
a
variety
of
reasons
from
the
mundane
to
the
insurmountable
n
thus
rank
and
file
officers
can
help
fill
the
gap
between
theory
and
practice
mechanisms
to
improve
labor
management
cooperation
are
essential
to
police
reform
it
is
misguided
to
suggest
that
the
solution
is
simply
to
make
it
easier
for
departments
to
fire
or
discipline
officers
without
changing
the
way
that
management
relates
to
the
rank
and
file
for
at
least
three
reasons
first
it
may
be
politically
impossible
to
significantly
reduce
contractual
or
statutory
protections
for
officers
accused
of
misconduct
second
and
by
far
more
important
even
if
every
officer
who
kills
a
civilian
unjustifiably
were
fired
promptly
and
criminally
prosecuted
it
is
an
empirical
question
whether
police
violence
would
decline
through
the
operation
of
specific
or
general
deterrence
n
if
some
number
of
unjustified
police
shootings
are
the
result
of
poor
training
or
bad
management
one
puts
a
great
deal
of
faith
in
enlightened
police
management
to
assume
that
eliminating
job
protections
for
rank
and
file
officers
will
allow
management
to
dramatically
alter
patrol
officers
behavior
to
better
safeguard
the
public
even
if
police
union
contracts
and
statutory
leobors
were
revised
to
provide
a
speedier
and
more
transparent
disciplinary
process
that
would
make
it
easier
to
terminate
the
employment
of
officers
found
to
have
used
improper
force
still
policing
behavior
might
not
change
dramatically
if
police
management
encourages
practices
that
lead
to
excessive
force
arrests
for
minor
infractions
or
other
kinds
of
law
enforcement
strategies
that
harm
minority
communities
conclusion
the
prevailing
narrative
suggests
that
rank
and
file
officers
in
general
and
police
unions
in
particular
are
obstacles
to
reforms
that
would
make
policing
more
transparent
accountable
and
legitimate
to
the
citizenry
while
there
is
certainly
strong
evidence
to
support
this
view
this
article
highlights
examples
of
rank
and
file
officers
acting
individually
and
some
unions
acting
representatively
as
key
partners
in
reform
efforts
that
can
improve
the
quality
of
policing
the
essential
question
is
how
to
increase
the
opportunities
for
officers
to
be
a
positive
force
for
the
improvement
of
police
services
discussions
of
the
need
for
police
reform
understandably
focus
on
problematic
officers
and
on
unions
that
appear
to
be
irredeemably
opposed
to
any
reform
oriented
policies
what
is
lost
in
these
discussions
is
the
recognition
of
the
officers
who
could
be
partners
in
reform
efforts
and
who
do
not
have
a
mechanism
for
making
their
voices
heard
within
the
department
especially
when
the
police
union
for
whatever
reason
either
does
not
support
their
views
or
does
not
take
their
views
into
account
minority
unionism
in
police
departments
gives
these
officers
a
voice
by
creating
an
institutional
mechanism
to
ensure
that
their
views
are
heard
this
proposal
expands
the
duty
of
management
to
meet
and
confer
with
the
police
union
to
include
subjects
relating
to
reform
it
prevents
the
minority
union
from
renegotiating
the
economic
terms
and
disciplinary
system
created
by
the
majority
union
in
the
collective
bargaining
agreement
or
invoking
the
interest
arbitration
system
used
to
resolve
bargaining
disputes
between
the
majority
union
and
the
department
thus
departments
and
police
unions
should
support
this
reform
as
it
respects
their
interests
the
proposal
moreover
is
built
on
successful
labor
management
partnerships
that
have
been
used
in
both
federal
and
state
systems
and
that
demonstrably
improved
productivity
morale
and
the
quality
of
service
provided
by
government
agencies
in
which
these
types
of
labor
management
councils
have
been
implemented
alternative
proposals
such
as
increasing
public
scrutiny
of
police
discipline
and
reducing
job
protections
for
police
officers
may
not
achieve
greater
accountability
or
reduce
unwarranted
police
violence
while
it
is
important
to
increase
public
scrutiny
of
police
actions
doing
so
will
not
necessarily
further
the
goals
of
police
accountability
for
instance
civilian
members
of
panels
that
review
the
disciplinary
decisions
of
lapd
police
chief
beck
were
more
likely
than
officers
to
oppose
the
chief
s
discipline
recommendations
n
furthermore
if
eliminating
job
protections
for
officers
would
reduce
police
violence
then
it
should
be
done
however
this
proposal
addresses
the
normative
question
of
what
kinds
of
procedural
protections
police
officers
should
have
when
accused
of
misconduct
n
allowing
a
diverse
set
of
officers
to
participate
in
reform
oriented
policymaking
would
force
the
primary
union
to
account
for
minority
voices
force
management
to
account
for
a
diversity
of
views
and
help
management
and
rank
and
file
officers
to
develop
trust
providing
them
voice
and
accounting
for
their
input
shows
them
respect
gives
them
a
sense
of
ownership
n
and
will
likely
increase
their
perceptions
of
the
department
s
legitimacy
the
benefits
of
experimenting
with
giving
diverse
voices
a
say
in
reform
oriented
policymaking
is
well
worth

levine
supra
note
at
as
noted
in
the
doj
chicago
report
some
barriers
to
accountability
for
misconduct
are
also
created
by
management
without
apparent
legislative
or
union
negotiated
pressure
the
doj
stated
our
investigation
revealed
that
the
city
fails
to
conduct
any
investigation
of
nearly
half
of
police
misconduct
complaints
and
that
a
number
of
institutional
barriers
contribute
to
this
fact
there
are
provisions
in
the
city
s
agreements
with
the
unions
that
impede
the
investigative
process
such
as
the
general
requirement
that
a
complainant
sign
a
sworn
affidavit
and
limitations
on
investigating
anonymous
complaints
and
older
incidents
of
misconduct
that
said
the
union
agreements
contain
override
provisions
for
some
of
these
provisions
that
the
city
rarely
utilizes
other
barriers
have
been
created
solely
by
the
city
such
as
internal
policies
allowing
investigative
agencies
to
truncate
investigations
of
serious
misconduct
through
mediation
administratively
close
complaints
deemed
less
serious
and
ignore
mandatory
investigations
into
uses
of
force
that
could
identify
misconduct
or
faulty
training
issues
doj
chi
rep
supra
note
at
the
doj
also
found
procedures
used
in
the
circumstances
where
investigations
are
conducted
hampered
the
search
for
truth
and
its
description
of
those
procedures
makes
clear
that
blame
for
them
is
widespread
witnesses
and
accused
officers
are
frequently
not
interviewed
at
all
or
not
interviewed
until
long
after
the
incident
when
memories
have
faded
when
interviews
do
occur
questioning
is
often
biased
in
favor
of
officers
and
witness
coaching
by
union
attorneys
is
prevalent
and
unimpeded
a
dynamic
neither
we
nor
our
law
enforcement
experts
had
seen
to
nearly
such
an
extent
in
other
agencies
investigators
routinely
fail
to
collect
probative
evidence
the
procedures
surrounding
investigations
allow
for
ample
opportunity
for
collusion
among
officers
and
are
devoid
of
any
rules
prohibiting
such
coordination
we
found
that
a
lack
of
resources
and
investigative
training
contribute
to
these
investigative
problems
we
also
found
that
investigations
foundered
because
of
the
pervasive
cover
up
culture
among
cpd
officers
which
the
accountability
entities
accept
as
an
immutable
fact
rather
than
something
to
root

past
experiments

alone
suggest
that
this
reform
is
likely
to
encounter
substantial
resistance

insufficient
to
transform
police
practices
absent
dramatic
changes
in
management
that
will
generate
trust
of
the
rank

what
is
needed
are
reforms
that
garner
rank

so
that
the
practices
are
embraced
willingly
rather
than
imposed
through

among

sounding

only
portend
greater
anxiety
about
digital
robots
replacing
humans
in
the
governmental
sphere
a
few
administrative
agencies
have
already
begun
to
adopt
this
technology
while
others
have
clear
potential
in
the
near
term
to
use
algorithms
to
shape
official
decisions
over
both
rulemaking
and
adjudication
it
is
no
longer
fanciful
to
envision
a
future
in
which
government
agencies
could
effectively
make
law
by
robot
a
prospect
that
understandably
conjures
up
dystopian
images
of
individuals
surrendering
their
liberty
to
the
control
of
computerized
overlords
should
society
be
alarmed
by
governmental
use
of
machine
learning
applications
we
examine
this
question
by
considering
whether
the
use
of
robotic
decision
tools
by
government
agencies
can
pass
muster
under
core
time
honored
doctrines
of
administrative
and
constitutional
law
at
first
glance
the
idea
of
algorithmic
regulation
might
appear
to
offend
one
or
more
traditional
doctrines
such
as
the
nondelegation
doctrine
procedural
due
process
equal
protection
or
principles
of
reason
giving
and
transparency
we
conclude
however
that
when
machine
learning
technology
is
properly
understood
its
use
by
government
agencies
can
comfortably
fit
within
these
conventional
legal
parameters
we
recognize
of
course
that
the
legality
of
regulation
by
robot
is
only
one
criterion
by
which
its
use
should
be
assessed
agencies
should
not
apply
algorithms
cavalierly
even
if
doing
so
might
not
run
afoul
of
the
law
in
some
cases
safeguards
may
be
needed
for
machine
learning
to
satisfy
broader
good
governance
aspirations
yet
in
contrast
with
the
emerging
alarmism
we
resist
any
categorical
dismissal
of
a
future
administrative
state
in
which
algorithmic
automation
guides
and
even
at
times
makes
key
decisions
instead
we
urge
that
governmental
reliance
on
machine
learning
should
be
approached
with
measured
optimism
about
the
potential
benefits
such
technology
can
offer

introduction
algorithms
are
not
new
for
decades
they
have
served
as
integral
components
of
every
computer
program
n
but
today
advanced
machine

are
creating
a
vastly
automated

astonishing

today
s
algorithms

digital
robots

that
possess
effectively
autonomous
abilities
to
adapt
and
learn
n
as
this
type
of
artificial
intelligence
becomes
more
intricately
woven
into
the
economy
a
new
kind
of
information
revolution
is
beginning
that
may
lead
to
fundamental
changes
in
society
n
the
ability
of
increasingly
intelligent
systems
to
replace
human
workers
for
instance
has
prompted
widespread
concern
about
the
impact
of
machine
learning
on
employment
opportunities
across
a
variety
of
occupational
and
professional
fields
n
according
to
some
projections
artificial
intelligence
threatens
to
displace
workers
in
all
routinized
jobs
and
skill
based
jobs
that
require
the
ability
to
perform
diverse
kinds
of
cognitive
labor
from
physicians
to
reporters
to
stockbrokers
n
even
more
ominously
some
commentators
worry
about
potentially
new
forms
of
human
oppression
that
could
stem
from
greater
reliance
on
artificial
intelligence
high
tech
entrepreneur
elon
musk
for
example
has
warned
that
artificial
intelligence
presents
the
biggest
existential
threat
to
society
likening
it
to
summoning
the
demon
n
renowned
physicist
stephen
hawking
has
eerily
forecasted
that
t
he
development
of
full
artificial
intelligence
could
spell
the
end
of
the
human
race
n
new

times
reporter
john
markoff
summarizes
the
views
of
a
growing
number
of
observers
who
worry
that
emerging
smart
machines
risk
constituting
a
new
set
of
masters
controlling
humanity
n
these
worries
about
artificial
intelligence
s
impact
on
human
liberty
have
surfaced
over
the
use
of
machine
learning
by
private
sector
institutions
such
as
banks
and
media
companies
but
presumably
the
prospect
of
governmental
reliance
on
autonomous
self
learning
robots
only
magnifies
any
perceived
risks
of
digital
oppression
machine
learning
uses
by
defense
homeland
security
and
criminal
law
enforcement
authorities
have
understandably
begun
to
trigger
alarm
and
prompt
serious
ethical
consideration
waging
war
through
robots
for
example
presents
obviously
novel
concerns
n
the
use
of
algorithms
to
analyze
telephone
records
and
other
personal
information
has
also
sparked
extensive
public
controversy
over
privacy
issues
n
similar
controversies
surround
law
enforcement
agencies
use
of
machine
learning
to
detect
respond
to
and
perhaps
even
predict
crime
n
notwithstanding
the
extensive
attention
given
to
the
use
of
machine
learning
algorithms
by
national
security
and
criminal
law
enforcement
agencies
the
use
of
such
artificial
intelligence
by
other
governmental
institutions
in
the
day
to
day
operation
of
government
has
escaped
sustained
analysis
granted
commentators
have
occasionally
speculated
about
a
fanciful
future
in
which
institutions
like
the
supreme
court
n
or
the
presidency
n
might
be
replaced
by
artificial
intelligence
but
such
speculations
are
usually
intended
as
absurdities
most
people
believe
that
core
governmental
institutions
and
their
decisions
must
be
grounded
in
judgments
made
by
real
human
beings
a
government
of
the
people
by
the
people
n
even
if
machine
learning
algorithms
come
to
be
widely
accepted
as
substitutes
for
human
control
over
automobiles
or
other
functions
in
private
life
a
deeper
more
fundamental
suspicion
about
artificial
intelligence
will
presumably
remain
about
the
use
of
machine
learning
in
the
governmental
sphere
when
it
comes
to
making
laws
and
other
governmental
decisions
the
notion
of
using
algorithms
as
substitutes
for
human
decisions
would
appear
to
create
a
serious
threat
to
democratic
governance
conjuring
images
of
unaccountable
computerized
overlords
n
and
yet
despite
dire
warnings
about
the
dangers
of
runaway
algorithmic
governance
many
aspects
of
public
administration
could
undoubtedly
benefit
from
the
application
of
machine
learning
algorithms
both
today
and
in
years
to
come
the
vast
work
of
administrative
agencies
with
their
many
routine
regulatory
responsibilities
and
adjudicatory
processes
would
seem
ripe
to
benefit
from
such
automation
these
agencies
fulfill
important
oversight
responsibilities
over
vital
aspects
of
everyday
life
from
regulating
the
safety
of
the
food
we
eat
to
setting
the
rules
by
which
financial
markets
operate
officials
in
these
agencies
must
make
an
array
of
crucial
judgments
on
a
daily
basis
that
are
not
unlike
the
kinds
of
judgments
that
machine
learning
has
so
clearly
helped
improve
in
the
private
sector
n
moreover
with
the
private
sector
increasingly
relying
on
algorithms
to
make
faster
more
precise
decisions
the
increased
speed
and
complexity
of
economic
activity
in
the
machine
learning
era
surely
demands
that
government
agencies
keep
pace
and
make
use
of
the
same
analytic
tools
in
order
to
regulate
the
private
sector
more
effectively
n
if
machine
learning
can
help
regulatory
agencies
make
smarter
more
accurate
decisions
the
benefits
to
society
could
be
considerable
but
can
the
prospect
of
the
government
regulating
by
robot
or
adjudicating
by
algorithm
be
accommodated
within
prevailing
legal
norms
fitting
machine
learning
into
the
regulatory
state
may
turn
out
to
be
one
of
the
most
fundamental
challenges
facing
the
u
s
governmental
system
in
the
decades
to
come
regulating
by
robot
would
hardly
seem
at
first
glance
to
fit
naturally
within
prevailing
principles
of
administrative
law
that
law
after
all
is
built
on
the
assumption
that
governmental
decisions
will
be
made
by
humans
such
an
assumption
has
led
to
a
variety
of
legal
constraints
aimed
at
ensuring
administrative
decisions
are
democratically
accountable
and
fair
indeed
even
with
humans
at
the
helm
administrative
agencies
are
already
thought
to
constitute
a
vast
bureaucratic
machinery
of
government
with
an
ever
present
potential
to
grow
detached
from
and
unaccountable
to
the
rest
of
society
n
if
many
bureaucrats
jobs
come
to
be
replaced
by
automated
systems
the
likelihood
of
an
even
more
detached
possibly
despotic
administrative
government
would
only
seem
to
increase
n
when
contemplating
the
use
of
robotic
algorithms
public
officials
lawyers
and
judges
should
ask
how
well
the
use
of
machine
learning
will
conform
to
well
established
legal
principles
of
constitutional
and
administrative
law
in
this
article
we
address
significant
but
previously
unanalyzed
legal
questions
raised
by
machine
learning
in
particular
we
consider
how
nonhuman
decision
tools
would
have
to
be
used
to
comport
with
the
nondelegation
doctrine
and
with
rules
about
due
process
antidiscrimination
and
governmental
transparency
although
administrative
agencies
are
still
only
beginning
to
use
machine
learning
algorithms
today
s
widespread
concern
about
the
robotic
control
of
other
facets
of
life
makes
it
opportune
to
examine
carefully
the
potential
for
machine
learning
s
use
by
government
agencies
n
given
the
relative
complexity
of
modern
machine
learning
algorithms
we
begin
in
part
i
by
providing
a
brief
non
technical
summary
of
how
these
algorithms
operate
drawing
on
this
background
we
also

existing
and
likely
future
applications

analysis
of
such
algorithmic
applications
by
federal
administrative
agencies
considering
whether
various
methods
of
implementing
machine
learning
will
likely
offend
principles
of
nondelegation
due
process
antidiscrimination
and
transparency
we
conclude
that
government
agencies
should
be
able
to
rely
on
autonomous
learning
decision
tools
without
running
afoul
of
legal
standards
contrary
to
popular
perceptions
machine
learning
will
not
lead
to
a
runaway
government
as
a
series
of
technical
limitations
preclude
a
future
in
which
complete
regulatory
or
adjudicatory
power
can
be
ceded
to
autonomous
algorithms
over
which
humans
exert
little
control
when
used
thoughtfully
these
machine
learning
applications
should
not
offend
the
core
legal
foundations
of
the
regulatory
state
after
analyzing
the
administrative
law
implications
of
machine
learning
we
step
back
in
part
iii
to
reflect
on
the
policy
merits
of
applying
machine
learning
to
administrative
tasks
we
do
recognize
that
machine
learning
could
be
implemented
irresponsibly
in
ways
that
even
though
legal
might
still
offend
more
conventional
notions
of
good
government
n
as
with
any
tool
artificial
intelligence
could
be
misused
and
by
no
means
should
anyone
think
that
machine
learning
constitutes
a
panacea
for
government
the
use
of
machine
learning
in
specific
settings
and
for
particular
purposes
may
well
prove
inadvisable
once
all
things
are
considered
the
way
algorithms
are
used
will
matter
too
and
at
times
some
safeguards
may
need
to
be
implemented
to
ensure
consonance
with
the
broader
purposes
standing
behind
the
administrative
law
doctrines
we
consider
here
in
general
though
governmental
decision
making
in
the
machine
learning
era
can
and
in
appropriate
circumstances
should
take
advantage
of
the
enhanced
public
value
that
can
be
achieved
from
regulating
by
robot
and
adjudicating
by
algorithm
our
detailed
examination
of
the
legal
issues
and
policy
tradeoffs
leads
us
to
be
reasonably
optimistic
about
machine
learning
and
the
instrumental
role
it
can
play
in
making
a
more
promising
future
for
administrative
government
i
machine
learning
and
its
administrative
applications
some
of
the
most
prominent
examples
of
private
sector
growth
today
from
amazon
n
to
zillow
n
depend
on
the
use
of
machine
learning
to
optimize
production
processes
supply
chains
marketing
and
the
pricing
of
goods
and
services
machine
learning
undergirds
future
growth
across
a
wide
range
of
sectors
from
the
introduction
of
fintech
firms
in
the
financial
industry
n
to
advances
in
healthcare
delivery
via
precision
medicine
n
machine
learning
s
main
attraction
stems
from
how
well
it
outperforms
human
intelligence
n
as
private
firms
pursue
significant
efficiency
gains
through
the
kind
of
smarter
and
more
contextualized
decisions
made
possible
by
algorithmic
analysis
of
big
data
the
government
will
undoubtedly
need
to
follow
suit
not
merely
to
keep
up
with
new
risks
these
private
sector
uses
of
machine
learning
might
bring
but
also
to
improve
government
s
ability
to
address
a
host
of
existing
risks
and
regulatory
problems
n
machine
learning
promises
to
make
the
government
like
the
private
sector
smarter
and
more
efficient
in
this
part
we
introduce
machine
learning
and
discuss
how
government
agencies
are
already
beginning
to
explore
its
use
to
optimize
administrative
tasks
an
endeavor
that
is
likely
to
grow
both
in
size
and
scope
in
the
years
ahead
we
first
explain
what
machine
learning
is
and
describe
its
distinguishing
features
we
then
discuss
how
agencies
are
already
using
machine
learning
finally
we
show
how
this
technology
could
in
the
future
potentially
transform
the
administrative
state
through
what
we
call
rulemaking
by
robot
and
adjudicating
by
algorithm
a
what
is
machine
learning
fundamentally
machine
learning
algorithms
are
used
to
make
predictions
this
emphasis
on
prediction
contrasts
markedly
with
traditional
statistical
techniques
which
seek
to
model
underlying
data
generating
processes
in
the
real
world
although
traditional
statistical
techniques
can
also
generate
predictions
they
do
so
only
when
the
model
created
by
the
analyst
fits
well
with
the
underlying
processes
being
modeled
these
traditional
techniques
require
the
analyst
first
to
specify
a
mathematical
equation
expressing
an
outcome
variable
as
a
function
of
selected
explanatory
variables
put
together
in
a
particular
way
and
then
to
see
how
well
the
data
fit
with
the
analyst
s
choices
for
example
when
analysts
employ
the
traditional
techniques
of
ordinary
least
squares
regression
or
logistic
regression
they
specify
equations
that
represent
their
a
priori
beliefs
about
the
functional
relationships
that
exist
between
independent
or
explanatory
and
dependent
or
outcome
variables
what
regression
does
in
essence
is
estimate
the
magnitude
and
direction
of
these
relationships
between
the
two
types
of
variables
that
are
selected
and
specified
by
the
analyst
the
relationships
in
the
statistical
model
ostensibly
represent
the
relationships
in
the
real
world
which
is
why
regression
results
are
often
used
to
support
causal
inferences
by
contrast
machine
learning
is
nonparametric
in
that
it
does
not
require
the
researcher
to
specify
any
particular
functional
form
of
a
mathematical
model
in
advance
instead
these
algorithms
allow
the
data
themselves
to
dictate
how
information
contained
in
input
variables
is
put
together
to
forecast
the
value
of
an
output
variable
n
machine
learning
algorithms
do
not
generate
quite
the
same
kind
of
information
on
the
magnitude
or
direction
of
the
effects
that
might
be
associated
with
any
single
input
variable
on
the
output
variable
controlling
for
the
other
variables
the
functional
relationships
in
machine
learning
are
not
necessarily
the
complete
set
of
those
in
nature
s
true
data
generating
process
as
a
result
no
claim
can
be
made
that
the
machine
learning
process
represents
any
set
of
true
relationships
in
the
world
and
thus
none
of
the
causal
inferences
that
typically
characterize
statistical
modeling
can
be
applied
to
results
of
machine
learning
in
short
with
machine
learning
results
causal
relationships
between
inputs
and
outputs
may
simply
not
exist
no
matter
how
intuitive
such
relationships
might
look
on
the
surface
if
a
machine
learning
algorithm
tends
to
forecast
that
older
individuals
commit
fewer
crimes
than
younger
individuals
for
example
it
cannot
be
claimed
on
the
basis
of
the
machine
learning
process
that
older
age
causes
any
reduction
in
the
propensity
to
commit
crimes
n
nevertheless
from
a
technical
standpoint
machine
learning
s
distinctive
predictive
and
nonparametric
focus
turns
out
to
be
paramount
to
its
impressive
usefulness
in
generating
reliable
forecasts
also
of
central
importance
and
what
gives
machine
learning
its
name
is
how
such
algorithms
mathematically
learn
to
generate
their
predictions
there
are
many
machine
learning
algorithms
that
do
so
in
different
mathematical
ways
but
they
all
attempt
as
one
textbook
explains
to
optimize
a
performance
criterion
using
example
data
or
past
experience
n
in
other
words
these
algorithms
make
repeated
passes
through
data
sets
progressively
modifying
or
averaging
their
predictions
to
optimize
specified
criteria
to
illustrate
this
functioning
consider
a
common
application
of
machine
learning
that
has
proven
critical
to
improvements
in
the
government
s
handling
of
postal
mail
and
other
paperwork
processing
tasks
the
recognition
and
classification
of
handwritten
digits
n
in
this
simple
application
an
algorithm
s
performance
criterion
or
objective
function
is
classification
accuracy
that
is
how
often
it
correctly
recognizes
say
a
handwritten
number
two
as
a
two
to
perform
this
classification
an
algorithm
must
learn
what
aspects
of
a
handwritten
digit
make
it
likely
to
be
a
two
over
the
course
of
iterative
passes
through
the
data
such
an
algorithm
tries
to
use
many
different
mathematical
descriptions
of
shapes
as
well
as
relationships
of
shapes
in
the
pictures
of
handwritten
digits
to
make
its
classifications
if
a
particular
descriptive
method
is
optimal
the
algorithm
will
be
rewarded
with
a
low
error
rate
if
the
descriptions
are
not
optimal
the
algorithm
will
be
punished
with
a
high
error
rate
it
can
learn
for
example
that
a
handwritten
digit
is
likely
to
be
a
two
if
the
topmost
section
of
the
digit
depicted
is
semicircular
and
facing
downward
ultimately
the
algorithm
will
seek
to
make
classifications
based
on
mathematical
descriptions
of
shapes
that
yield
the
lowest
error
rates
n
this
handwriting
recognition
example
provides
an
illustration
of
machine
learning
algorithms
applied
to
classification
problems
where
the
goal
is
to
sort
objects
into
classes
but
classification
problems
represent
only
some
of
the
diverse
applications
of
machine
learning
techniques
machine
learning
algorithms
can
also
be
used
to
predict
numerical
values
such
as
house
prices
or
stock
market
index
values
endeavors
that
are
often
termed
regression
problems
n
they
also
can
be
applied
to
scenarios
such
as
playing
chess
where
an
algorithm
can
be
used
to
determine
the
optimal
sequence
of
actions
n
variety
in
the
types
of
machine
learning
algorithms
means
that
they
can
be
used
in
a
wide
variety
of
predictive
endeavors
admittedly
many
non
learning
techniques
have
long
been
used
to
pursue
these
same
endeavors
for
example
ordinary
least
squares
regression
can
estimate
numerical
outcomes
and
logistic
regression
is
commonly
used
as
a
binary
classifier
given
the
existence
of
these
alternative
statistical
techniques
what
advantages
do
machine
learning
algorithms
offer
put
simply
they
outperform
standard
procedures
in
terms
of
predictive
accuracy
and
statistical
efficiency
that
is
the
increased
ability
to
obtain
predictions
with
both
low
bias
and
low
variance
n
furthermore
many
phenomena
that
analysts
want
to
forecast
are
extraordinarily
complex
and
analysts
often
lack
the
a
priori
knowledge
necessary
to
specify
an
accurately
forecasting
conventional
model
by
eschewing
this
dependency
on
existing
knowledge
and
the
need
to
identify
the
functional
form
of
any
relationships
machine
learning
can
apply
to
a
wider
range
of
problems
and
yield
vastly
enhanced
accuracy
over
its
alternatives
whether
human
intuition
expert
judgment
or
traditional
statistical
techniques
n
learning
algorithms
can
also
adapt
more
dynamically
as
new
data
become
available
they
can
search
for
new
patterns
and
thereby
improve
forecasting
accuracy
although
machine
learning
algorithms
are
known
and
prized
for
their
accuracy
this
benefit
does
come
at
an
interpretive
cost
this
cost
is
frequently
invoked
by
references
to
machine
learning
algorithms
as
black
box
procedures
n
the
black
box
nature
of
machine
learning
holds
important
implications
for
administrative
law
so
to
understand
this
feature
of
machine
learning
consider
again
the
classification
of
handwritten
digits
we
said
that
an
algorithm
might
learn
that
certain
geometric
characteristics
of
the
shapes
of
handwritten
digits
are
useful
for
determining
which
digits
they
represent
yet
we
cannot
really
know
what
precise
characteristics
any
machine
learning
algorithm
is
keying
in
on
machine
learning
algorithms
transform
a
series
of
inputs
to
a
series
of
outputs
by
optimizing
a
performance
criterion
but
that
is
where
the
analyst
s
easy
ability
to
interpret
the
algorithms
workings
comes
to
an
end
the
user
of
an
algorithm
cannot
really
discern
which
particular
relationships
between
variables
factor
into
the
algorithm
s
classification
or
at
which
point
in
the
algorithm
they
do
nor
can
the
user
determine
how
exactly
the
algorithm
puts
together
various
relationships
to
yield
its
classifications
n
for
this
reason
machine
learning
algorithms
are
often
described
as
transforming
inputs
to
outputs
through
a
black
box
an
analyst
cannot
look
inside
the
black
box
to
understand
how
that
transformation
occurs
or
describe
the
relationships
with
the
same
intuitive
and
causal
language
often
applied
to
traditional
statistical
modeling
n
despite
this
interpretive
limitation
machine
learning
algorithms
have
been
implemented
widely
in
private
sector
settings
companies
desire
the
savings
in
costs
and
efficiency
gleaned
from
these
techniques
and
the
lack
of
intuitive
interpretability
is
of
little
concern
in
endeavors
where
accuracy
not
causality
is
the
valued
metric
netflix

a
form
of
machine
learning
called
artificial
neural

also
shown
great
utility
in

financial
sector

it
is
employed

predict

n
the
benefits
of

have
also
promoted
their
adoption
in
academic
research
in
disciplines
closely
connected
to
policymaking
where
predictive
accuracy
is
critical

applications
in
a
wide
variety
of
settings

already
actively
shaping

b
existing
administrative
applications
for
much
the
same
reason
that
machine
learning
has
been
exploited
in
the
private
sector
its
use
holds
potentially
great
value
to
government
agencies
we
have
already
noted
that
national
security

agencies
are
starting
to
rely
on
machine

to
support

as
varied
as

other
government

have
also
begun
to
explore
uses
of
machine
learning
revealing
growing
recognition
of
its
promise
across
a
variety
of
policy
settings

at
all
levels
of

n
although
we
mainly
focus
in
this
article
on
the
use
of
machine
learning
by
the
federal

the
nation

have
received
much
attention
so
far
for
their
embrace
of
machine
learning
and
its
potential
to
improve
governmental

n
the

n
at

federal
level
one
of
the
earliest
domestic
applications
of
machine
learning
came
from

n
other
federal
agencies
have
also
started
to
rely

to
support
various
regulatory

activities
n
analysts
at
the

environmental
protection
agency

for
example
have
developed
a
program
called
toxcast
to
help
the
agency
predict
toxicities
of
chemical
compounds
n
chemical
toxicity
has
traditionally
been
established
using
animal
testing

these
laboratory
techniques
are
costly
and
time
consuming
not
to
mention
often
harmful
to
animals
faced
with
tens
of
thousands
of
chemicals
that
could
be
potentially
subject

regulation
the
agency
developed
toxcast
to
prioritize
which
of
the
multitude
of
chemicals

undergo
more

specifically
linear

first
phase

estimated
that
using
machine
learning
could
save
the

toxic
chemical

identified

although
the
epa
presently
uses
toxcast
to
identify
chemicals
for
additional
testing

more
traditional

underlying
predictive
approach

eventually
form
an
independent

have
recognized

is
significantly
more
potential

to

data
sets
to
support

but
also
to
make
big

more
readily
analyzable
one
example
can
be
found
in
the
creation
of
the
global
legal
entity

responsibility
for
its
development
n
having
such
a
unique
identifier
will
enhance

ability
to
identify
parties
to

instantly
and
precisely
allowing
the

to
apply
machine

to
larger

n
agencies
are
also
actively
working
toward
development
of
the
cloud
storage
systems
necessary
to
exploit
the
power
of
machine
learning
n
such
storage
that
takes
place
via
distributed
networks
of
computers
proves
to
be
better
suited
to
running
computationally
intensive
algorithms
and
its
availability
better
facilitates
interagency
sharing
of
big
data
the
fda
for
example
has
leveraged
cloud
computing
to
store
information
on
foodborne
pathogens
giving
the
agency
the
ongoing
simultaneous
capacity
to
collect
control
and
analyze
enormous
data
sets
n
similarly
the
epa
created
a
cross
agency
data
analytics

program
intended
to
foster
the
creation
of
databases
that
will
permit
the
analysis
of
data
from
many
different
agencies

organizations
n
the
sec
is
implementing
cloud
computing
to
store
and
process
its
one
billion
daily
records
of
financial

activities
often
time
stamped
to
the
microsecond
allowing
the
sec
to
perform
analyses
of
thousands
of

involving

records
at
a
time
n
the
proliferation
of
such
efforts
to
capture
share
and
analyze
vast
quantities
of
data
makes
it
easy
to
envision
for
example
an
extension
of
the
sec
s
cloud
computing
program
that
would
eventually
allow
agency
computers
to
monitor
trading
activities
in
real
time
predicting
in
milliseconds
whether
a
financial
transaction
is
the
result
of
insider
trading
and
then
automatically
stopping
or
reversing
trades
based
on
those
predictions
n
with
these
various
efforts
underway
the
government
is
well
on
its
way
into
the
era
of
machine
learning
before
turning
to
the
legal
implications
of
this
new
era
we
next
develop
more
precisely
what
machine
learning
portends
for
government
agencies
and
why
its
use
might
raise
questions
under
prevailing
administrative
law
doctrines
c
adjudicating
by
algorithm
rulemaking
by
robot
what
exactly
might
be
problematic
about
an
era
in
which
government
embraces
machine
learning
up
to
this
point
in
our
discussion
perhaps
the
answer
will
not
be
obvious
were
it
not
for
dire
warnings
in
the
popular
press
of
impending
artificially
intelligent
oppression
it
might
seem
that
machine
learning
simply
represents
a
more
sophisticated
data
rich
and
predictively
useful
version
of
the
kind
of
analytic
methods
that
government
agencies
have
long
used
if
that
is
what
machine
learning
is
and
if
government
can
use
new
statistical
techniques
to
improve
its
performance
of
various
functions
from
weather
forecasting
to
identifying
potentially
hazardous
chemicals
then
presumably
a
machine
learning
era
in
government
should
not
only
be
completely
unproblematic
but
also
positively
encouraged
three
principal
properties
of
machine
learning
combine
however
to
distinguish
it
from
other
analytical
techniques
and
give
rise
to
potential
concerns
about
the
greater
reliance
on
machine
learning
by
governmental
authorities
the
first
is
machine
learning
s
self
learning
property
the
results
of
algorithms
do
not
depend
on
humans
specifying
in
advance
how
each
variable
is
to
be
factored
into
the
predictions
indeed
as
long
as
learning
algorithms
are
running
humans
are
not
really
controlling
how
they
are
combining
and
comparing
data
these
algorithms
effectively
look
for
patterns
on
their
own
the
second
key
property
is
machine
learning
s
black
box
nature
the
results
of
machine
learning
analysis
are
not
intuitively
explainable
and
cannot
support
causal
explanations
of
the
kind
that
underlie
the
reasons
traditionally
offered
to
justify
governmental
action
finally
machine
learning
as
with
other
computational
strategies
in
today
s
digital
era
can
be
fast
and
automatic
supporting
uses
in
which
the
algorithm
produces
results
that
can
shorten
or
potentially
bypass
human
deliberation
and
decision
making
all
three
of
these
factors
combine
to
make
machine
learning
techniques
appear
qualitatively
more
independent
from
humans
when
compared
to
other
statistical
techniques
to
illustrate
these
features
of
machine
learning
and
what
they
portend
for
government
consider
the
challenges
the
u
s
pipeline
and
hazardous
materials
safety
administration
phmsa
faces
in
deciding
how
to
allocate
limited
inspection
resources
to
oversee
the
many
thousands
of
miles
of
gas
oil
and
chemical
pipelines
throughout
the
united
states
major
leaks
as
well
as
explosions
from
leaky
pipelines
in
recent
years
have
made
palpable
the
significance
of
effective
governmental
oversight
of
pipeline
safety
n
in
recent
years
phmsa
has
explored
using
a
traditional
regression
approach
to
predict
risks
of
pipeline
accidents
and
decide
how
to
target
the
agency
s
inspections
n
although
such
an
attempt
to
engage
in
quantitative
decision
making
is
certainly
laudable
much
more
efficient
inspection
targeting
could
result
if
phmsa
generated
its
risk
predictions
using
machine
learning
this
could
be
possible
in
the
near
future
once
big
data
sets
are
shared
in
real
time
between
different
agencies
and
information
streams
could
be
provided
by
remote
sensing
technologies
instead
of
being
limited
to
analyzing
a
dozen
or
so
variables
that
phmsa
s
analysts
have
predetermined
should
be
included
in
their
regression
analysis
machine
learning
algorithms
could
work
their
way
through
massive
amounts
of
data
containing
hundreds
of
potentially
predictively
useful
variables
ranging
from
pipeline
operators
tax
returns
to
their
firms
workforce
diversity
the
resulting
predictions
of
pipeline
accident
risk
could
be
used
not
only
to
target
inspections
but
also
potentially
if
such
an
algorithm
could
be
supplied
with
real
time
data
from
remote
sensors
to
order
preemptive
shutdowns
of
pipeline
segments
that
the
algorithm
predicts
are
at
risk
of
imminent
failure
to
the
extent
that
modern
pipeline
systems
are
equipped
with
computerized
remote
shut
off
capabilities
a
machine
learning
algorithm
could
even
be
programmed
to
send
an
automatic
order
to
pipeline
operator
s
system
calling
for
an
immediate
automatic
shutdown
of
a
section
of
pipeline
based
on
real
time
forecasts
produced
by
machine
learning
all
potentially
without
any
human
intervention
machine
learning
is
well
suited
for
automating
these
kinds
of
decisions
given
its
emphasis
on
accuracy
and
the
government
s
overwhelming
need
to
use
its
limited
resources
to
prevent
dangers
from
arising
but
notice
that
a
shift
to
a
machine
learning
approach
in
this
context
could
come
along
with
some
qualitative
loss
of
human
involvement
under
machine
learning
phmsa
analysts
would
no
longer
predetermine
which
variables
should
be
included
in
the
agency
s
risk
models
indeed
they
would
not
even
create
any
risk
models
at
all
in
the
sense
of
building
equations
specifying
exactly
how
various
variables
might
impact
pipeline
risk
machine
learning
also
does
not
afford
a
ready
means
of
explaining
why
any
section
of
pipeline
should
be
inspected
or
shut
down
the
computerized
nature
of
machine
learning
also
means
that
it
can
automate
decisions
currently
made
by
humans
such
as
the
dispatching
of
inspectors
or
even
the
inspections
themselves
it
is
not
difficult
to
imagine
a
future
in
which
a
machine
learning
system
based
in
phmsa
s
headquarters
in
washington
d
c
could
be
used
to
automatically
dispatch
agency
drones
distributed
throughout
the
country
having
them
fly
over
sections
of
pipeline
to
take
video
images
or
collect
air
quality
samples
thereby
removing
altogether
the
need
to
send
human
inspectors
to
the
scene
admittedly
even
with
this
potential
future
scenario
in
mind
it
still
might
not
be
self
evident
why
machine
learning
may
be
problematic
after
all
machines
have
long
supported
governmental
functions
in
the
administrative
state
although
not
flown
by
drones
machines
currently
collect
air
quality
samples
in
a
network
of
fixed
sites
around
the
country
informing
state
and
federal
environmental
regulatory
decision
making
n
moreover
when
it
comes
to
inspecting
potentially
hazardous
sites
eliminating
the
need
for
humans
to
enter
high
risk
areas
should
surely
be
a
positive
advance
not
a
reason
for
alarm
n
furthermore
decisions
about
the
allocation
of
inspection
resources
have
long
been
treated
as
a
matter
of
well
accepted
law
as
falling
entirely
within
an
agency
s
discretion
n
if
agencies
can
legally
allocate
inspection
resources
by
the
flip
of
a
coin
that
is
sending
inspectors
to
sites
at
random
as
some
agencies
do
then
they
should
be
able
legally
to
rely
on
more
sophisticated
algorithms
that
deploy
scarce
inspection
resources
automatically
but
more
efficiently
n
for
this
reason
we
foresee
comparatively
little
resistance
as
a
matter
of
law
to
applications
of
machine
learning
that
aim
to
make
more
efficient
use
of
scarce
inspection
resources
many
uses
of
machine
learning
by
administrative
agencies
will
be
like
the
use
of
machine
learning
to
decide
where
to
send
inspectors
in
that
they
will
inform
actions
committed
to
agency
discretion
most
of
these
uses
will
be
unproblematic
from
the
standpoint
of
administrative
law
n
surely
the
u
s
postal
service
s
reliance
on
machine
learning
algorithms
to
sort
mail
hardly
constitutes
any
grave
threat
to
society
either
existential
or
constitutional
in
addition
even
when
agency
officials
use
learning
algorithms
to
support
actions
that
are
not
committed
to
agency
discretion
if
they
use
them
simply
to
inform
their
own
independent
judgments
this
too
should
be
unremarkable
such
use
would
be
indistinguishable
from
any
other
research
support
or
informational
input
into
agency
decision
making
the
non
shaded
parts
of
table
highlight
several
general
types
of
agency
uses
of
machine
learning
that
should
easily
be
viewed
as
beyond
reproach
at
least
from
the
standpoint
of
existing
general
principles
of
structural
law
governing
the
administrative
state
the
domains
in
which
machine
learning
might
be
of
concern
at
least
as
a
prima
facie
matter
will
be
those
in
which
artificial
intelligence
is
used
more
for
determining
rather
than
just
supporting
decisions
that
are
not
otherwise
committed
to
agency
discretion
by
law
as
shown
in
the
shaded
portions
of
table
that
leaves
two
important
realms
in
which
machine
learning
could
be
incorporated
into
the
administrative
state
adjudicating
by
algorithm
and
rulemaking
by
robot
n
one
example
of
adjudicating
by
algorithm
would
be
our
posited
phmsa
pipeline
safety
machine
learning
system
that
automatically
issues
shut
off
orders
when
the
system
forecasts
a
heightened
risk
it
is
not
difficult
to
imagine
other
examples
of
adjudicatory
decisions
that
could
be
automated
by
algorithms
n
especially
when
the
relevant
criteria
for
an
adjudicatory
action
are
forward
looking
and
thus
dependent
on
accurate
predictions
at
some
point
for
example
the
faa
might
be
able
to
license
pilots
through
an
entirely
automated
process
relying
on
risk
based
machine
learning
forecasts
of
individual
applicants
overall
level
of
safety
n
the
federal
trade
commission
or
the
department
of
justice
s
antitrust
division
might
conceivably
come
to
rely
on
machine
learning
to
predict
what
effects
a
proposed
merger
would
have
on
future
competition
and
market
pricing
perhaps
entirely
automating
the
antitrust
review
process
table
applications
of
machine
learning
in
the
administrative
state
when
it
comes
to
rulemaking
by
robot
we
need
not
rely
entirely
on
the
imagination
the
city
of
los
angeles
current
traffic
signaling
system
illustrates
a
very
simple
but
still
real
world
application
of
rulemaking
by
robot
although
deciding
the
color
of
traffic
lights
may
seem
like
a
trivial
example
a
traffic
signal
does
determine
what
rule
applies
to
anyone
who
wants
to
drive
along
a
city
street
at
a
given
period
of
time
yet
with
the
system
in
place
in
los
angeles
just
as
no
human
determines
when
a
traffic
light
should
be
red
or
green
no
government
official
can
really
explain
why
the
city
s
machine
learning
system
sets
any
given
traffic
light
that
is
rule
when
it
does
we
can
expect
it
will
not
be
long
before
more
government
authorities
at
the
local
and
federal
levels
will
be
able
to
develop
similar
systems
in
their
own
domains
that
are
conceptually
equivalent
to
los
angeles
traffic
control
system
it
is
not
difficult
to
imagine
more
complex
and
consequential
examples
of
regulating
by
robot
consider
the
possibility
that
the
sec
might
find
it
beneficial
even
necessary
to
govern
the
world
of
high
speed
electronic
trading
by
making
nimble
and
equally
high
speed
adjustments
to
the
rules
of
market
transactions
perhaps
modifying
stock
exchanges
current
rigid
trading
circuit
breakers
with
ones
that
adjust
in
real
time
n
the
u
s
department
of
the
treasury
for
similar
reasons
might
plausibly
seek
to
establish
a
dynamic
automated
process
according
to
which
certain
macro
prudential
rules
governing
financial
institutions
respond
to
real
time
market
changes
indicative
of
systemic
risk
n
even
when
time
is
not
so
critical
and
the
good
cause
exemption
to
the
standard
rulemaking
process
might
not
apply
it
is
hardly
unimaginable
today
that
agencies
could
automate
entirely
the
notice
and
comment
rulemaking
process
especially
for
the
kinds
of
routine
rules
that
make
up
the
bulk
of
government
rules
n
natural
language
processing
programs
could
even
conceivably
read
and
summarize
any
public
comments
submitted
on
proposed
rules
and
potentially
even
craft
some
of
the
regulatory
language
n
for
anything
but
perhaps
the
simplest
rules
like
traffic
signals
rulemaking
by
robot
will
require
that
machine
learning
be
combined
with
other
analytic
techniques
rules
are
forward
looking
but
they
also
involve
complex
normative
judgments
not
merely
predictive
ones
determining
the
content
of
rules
often
requires
making
difficult
choices
about
the
entities
to
be
regulated
the
conduct
or
outcome
that
the
rule
tells
these
entities
to
achieve

avoid
and
the
nature
and
degree
of
the
consequences
that
follow
from
adhering

some
of
these
choices
are
normative

also
because

unable

the
justification
for
new

after

nevertheless
it
may
be
possible
for
machine

n
agent
based
modeling
refers
to
the
use
of
an
algorithm
consisting
of
a
mathematically
defined
environment
that
includes
agents
that
observe
the
overall
environment
and
take
actions
designed
to
reach
a
specified
goal
n
multi
agent
systems
are
similar
to
agent
based
models
but
with
multiple
autonomous
agents
interacting
with
each
other
n
with
either
of
these
agent
based
techniques
the
agents
which
in
the
rulemaking
context
would
include
the
regulator
and
the
regulated
entities
must
have
some
defined
decision
making
processes
that
allow
them
to
translate
observations
of
the
environment
into
actions
these
decision
making
processes
can
be
specified
a
priori
by
the
researcher
or
regulatory
official
but
such
a
priori
knowledge
often
does
not
exist
or
is
not
sophisticated
enough
to
mimic
how
real
world
agents
make
their
decisions
therefore
machine
learning
often
called
reinforcement
learning
in
these
applications
or
what
we
will
for
ease
of
reference
call
embedded
machine

incorporated
into

to
possible

consider
how
the
occupational
safety
and
health
administration
osha
might
proceed
if
it
were
to
create
an
automated
process
for
determining
whether
to
implement
a
new
workplace
safety
regulation
osha
could
implement
an
algorithm
in
which
the
modeled
agents
are
the
employers
being
regulated
the
environment
in
which
these
agents
operate
would
include
mathematically
specified
factors
capable
of
influencing
agent
behavior
including
a
possible
regulation
the
employer
agents
in
the
model
would
observe
the
environment
which
would
include
different
regulatory
alternatives
including
an
environment
with
no
regulation
and
then
take
actions
such
as
complying
with
the
regulation
to
reach
their
own
goals
perhaps
defined
as
profit
maximization
now
although
osha
would
like
to
use
this
agent
based
model
to
see
how
employers
respond
to
the
potential
new
regulation
and
consequently
what
effects
the
regulation
may
have
osha
does
not
know
a
priori
how
employers
will
decide
how
to
respond
to
any
regulation
the
agent
based
model
would
therefore
use
a
machine
learning
technique
to
select
employers
optimal
responses
to
the
regulation
given
their
profit
maximization
goal
this
example
suggests
how
osha
might
use
machine
learning
embedded
within
an
agent
based
model
of
the
effects
of
a
proposed
regulation
but
the
techniques
real
potential
to
inform
the
content
of
regulations
comes
from
the
ability
of
osha
to
include
an
agent
representing
itself
in
the
abm
this
mathematically
represented
agent
would
issue
multiple
different
possible
regulations
formulated
in
advance
by
human
programmers
and
then
select
the
regulatory
alternative
that
yields
those
effects
as
defined
in
relation
to
observable
components
of
the
environment
that
maximize
an
objective
function
or
goal
established
by
the
real
world
osha
the
possible
regulations
analyzed
in
this
fashion
could
assume
any
number
of
different
combinations
of
regulatory
targets
commands
and
consequences
with
the
forecasted
effect
of
these
regulations
on
the
actions
of
regulated
entities
being
observed
through
the
modeling
exercise
unlike
in
the
adjudicatory
context
where
machine
learning
directly
makes
individualized
forecasts
and
where
an
adjudication
can
be
determined
simply
by
whether
an
algorithm
forecasts
risks
or
other
outcomes
above
a
threshold
level
in
the
rulemaking
context
machine
learning
would
need
to
be
nested
within
a
larger
decision
making
model
to
support
automated
regulatory
decisions
machine
learning
predictions
would
within
an
agent
based
simulation
inform
agents
actions
which
in
turn
would
generate
predicted
outcomes
from
different
regulatory
permutations
this
fusion
of
agent
based
or
multi
agent
models
with
machine
learning
may
hold
great
potential
for
assisting
in
certain
kinds
of
rulemaking
but
even
with
this
fusion
governmental
reliance
on
algorithms
would
still
not
cede
entirely
the
involvement
of
humans
as
already
indicated
at
a
foundational
level
humans
will
still
need
to
choose
and
then
input
into
embedded
machine
learning
systems
the
data
as
well
as
overarching
goals
to
be
maximized
and
constraints
to
be
minimized
moreover
due
to
data
limitations
as
well
as
core
uncertainties
many
rulemaking
decisions
will
still
by
necessity
call
for
human
judgment
and
thus
be
incapable
of
automation
as
with
any
statistical
technique
the
algorithms
that
could
be
embedded
in
automated
rulemaking
models
will
require
data
because
all
historical
data
arise
within
a
world
with
a
different
rule
than
the
one
proposed
even
if
that
is
no
rule
at
all
regulators
will
seldom
if
ever
find
enough
data
to
correspond
to
all
possible
forms
a
future
regulation
and
resulting
environmental
state
might
take
this
is
often
a
challenge
in
applications
of
agent
based
models
in
other
contexts
such
as
healthcare
provision
in
those
other
contexts
the
lack
of
data
is
often
addressed
through
the
creation
of
simulated
environmental
data
n
generation
of
simulated
data
however
requires
that
the
architecture
of
the
environment
being
modeled
and
the
relationships
between
components
of
that
environment
be
sufficiently
well
known
a
priori
as
to
be
specifiable
embedded
machine
learning
techniques
have
been
successfully
developed
for
applications
like
modeling
how
infectious
patients
should
be
moved
around
a
hospital
n
in
that
context
the
environment
of
interest
can
be
reasonably
well
specified
the
actors
and
parameters
are
limited
for
example
healthcare
professionals
infected
patients
uninfected
patients
and
rooms
and
the
analyst
knows
a
priori
enough
about
how
diseases
are
transmitted
to
generate
simulated
data
using
probabilities
of
infection
based
on
proximity
and
time
spent
near
infected
patients
this
kind
of
a
priori
knowledge
would
seem
to
be
less
likely
to
exist
in
the
more
complex
or
uncertain
situations
that
many
regulators
address
where
the
relevant
causal
relationships
do
not
stem
from
processes
as
law
like
as
biological
disease
transmission
if
the
system
being
modeled
is
extremely
complex
as
with
many
forms
of
regulation
whether
of
complex
financial
instruments
or
advanced
industrial
operations
n
the
regulator
may
not
know
enough
about
the
underlying
causal
architecture
to
generate
simulated
environmental
data
bearing
any
resemblance
to
real
world
data
of
course
despite
these
difficulties
the
conditions
for
using
embedded
machine
learning
for
rulemaking
may
still
sometimes
exist
in
a
comment
letter
to
the
sec
for
example
academic
and
business
experts
in
agent
based
modeling
and
financial
markets
have
advocated
the
use
of
such
models
in
regulating
equity
markets
arguing
that
algorithms
in
this
context
would
be
sufficiently
specifiable
n
although
we
take
no
position
on
these
specific
claims
we
raise
them
to
suggest
the
plausibility
of
using
embedded
machine
learning
to
automate
the
process
of
selecting
and
designing
regulations
in
some
settings
agency
officials
will
need
to
determine
the
applicability
of
any
embedded
machine
learning
rulemaking
tool
on
a
case
by
case
basis
our
point
is
to
show
that
even
if
many
applications
of
machine
learning
will
be
completely
benign
as
a
matter
of
administrative
law
agencies
may
soon
be
able
for
the
first
time
to
set
the
content
of
certain
types
of
rules
by
automated
artificial
intelligence
techniques
whether
in
making
individualized
forecasts
or
in
feeding
into
more
generalized
modeling
results
machine
learning
algorithms
have
the
potential
to
transform
key
governmental
functions
in
ways
that
not
only
augment
human
judgment
but
replace
it
with
automated
algorithmic
analysis
for
some
observers
this
prospect
will
trigger
loud
alarm
bells
of
the
kind
set
off
by
the
use
of
artificial
intelligence
more
generally
at
a
minimum
the
prospect
of
either
robotic
rulemaking
or
algorithmic
adjudication
raises
important
questions
about
whether
such
automated
techniques
can
be
squared
with
core
principles
of
constitutional
and
administrative
law
ii
the
legality
of
machine
learning
in
the
administrative
state
as
government
agencies
continue
on
the
path
toward
increased
reliance
on
machine
learning
in
administrative
decision
making
public
officials
lawyers
and
scholars
will
confront
choices
about
whether
to
encourage
or
constrain
this
technology
making
these
choices
will
depend
at
least
in
the
first
instance
on
assessing
how
agency
use
of
machine
learning
would
conform
to
the
cornerstones
of
constitutional
and
administrative
law
principles
of
nondelegation
due
process
antidiscrimination
and
transparency
n
these
core
legal
principles
against
which
we
assess
machine
learning
in
this
part
present
issues
that
arise
from
the
mathematical
distinctiveness
of
machine
learning
in
particular
its
self
learning
black
box
and
automated
properties
especially
when
machine
learning
is
used
to
determine
outcomes
that
are
judicially
reviewable
its
properties
combine
to
surface
some
first
order
questions
stemming
from
a
legal
system
that
has
been
historically
premised
on
the
existence
of
governmental
decision
makers
who
are
human
beings
our
answers
to
the
legal
questions
presented
in
this
part
must
by
necessity
assume
a
degree
of
generality
machine
learning
is
not
a
singular
entity
with
one
prescribed
method
of
implementation
so
we
cannot
pretend
to
offer
a
definitive
legal
analysis
of
all
possible
applications
of
artificial
intelligence
in
the
administrative
process
how
machine
learning
will
come
to
be
used
in
particular
contexts
by
particular
agencies
will
no
doubt
prove
pivotal
to
determining
its
legality
under
certain
doctrines
neither
the
technique
of
machine
learning
nor
its
uses
are
completely
uniform
even
while
sharing
general
properties
and
even
some
of
those
general
properties
are
far
from
absolute
still
learning
algorithms
do
exhibit
to
a
sufficient
degree
some
core
features
that
make
it
possible
to
offer
some
overarching
conclusions
for
example
even
though
algorithms
can
learn
on
their
own
and
support
automated
decisions
humans
still
must
decide
how
algorithms
are
specified
deployed
and
integrated
into
broader
administrative
processes
machine
learning
algorithms
are
thus
autonomous
only
in
the
sense
that
they
can
run
continuously
and
have
the
potential
to
translate
their
outputs
automatically
into
regulatory
actions
n
they
do
not
set
their
own
objective
functions
nor
are
they
completely
outside
human
control
an
algorithm
by
its
very
definition
must
have
its
parameters
and
uses
specified
by
humans
and
this
property
will
likely
prove
pivotal
in
the
legal
assessment
of
specific
applications
of
artificial
intelligence
by
federal
administrative
agencies
a
nondelegation
military
weapons
systems
driven
by
algorithms
raise
serious
concerns
because
with
these
systems
decisions
possessing
life
and
death
consequences
may
no
longer
be
made
directly
by
humans
n
for
similar
reasons
concerns
could
be
raised
about
administrative
agencies
use
of
artificial
intelligence
although
officials
at
administrative
agencies
do
not
fire
missiles
they
are
responsible
for
choices
that
can
carry
equally
important
consequences
such
as
determining
the
safety
of
food
water
and
drugs
if
concerns
exist
over
delegating
too
much
control
to
non
humans
in
the
military
context
then
perhaps
at
least
a
prima
facie
case
exists
against
the
use
of
algorithms
to
make
administrative
and
regulatory
decisions
the
u
s
constitution
provides
that
a
ll
legislative
powers
of
the
federal
government
shall
be
vested
in
congress
n
courts
have
long
accepted
that
congress
can
within
limits
delegate
authority
to
administrative
agencies
headed
by
appointed
officers
who
although
unelected
are
overseen
in
various
ways
by
members
of
congress
and
the
president
n
yet
the
nondelegation
doctrine
still
a
fixture
in
american
constitutional
and
administrative
law
places
some
theoretical
limits
on
those
delegations
which
must
for
example
be
accompanied
by
an
intelligible
principle
although
this
doctrine
has
long
accepted
even
broad
delegations
of
authority
to
administrative
agencies
the
law
has
always
assumed
that
the
recipient
of
that
authority
would
be
a
human
being
such
as
an
officer
of
the
united
states
or
on
occasion
a
private
individual
or
group
of
individuals
as
machine
learning
becomes
more
advanced
and
government
agencies
use
it
more
extensively
decision
making
authority
could
effectively
become
delegated
still
further
to
computerized
algorithms
yet
if
government
actions
should
be
undertaken
by
humans
then
delegation
to
autonomously
learning
machines
could
potentially
transfer
governmental
power
outside
the
bounds
that
the
constitution
permits
such
an
objection
under
the
nondelegation
doctrine
has
never
been
squarely
contemplated
under
previous
judicial
rulings
but
it
bears
clear
conceptual
affinity
with
the
spirit
and
tradition
of
the
nondelegation
doctrine
the
underlying
concern
is
the
same
the
improper
transfer
of
legislative
authority
given
that
the
nondelegation
doctrine
has
traditionally
governed
the
granting
of
authority
by
congress
to
agencies
we
confront
two
possible
scenarios
the
first
assumes
that
congress
has
granted
authority
to
an
agency
to
deploy
machine
learning
algorithms
to
make
administrative
decisions
the
second
is
a
scenario
in
which
congress
has
delegated
some
kind
of
administrative
authority
to
the
head
of
an
agency
in
a
conventional
manner
but
the
relevant
agency
official
then
seeks
out
and
relies
upon
a
machine
learning
system
to
exercise
that
authority
we
will
address
both
of
these
possible
situations
in
turn
even
though
the
second
scenario
might
be
the
one
that
is
more
likely
to
arise
in
practice
given
that
statutes
have
not
been
drafted
with
algorithmic
administration
in
mind
however
the
second
scenario
raises
different
even
if
related
questions
of
statutory
interpretation
namely
whether
a
statute
granting
an
agency
certain
governmental
authority
precludes
the
agency
from
subdelegating
its
decision
making
to
machine
learning
algorithms
n
we
will
put
such
a
statutory
question
to
the
side
initially
focusing
on
the
first
scenario
in
which
congress
delegates
authority
to
agencies
to
regulate
by
robot
this
scenario
allows
us
to
focus
directly
on
the
constitutional
question
raised
by
what
justice
mariano
florentino
cu
llar
has
dubbed
the
problem
of
cyberdelegation
n
cyberdelegation
the
answer
to
the
constitutional
question
of
cyberdelegation
should
not
be
difficult
and
not
merely
because
the
nondelegation
doctrine
has
been
widely
recognized
to
have
had
only
one
good
year
n
a
congressional
authorization
of
rulemaking
by
robot
should
not
offend
the
nondelegation
doctrine
because
presumably
such
an
authorization
would
be
made
with
the
understanding
that
algorithmic
policy
determinations
depend
inherently
on
well
specified
objective
functions
it
seems
unlikely
that
any
congress
that
would
expressly
contemplate
the
use
of
artificial
intelligence
by
agencies
would
not
also
include
in
legislation
authorizing
such
use
a
sufficiently
intelligible
principle
that
would
satisfy
the
demands
of
the
nondelegation
doctrine
under
this
doctrine
rulemaking
authority
can
be
delegated
to
agencies
only
if
congress
provides
in
its
authorizing
legislation
an
intelligible
principle
channeling
and
constraining
the
exercise
of
that
delegated
authority
n
as
every
lawyer
today
knows
the
level
of
intelligibility
demanded
by
the
courts
has
hardly
been
substantial
the
courts
have
recognized
that
agencies
can
be
delegated
power
under
broad
general
directives
n
that
facilitate
governmental
efficacy
in
our
increasingly
complex
society
replete
with
ever
changing
and
more
technical
problems
n
as
a
result
congress
must
delegate
in
ways
delineat
ing
the
general
policy
the
public
agency
which
is
to
apply
it
and
the
boundaries
of
this
delegated
authority
n
courts
have
even
upheld
delegations
of
authority
directing
explicitly
only
that
agencies
must
act
in
the
public
interest
n
to
say
that
an
intelligible
principle
must
guide
agency
actions
is
to
say
that
those
actions
must
be
aligned
with
a
goal
or
in
mathematical
terms
a
type
of
objective
function
an
objective
function
is
an
essential
prerequisite
for
the
use
of
machine
learning
and
it
will
by
necessity
provide
sufficient
intelligibility
to
withstand
the
test
embedded
in
the
nondelegation
doctrine
if
a
goal
as
broad
and
qualitative
as
acting
in
the
public
interest
is
legally
sufficient
then
goals
defined
in
precise
quantifiable
and
measurable
ways
must
be
so
as
well
a
congress
that
deliberately
contemplated
and
authorized
an
agency
to
use
machine
learning
would
presumably
also
understand
the
need
to
provide
guidance
about
the
necessary
objective
function
for
algorithms
to
optimize
and
it
would
be
more
likely
than
usual
to
articulate
a
sufficiently
clear
set
of
goals
that
would
pass
the
intelligibility
muster
what
about
the
recipients
of
the
authority
to
whom
congress
delegates
typically
these
recipients
have
been
agency
officials
but
on
occasion
congress
has
tried
to
delegate
certain
kinds
of
authority
to
private
actors
when
congress
has
delegated
lawmaking
power
to
private
entities
the
supreme
court
has
declared
such
arrangements
to
be
legislative
delegation
in
its
most
obnoxious
form
n
the
court
s
disapproval
of
congressional
authorization
of
private
decision
making
with
legal
implications
raises
a
key
question
about
the
possibility
of
congressional
authorization
of
algorithmic
decision
making
if
delegating
outside
the
government
to
the
private
sector
is
so
disfavored
then
presumably
a
delegation
of
rulemaking
authority
still
further
not
even
to
a
human
being
but
to
a
machine
would
seem
more
extreme
and
objectionable
we
think
courts
would
be
unlikely
to
equate
delegation
to
machines
with
delegation
to
private
individuals
or
entities
for
three
reasons
first
machine
learning
algorithms
lack
the
essence
of
what
makes
a
delegation
to
private
individuals
so
obnoxious
the
self
interest
of
those
private
parties
private
parties
have
their
own
biases
and
interests
that
lead
them
to
make
privately
optimal
decisions
that
may
not
be
socially
optimal
n
by
contrast
what
machine
learning
algorithms
will
optimize
are
the
objectives
that
those
deploying
them
specify
should
be
optimized
as
long
as
this
specification
is
done
by
authorized
government
officials
the
concerns
about
bias
or
self
interest
that
animate
the
constitutional
prohibition
on
delegations
to
the
private
sector
should
not
exist
second
even
when
they
rely
on
machine
learning
human
governmental
officials
will
retain
ultimate
control
over
the
specification
of
algorithms
and
the
translation
of
their
outputs
to
regulatory
actions
that
the
government
maintains
such
a
level
of
direction
and
control
has
made
it
sufficient
for
courts
to
uphold
delegations
to
private
parties
as
long
as
a
private
party
s
participation
in
rulemaking
falls
short
of
possessing
the
ultimate
decisional
control
courts
have
allowed
delegations
to
the
private
sector
the
supreme
court
has
deemed
constitutional
for
example
legislation
providing
industry
with
a
role
in
policymaking
by
a
government
commission
because
private
firms
only
function
ed
subordinately
to
the
commission
n
more
generally
the
court
has
permitted
delegation
to
private
parties
when
their
actions
are
limited
to
advisory
decisions
rather
than
ones
that
are
binding
on
others
n
the
kind
of
rulemaking
by
robot
that
we
described
in
section
i
c
and
even
just
the
phrase
rulemaking
by
robot
might
at
first
glance
suggest
a
role
for
machines
that
exceeds
the
limits
established
for
delegations
to
private
entities
yet
even
though
machine
learning
systems
are
more
autonomous
from
humans
than
are
conventional
statistical
techniques
their
autonomy
is
still
far
from
the
constitutionally
impermissible
kind
even
if
rulemaking
were
to
be
fully
automated
the
underlying
algorithms
just
to
function
correctly
must
still
be
so
well
specified
that
important
discretion
would
remain
with
the
human
creators
and
overseers
of
the
algorithms
as
previously
discussed
algorithms
could
not
themselves
craft
regulatory
content
de
novo
humans
must
specify
the
targets
commands
and
consequences
of
potential
rules
from
which
an
embedded
machine
learning
system
might
choose
the
best
n
more
importantly
humans
can
at
any
time
choose
to
reject
a
machine
chosen
rule
alter
an
algorithm
s
specifications
or
even
pull
the
plug
on
the
system
entirely
if
nothing
else
as
long
as
rules
need
to
be
officially
signed
or
approved
by
a
human
official
then
humans
will
retain
ultimate
control
n
finally
although
algorithms
can
act
faster
than
humans
which
might
imply
a
lack
of
control
ultimately
algorithms
are
mere
measurement
tools
which
the
courts
widely
accept
as
legally
permissible
the
objection
of
course
would
be
that
humans
cannot
as
a
practical
matter
exercise
meaningful
control
over
automated
rulemaking
systems
in
high
speed
settings
in
these
and
perhaps
other
situations
it
may
simply
not
be
practical
for
human
officials
to
monitor
algorithms
output
in
real
time
and
exercise
their
abilities
to
approve
or
reject
rules
or
even
pull
the
plug
on
the
system
these
officials
would
of
course
still
retain
the
ability
to
disable
or
modify
a
rulemaking
by
robot
system
retroactively
although
it
might
be
reasonable
in
some
circumstances
to
demand
more
than
retroactive
review
in
most
instances
automated
artificial
intelligence
systems
once
constructed
by
humans
will
typically
function
as
legally
permissible
measurement
tools
in
prometheus
radio
project
v
fcc
the
fcc
relied
on
a
private
company
arbitron
to
measure
local
radio
station
audiences
and
these
measurements
provided
critical
inputs
to
rules
on
station
ownership
that
were
required
to
serve
the
public
interest
in
part
by
ensuring
competition
n
the
court
ruled
that
reliance
on
arbitron
was
not
an
unconstitutional
delegation
of
legislative
power
noting
arbitron
will
only
provide
a
mechanism
for
measuring
market
concentration
because
the
commission
remains
the
sole
arbiter
of
whether
a
proposed
radio
station
combination
serves
the
public
interest
no
improper
delegation
will
occur
n
thus
because
the
commission
specified
the
kind
of
rule
whether
an
ownership
pattern
is
legal
and
the
goal
to
be
served
by
the
rule
a
radio
station
combination
ensuring
diversity
and
competition
sufficient
to
serve
the
public
interest
private
parties
were
allowed
to
control
the
methods
used
to
measure
diversity
and
competition
and
provide
measurements
that
were
then
translated
into
rules
analogously
if
an
agency
creates
an
embedded
machine
learning
system
by
supplying
the
possible
rule
options
and
the
objective
function
the
implementation
of
an
algorithm
that
maximizes
that
objective
function
and
immediately
promulgates
the
resulting
rule
should
be
sustained
against
nondelegation
objections
because
it
is
functionally
serving
just
as
a
measurement
tool
from
the
standpoint
of
the
nondelegation
doctrine
the
use
of
machine
learning
is
not
conceptually
any
different
than
the
constitutional
use
of
other
machines
or
instruments
when
fda
officials
use
measuring
devices
like
thermometers
to
determine
the
optimal
temperature
at
which
to
store
fish
they
are
no
more
delegating
impermissibly
to
those
devices
than
if
they
were
to
rely
on
machine
learning
algorithms
for
these
reasons
not
only
would
legislation
authorizing
machine
learning
applications
be
unlikely
to
offend
the
intelligible
principle
requirement
it
also
should
not
constitute
a
prohibited
delegation
of
authority
to
an
entity
outside
of
government
cyberdelegation
might
well
look
somewhat
novel
but
it
is
not
unlike
government
reliance
on
measurement
devices
and
thus
unlikely
to
exceed
constitutional
constraints
on
the
delegation
of
governing
authority
statutory
subdelegation
having
concluded
that
congressional
authorization
of
rulemaking
by
robot
is
unlikely
to
offend
the
nondelegation
doctrine
we
return
to
the
issue
of
subdelegation
we
noted
at
the
outset
of
this
section
that
the
subdelegation
issue
involves
in
the
first
instance
answering
a
statutory
interpretation
question
specifically
would
an
agency
head
s
reliance
on
machine
learning
algorithms
exceed
authority
delegated
by
congress
via
statutory
language
specifically
authorizing
the
administrator
or
the
secretary
to
act
it
should
be
evident
that
for
reasons
similar
to
those
we
have
just
presented
about
delegations
to
private
entities
subdelegations
to
machines
pose
no
categorical
legal
concerns
administrators
do
not
exceed
their
statutory
authority
by
relying
on
thermometers
or
other
measurement
devices
nor
do
they
transgress
their
statutory
authority
by
relying
on
aides
and
subordinate
officials
because
ultimate
decision
making
authority
in
such
cases
is
never
completely
or
irrevocably
subdelegated
given
administrators
need
to
endorse
or
their
ability
to
override
what
their
subordinates
do
n
the
same
would
be
true
of
reliance
on
machine
learning
algorithms
despite
demonstrating
that
regulating
by
robot
is
unlikely
to
violate
the
nondelegation
doctrine
our
analysis
should
not
of
course
be
taken
to
imply
that
agency
actions
will
never
be
struck
down
on
grounds
related
to
delegation
delegations
for
example
may
be
constrained
by
how
much
judicial
deference
courts
give
to
agencies
interpretations
of
ambiguous
statutes
admittedly
chevron
n
deference
would
appear
to
be
considerable
as
courts
are
generally
instructed
to
defer
to
agencies
reasonable
interpretations
of
ambiguous
statutes
n
for
this
reason
we
find
it
difficult
to
see
how
an
agency
s
decision
to
use
machine
learning
even
if
central
to
an
agency
s
statutory
construction
could
rise
to
the
level
of
unreasonableness
typically
required
for
courts
to
reject
agency
interpretations
nonetheless
given
that
judges
have
yet
to
face
robotic
rulemaking
processes
like
those
we
described
in
section
i
c
there
remains
a
possibility
that
they
may
in
certain
situations
view
administrative
algorithms
with
a
particular
aversion
furthermore
given
what
seems
to
be
a
growing
currency
of
arguments
that
courts
have
been
overly
or
inappropriately
deferential
to
agencies
n
the
possibility
of
future
changes
in
deference
standards
cannot
be
overlooked
it
is
also
possible
of
course
for
congress
in
the
future
simply
to
prohibit
an
agency
or
perhaps
all
agencies
from
subdelegating
to
automated
systems
based
on
machine
learning
algorithms
despite
these
future
possibilities
arising
on
statutory
grounds
or
potential
changes
to
the
chevron
doctrine
when
it
comes
to
the
core
constitutional
question
we
do
not
foresee
delegation
considerations
posing
any
substantial
legal
hurdle
to
regulatory
applications
of
machine
learning
b
due
process
if
the
prospect
of
rulemaking
by
robot
might
animate
concerns
about
the
nondelegation
doctrine
the
prospect
of
adjudicating
by
algorithm
will
no
doubt
raise
due
process
concerns
administrative
agencies
after
all
are
expected
to
provide
adequate
procedural
due
process
when
taking
actions
that
could
deprive
individuals
or
entities
of
protected
liberty
interests
or
property
rights
and
entitlements
n
these
deprivations
can
occur
whenever
agencies
exercise
their
adjudicatory
authority
such
as
when
the
epa
orders
businesses
to
engage
in
the
costly
cleanup
of
hazardous
waste
for
which
they
are
deemed
responsible
n
or
the
social
security
administration
terminates
financial
payments
of
governmental
benefits
to
individuals
deemed
to
be
no
longer
eligible
n
in
the
machine
learning
era
would
an
agency
s
reliance
on
an
automated
machine
learning
system
to
make
such
adjudicatory
decisions
constitute
a
violation
of
an
individual
s
constitutional
right
to
due
process
as
we
noted
at
the
outset
of
this
part
much
will
turn
on
how
machine
learning
is
used
and
how
adjudications
by
algorithm
are
conducted
machine
learning
systems
could
be
used
as
discussed
in
section
i
c
simply
to
generate
inferences
that
constitute
but
one
of
several
inputs
into
an
independent
judgment
made
by
human
officials
or
they
could
be
used
to
make
automatic
decisions
about
deprivations
of
protected
rights
and
interests
this
latter
approach
involving
automated
algorithmic
decisions
in
adjudicatory
matters
would
seem
the
most
likely
to
deny
individuals
their
due
process
right
to
a
hearing
one
of
the
canonical
tenets
of
procedural
due
process
n
even
so
we
will
explain
why
even
such
machine
learning
based
decisions
are
in
no
way
uniquely
barred
from
satisfying
due
process
after
reaching
this
conclusion
though
we
will
highlight
an
area
of
tension
in
current
case
law
that
may
make
it
difficult
to
for
agencies
to
determine
when
procedural
protections
are
needed
in
an
age
of
algorithmic
adjudication
tests
for
due
process
the
landmark
case
of
goldberg
v
kelly
is
usually
recognized
for
establishing
that
due
process
protections
extend
to
recipients
of
government
welfare
benefits
which
previously
had
been
considered
privileges
that
did
not
afford
the
same
protection
as
constitutional
rights
n
although
goldberg
is
often
cited
for
the
court
s
rejection
of
the
right
privilege
distinction
just
as
central
to
the
court
s
decision
was
the
importance
of
welfare
recipients
having
the
ability
to
appear
in
person
before
the
government
official
who
makes
the
decision
about
whether
to
terminate
individual
benefits
n
the
court
rejected
a
process
that
was
based
on
written
documentation
finding
that
it
was
even
insufficient
for
a
human
caseworker
to
present
the
case
on
behalf
of
the
welfare
recipient
n
six
years
later
in
mathews
v
eldridge
the
supreme
court
held
that
in
the
context
of
social
security
disability
benefits
the
government
could
structure
a
process
based
solely
on
paperwork
review
and
without
offering
the
recipients
of
disability
benefits
a
pre
termination
hearing
before
an
administrative
official
n
the
court
did
not
overturn
goldberg
but
instead
it
offered
the
now
canonical
balancing
test
involving
three
factors
that
must
be
weighed
in
determining
whether
due
process
has
been
satisfied
first
the
private
interest
that
will
be
affected
by
the
official
action
second
the
risk
of
an
erroneous
deprivation
of
such
interest
through
the
procedures
used
and
the
probable
value
if
any
of
additional
or
substitute
procedural
safeguards
and
finally
the
government
s
interest
including
the
function
involved
and
the
fiscal
and
administrative
burdens
that
the
additional
or
substitute
procedural
requirement
would
entail
n
the
mathews
court
explicitly
noted
that
d
ue
process
is
flexible
and
calls
for
such
procedural
protections
as
the
particular
situation
demands
n
with
mathews
balancing
now
defining
procedural
due
process
we
conclude
that
algorithmic
adjudication
would
appear
to
fare
suitably
well
in
most
instances
even
if
goldberg
might
still
preclude
reliance
on
machine
learning
in
the
context
of
state
welfare
benefits
of
course
given
that
the
mathews
standard
calls
for
balancing
it
is
impossible
to
make
sweeping
generalizations
about
how
machine
learning
algorithms
would
fare
when
used
by
agencies
making
specific
kinds
of
decisions
but
at
least
one
thing
should
be
clear
no
agency
should
categorically
rule
out
the
use
of
machine
learning
algorithms
to
support
adjudicatory
decisions
among
the
areas
of
the
law
in
which
it
depends
would
seem
to
be
the
best
answer
this
is
definitely
one
mathews
s
first
factor
the
private
interest
at
stake
is
something
entirely
exogenous
to
machine
learning
but
the
last
two
factors
could
very
well
be
affected
perhaps
dramatically
so
in
some
cases
by
the
use
of
algorithms
when
used
to
administer
extremely
large
programs
machine
learning
could
save
the
government
a
substantial
amount
of
money
by
forgoing
pre
deprivation
hearings
thereby
significantly
increasing
the
weight
of
the
third
factor
in
favor
of
machine
learning
in
any
due
process
balancing
it
is
the
second
factor
then
that
will
likely
prove
critical
in
determining
the
constitutional
validity
of
automated
adjudications
namely
how
well
machine
learning
stacks
up
against
alternative
non
machine
based
procedures
in
terms
of
avoiding
erroneous
deprivations
agencies
will
need
to
be
justifiably
confident
that
automatic
algorithmic
deprivations
have
sufficiently
low
error
rates
to
weigh
heavily
against
the
need
for
pre
deprivation
hearings
before
human
officials
we
cannot
of
course
determine
ex
ante
what
will
constitute
sufficiently
low
rates
for
all
uses
given
that
the
nature
of
a
balancing
test
like
that
in
mathews
requires
case
by
case
determinations
we
see
little
reason
to
write
off
all
adjudicatory
algorithms
as
unable
to
conform
to
due
process
expectations
on
the
contrary
because
algorithms
can
reduce
the
possible
introduction
of
negative
features
of
human
judgment
such
as
prejudice
bias
and
mistakes
we
have
reason
to
expect
that
the
use
of
machine
learning
by
government
can
advance
due
process
values
n
evaluating
adjudicatory
algorithms
when
agencies
seek
to
assess
the
superiority
of
their
machine
learning
in
terms
of
error
avoidance
the
second
mathews
factor
two
conditions
must
be
met
error
rates
truly
representing
the
decision
processes
accuracy
must
be
available
and
those
error
rates
must
prove
to
be
acceptable
in
the
overall
balance
of
factors
the
first
of
these
two
conditions
should
easily
be
met
by
virtue
of
machine
learning
being
a
purely
mathematical
decision
making
process
unlike
qualitative
methods
for
determining
the
factual
bases
of
deprivations
mathematical
classification
systems
provide
estimates
of
their
error
rates
before
they
are
actually
implemented
one
can
obtain
from
machine
learning
algorithms
for
instance
a
form
of
output
called
confusion
tables
which
show
various
error
rates
in
a
test
data
set
n
assuming
some
degree
of
similarity
between
the
test
data
and
the
population
in
which
the
algorithms
will
be
implemented
these
error
rates
can
be
generalized
to
real
world
adjudications
the
second
condition
an
error
rate
s
acceptability
might
be
determined
by
reference
to
a
body
of
case
law
that
characterizes
acceptable
error
rates
for
other
types
of
procedures
relying
on
comparisons
of
error
rates
associated
with
other
procedures
would
be
in
line
with
courts
overall
emphasis
whenever
possible
in
applying
the
mathews
test
on
quantitative
estimates
of
error
based
on
empirical
evidence
rather
than
on
abstract
or
hypothetical
concepts
of
risk
n
although
due
process
determinations
will
still
be
flexible
and
require
case
by
case
balancing
agencies
could
reasonably
look
to
precedents
about
other
procedures
to
guide
their
decisions
about
algorithmic
autonomy
if
the
courts
typically
look
favorably
on
conventional
procedural
mechanisms
that
have
a
certain
level
of
accuracy
then
automatic
algorithm
based
adjudications
with
similar
error
rates
should
be
likely
to
pass
constitutional
muster
looking
to
precedents
will
reveal
on
the
one
hand
low

concluded
that

high

between

court
decisions
reveal
less
agreement
over
the
risk
that

moderate

pose

in
some
of
these

the

not

controlling

in

lack

threshold
of

past
precedents
present
another
challenge
in
that
reversal
rates
are
not
necessarily
a
complete
or
accurate
measure
of
error
in
the
particular
context
of
mathews
the
court
noted
that
the
administrative
review
system
operated
on
an
open
file
basis
n
meaning
that
those
denied
disability
benefits
could
at
any
point
following
their
deprivations
submit
new
evidence
that
could
result
in
additional
medical
examinations
individuals
who
availed
themselves
of
these
procedures
to
have
an
initial
denial
changed
were
not
included
in
the
percent
reversal
rate
because
their
cases
were
never
appealed
n
similarly
and
relevant
to
measurements
in
all
scenarios
reversal
rates
may
fail
to
capture
those
who
are
erroneously
denied
benefits
but
who
choose
for
various
unrelated
reasons
not
to
file
an
appeal
that
would
lead
to
an
evidentiary
hearing
and
reversal
for
these
reasons
the
actual
rate
of
error
in
administrative
systems
will
presumably
be
higher
than
indicated
by
a
rate
of
reversal
n
these
deficiencies
in
measuring
error
risk
based
on
reversal
rates
may
pose
a
challenge
to
an
agency
s
search
for
judicial
guidance
on
automatic
algorithmic
deprivations
algorithms
test
data
error
rates
are
mathematically
computed
in
a
way
that
makes
it
difficult
to
compare
them
directly
to
the
reversal
rates
currently
relied
upon
within
the
case
law
although
the
case
law
seems
to
indicate
that
reversal
rates
under
percent
should
be
sufficient
to
avoid
the
need
for
pre
deprivation
hearings
agencies
will
be
unable
to
determine
ex
ante
what
any
particular
algorithm
s
mathematical
error
rate
equates
to
in
terms
of
a
reversal
rate
as
a
more
accurate
estimate
of
the
total
error
in
a
system
will
likely
be
higher
than
any
reversal
rate
an
algorithm
s
error
rate
might
be
higher
too
even
when
reliance
on
the
algorithm
actually
results
in
a
less
error
prone
process
still
if
an
algorithm
s
error
rate
itself
fell
below
percent
then
agencies
relying
on
the
algorithm
for
adjudication
could
presumably
predict
that
the
courts
would
deem
this
rate
to
be
acceptable
if
nothing
else
agencies
could
structure
algorithmic
adjudication
systems
to
produce
data
on
reversal
rates
by
incorporating
a
delay
period
between
the
time
when
an
algorithmic
prediction
is
made
and
when
any
corresponding
deprivation
of
rights
occurs
affected
individuals
or
entities
would
have
the
opportunity
to
request
a
hearing
thus
generating
over
time
some
data
on
reversals
these
delay
periods
could
accompany
a
phase
in
or
piloting
of
an
automated
adjudicatory
system
providing
agencies
with
the
data
needed
to
establish
how
their
test
data
error
rates
correspond
with
reversal
rates
as
long
as
these
error
rates
prove
sufficiently
low
we
anticipate
no
categorical
reason
why
courts
would
reject
adjudication
by
algorithm
merely
due
to
its
digitized
and
automated
nature
cross
examination
of
adjudicatory
algorithms
perhaps
the
more
substantial
due
process
question
presented
by
automated
adjudication
stems
from
how
such
a
system
would
affect
an
aggrieved
party
s
right
to
cross
examination
claimants
presumably
should
have
a
right
to
understand
and
provide
comment
on
the
design
of
any
algorithm
as
well
as
the
underlying
data
used
n
unfortunately
it
will
seldom
if
ever
be
readily
discern
able
why
any
particular
prediction
resulted
from
machine
learning
and
consequently
it
will
not
be
easy
to
determine
what
evidence
would
be
needed
to
rectify
errors
n
any
of
the
variables
could
have
been
predictively
important
ones
and
any
of
those
variables
could
have
been
the
one
or
ones
that
contained
the
error
probably
the
only
meaningful
way
to
identify
errors
would
be
to
conduct
a
proceeding
in
which
an
algorithm
and
its
data
are
fully
explored
this
could
be
accomplished
through
agency
rulemaking
establishing
an
automated
adjudicatory
system
in
the
first
place
and
in
specifying
the
underlying
algorithm
s
parameters
it
might
also
be
raised
in
individual
hearings
or
appeals
seeking
to
analyze
separately
an
algorithm
s
forecast
in
each
case
probing
for
sources
of
error
in
the
data
and
specifications
underlying
those
individual
predictions
n
given
that
this
thorough
examination
of
algorithmic
error
will
entail
sophisticated
deconstructions
of
data
quality
and
methodology
few
individual
claimants
will
readily
possess
the
mathematical
and
analytical
ability
to
conduct
such
an
investigation
without
assistance
n
even
with
the
appointment
of
counsel
or
with
a
requirement
that
a
hearing
examiner
effectively
act
as
counsel
claimants
may
not
be
able
to
receive
a
fair
hearing
about
the
choices
embedded
in
and
the
data
used
by
algorithmic
adjudication
most
potential
counsel
or
agency
hearing
examiners
do
not
possess
the
necessary
skills
to
interrogate
machine
learning
systems
an
expert
must
have
a
good
degree
of
statistical
knowledge
to
understand
how
for
example
variables
importance
values
are
interpreted
and
what
consequences
those
interpretations
hold
for
the
effects
of
possible
erroneous
variable
measurements
on
predictions
adjudicating
by
algorithm
may
thus
necessitate
the
establishment
of
a
body
of
neutral
and
independent
statistical
experts
to
provide
oversight
and
review
or
more
likely
a
prior
rulemaking
process
informed
by
an
expert
advisory
committee
or
subjected
to
a
peer
review
process
fortunately
such
procedural
steps
are
well
established
and
have
been
long
used
in
other
complex
administrative
matters
n
in
the
end
whether
any
particular
algorithmic
system
will
satisfy
the
standards
of
due
process
will
depend
on
how
well
that
system
works
and
on
the
adequate
validation
of
its
performance
but
nothing
in
principle
stands
in
the
way
of
satisfying
the
demands
of
due
process
even
for
automated
adjudication
by
algorithm
especially
given
the
flexibility
courts
have
long
granted
agencies
in
crafting
adjudicatory
procedures
furthermore
given
the
well
established
biases
and
errors
that
can
creep
into
human
judgment
and
recognizing
that
machine
learning
algorithms
have
demonstrated
superiority
over
human
decisions
in
other
contexts
n
it
is
reasonable
to
conclude
that
agencies
will
be
able
to
satisfy
the
demands
of
due
process
even
in
the
machine
learning
era
n
c
antidiscrimination
as
agencies
face
choices
about
how
to
design
machine
learning
algorithms
in
the
service
of
adjudication
and
rulemaking
they
will
need
to
decide
what
kinds
of
variables
should
be
included
in
the
data
these
algorithms
use
to
make
predictions
they
may
have
at
their
disposal
data
on
demographic
variables
representing
membership
in
legally
protected
classes
and
inclusion
of
these
variables
in
algorithms
could
increase
their
predictions
accuracy
and
potentially
reduce
disparities
in
accuracy
across
classes
n
but
including
them
and
then
basing
action
on
the
resulting
predictions
raises
serious
concerns
about
illegal
discrimination
especially
if
those
predictions
lead
to
differential
effects
on
members
of
a
protected
class
as
a
white
house
report
on
big
data
has
warned
p
owerful
algorithms
can
unlock
value
in
the
vast
troves
of
information
available
but
also
raise
the
potential
of
encoding
discrimination
in
automated
decisions
n
in
this
section
we
take
up
the
question
of
whether
inclusion
of
class
related
input
variables
in
federal
agencies
algorithms
would
render
them
unconstitutional
for
equal
protection
reasons
we
find
that
although
consideration
of
suspect
class
membership
is
almost
universally
struck
down
for
contravening
equal
protection
in
traditional
decision
making
processes
quantitative
or
otherwise
some
of
the
unique
attributes
of
how
machine
learning
operates
may
shield
agencies
from
a
finding
of
unconstitutionality
this
is
not
to
say
that
the
use
of
machine
learning
algorithms
by
federal
agencies
will
always
be
unproblematic
under
equal
protection
on
the
contrary
the
use
of
algorithms
could
be
driven
by
manifest
easily
discoverable
animus
or
discriminatory
intent
as
much
as
any
other
decision
process
our
suggestion
is
simply
that
potential
equal
protection
challenges
to
agency
use
of
machine
learning
will
likely
face
a
high
bar
if
officials
in
these
agencies
employ
algorithms
responsibly
and
in
good
faith
building
a
suitable
record
to
demonstrate
the
propriety
of
their
design
and
use
under
the
fifth
amendment
agencies
must
respect
the
equal
protection
rights
of
those
affected
by
their
actions
n
federal
agencies
though
do
not
violate
those
rights
solely
because
an
action
has
a
disproportionate
impact
on
a
protected
class
such
as
race
or
religion
n
rather
to
show
a
violation
of
equal
protection
by
the
federal
government
a
purpose
to
discriminate
must
be
present
n
in
other
words
agency
action
that
purposefully
discriminates
based
on
a
protected
class
that
is
action
that
engages
in
disparate
treatment
will
be
legally
suspect
and
subject
to
heightened
scrutiny
n
at
the
end
of
this
section
we
will
briefly
suggest
that
regulatory
decisions
made
by
machine
learning
could
in
many
instances
withstand
heightened
scrutiny
but
of
course
we
recognize
that
evaluation
under
such
a
heightened
standard
of
review
will
ultimately
be
highly
fact
dependent
our
principal
argument
in
this
section
is
that
algorithms
that
include
variables
indicating
protected
class
membership
will
seldom
if
ever
trigger
heightened
scrutiny
at
least
in
the
absence
of
any
explicit
showing
of
discriminatory
intent
or
animus
equal
protection
challenges
to
machine
learning
will
in
short
likely
fail
at
the
first
step
of
analysis
that
demands
a
finding
that
algorithms
that
include
or
analyze
class
related
variables
are
intentionally
discriminatory
suspect
classifications
because
we
assume
that
there
will
rarely
exist
direct
evidence
that
a
decision
maker
in
this
case
an
algorithm
s
programmers
or
their
superiors
consciously
intended
to
discriminate
on
the
basis
of
a
protected
class
evidence
of
any
such
intent
would
need
to
be
found
indirectly
and
circumstantially
we
will
address
this
kind
of
search
for
inferences
of
discrimination
in
the
next
section
where
we
explain
why
machine
learning
is
unlikely
to
give
rise
to
such
inferences
but
first
we
take
up
the
typical
way
that
claimants
alleging
disparate
treatment
succeed
in
showing
that
governmental
action
deserves
heightened
scrutiny
namely
by
demonstrating
that
an
agency
action
involves
a
suspect
classification
such
classifications
are
automatically
subject
to
heightened
scrutiny
n
courts
will
likely
find
it
difficult
to
conclude
that
agency
algorithms
that
analyze
class
related
variables
entail
suspect
classifications
n
for
one
thing
the
supreme
court
has
never
clearly
defined
what
constitutes
a
suspect
classification
n
its
attitude
has
been
relatively
consistent
when
the
only
variable
contributing
to
a
governmental
decision
is
membership
in
a
protected
class
and
where
such
membership
universally
leads
to
disadvantaged
outcomes
such
decision
schemes
are
clearly
suspect
classifications
and
must
be
subjected
to
heightened
scrutiny
n
beyond
such
manifestly
problematic
scenarios
the
court
s
criteria
for
suspect
classifications
have
been
murkier
still
the
court
has
subjected
to
heightened
scrutiny
decision
processes
in
which
membership
in
a
protected
class
was
but
one
of
many
variables
considered
by
government
decision
makers
n
it
might
therefore
be
assumed
that
any
inclusion
of
class
membership
or
even
the
mere
consideration
of
a
protected
class
would
suffice
to
conclude
that
a
decision
making
process
depends
on
a
suspect
classification
n
if
this
were
the
case
then
any
machine
learning
algorithm
that
analyzes
data
containing
variables
for
membership
in
a
protected
class
would
surely
receive
heightened
scrutiny
yet
as
others
have
suggested
governmental
actions
that
are
class
conscious
but
do
not
classify
on
the
basis
of
group
membership
may
be
exempt
from
heightened
scrutiny
n
in
other
words
government
might
consider
a
suspect
class
without
necessarily
resulting
in
a
classification
how
class
membership
is
considered
beyond
merely
the
fact
that
it
is
can
matter
greatly
when
it
comes
to
determining
if
a
government
action
rests
on
a
suspect
classification
previous
scholarship
has
put
forward
five
such
aspects
of
a
classification
an
official
government
label
proclaiming
or
identifying
the
class
of
a
particular
individual
which
is
then
the
basis
for
allocating
benefits
or
imposing
burdens
on
the
person
classified
n
the
machine
learning
algorithms
we
envision
would
certainly
contain
an
official
government
label
indicating
particular
individuals
class
memberships
it
is
less
clear
however
that
these
algorithms
would
allocate
benefits
or
burdens
on
the
basis
of
class
membership
in
the
same
way
as
have
almost
every
decision
scheme
that
to
date
has
been
subjected
to
heightened
scrutiny
by
courts
decision
schemes
previously
reviewed
by
the
courts
have
universally
exhibited
what
we
label
categorically
different
treatment
based
on
class
membership
in
the
past
when
an
individual
s
race
has
been
factored
into
a
decision
being
a
member
of
a
given
race
has
caused
individuals
of
that
race
to
have
their
predicted
outcomes
affected
in
a
consistently
and
categorically
different
way
than
individuals
of
another
race
in
these
situations
being
a
member
of
a
given
race
has
always
been
across
individuals
of
that
race
either
advantageous
or
disadvantageous
when
compared
to
being
a
member
of
a
different
race
n
yet
with
machine
learning
many
if
not
most
algorithms
will
not
lead
to
categorically
different
treatment
even
when
they
include
consideration
of
variables
for
race
and
other
protected
classes
concern
about
categorically
different
treatment
on
the
basis
of
class
membership
underlies
many
supreme
court
decisions
under
the
equal
protection
clause
in
gratz
v
bollinger
white
undergraduate
applicants
were
categorically
denied
twenty
points
awarded
to
students
belonging
to
underrepresented
minority
groups
in
a
point
based
admissions
system
resulting
in
a
suspect
classification
n
in
grutter
v
bollinger
a
law
school
used
a
more
holistic
admissions
process
that
did
not
distribute
points
but
this
process
was
still
deemed
a
suspect
classification
when
race
did
factor
into
an
admissions
decision
membership
in
an
underrepresented
minority
group
was
universally
given
a
degree
of
preference
for
admission
over
lack
of
such
membership
n
the
court
has
similarly
held
that
heightened
scrutiny
is
warranted
due
to
categorically
different
treatment
arising
from
a
public
school
board
s
method
for
determining
teacher
layoffs
that
gave
preferential
treatment
to
minority
teachers
n
another
school
district
s
process
of
assigning
students
to
schools
triggered
heightened
scrutiny
because
for
each
school
it
gave
preference
to
students
of
certain
races
whose
assignment
would
place
the
school
s
racial
makeup
closer
to
that
of
the
school
s
district
n
in
each
of
these
cases
a
public
decision
process
treated
membership
in
certain
races
as
advantageous
while
treating
membership
in
others
as
disadvantageous
these
are
just
a
few
examples
but
they
demonstrate
the
pervasiveness
of
categorically
different
treatment
of
class
membership
traditionally
taking
race
or
other
protected
class
characteristics
into
account
meant
drawing
a
distinction
that
leads
to
one
class
being
advantaged
to
some
degree
over
another
class
by
being
more
likely
to
receive
benefits
or
avoid
burdens
the
court
s
reasoning
in
its
equal
protection
cases
underscores
how
doctrinally
important
this
categorically
different
treatment
of
class
membership
is
to
finding
a
reliance
on
a
suspect
classification
in
fullilove
v

the
supreme
court
applied
strict
scrutiny
precisely
because
the
legislative
scheme
gave
and
withheld
preference
based
on
ethnic
membership
n
similarly
in
wygant
v
jackson
board
of
education
the
court
stated
that
the
challenged
teacher
layoffs
operate
d
against
whites
and
in
favor
of
certain

and
therefore
constitute
d
a
classification
based
on

n
more
recently
the
court
emphasized
its
concern
in
fisher
v
university
of
texas
at
austin
about
a
state
considering
racial
minority
status
as
a
positive
or
favorable
factor
in
a
university
s
admissions
process
n
the
court
reasoned
that
t
he
principle
of
equal
protection
admits
no
artificial
line
of
a
two
class
theory
that
permits
the
recognition
of
special
wards
entitled
to
a
degree
of
protection
greater
than
that
accorded
others
n
in
other
words
equal
protection
law
singles
out
for
heightened
scrutiny
those
classifications
that
arise
when
government
draws
lines
that
categorically
favor
some
classes
and
disfavor
others
n
what
makes
explicit
consideration
of
class
membership
odious
and
offensive
to
equal
protection
principles
is
not
just
the
government
officials
consideration
of
race
and
other
protected
classes
but
their
use
of
class
status
as
part
of
a
classification
when
a
membership
in
one
class
is
consistently
treated
as
advantageous
or
disadvantageous
compared
to
membership
in
another
class
when
it
comes
to
the
use
of
machine
learning
algorithms
however
consideration
of
class
membership
will
not
necessarily
or
even
often
give
rise
to
categorically
different
treatment
we
can
expect
that
most
machine
learning
applications
will
be
used
to
forecast
complex
phenomena
such
as
tax
fraud
or
disability
eligibility
that
are
not
easily
predicted
by
standard
less
powerful
statistical
techniques
such
complex
phenomena
are
complex
precisely
because
their
causes
are
not
uniform
and
homogenous
across
the
population
when
machine
learning
is
applied
to
predict
such
phenomena
its
nonparametric
nature
and
incorporation
of
multidimensional
interaction
effects
allow
this
heterogeneity
to
be
manifested
and
more
fully
exploited
for
predictive
benefit
n
what
this
means
for
equal
protection
analysis
is
that
if
machine
learning
algorithms
incorporate
an
input
variable
representing
individual
membership
in
a
particular
class
it
is
highly
unlikely
that
the
effect
of
that
variable
on
predicted
outcomes
will
be
consistently
advantageous
or
disadvantageous
for
the
multitude
of
individuals
in
that
class
such
algorithms
will
be
designed
after
all
to
optimize
for
accuracy
in
making
predictions
of
fraud
or
benefits
eligibility
not
for
giving
preferential
treatment
based
on
race
or
other
class
characteristics
a
learning
algorithm
will
generally
be
able
to
improve
its
accuracy
through
more
data
and
additional
variables
of
all
types
the
forecasts
an
algorithm
generates
will
likely
support
favorable
treatment
for
some
members
of
a
class
and
unfavorable
treatment
for
other
members
of
that
same
class
as
these
forecasts
depend
on
complex
non
linear
interactions
of
multiple
variables
n
in
sum
determining
that
machine
learning
algorithms
create
a
suspect
classification
will
hardly
be
a
clear
cut
task
even
when
government
agencies
include
class
related
variables
in
their
data
sets
until
now
explicit
consideration
of
individuals
memberships
in
protected
classes
has
virtually
always
been
labeled
as
a
classification
because
of
the
categorically
different
treatment
that
accompanies
such
consideration
we
recognize
that
for
this
reason
some
courts
may
instinctually
incline
toward
treating
as
a
suspect
classification
the
mere
consideration
of
class
related
variables
by
learning
algorithms
yet
what
truly
makes
such
consideration
a
classification
and
thus
constitutionally
suspect
is
the
attendant
attachment
of
advantage
to
one
class
and
of
disadvantage
to
another
by
the
officials
who
are
collecting
and
analyzing
data
in
traditional
ways
an
attachment
that
will
neither
necessarily
nor
usually
be
present
with
the
use
of
machine
learning
the
courts
heightened
scrutiny
of
suspect
classifications
exists
not
to
prevent
any
and
all
governmental
considerations
of
class
characteristics
rather
it
exists
to
constrain
governments
from
stereotyping
and
treating
individuals
as
if
they
were
defined
by
their
status
within
a
particular
class
n
traditional
schemes
such
as
admitting
minority
students
or
retaining
minority
teachers
invariably
do
stereotype
when
they
categorically
assign
a
different
weight
in
the
government
s
decision
analysis
based
on
class
membership
by
contrast
machine
learning
algorithms
especially
those
we
have
in
mind
for
use
in
solving
complex
forecasting
problems
are
far
less
likely
to
do
so
as
courts
begin
to
encounter
governmental
use
of
artificial
intelligence
they
should
recognize
that
classification
is
not
a
synonym
for
explicit
consideration
of
an
individual
s
class
membership
n
at
least
not
when
applied
to
learning
algorithms
that
analyze
data
that
may
contain
class
related
variables
machine
learning
algorithms
do
not
operate
by
giving
categorically
different
treatment
based
on
class
membership
as
such
absent
animus
or
other
explicit
intentionality
about
class
in
the
selection
of
optimization
parameters
machine
learning
s
use
should
not
contravene
the
foundational
principles
underlying
the
supreme
court
s
invocation
of
suspect
classifications
inferring
discriminatory
intent
even
if
algorithms
do
not
implicate
suspect
classifications
opponents
of
certain
machine
learning
applications
might
still
argue
that
they
should
be
subjected
to
heightened
scrutiny
by
invoking
circumstantial
evidence
to
convince
courts
to
infer
discriminatory
intent
n
such
opponents
might
claim
that
the
mere
inclusion
of
a
variable
such
as
race
in
an
algorithmic
analysis
even
if
it
does
not
result
in
consistently
advantageous
or
disadvantageous
predictions
still
demonstrates
an
a
priori
intent
to
give
disparate
treatment
or
produce
a
disparate
outcome
they
might
argue
that
conscious
decisions
by
a
regulatory
agency
to
include
such
variables
in
a
machine
learning
analysis
represent
the
kind
of
specific
events
leading
up
to
the
challenged
decision
n
that
provide
circumstantial
evidence
of
discriminatory
intent
whatever
surface
appeal
such
arguments
might
hold
we
think
they
will
almost
surely
fail
in
the
context
of
machine
learning
the
black
box
nature
of
this
analysis
means
that
the
act
of
including
a
variable
does
not
by
itself
provide
much
insight
into
what
an
algorithm
user
might
have
hoped
to
gain
by
including
that
variable
additional
direct
or
circumstantial
evidence
would
be
needed
to
connect
the
inclusion
of
a
variable
to
discriminatory
intent
yet
perhaps
machine
learning
opponents
will
argue
that
government
officials
should
reasonably
foresee
that
the
inclusion
of
variables
related
to
a
protected
class
could
create
a
disparate
impact
and
thus
officials
persistence
in
including
those
variables
evidences
intent
to
discriminate
n
such
a
claim
would
be
dubious
given
how
machine
learning
analysis
works
on
a
black
box
basis
it
is
virtually
impossible
for
anyone
to
know
a
priori
what
a
given
variable
s
likely
importance
in
the
algorithm
will
be
or
what
its
ultimate
effects
will
be
on
any
disparities
of
predictions
n
many
machine
learning
algorithms
incorporate
stochastic
processes
that
randomly
decide
if
and
when
a
given
variable
factors
into
the
classifications
and
there
are
often
complex
and
unpredictable
interaction
effects
between
different
variables
that
may
cause
the
inclusion
of
a
protected
trait
related
variable
to
decrease
rather
than
increase
the
disparity
of
outcomes
even
after
an
algorithm
is
implemented
its
black
box
nature
prevents
anyone
from
determining
the
effects
of
that
variable
on
any
resulting
disparity
of
the
outcomes
whether
it
may
have
worsened
or
lessened
those
disparities
n
machine
learning
opponents
might
attempt
alternatively
to
argue
that
although
disparate
impacts
cannot
be
expected
a
priori
a
decision
maker
with
discriminatory
intent
could
run
an
algorithm
multiple
times
with
different
variables
included
determine
ex
post
whether
including
a
variable
representing
a
protected
trait
produces
greater
disparity
of
outcomes
and
then
choose
to
implement
an
algorithm
including
such
a
variable
if
it
produces
relatively
greater
disparity
n
the
legitimacy
of
such
a
claim
however
is
questionable
due
to
the
unknowable
generalizability
of
the
outcomes
of
any
single
machinelearning
analysis
it
is
common
practice
to
build
an
algorithm
using
a
random
sample
of
an
entire
data
set
called
the
training
data
and
to
then
evaluate
the
algorithm
s
predictions
in
a
different
random
sample
of
that
data
set
called
the
test
data
n
this
allows
an
analyst
to
obtain
some
sense
of
how
the
algorithm
may
perform
in
new
realizations
of
the
data
as
changes
may
result
whenever
an
algorithm
is
used
in
novel
predictive
endeavors
one
problem
common
to
any
statistical
analysis
is
that
the
analyst
cannot
know
how
close
the
test
data
are
to
new
realizations
of
data
and
thus
cannot
predict
how
a
model
or
algorithm
will
perform
in
the
real
world
if
the
entire
data
set
from
which
the
test
data
were
randomly
sampled
was
itself
a
random
sample
from
the
real
world
population
then
the
test
data
and
novel
realizations
may
well
be
similar
but
it
is
unlikely
even
if
an
agency
is
working
with
randomly
sampled
data
for
the
population
from
which
data
are
sampled
to
be
the
same
population
for
which
generalizations
are
desired
to
be
made
take
for
instance
an
irs
algorithm
used
to
predict
tax
fraud
this
algorithm
s
underlying
data
may
have
come
from
prior
years
audits
and
their
outcomes
but
that
population
is
not
the
same
as
the
population
of
interest
which
would
presumably
comprise
all
individuals
filing
tax
returns
not
just
those
audited
in
the
present
year
temporal
differences
between
test
data
and
real
world
data
can
matter
as
differences
in
the
economy
between
prior
years
and
the
current
year
may
impact
the
likelihood
of
individuals
to
engage
in
fraudulent
tax
practices
thus
even
if
an
agency
analyst
were
to
choose
an
algorithm
that
included
a
variable
representing
a
protected
class
such
as
race
a
disparate
impact
is
not
foreseeable
due
to
the
inability
of
knowing
the
likelihood
that
disparate
outcomes
observed
in
test
data
would
be
borne
out
in
real
world
data
for
these
reasons
plaintiffs
attempting
to
show
circumstantial
evidence
of
discriminatory
intent
in
the
use
of
machine
learning
will
surely
face
a
steep
uphill
climb
withstanding
standards
of
review
thus
far
we
have
explained
why
administrative
agencies
use
of
machine
learning
algorithms
that
analyze
class
related
variables
are
unlikely
to
give
rise
to
heightened
scrutiny
despite
a
lack
of
clear
settled
judicial
guidance
in
this
area
it
seems
safe
to
conclude
that
learning
algorithms
mathematical
properties
likely
will
preclude
the
courts
from
labeling
the
use
of
protected
class
data
in
these
algorithms
as
a
suspect
classification
or
inferring
any
circumstantial
discriminatory
intent
yet
if
a
court
nevertheless
did
subject
agencies
machine
learning
tools
to
heightened
scrutiny
this
does
not
automatically
mean
that
courts
will
find
that
the
agencies
have
denied
individuals
of
the
equal
protection
of
the
law
whether
a
decision
process
deemed
to
be
discriminatory
could
survive
heightened
scrutiny
will
depend
to
a
great
degree
on
factors
exogenous
to
the
nature
of
machine
learning
specifically
the
nature
of
the
government
objective
and
the
state
interest
motivating
the
process
n
presumably
regulatory
agencies
that
use
machine
learning
in
the
service
of
policy
objectives
such
as
public
health
protection
or
market
stability
would
have
strong
arguments
that
they
are
seeking
to
advance
compelling
state
interests
although
a
full
consideration
of
how
applications
of
machine
learning
would
fare
under
heightened
scrutiny
will
be
highly
fact
dependent
government
should
be
able
to
overcome
at
least
one
aspect
of
heightened
scrutiny
analysis
the
prohibition
on
overbroad
generalizations
about
different
classes
n
this
specific
equal
protection
concern
has
been
raised
in
the
context
of
evidence
based
sentencing
in
which
checklists
used
to
inform
criminal
sentencing
include
gender
coding
variables
weighted
on
the
basis
of
past
regression
analyses
n
for
example
sonja
starr
has
put
forward
a
compelling
argument
for
why
in
that
context
inclusion
of
class
related
variables
unconstitutionally
capitalizes
on
overbroad
generalizations
about
class
membership
checklists
take
gender
into
account
only
by
assigning
uniform
weights
to
one
gender
thereby
subjecting
all
individuals
to
group
based
treatment
instead
of
treating
them
truly
as
individuals
a
core
value
embodied
by
the
equal
protection
clause
n
this
criticism
though
is
unlikely
to
carry
the
same
weight
in
the
context
of
administrative
agencies
use
of
machine
learning
algorithms
if
gender
for
instance
were
included
in
an
algorithm
it
would
not
be
the
case
that
say
all
females
would
have
their
predictions
affected
in
the
same
way
simply
because
they
were
female
rather
the
effects
of
gender
on
the
predictions
would
vary
across
individuals
and
would
depend
on
interactions
between
the
gender
variable
and
all
other
input
variables
effects
that
would
again
be
unpredictable
and
heterogeneous
across
individuals
n
opponents
might
argue
that
machine
learning
nonetheless
creates
a
problematic
statistical
generalization
of
its
own
because
algorithms
generate
predictions
about
what
individuals
will
do
based
on
what
similar
individuals
have
done
in
the
past
n
admittedly
machine
learning
does
rely
on
analysis
of
training
data
sets
however
such
reliance
on
the
past
behavior
of
similar
individuals
occurs
at
a
fundamentally
different
and
much
more
individualized
level
in
the
algorithmic
context
than
in
the
context
of
checklists
in
the
latter
generalizations
are
made
about
what
females
as
a
broad
group
have
historically
done
in
the
former
generalizations
will
be
made
about
the
past
behaviors
of
say
females
of
a
certain
age
with
a
certain
educational
background
living
in
a
particular
area
paying
a
given
amount
of
taxes
driving
a
certain
type
of
car
and
so
forth
thus
even
though
starr
has
provided
compelling
reasons
to
believe
that
checklist
generalizations
may
be
unconstitutionally
overbroad
the
same
assertion
of
excessive
breadth
will
be
much
less
tenable
with
respect
to
machine
learning
algorithms
we
reiterate
that
challenges
to
agencies
algorithms
will
not
likely
reach
the
stage
where
these
considerations
will
be
relevant
the
usual
rationales
for
heightened
scrutiny
are
not
likely
to
apply
to
machine
learning
accordingly
the
applicable
standard
for
equal
protection
purposes
will
likely
be
rational
basis
review
which
generally
results
in
the
validation
of
state
action
n
rational
basis
review
merely
requires
that
a
governmental
action
be
rationally
related
to
furthering
a
legitimate
state
interest
n
assuming
that
the
governmental
interest
to
which
an
agency
s
machine
learning
algorithm
is
applied
is
legitimate
it
should
be
quite
difficult
for
that
algorithm
to
be
struck
down
on
equal
protection
grounds
an
algorithm
s
objective
function
will
itself
provide
a
concrete
mathematical
embodiment
of
the
agency
s
goal
sufficient
to
demonstrate
a
rational
relationship
between
the
algorithm
and
the
governmental
interest
at
stake
one
of
the
few
ways
in
which
government
actions
can
be
struck
down
under
rational
basis
review
is
through
the
finding
of
a
motivating
animus
toward
a
certain
group
n
the
supreme
court
has
yet
to
offer
clear
guidance
for
determining
the
presence
of
animus
or
how
exactly
such
a
presence
should
affect
judicial
review
n
nevertheless
we
can
surmise
that
animus
can
be
found
either
through
direct
evidence
or
via
inference
n
direct
evidence
typically
takes
the
form
of
statements
whether
by
legislators
n
or
private
individuals
whose
views
are
given
effect
by
challenged
actions
n
showing
sentiments
of
hostility
stereotype
bias
or
bigotry
such
manifest
indications
of
animus
might
well
surround
specific
uses
of
machine
learning
algorithms
but
nothing
unique
about
machine
learning
makes
it
any
more
vulnerable
to
explicit
animus
than
any
other
decision
making
process
or
governmental
action
claims
of
indirect
inferences
of
animus
might
conceivably
be
advanced
by
calling
attention
to
disparate
outcomes
yet
at
least
with
respect
to
machine
learning
any
such
inferences
would
be
hard
to
justify
although
animus
has
not
been
unambiguously
defined
inferences
of
it
would
likely
entail
making
a
situation
dependent
search
for
some
kind
of
logical
connection
between
the
consideration
of
class
and
the
government
interest
being
served
the
absence
of
which
might
plausibly
support
an
inference
of
animus
n
if
an
algorithm
s
supplementary
diagnostic
output
somehow
indicated
that
a
class
related
variable
was
relatively
important
for
the
accuracy
of
the
algorithm
s
predictions
then
it
would
appear
easy
to
claim
that
that
variable
is
connected
to
a
valid
governmental
interest
an
interest
in
taking
action
aimed
at
a
legitimate
purpose
in
the
most
efficient
and
accurate
way
possible
alternatively
if
a
class
related
variable
could
be
shown
to
be
not
predictively
important
then
the
consideration
of
class
would
likely
not
be
driving
the
discrimination
complained
of
but
rather
it
would
be
other
non
class
related
variables
that
would
underlie
the
outcomes
opponents
of
machine
learning
might
argue
that
these
other
variables
form
in
combination
a
proxy
for
class
and
this
could
be
true
but
then
the
inclusion
of
those
variables
would
carry
the
same
logical
connection
to
the
government
s
interest
as
would
the
inclusion
of
important
class
related
variables
the
non
class
related
variables
would
be
contributing
noticeably
to
the
algorithm
s
accuracy
for
these
reasons
even
when
some
evidence
might
be
put
forward
as
to
the
predictive
power
of
certain
variables
it
is
unlikely
that
agencies
algorithms
will
be
particularly
vulnerable
to
indirect
inferences
of
animus
that
could
lead
them
to
be
struck
down
under
rational
basis
review
another
potential
argument
opponents
might
make
is
that
animus
arises
if
an
agency
implements
an
algorithm
and
finds
that
it
yields
vastly
disproportionate
outcomes
for
individuals
of
a
particular
class
but
then
the
agency
fails
to
take
any
steps
to
alleviate
these
disparate
outcomes
n
after
all
a
series
of
novel
statistical
methods
are
emerging
that
can
minimize
the
disparate
impact
of
algorithms
n
these
methods
though
come
at
the
expense
of
forecasting
accuracy
which
means
that
an
agency
s
failure
to
adopt
them
may
not
necessarily
imply
animus
the
agency
may
simply
be
seeking
to
ensure
that
accurate
predictions
underlie
its
actions
furthermore
any
steps
an
agency
might
take
to
rectify
disparate
impacts
after
an
algorithm
s
implementation
could
itself
constitute
unconstitutional
disparate
treatment
n
overall
our
analysis
indicates
that
agencies
seeking
to
use
machine
learning
to
advance
their
public
missions
should
not
be
put
off
by
the
potential
for
equal
protection
challenges
n
we
expect
that
the
courts
will
permit
these
agencies
to
include
class
related
variables
in
their
algorithms
for
the
sake
of
accuracy
and
even
for
trying
to
mitigate
disparate
impacts
although
the
inclusion
of
race
and
other
class
characteristics
in
decision
making
supported
by
machine
learning
may
seem
to
run
afoul
of
the
court
s
historical
aversion
to
explicit
considerations
of
protected
classes
we
have
explained
why
the
algorithmic
consideration
of
class
unlike
the
consideration
in
traditional
decision
processes
is
unlikely
to
yield
categorically
different
treatment
based
on
class
membership
agencies
algorithms
are
unlikely
to
be
deemed
suspect
classifications
triggering
heightened
scrutiny
due
to
the
distinctive
mathematical
properties
of
machine
learning
agencies
will
also
likely
escape
heightened
scrutiny
based
on
circumstantial
evidence
of
intent
absent
direct
evidence
of
animus
machine
learning
should
be
easily
sustained
under
rational
basis
review
even
if
subjected
to
heightened
scrutiny
machine
learning
should
at
least
in
some
settings
also
withstand
challenge
our
conclusions
about
agencies
ability
to
use
machine
learning
in
ways
that
avoid
equal
protection
problems
should
hardly
be
construed
as
giving
our
blessing
to
the
careless
or
indiscriminate
use
of
machine
learning
principles
of
good
government
still
necessitate
whenever
feasible
the
avoidance
of
possible
discriminatory
outcomes
even
when
such
steps
are
not
demanded
by
the
constitution
indeed
one
important
reason
for
agency
experimentation
with
machine
learning
is
to
find
ways
to
reduce
or
eliminate
the
errors
and
biases
that
creep
into
human
decisions
although
agency
officials
should
be
fully
cognizant
of
potential
equal
protection
objections
to
their
efforts
to
engage
in
algorithmic
adjudication
or
robotic
rulemaking
these
legal
risks
appear
quite
manageable
and
should
hardly
stand
in
the
way
of
responsible
attempts
to
use
machine
learning
especially
when
doing
so
will
reduce
discrimination
that
would
otherwise
be
introduced
by
human
decision
makers
and
their
often
inescapable
sometimes
unconscious
prejudices
n
d
transparency
up
to
this
point
we
have
considered
choices
that
agencies
will
face
when
deciding
to
implement
algorithmic
tools
now
we
turn
to
the
question
of
how
could
and
should
regulators
ensure
proper
transparency
about
their
choices
some
observers
already
fear
that
an
era
of
artificial
intelligence
may
render
too
much
of
society
and
its
workings
opaque
n
the
legitimacy
of
agencies
choices
about
algorithms
will
therefore
depend
on
accountability
and
transparency
n
principles
of
transparency
undergird
much
of
administrative
law
finding
expression
in
statutes
such
as
the
freedom
of
information
act
n
and
various
requirements
under
the
administrative
procedure
act
n
taken
together
these
statutes
provide
a
fundamental
means
for
citizens
to
know
what
their
government
is
up
to
n
the
legitimacy
of
rules
issued
by
administrative
agencies
requires
that
those
being
regulated
have
access
to
information
showing
how
and
why
rules
were
adopted
particularly
transparency
requires
that
agencies
ensure
that
their
decisions
are
clearly
articulated
and
the
rationales
for
these
decisions
are
fully
explained
and
the
evidence
on
which
the
decisions
are
based
is
publicly
accessible
n
in
the
united
states
transparency
and
reason
giving
are
embedded
in
a
wide
variety
of
statutory
and
court
constructed
principles
regulatory
agencies
must
for
example
allow
for
public
comment
on
proposed
rules
and
final
rules
must
be
published
in
the
federal
register
along
with
a
separate
statement
providing
clear
justification
of
agencies
policy
choices
n
agencies
also
must
generally
disclose
information
to
the
public
upon
request
n
and
agencies
headed
by
multiple
commissioners
must
generally
make
their
decision
making
meetings
open
to
the
public
n
all
of
these
requirements
have
applied
without
much
interfering
with
traditional
administrative
practices
including
those
in
which
qualitative
decision
processes
by
humans
are
supplemented
with
conventional
quantitative
techniques
by
contrast
basing
regulatory
decisions
on
machine
learning
might
be
viewed
by
some
observers
as
taking
a
step
backwards
and
creating
obfuscation
because
of
learning
algorithms
complexity
and
black
box
nature
how
can
the
seemingly
ineffable
qualities
of
algorithmic
analysis
be
squared
with
principles
of
open
government
if
an
agency
decides
to
adopt
a
rule
because
its
machine
learning
algorithm
said
so
will
that
by
itself
constitute
adequate
justification
when
the
functioning
of
the
algorithm
cannot
be
intuitively
explained
this
section
takes
up
these
and
related
questions
we
conclude
that
well
informed
responsible
use
of
machine
learning
can
be
compatible
with
long
established
principles
of
accountable
and
transparent
administrative
decision
making
even
if
some
algorithmic
components
may
be
exempt
from
public
disclosure
before
delving
into
our
main
argument
though
let
us
briefly
confront
head
on
any
notion
that
the
black
box
nature
of
machine
learning
necessarily
condemns
it
as
being
unlawfully
opaque
although
such
an
initial
conclusion
might
seem
reasonable
from
the
words
black
box
such
a
label
is
a
bit
of
a
misnomer
in
this
context
to
say
that
machine
learning
has
a
black
box
nature
does
not
mean
it
is
completely
impenetrable
to
human
examination
rather
as
discussed
in
section
i
a
it
means
that
machine
learning
methods
for
transforming
inputs
to
outputs
are
not
as
intuitively
interpretable
as
more
traditional
forms
of
data
analysis
n
this
is
different
than
saying
that
no
one
can
know
at
all
how
algorithms
generate
their
predictions
which
we
would
agree
would
undermine
the
transparency
of
any
technique
underlying
administrative
action
machine
learning
can
be
understood
and
explained
analysts
can
and
do
possess
full
knowledge
of
algorithms
inner
workings
and
they
can
mathematically
explain
how
these
algorithms
optimize
their
objective
functions
what
they
lack
is
simply
an
interpretive
ability
to
describe
this
optimization
in
conventional
intuitive
terms
they
cannot
say
that
a
machine
learning
analysis
shows
that
x
causes
y
and
therefore
a
government
agency
aiming
to
reduce
y
needs
to
regulate
x

legitimacy

that

give
adequate
reasons

this
core
principle
in

the
shift
in
how
easy
it
is
to
grasp
intuitively
the
results
of
machine

algorithms
might
seem
to
mark
an
important
qualitative
change
in
how
governmental
decisions
can
be
explained
when
they
are
based
on
artificial
intelligence
given
the
way
courts
often
defer
to
agency
expertise
in
cases
involving
complex
scientific
and
mathematical
analysis
however
decisions
that
rely
on
machine
learning
are
unlikely
to
be
rejected
by
the
courts
as
insufficiently
reasoned
to
be
sure
administrative
law
has
long
compelled
reason
giving
by
agency
officials
especially
for
rulemaking

a
cornerstone

an
accountable

in

what
is
now
the
canonical
test

an

the

expect

ensure
that

policy
decision
remains
with
the
agency
rather
than

n
thus
in
administrative
applications
of
machine
learning
agencies
will
need
to
disclose
algorithmic
specifications

the

method

purport

give
agencies
explanations
a
substantial
inquiry
one
that
is
thorough
and
probing
n
consequently
some
uncertainty
especially
in
complex
rulemakings
may
always
exist
over
whether
a
court
will
ultimately
find
an
agency
s
explanations
satisfactory
and
such
uncertainty
may
exist
as
well
when
agencies
engage
in
rulemaking
by
robot
or
adjudication
by
algorithm
still
courts
are
usually
deferential
to
agencies
explanations
especially
when
they
involve
complex
expert
judgments
a
year
after
state
farm
for
example
the
court
reviewed
a
highly
complex
rule
developed
by
the
nuclear
regulatory
commission
nrc
in
which
the
agency
effectively
assumed
that
long
term
storage
of
radioactive
wastes
would
pose
no
environmental
impact
the
court
upheld
the
nrc
action
reasoning
that
a
reviewing
court
must
remember
that
the
commission
is
making
predictions
within
its
area
of
special
expertise
at
the
frontiers
of
science
when
examining
this
kind
of
scientific
determination
as
opposed
to
simple
findings
of
fact
a
reviewing
court
must
generally
be
at
its
most
deferential
n
subsequent
lower
court
decisions
have
exemplified
this
degree
of
deference
to
agencies
scientific
and
mathematical
analyses
for
example
a
district
court
recently
noted
that
t
he
most
important
thing
to
remember
is
that
even
if
plaintiffs
can
poke
some
holes
in
the
agency
s
models
that
does
not
necessarily
preclude
a
conclusion
that
these
models
are
the
best
available
science
some
degree
of
predictive
error
is
inherent
in
the
nature
of
mathematical
modeling
n
similarly
another
district
court
involved
in
a
recent
review
of
an
agency
s
conventional
mathematical
model
noted
that
w
hile
there
seems
to
be
a
reasonable
difference
of
opinion
regarding
whether
the
model
accurately
predicted
concentrations
of
the
chemical
at
issue
it
is
not
within
the
purview
of
this
court
to
weigh
the
evidence
supporting
these
extremely
divergent
scientific
opinions
and
decide
which
of
them
is
correct
n
in
these
and
other
cases
of
dueling
arguments
over
complex
models
agency
expertise
usually
wins
out
and
will
likely
continue
to
do
so
even
as
machine
learning
becomes
the
more
common
source
of

analysis

the

the

do
so
one
such
practice
would
be
the
disclosure
of
all
iterations
of
an
algorithm
or
alternative
algorithms
that
were
considered
their
predictions
and
their
corresponding
specifications
assuming
that
those
specifications
are
not
exempt
from
disclosure
the
end
goal
of
an
algorithm
is
accurate
prediction
via
optimization
of
an
objective
function
determining
which
algorithm
and
specifications
yield
the
most
accurate
predictions
is
often
a
matter
of
trial
and
error
various
algorithms
perform
differently
in
data
sets
and
a
whole
host
of
factors
can
affect
their
accuracy
including
how
many
times
an
algorithm
is
run
before
compiling
results
from
all
runs
what
variables
are
included
in
the
algorithm
and
other
tuning
parameters
that
vary
depending
on
the
algorithm
in
other
words
the
road
to
a
final
algorithm
is
paved
with
many
others
whose
results
ultimately
inform
properties
of
the
final
algorithm
disclosing
the
earlier
runs
would
be
advisable
because
they
would
indicate
that
the
ultimate
methodology
was
chosen
wisely
and
with
consideration
of
possible
alternatives
n
volunteering
how
those
previous
algorithms
were
specified
and
tuned
should
not
reveal
information
that
needs
to
be
exempted
from
disclosure
and
yet
it
would
give
some
insights
into
agencies
deliberative
processes
perhaps
more
importantly
it
would
signal
the
adoption
of
a
presumption
in
favor
of
disclosure
that
exemplifies
good
governmental
practice
n
agencies
could
also
generate
and
release
additional
forms
of
algorithmic
output
that
reveal
information
about
the
structural
properties
of
data
sets
and
the
relationships
among
variables
without
disclosing
exempted
information
such
outputs
might
include
for
example
partial
dependence
plots
which
reveal
the
functional
forms
of
relationships
albeit
with
no
implication
of
causality
between
predictor
variables
and
the
outcome
variable
as
well
as
predictor
importance
plots
which
indicate
roughly
speaking
how
important
each
predictor
variable
is
for
resulting
predictions
n
such
plots
are
tangential
to
the
metric
that
is
key
to
policymaking
based
on
algorithms
predictive
accuracy
and
thus
they
are
not
likely
to
factor
into
rules
in
any
dispositive
way
that
would
make
them
legally
subject
to
disclosure
but
they
can
offer
supplementary
commentary
that
would
further
transparency
by
allowing
interested
parties
to
accrue
some
knowledge
of
information
contained
in
withheld
data
sets
or
algorithms
perhaps
more
importantly
output
such
as
partial
dependence
plots
n
might
provide
some
more
intuitive
explanations
as
to
why
an
algorithm
s
predictions
resulted
which
may
be
valuable
to
courts
or
members
of
the
public
accustomed
to
decisions
based
on
causal
reasoning
n
ultimately
transparency
in
administrative
rulemaking
is
essential
to
avoid
the
creation
of
secret
law
n
and
to
ensure
an
informed
citizenry
vital
to
the
functioning
of
a
democratic
society
needed
to
check
against
corruption
and
to
hold
the
governors
accountable
to
the
governed
n
when
regulations
are
made
based
on
algorithmic
predictions
transparency
of
decision
making
requires
as
much
disclosure
about
the
algorithm
s
specifications
and
its
underlying
data
as
possible
n
however
as
noted
foia
may
often
allow
the
withholding
of
some
data
on
commercial
confidentiality
or
related
grounds
rendering
complete
reproducibility
of
results
difficult
but
if
algorithmic
specifications
can
be
disclosed
so
as
to
make
results
at
least
theoretically
reproducible
then
the
fundamental
goal
of
knowing
how
and
why
decisions
resulted
might
be
satisfied
of
course
those
specifications
themselves
in
particular
the
mathematical
optimization
processes
used
in
a
machine
learning
analysis
could
be
exempted
from
disclosure
as
well
if
they
support
law
enforcement
or
are
developed
by
private
contractors
but
these
are
all
legally
permissible
exemptions
that
have
been
invoked
by
agencies
time
and
again
outside
the
context
of
algorithmic
regulation
as
agencies
move
into
the
era
of
machine
learning
they
may
continue
to
avail
themselves
of
these
same
exemptions
but
would
still
be
required
or
at
least
advised
to
release
an
appropriate
amount
of
information
to
illuminate
what
may
initially
seem
to
be
an
opaque
analytical
process
and
satisfy
prevailing
norms
of
open
government
in
these
ways
agencies
will
also
be
able
to
justify
their
actions
with
sufficient
reasons
to
withstand
charges
that
agencies
have
acted
in
an
arbitrary
or
capricious
manner
iii
the
merits
of
machine
learning
in
the
regulatory
state
the
legal
analysis
presented
in
the
previous
part
indicates
that
when
federal
agencies
use
artificial
intelligence
to
automate
regulatory
and
adjudicatory
decisions
they
will
likely
face
little
difficulty
in
making
machine
learning
practices
fit
within
existing
administrative
and
constitutional
constraints
n
this
analysis
has
taken
place
against
a
backdrop
of
growing
concern
over
the
proliferation
of
machine
learning
and
artificial
intelligence
which
may
make
our
conclusions
surprising
if
not
a
bit
disquieting
to
some
readers
after
all
as
we
noted
at
the
outset
of
this
article
technologists
and
sociologists
alike
worry
about
the
consequences
of
algorithmic
automation
spreading
throughout
society
bringing
with
it
the
possibility
that
highly
skilled
jobs
will
be
taken
over
by
machines
n
as
super
intelligent
computers
surpass
the
capacities
of
humans
n
these
anxieties
will
undoubtedly
grow
only
more
fevered
when
artificial
intelligence
falls
into
the
hands
of
government
officials
such
as
when
it
is
used
in
predictive
policing
n
or
in
what
has
been
called
the
crossing
of
a
moral
rubicon
in
target
selecting
military
drones
n
if
the
significant
governmental
power
wielded
by
administrative
agencies
could
also
be
taken
over
by
autonomous
algorithms
then
surely
society
would
face
a
grave
specter
of
lives
and
livelihoods
being
regulated
by
robots
notwithstanding
these
ominous
warnings
actual
technological
capabilities
are
hardly
so
threatening
for
much
the
same
reason
that
science
alone
can
never
make
policy
decisions
n
machine
learning
algorithms
need
humans
to
specify
their
objective
functions
and
construct
the
mathematical
processes
that
will
maximize
them
n
although
machine
learning
could
replace
or
supplement
many
routine
governmental
tasks
the
oversight
and
direction
of
the
government
will
remain
in
human
hands
even
in
the
machine
learning
era
society
s
most
consequential
regulatory
decisions
are
not
routine
and
therefore
will
almost
surely
prove
to
be
unsuitable
candidates
for
automation
these
most
significant
regulatory
policy
decisions
present
complexities
uncertainties
and
value
judgments
that
will
resist
the
kind
of
specification
needed
to
embed
them
in
mathematical
objective
functions
machine
learning
analysis
will
be
able
to
assist
only
by
informing
the
most
significant
of
regulatory
choices
not
by
determining
them
n
the
more
routine
decisions
that
algorithms
will
be
able
to
make
will
surely
affect
people
s
lives
and
livelihoods
but
in
these
cases
machine
learning
applications
will
be
designed
to
meet
human
officials
specifications
and
will
ultimately
remain
under
human
control
autonomous
robots
will
not
be
wielding
regulatory
power
on
their
own
for
the
reasons
we
have
explained
nothing
about
algorithms
makes
them
uniquely
or
automatically
unsuitable
for
use
by
administrative
agencies
in
terms
of
their
ability
to
comport
with
core
legal
principles
although
machine
learning
systems
can
fit
quite
comfortably
within
existing
constitutional
and
administrative
law
this
does
not
mean
that
their
use
will
always
be
warranted
n
it
especially
does
not
mean
that
agencies
should
use
machine
learning
in
a
haphazard
or
irresponsible
manner
agencies
will
have
to
act
with
care
and
in
designing
and
implementing
their
algorithms
consider
potential
pitfalls
and
areas
of
concern
in
the
following
two
sections
we
briefly
discuss
how
several
key
policy
issues
and
good
government
principles
apply
to
machine
learning
applications
the
policy
issues
relate
to
the
four
legal
doctrines
discussed
earlier
nondelegation
due
process
antidiscrimination
and
transparency
the
other
principles
of
good
government
apply
more
generally
to
the
exploitation
of
algorithms
by
those
in
positions
of
power
only
by
engaging
in
a
thorough
case
by
case
evaluation
of
such
non
binding
but
vital
considerations
will
agencies
ensure
that
their
use
of
machine
learning
conforms
not
just
to
the
law
but
also
to
foundational
principles
of
sound
and
legitimate
public
policy
a
related
public
policy
concerns
in
the
previous
part
we
demonstrated
that
in
principle
agencies
machine
learning
algorithms
should
withstand
legal
challenges
based
on
doctrines
of
nondelegation
due
process
antidiscrimination
and
transparency
of
course
an
escape
from
judicial
censure
does
not
necessarily
guarantee
that
the
algorithms
will
be
fully
consonant
with
the
public
policy
principles
underlying
those
doctrines
some
of
the
policy
concerns
animating
the
legal
doctrines
discussed
in
part
ii
still
deserve
attention
if
agencies
are
to
use
machine
learning
in
a
responsible
manner
for
instance
we
noted
that
one
of
the
nondelegation
doctrine
s
motivating
goals
ensuring
political
accountability
has
prompted
some
scholars
to
advocate
that
the
courts
should
give
more
deference
when
an
agency
head
makes
the
key
decision
than
when
decisions
are
made
by
subordinate
officials
n
the
courts
have
not
embraced
such
a
graduated
approach
but
its
suggestion
should
prompt
agency
officials
to
consider
how
machine
learning
may
affect
the
locus
of
decision
making
inside
their
agencies
when
rules
are
intimately
tied
to
the
outputs
of
an
algorithm
the
programming
of
that
algorithm
will
be
a
consequential
task
one
that
presumably
should
not
be
assigned
exclusively
to
a
lowerlevel
analyst
as
traditional
statistical
analyses
may
be
today
assigning
responsibility
to
lower
level
analysts
without
adequate
input
and
oversight
could
run
the
risk
that
higher
level
officials
those
who
are
more
directly
accountable
to
the
political
branches
of
government
and
to
the
public
will
not
fully
understand
critical
details
about
an
already
ostensibly
opaque
rulemaking
process
perhaps
worse
the
lower
level
analysts
could
make
choices
about
an
algorithm
s
specifications
and
tuning
without
realizing
potentially
far
reaching
impacts
of
their
decisions
n
for
these
reasons
agencies
should
be
mindful
of
who
within
an
agency
actually
wields
algorithm
specifying
power
and
how
well
high
level
officials
understand
the
methods
of
regulating
by
robot
or
adjudicating
by
algorithm
our
discussion
of
due
process
similarly
suggests
that
there
is
no
reason
to
view
adjudicatory
algorithms
as
uniquely
threatening
to
fair
hearings
still
agencies
will
need
to
proceed
thoughtfully
and
with
care
n
agencies
may
need
to
delay
the
deployment
of
their
algorithms
to
get
a
sense
of
how
well
the
test
data
error
rates
correspond
with
decision
reversal
rates
the
metric
underlying
the
existing
body
of
relevant
case
law
furthermore
agencies
should
increasingly
seek
out
and
engage
neutral
statistical
experts
to
provide
dispassionate
assessments
of
consequential
uses
of
algorithms
individuals
challenging
an
agency
s
deprivation
of
their
rights
or
property
cannot
be
expected
to
mount
a
sufficiently
probing
search
for
an
algorithm
s
potential
inadequacies
and
biases
either
on
their
own
or
with
the
help
of
skilled
but
mathematically
na
xef
ve
counsel
even
if
not
legally
required
agencies
should
still
undertake
the
kind
of
probing
inquiry
needed
to
minimize
possible
errors
and
biases
associated
with
any
algorithms
they
use
agencies
must
also
take
note
of
the
potential
for
their
algorithms
to
cause
a
disproportionate
impact
on
members
of
certain
classes
or
groups
despite
the
probable
constitutionality
under
the
fifth
amendment
of
the
use
of
such
algorithms
n
of
all
the
policy
concerns
related
to
the
legal
doctrines
discussed
in
this
article
the
possibility
of
disproportionate
impacts
may
be
the
most
acute
in
the
popular
and
academic
media
commentators
have
noted
the
ways
in
which
algorithmic
bias
can
manifest
itself
n
a
series
of
violent
interactions
between
police
and
african
americans
over
the
last
few
years
has
prompted
public
worry
of
pervasive
discrimination
by
governmental
authorities
n
agencies
should
thus
seek
ways
of
mitigating
algorithms
disparate
impact
but
they
should
do
so
not
just
as
a
response
to
this
public
alarm
but
also
as
a
matter
of
ethical
governance
if
discrimination
no
matter
how
unintentional
can
be
avoided
it
should
be
recent
advances
in
statistics
as
noted
earlier
may
provide
agencies
with
powerful
mitigating
tools
but
agencies
will
still
need
to
balance
tradeoffs
with
forecasting
accuracy
n
finally
we
have
shown
that
agencies
should
have
no
problem
disclosing
sufficient
information
to
meet
the
reason
giving
and
transparency
requirements
of
the
apa
and
foia
n
nevertheless
disclosing
the
bare
minimum
probably
just
the
objective
functions
and
limited
aspects
of
algorithms
specifications
should
not
be
the
ultimate
goal
of
an
open
forthcoming
administrative
state
agencies
should
begin
developing
practices
for
documenting
retaining
and
disclosing
developmental
algorithm
specifications
and
final
algorithm
supplemental
output
to
increase
transparency
and
facilitate
peer
review
n
b
other
good
government
principles
in
addition
to
policy
concerns
related
to
the
four
legal
doctrines
analyzed
in
part
ii
several
other
good
government
principles
should
be
considered
by
agencies
when
using
machine
learning
these
principles
relate
to
challenges
associated
with
quantification
permissible
error
lack
of
empathy
job
losses
and
privacy
first
agencies
should
recognize
that
the
use
of
algorithms
will
often
compel
agency
decision
makers
to
engage
in
quantitative
coding
of
value
judgments
that
have
typically
been
made
qualitatively
for
example
machine
learning
algorithms
often
permit
the
specification
of
their
cost
ratios
the
ratio
of
false
positives
to
false
negatives
n
this
is
a
concrete
unambiguous
quantification
of
agencies
relative
normative
values
of
their
errors
for
agencies
not
accustomed
to
making
moral
valuations
through
any
kind
of
formal
process
let
alone
one
that
assigns
them
numbers
machine
learning
algorithms
will
necessitate
addressing
questions
of
organizational
and
democratic
decision
making
who
should
have
the
power
to
transform
qualitative
moral
judgments
into
a
cost
ratio
should
agencies
involve
the
public
or
at
least
make
interested
parties
aware
of
a
transformation
from
qualitative
to
a
quantitative
assessment
of
errors
and
algorithmic
tradeoffs
is
such
a
transformation
even
possible
or
are
human
deliberations
over
morality
too
nuanced
to
be
reduced
to
a
matrix
of
error
rates
n
agencies
will
have
to
confront
not
only
the
challenges
of
making
accurate
quantifications
of
error
rates
but
also
contend
with
a
host
of
relevant
normative
questions
about
quantification
as
they
proceed
into
the
machine
learning
era
second
agencies
will
have
to
decide
what
constitutes
acceptable
algorithmic
error
rates
this
will
go
beyond
the
due
process
related
assessment
of
whether
courts
will
consider
algorithm
error
rates
acceptable
instead
it
requires
agencies
to
ask
how
large
gains
in
accuracy
must
be
to
offset
other
difficulties
in
implementing
algorithmic
systems
such
issues
would
likely
arise
in
the
context
of
benefit
cost
analyses
that
agencies
conduct
prior
to
taking
important
actions
for
example
how
much
would
say
a
five
percent
increase
in
accuracy
when
predicting
hazardous
waste
pipeline
incidents
save
an
agency
in
inspection
costs
would
these
savings
be
worth
the
necessary
investments
in
human
capital
and
data
infrastructure
and
beyond
the
internal
difficulties
faced
by
agencies
would
the
public
demand
particularly
large
increases
in
accuracy
to
compensate
for
the
novelty
and
potentially
alarming
nature
of
robotic
systems
of
regulation
or
adjudication
n
is
a
marginal
improvement
over
the
status
quo
acceptable
or
should
agencies
strive
for
something
more
third
we
should
consider
what
happens
to
human
contact
in
a
world
of
robotic
regulators
and
algorithmic
adjudicators
citizens
expect
their
government
to
be
competent
and
efficient
but
they
also
tend
to
view
governmental
institutions
as
more
legitimate
when
these
institutions
operate
with
understanding
and
empathy
n
the
idea
of
the
government
reducing
individuals
to
data
points
that
are
then
fed
into
an
algorithm
will
seem
disconcertingly
impersonal
even
if
ultimately
more
accurate
and
efficient
administrative
officials
that
use
algorithms
should
seek
to
listen
to
interested
members
of
the
public
as
they
design
systems
for
rulemaking
by
robot
or
adjudicating
by
algorithm
these
officials
should
also
encourage
participation
through
interactive
methods
that
treat
beneficiaries
targets
of
regulation
and
all
other
affected
parties
with
respect
and
dignity
n
fourth
government
should
not
turn
a
blind
eye
to
the
possibility
that
widespread
use
of
algorithms
will
put
many
government
workers
out
of
their
jobs
n
the
extent
to
which
agencies
workforces
will
shrink
as
a
result
of
adopting
machine
learning
is
unclear
as
we
have
noted
human
input
will
still
be
necessary
at
many
steps
of
regulatory
and
adjudicatory
processes
even
when
automated
n
but
there
can
be
little
doubt
that
the
structures
of
agencies
workforces
will
change
if
day
to
day
operations
begin
to
take
drastically
different
forms
due
to
automated
decision
making
with
over
million
full
time
employees
in
the
executive
branch
of
the
federal
government
n
and
many
more
working
for
government
contractors
large
scale
automation
efforts
may
be
appropriately
combined
with
proactive
job
training
for
workers
who
might
seek
positions
in
the
future
in
algorithm
support
responsibilities
finally
although
throughout
this
article
we
have
self
consciously
eschewed
a
discussion
of
privacy
concerns
for
reasons
noted
earlier
n
agencies
still
must
never
overlook
these
concerns
administrative
agencies
are
poised
to
collect
more
data
on
individuals
with
each
passing
day
agencies
must
properly
and
securely
store
these
data
to
minimize
threats
to
privacy
intrusions
especially
when
many
administrative
applications
of
machine
learning
will
require
inter
agency
sharing
through
the
cloud
n
agencies
may
also
increasingly
seek
individuals
data
from
sources
outside
of
the
united
states
which
will
require
careful
consideration
of
jurisdictional
questions
n
c
a
path
forward
the
issues
we
have
raised
in
the
preceding
two
sections
should
be
addressed
as
part
of
agencies
case
by
case
assessments
and
benefit
cost
analyses
of
specific
applications
of
machine
learning
agency
and
cross
agency
decisions
about
when
and
how
to
implement
machine
learning
will
benefit
from
clear
guidance
on
how
to
assess
machine
learning
s
merits
n
the
administrative
conference
of
the
united
states
the
national
academy
of
public
administration
or
the
national
academy
of
sciences
might
be
able
to
help
in
developing
guidelines
when
agencies
ultimately
apply
such
guidelines
and
conduct
benefit
cost
analysis
of
specific
machine
learning
applications
we
can
expect
administrative
algorithms
will
prove
extremely
promising
in
some
instances
and
less
advantageous
in
others
n
agencies
should
be
suitably
discerning
and
pursue
machine
learning
applications
when
they
can
lead
to
meaningful
improvements
in
procedural
and
substantive
outcomes
recognition
of
the
need
for
careful
consideration
and
reasonable
safeguards
when
agencies
use
algorithms
should
not
lead
to
any
presumption
against
using
machine
learning
entirely
these
techniques
are
becoming
ubiquitous
in
private
industry
for
good
reason
their
ability
to
make
accurate
predictions
of
complex
phenomena
can
render
decision
making
vastly
more
effective
and
efficient
and
it
would
be
wise
for
administrative
agencies
also
to
seek
these
benefits
n
still
accountable
managers
must
carefully
oversee
their
use
of
algorithms
even
in
the
private
sector
n
and
they
must
take
possible
unintended
consequences
into
account
n
the
same
can
be
said
of
all
innovative
practices
the
need
to
weigh
the
pros
and
cons
of
algorithms
is
in
no
way
qualitatively
different
than
the
weighing
of
benefits
and
costs
needed
to
inform
other
administrative
choices
n
including
those
prompted
by
other
technological
advancements
n
thoughtful
implementation
is
always
advisable
for
the
adoption
of
any
new
administrative
technology
or
process
deciding
how
and
when
to
use
machine
learning
may
not
come
easily
which
may
make
agency
efforts
to
facilitate
public
participation
in
decisions
about
the
use
of
machine
learning
even
more
important
it
would
certainly
be
better
to
take
additional
time
to
engage
in
robust
public
consultation
and
make
thoughtful
decisions
about
machine
learning
s
use
than
to
dismiss
algorithms
out
of
hand
over
exaggerated
fears
about
unleashing
artificial
intelligence
demons
n
technological
and
analytical
advances
are
continually
invented
and
adopted
because
despite
their
potential
limitations
they
offer
the
possibility
to
transform
society
for
the
better
the
implementation
of
machine
learning
algorithms
by
administrative
agencies
certainly
possesses
such
potential
with
proper
forethought
and
care
guided
by
the
kind
of
analysis
we
have
provided
throughout
this
article
an
administrative
state
on
the
cutting
edge
of
statistical
innovation
can
be
legally
and
responsibly
realized
moving
in
this
direction
can
deliver
marked
improvements
in
overall
well
being
especially
as
the
government
faces
new
challenges
in
overseeing
a
private
sector
that
has
already
entered
the
machine
learning
era
conclusion
we
have
considered
a
future
american
administrative
state
increasingly
driven
by
machine
learning
algorithms
such
a
future
may
not
look
like
the
glamorously
or
ominously
automated
picture
painted
by
popular
media
coverage
of
artificial
intelligence
but
it
nonetheless
could
entail
significant
changes
in
how
the
government
functions
whether
in
making
certain
rules
or
in
applying
and
enforcing
them
administrative
agencies
have
begun
to
take
steps
toward
such
a
future
and
our
analysis
offers
support
to
agencies
that
seek
to
venture
further
into
this
new
era
of
administration
agencies
that
rely
on
machine
learning
algorithms
are
unlikely
to
face
unique
insurmountable
legal
barriers
at
least
not
under
the
key
legal
principles
of
the
administrative
state
that
we
have
assessed
here
by
establishing
the
legality
of
the
use
of
machine
learning
we
believe
our
analysis
clears
away
one
of
the
more
significant
hurdles
to
its
further
implementation
of
course
although
our
legal
analysis
supports
agency
use
of
machine
learning
we
recognize
that
agencies
will
need
as
with
any
management
or
policy
choice
to
exercise
care
in
how
and
when
they
deploy
new
technology
and
will
need
to
build
the
human
capital
and
information
technology
infrastructure
to
support
rulemaking
by
robot
and
adjudication
by
algorithm
n
to
admit
the
need
for
such
diligence
in
execution
however
is
no
reason
for
preemptively
shying
away
from
the
benefits
from
government
agencies
deployment
of
the
latest
statistical
advancements
if
agencies
encounter
public
hesitancy
about
governmental
use
of
artificial
intelligence
perhaps
that
anxiety
will
stem
from
a
perception
of
machine
learning
algorithms
as
fundamentally
different
in
kind
from
existing
decisionmaking
processes
something
about
the
phrase
black
box
a
common
description
of
machine
learning
techniques
may
make
machine
learning
sound
incompatible
with
notions
of
accountable
government
but
it
would
be
more
accurate
to
view
machine
learning
algorithms
or
any
other
statistical
procedures
not
as
complete
black
boxes
but
rather
as
extensions
of
existing
human
decision
making
after
all
human
cognition
and
computerized
algorithms
may
process
information
in
certain
foundationally
similar
ways
n
the
latter
are
black
box
in
nature
simply
because
they
are
qualitatively
speaking
more
complex
and
less
intuitively
understandable
than
conventional
techniques
perhaps
also
much
like
human
decision
making
democratic
government
itself
in
a
collective
sense
is
decision
making
according
to
the
algorithm
of
majority
rule
the
constitution
s
establishment
of
a
bicameral
legislature
and
a
system
of
checks
and
balances
established
a
complex
decision
making
algorithm
involving
hundreds
of
officials
elected
by
millions
of
voters
with
the
passage
of
time
congress
presidents
and
agencies
have
imposed
their
own
layers
of
procedures
for
their
work
that
are
arguably
as
complex
and
counterintuitive
as
any
machine
learning
algorithm
n
just
as
some
messiness
and
ineffability
in
collective
decision
making
may
be
the
price
of
the
benefits
of
democracy
difficulty
intuiting
machine
learning
results
may
be
a
relatively
small
price
to
pay
for
more
accurate
and
effective
decisions
in
the
administrative
state
with
the
advent
of
artificial
intelligence
s
widespread
application
throughout
all
other
realms
of
society
it
will
not
be
long
before
the
administrative
state
moves
headlong
to
confront
the
questions
we
have
analyzed
in
this
article
for
administrative
agencies
what
will
distinguish
the
machine
learning
era
is
not
a
substitution
of
human
judgment
with
some
foreign
and
unfamiliar
methodology
but
rather
an
evolution
of
human
judgment
to
incorporate
fundamentally
similar
albeit
more
accurate
and
often
practically
more
useful
processes
of
decision
making
made
possible
by
advances
in
statistical
knowledge
data
storage
and
digital
computing
the
analysis
offered
here
provides
an
antidote
to
visceral
reactions
against
the
use
of
artificial
intelligence
in
the
public
sector
reactions
we
hope
will
give
way
to
a
measured
optimism
capable
of
guiding
and
improving
the
future

the

process
and
the
good
cause
exception
to
it
is
provided
at
u
s
c
it
is
important
to
recognize
that
we
have
adopted
a
formulation
of
algorithm
created
rules
resembling
that
of
rules
as
they
exist
today
an
algorithm
would
promulgate
rules
specifying
a
particular
course
of
action
a
particular
safety
standard
a
particular
acceptable
emissions
level
or
so
forth
under
this
formulation
any
changes
to
an
algorithm
that
result
in
a
different
prescription
including
merely
re
running
the
algorithm
as
specified
on
new
data
would
necessitate
a
new
rulemaking
process
absent
a
good
cause
exemption
but
because
machine
learning
is
likely
to
be
of
most
utility
when
engaged
to
regulate
dynamic
time
sensitive
environments
it
is
probable
that
such
an
exemption
could
often
or
even
categorically
be
claimed
an
alternative
formulation
might
be
one
in
which
rules
state
merely
that
an
algorithm
will
be
used
to
promulgate
prescriptions
continuously
instead
of
a
rule
reciting
a
particular
course
of
action
or
safety
standard
on
the
basis
of
algorithmic
output
the
rule
would
say
that
a
future
algorithm
will
run
continuously
and
be
updated
dynamically
to
decide
the
appropriate
course
of
action
or
safety
standard
in
the
future
cf
coglianese
supra
note
at
noting
the
possibility
of
a
reconceptualization
of
the
form
in
which
rules
are
promulgated
such
a
formulation
probably
would
not
necessitate
that
a
new
rulemaking
be
commenced
whenever
the
algorithm
is
updated
but
it
might
be
legally
problematic
given
the
need
for

its

and
natural

natural

could
however
probably
write
sections

other

human
input

the
goal
of
a

rule

such
sections
could
plausibly
be
written
in

by
humans

then
the
rest
could

we
also
do
not
focus
on

concerns
because
they
are
not
unique
to

use
of
machine

our
principal
concern
here
is
with
issues
that
are
distinctively
applicable
to
the
use
of
machine
learning
in
the
administrative
state
furthermore
many
of
machine
learning
s
privacy
implications
could
be
more
accurately
characterized
as
implications
of
the
use
of
big
data
although
algorithms
themselves
may
make
possible
new
kinds
of
inferences
this
ability
is
manifested
only
in
large
data
sets
so
the
underlying
privacy
problems
that
others
have
flagged
appear
to
have
been
raised
more
by
the
collection
of
big
data
than
by
the
use
of
machine
learning
algorithms
per
se
n
note
that
this
limited
autonomy
also
implies
given
our
description
of
how
machine

operates
the
potential
for
algorithms
to
yield
unexpected
seemingly
original
outcomes
also
although
we
have
chosen
to
use
and
qualify
the
term
autonomy
other
legal
literature
on

refers
with
good

to
similarly

if

by
which
that

matter
is
estimated
as
previously
discussed

machine

will
often
be
applied
to
make
predictions
about
risks
not
capable
of
being
directly
evidenced
if
phmsa
orders
the
shutdown
of
a
pipeline
for

the
issue
disputed
at
a

will
be
whether
that
pipeline
indeed
posed
a
risk
for
future
failure
and
the
kind
of
physical
evidence
that
could
be
presented
at
the
hearing
may
not
be
capable
of
demonstrating
the
pipeline
s
lack
of
risk
therefore
a
pipeline
operator
in
such
a
hearing
will
have
to
provide
evidence
instead
about
the
potential
sources

that
was

imagine
for
instance
that
for
a
given
protected
attribute
a
data
set
contains
information
about
two
classes
of
individuals
one
class
is
larger
and
has
on
average
more
advantageous
outcomes
in
terms
of
the
output
variable
however
defined
the
other
class
is
smaller
and
has
on
average
less
advantageous
outcomes
if
an
algorithm
were
ignorant
of
or
blind
to
the
class
identities
of
individuals
in
this
data
set
the
algorithm
would
generate
one
classification
rule
that
would
generally
perform
more
accurately
for
the
majority
class
simply
because
it
is
larger
causing
less
accurate
predictions
for
the
minority
class
if
however
this
algorithm
explicitly
took
into
account
individuals
class
memberships
it
could
generate
two
different
classification
rules
one
for
each
class
allowing
for
more
accurate
predictions
overall
and
most
pertinently
for
the
minority
class
there
may
of
course
be
instances
in
which
the
increases
in
overall
accuracy
and
decreases
in
accuracy
disparities
are
negligible
particularly
nearly
equally
accurate
predictions
may
result
in
data
sets
lacking
class
related
variables
but
containing
many
other
variables
that
are
highly
correlated
with
class
membership

this
finding
may
naturally
prompt
the
question
of
whether
including
such
proxy
variables
capable

raises
equal

concerns
and
indeed
this

clear
that
the

must
be
disentangled
from
its
use
to

is
treated
within

have
suggested
that
because

has
classification

the

of

whether

whether
within
that

going

we
discuss
categorically
different
treatment
of

in
contexts
where
one
class
is
advantaged
it
is
awarded
benefits
or
allowed
to
avoid

and
another
is
disadvantaged
but
the
underlying
conceptual
formulation
of
categorically
different
treatment
also
applies
to
instances
in
which
the
attached
benefits
or
burdens
of
governmental
treatment
are
less
evident

for

johnson
v

which
concerned
the
assignment
of

only
to

with
cell
mates
of
the

race
no
prisoners
of
particular
races
were
burdened
any
more
than
others
but
the
court
explicitly
stated
that
allowing
this
action
to
escape
strict
scrutiny
ignores
our
repeated
command
that
racial
classifications
receive
close
scrutiny
even
when
they
may
be
said
to
burden
or
benefit
the
races
equally
johnson

u
s
quoting

u
s
it
should
be
clear

that
this
assignment
of
prisoners
by
race
nonetheless
involved
categorically
different
treatment
even
if
not
categorically
different
allocation
of
burdens
or
benefits
all

of

this

the

we

in

article
in
which
the
feared
equal
protection
violation
would
result
from
a
prohibition
not
of
disparate
impacts
but
of
animus
nonetheless
the
court
s
general
hesitancy
to
allow
ex
post
disparate
treatment
calls
into
question
whether
ex
post
rectifications
of
an
algorithm
s
disparate
impacts
would
be
permissible
n
in
reaching
this
conclusion
we
have
noted
several
uncertainties
that
exist
from
a
lack
of
clarity
surrounding
the
meaning
of
suspect
classification
to
the
uncertain
acceptability
of
ex
post
modifications
of
algorithms
with
disparate
impacts
such
uncertainties
are
representative
of
the
broader
ferment
that
has
characterized
and
continues
to
characterize
equal
protection
doctrine
and
it
is
in
the
context
of
this
ferment
that
our
conclusion
should
be
understood
perhaps
these
difficulties
in
obtaining
clarity
about
the
meaning
of
equal
protection
are
not
due
to
any
easily
rectifiable
inadequacies
in
law
but
simply
to
the
problem
of
defining
in
a
more
normative
sense
what
equality
actually
means
for
example
many
conceptions
of
equality
rest
on
the
notion
that
persons
similarly
circumstanced
shall
be
treated
alike
f
s
royster
guano
co
v
virginia
u
s
but
some
scholarship
has
argued
that
such
a
statement
is
circular
and
devoid
of
any
real
moral
thrust
the
only
coherent
way
to
define
two
individuals
as
being
alike
may
not
be
to
say
that
they
are
alike
in
any
empirical
way
but
to
say
that
they
are
morally
alike
in
that
they
should
be
treated
alike
but
then
a
determination
of
who
should
be
treated
alike
is
external
to
equality
and
must
be
derived
from
conceptions
of
rights
or
other

practical
implications

also
for
the

said

rodriguez
from
the
los

police
department
lapd
comdr
rodriguez
was
a
guest
speaker
yesterday
at
the
interpol
world
congress
he
shared
the
lapd
s
experience
by
presenting
a
case
study
highlighting
the
use
of
predpol
a
predictive
policing
software
that
pinpoints
crime
hot
spots
based
on
historical
data
like
crime
type
location
and
date
comdr
rodriguez
who
heads
eight
police
stations
in
los
angeles
california
had
told
the
straits
times
a
day
earlier
that
predictive
policing
helps
narrow
the
likelihood
of
a
crime
occurring
in
areas
depicted
by
a
feet

box
which
works

he
said
so
what
we
tell
our
officers
as
they
re
driving
from
point
a
to
point
b
through
the
city
is
know
where
these
boxes
are
and
drive
through
them
so
you
can
provide
a

presence

introduced
to
the

in
predpol
was
used
to
track
property
crimes
like
burglaries
theft

and
motor
vehicle
thefts
during
his
time
as
captain
at

los
angeles
police
divisions
property
crimes
decreased
he
said
but
he
emphasised
that
predpol
should
be
used
only
to
augment
police
operations
comdr
rodriguez
who
became
a
police
officer
in
said
no
matter
what
technology
you
have
or
how
advanced
you
get
you
ll
still
need
the
human
element
and
cooperation
from
the
community
human
intel
cannot
be
replaced
by
anything
else
while
there
are
fears
that
predictive
policing
might
infringe
on
civil
liberties
the
greater
concern
now
facing
the
lapd
is
perhaps
the
increase
in
violent
crimes
a
los
angeles
times
report
last
december
stated
that
violent
crime
figures
had
risen
for
a
third
straight
year
in
the
wake
of
homicides
and
gang
related
shootings
which
resulted
in
people
being
killed
in
the
city
though
the
number
is
lower
when
compared
with
the
killed
a
decade
ago
unfortunately
property
crime
figures
have
gone
up
too
comdr
rodriguez
attributed
the
rise
to
the
decriminalisation
of
some
offences
he
added
a
lot
of
crime
penalties
have
been
lowered
from
felonies
to
misdemeanours
for
property
crimes
these
individuals
know
the
time
they
re
going
to
get
is
minimal
when
it
comes
to
sentencing
right
now
the
biggest
problem
we
have
is
the
drug
problem
with
the
legalisation
of
marijuana
in
states
like
colorado
oregon
and
california
crime
figures
are
expected
to
rise
more
he
said
you
ve
got

support
your
drug
habit

said
comdr
rodriguez

thinks
that
marijuana
is

looking

feeling
they
then
progress

the

the

of

spreads
its
wings
only
with
the
falling
of
the
dusk
n
despite
hegel
s
ultimately
reassuring
premise
it
never
seemed
inevitable
that
the
emergence
of
mass
incarceration
as
a
proper
historical
subject
would
occur
simultaneously
with
its
institutional
and
political
demise
history
as
a
scientific
and
humanistic
tradition
with
its
own
methodologies
sources
and
conventions
inevitably
keeps
some
distance
on
the
present
typically
a
generation
or
two
has
passed
before
a
truly
significant
political
development
like
the
new
deal
or
the
cold
war
escapes
the
pull
of
presentist
hagiography
or
demonology
and
comes
under
the
full
possession
of
professional
historical
gaze
after
journalism
and
political
science
have
had
their
varying
efforts
at
neutralizing
the
present
in
contrast
the
point
at
which
a
significant
political
phenomenon
has
lost
its
dominance
over
the
present
is
a
much
less
regular
or
inevitable
pattern
n
and
yet
the
recent
wave
of
historical
analysis
of
mass
incarceration
a
development
that
began
in
the
s
happens
to
be
emerging
at
a
moment
of
political
questioning
more
profound
than
at
any
time
since
the
late
s
and
early
s
from
the
supreme
court
s
powerful
condemnation
of
california
s
overcrowding
n
to
the
black
lives
matter
movement
s
growing
presence
in
the
streets
and
voting
booths
of
major
cities
the
contemporary
carceral
state
is
under
attack
while
there
is
no
guarantee
that
we
will
in
fact
see
substantial
institutional
change
in
the
size
and
nature
of
the
carceral
state
the
emerging
historiography
of
mass
incarceration
has
been
shaped
by
the
very
possibility
of
that
change
and
has
lessons
that
could
be
crucial
in
strengthening
the
growing
movement
for
reform
elizabeth
hinton
s
impeccably
researched
study
of
federal
crime
policy
from
the
kennedy
through
reagan
administrations
is
the
most
telling
account
yet
of
this
new
history
of
the
american
carceral
state
n
this
has
been
a
topic
of
considerable
interest
to
political
scientists
and
criminologists
since
the
s
n
but
hinton
is
able
to
draw
on
confidential
memos
and
other
materials
from
the
national
archives
and
presidential
libraries
to
draw
a
far
more
precise
picture
than
ever
before
of
what
national
leaders
believed
they
knew
about
crime
and
how
they
intended
to
act
on
the
problem
her
account
likely
to
be
the
most
definitive
one
for
years
to
come
confirms
the
centrality
of
political
considerations
to
the
shaping
of
mass
incarceration
as
urged
by
earlier
studies
while
giving
us
a
much
more
detailed
and
pointed
analysis
of
what
those
political
considerations
were
in
particular
hinton
s
analysis
places
concern
over
the
political
and
social
threat
of
collective
violence
by
black
youth
growing
up
in
segregated
neighborhoods
of
concentrated
poverty
at
the
very
heart
of
crime
as
a
national
problem
n
and
as
the
focal
point
of
increasingly
punitive
solutions
from
kennedy
to
bush
i
and
if
her
history
continued
through
both
bushes
n
trying
to
prevent
black
youth
from
turning
to
crime
and
contain
those
involved
with
crime
with
aggressive
policing
and
excessive
incarceration
became
in
many
respects
america
s
chief
domestic
objective
from
the
vietnam
war
to
the
wars
in
iraq
and
afghanistan
n
this
obsessive
fear
of
black
youth
and
totalizing
national
commitment
to
their
surveillance
and
control
makes
all
of
the
contemporary
talk
from
national
leaders
about
trying
to
rebuild
trust
between
police
and
young
people
of
color
ludicrous
so
long
as
the
war
on
crime
continues
hinton
s
study
comes
at
a
time
when
most
of
the
action
from
scholars
in
trying
to
explain
mass
incarceration
has
moved
to
state
and
even
local
levels
n
while
the
carceral
state
in
our
federalist
system
is
primarily
one
of
state
and
local
governments
hinton
s
account
begins
during
a
period
when
the
federal
government
particularly
its
executive
branch
made
a
concerted
effort
to
alter
the
size
and
character
of
local
criminal
justice
agencies
including
police
departments
courts
and
correctional
systems
throughout
the
united
states
n
premised
on
what
was
depicted
as
a
serious
and
growing
threat
of
violent
crime
localized
in
large
cities
throughout
the
nation
the
war
on
crime
involved
the
dispersal
of
billions
of
dollars
nearly
two
billion
per
year
in
contemporary
dollars
three
quarters
of
which
went
into
policing
between
and
n
as
well
as
the
creation
of
model
laws
and
policies
that
the
money
helped
to
promote
policies
that
had
previously
been
considered
unwise
or
unconstitutional
including
preventive
pretrial
detention
and
mandatory
minimum
sentences
n
political
scientists
studying
the
war
on
crime
in
its
early
stages
already
concluded
it
had
largely
failed
in
its
goals
of
improving
the
effectiveness
of
law
enforcement
or
reducing
crime
something
hinton
s
research
reaffirms
n
but
as
hinton
documents
it
was
an
enormously
successful
exercise
in
state
building
n
creating
fear
as
a
byproduct
of
its
success
at
putting
crime
at
the
very
center
of
american
life
the
war
on
crime
became
self
perpetuating
and
continued
during
the
first
two
decades
of
this
century
even
as
crime
indexes
dropped
to
historic
lows
n
and
fear
of
crime
largely
diminished
as
a
national
political
issue
only
today
a
half
century
after
the
key
events
and
decisions
that
produced
the
war
on
crime
and
in
the
face
of
repeated
scandals
of
racism
inhumanity
and
failure
by
the
carceral
state
have
we
seen
growing
social
movement
resistance
to
end
that
war
n
although
historiographical
research
time
frames
based
in
large
part
on
archival
access
policies
determine
that
her
narrative
ends
some
twenty
five
years
prior
to
the
present
moment
n
hinton
s
themes
connect
directly
to
the
growing
discontent
with
the
systems
of
punitive
policing
and
mass
incarceration
and
carry
clear
implications
for
those
who
would
seek
to
reform
or
radically
change
those
systems
chillingly
for
reformers
and
radicals
alike
almost
all
of
the
ideas
being
circulated
in
the
name
of
reforming
the
carceral
state
today
were
already
parts
of
the
thinking
that
shaped
the
war
on
crime
and
are
thus
quite
unlikely
to
alter
its
fundamental
character
after
reviewing
hinton
s
major
findings
this
book
review
turns
first
to
hinton
s
historiographical
contributions
and
second
to
her
lessons
for
those
who
would
like
to
make
history
by
ending
mass
incarceration
i
from
war
on
poverty
to
war
on
crime
in
hinton
s
convincing
account
the
road
from
a
federal
campaign
to
eliminate

poverty
in
the
united
states
to
a
much
larger
one
aimed
at
fighting
crime
by
policing
and
punishing
people
in
poverty
was
a
remarkably
short
one
and
the

its
beginnings
in
the
kennedy
administration
the
war
on
poverty
was
braided
closely
with
questions
of
crime
and
particularly
delinquency
n
the
latter
was
taken
to
be
a
product
of
lacking
opportunities
for
integration
into
the
mainstream
of
social
and
economic
life
in
combination
with
the
reinforcing
stigma
of
criminalization
and
punishment
n
the
attempted
solutions
were
efforts
to
accelerate
the
exposure
of
these
same
youths
to
mainstreaming
opportunities
the
upbeat
name
for
this
concept
was
mobilization
for
youth
a
program
aimed
at
young
people
generally
in
poor
neighborhoods
n
at
its
most
ambitious
level
and
never
in
more
than
a
small
portion
of
the
nation
s
needy
areas
this
effort
placed
federal
grants
into
the
hands
of
frontline
antipoverty
organizations
and
community
organizers
community
action
workers
in
the
terminology
of
the
moment
to
socially
organize
and
politically
empower
poor
families
and
communities
n
five
years
later
in
the
johnson
administration
and
despite
that
president
having
made
an
even
louder
commitment
to
waging
war
on
poverty
than
his
predecessor
efforts
to
mobilize
youth
in
poverty
had
been
substantially
superseded
and
assimilated
into
a
far
larger
effort
to
maintain
surveillance
and
control
over
black
youth
living
in
neighborhoods
of
concentrated
poverty
n
this
newly
dubbed
war
on
crime
was
to
be
run
through
the
law
enforcement
oriented
department
of
justice
and
its
foot
soldiers
rather
than
community
action
workers
were
big
city
police
forces
n
perhaps
the
most
antiblack
organized
force
in
america
in
those
years
of
still
expanding
civil
rights
its
goals
remained
mixed
at
first
to
mainstream
youth
perceived
as
at
risk
of
becoming
involved
in
crime
but
also
to
confront
arrest
and
punish
those
black
youths
whose
potentiality
for
crime
crossed
over
into
criminal
behavior
n
even
before
the
feverish
year
of
and
nixon
s
dog
whistling
law
and
order
campaign
n
the
die
was
largely
cast
poverty
elimination
would
have
to
wait
for
a
successful
effort
to
reestablish
urban
social
control
over
segregated
neighborhoods
of
concentrated
poverty
the
nixon
administration
would
accelerate
this
already
rapid
shift
by
introducing
model
laws
for
the
district
of
columbia
aimed
at
increasing
police
power
and
the
punitive
potential
of
criminal
convictions
and
pivoting
from
johnson
s
overwhelming
investment
in
policing
toward
a
more
balanced
portfolio
of
police
courts
and
corrections
departments
n
ford
and
carter
would
bring
important
innovations
toward
ever
lengthening
prison
sentences
and
an
increasingly
fortified
urban
suburban
landscape
n
yet
all
of
this
remains
largely
in
the
tight
operating
principles
of
the
war
on
crime
logic
that
hinton
sees
in
place
of
the
very
appointment
of
the
johnson
administration
s
much
vaunted
national
commission
on
law
enforcement
and
the
administration
of
justice
n
what
happened
hinton
places
even
more
emphasis
than
previous
accounts
have
on
the
political
significance
of
the
pattern
of
urban
riots
or
uprisings
that
beginning
with
the
watts
riots
in
los
angeles
in
shook
america
s
large
and
medium
sized
cities
and
the
political
landscape
through
most
of
the
summers
into
the
early
s
n
unlike
the
more
generalized
idea
of
crime
in
the
streets
into
which
they
obviously
played
urban
riots
galvanized
very
specific
concerns
of
collective
violence
directed
against
white
society
and
its
governmental
forces
particularly
the
police
in
fact
to
the
extent
that
these
events
had
a
political
logic
it
was
one
very
much
aimed
against
big
city
police
whose
forms
of
order
maintenance
had
always
involved
routine
racial
harassment
and
in
the
increasingly
turbulent
s
were
becoming
more
violent
and
confrontational
n
ironically
the
major
solution
the
johnson
administration
promoted
notwithstanding
much
talk
of
investment
and
rebuilding
was
even
larger
better
equipped
and
more
lethal
police
forces
n
if
riots
could
be
seen
as
protests
of
the
inadequate
pace
of
antipoverty
policy
and
the
unmediated
tyranny
of
virtually
all
white
urban
police
forces
and
the
often
white
supremacist
political
machines
to
which
they
were
attached
they
were
an
even
more
potent
weapon
in
the
hands
of
those
who
argued
that
criminality
arising
from
the
tangle
of
pathologies
associated
with
segregated
neighborhoods
of
concentrated
poverty
was
a
threat
to
national
security
n
even
the
sympathetic
liberals
of
the
johnson
administration
saw
the
riots
as
signs
that
antipoverty
programs
at
least
at
the
individualized
behavioral
level
to
which
post
new
deal
liberal
politics
consigns
them
might
not
stem
the
tide
of
black
violence
in
time
to
prevent
if
not
a
revolution
at
least
a
fatal
rupture
of
support
for
the
johnson
agenda
nationally
n
much
like
the
increasingly
grim
conflict
in
vietnam
to
which
a
wide
variety
of
observers
drew
parallels
n
the
war
on
crime
would
have
to
reestablish
a
coercive
balance
of
control
before
more
hopeful
efforts
to
win
the
hearts
and
minds
of
young
residents
of
segregated
neighborhoods
of
concentrated
poverty
could
be
attempted
the
strategy
would
prove
futile
in
both
domestic
and
foreign
policy
but
it
would
take
far
longer
to
declare
the
war
on
crime
a
failure
the
riots
were
important
also
because
they
reinforced
the
racialized
criminology
that
formed
the
core
intellectual
framework
for
the
war
on
crime
in
this
analysis
drawn
from
the
midcentury
and
at
least
initially
from
liberal
social
scientists
like
daniel
p
moynihan
james
q
wilson
and
edward
banfield
crime
as
a
problem
stemmed
from
the
transformations
of
the
modern
city
and
the
rise
of
what
a
later
generation
would
call
the
underclass
n
captured
perhaps
most
enduringly
by
moynihan
s
imagistic
concept
of
the
tangle
of
urban
pathologies
read
urban
as
black
this
theory
saw
the
deformed
black
family
produced
by
the
aftermath
of
slavery
and
more
recently
the
great
migration
single
parent
female
headed
as
the
key
source
of
a
demographic
and
cultural
tide
of
nonconformity
and
violence
that
threatened
american
society
and
certainly
the
claims
of
liberalism
to
govern
it
n
the
riots
proved
that
this
tide
was
already
present
and
capable
of
overwhelming
the
local
police
forces
many
if
not
most
of
the
riots
involved
national
guards
force
being
mobilized
by
the
governor
and
in
some
cases
federal
troops
ordered
by
the
president
n
to
avoid
a
military
commitment
perhaps
many
times
the
scale
of
vietnam
it
would
be
necessary
to
permanently
bolster
the
scale
and
military
capacity
of
local
police
while
counterbalancing
the
dangerous
population
through
aggressive
use
of
arrest
and
imprisonment
n
as
much
as
this
is
a
book
about
mass
incarceration
it
is
also
a
book
about
policing
and
particularly
the
way
that
expanding
policing
in
the
s
and
s
paved
the
road
to
a
larger
prison
population
in
the
s
and
s
it
is
essential
that
we
link
mass
incarceration
to
the
kind
of
aggressive
preemptive
policing
that
has
been
a
major
product
of
the
war
on
crime
and
that
forms
the
core
of
what
today
is
becoming
intolerable
to
many
americans
about
our
carceral
state
johnson
and
nixon
shared
an
obsession
with
growing
and
transforming
american
police
forces
which
both
presidents
saw
as
the
frontline
troops
who
could
contain
the
crime
threat
of
alienated
black
youth
n
in
addition
to
expanding
the
size
of
police
forces
and
giving
them
the
kind
of
military
equipment
necessary
for
fighting
vietnam
like
counterinsurgency
wars
n
the
war
on
crime
early
on
embraced
a
transformation
of
policing
toward
preemptive
confrontation
with
the
enemy
an
enemy
increasingly
defined
as
all
black
young
men
in
segregated
neighborhoods
of
concentrated
poverty
the
enormous
influence
of
george
kelling
and
james
q
wilson
s
broken
windows
article
has
led
to
the
association
of
this
kind
of
policing
with
that
decade
and
since
n
but
hinton
draws
direct
lines
from
the
johnson
nixon
war
on
crime
centers
in
the
justice
department
to
this
new
model
n
it
is
from
these
origins
in
the
intersection
between
the
war
on
poverty
and
the
war
on
crime
that
the
new
policing
received
its
indelible
ambiguity
as
to
whether
it
is
about
policing
that
is
responsive
to
minority
communities
community
policing
problem
centered
policing
n
or
whether
it
is
about
policing
that
is
responsive
to
technocratically
set
management
objectives
compstat
predictive
policing
hotspots
policing
n
it
has
always
been
both
but
with
the
heaviest
commitment
to
the
latter
this
new
policing
model
largely
superseded
a
model
that
had
just
recently
been
invented
under
the
modernizing
influence
of
two
influential
chiefs
that
typified
midcentury
commitments
to
professionalization
of
policing
william
parker
of
los
angeles
and
o
w
wilson
of
chicago
and
based
on
more
efficient
and
rational
management
of
car
based
patrols
n
this
approach
was
intended
to
increase
response
time
and
recapture
discretionary
hours
left
to
police
conduct
in
area
based
patrols
even
if
it
did
not
do
much
to
reduce
crime
by
increasing
arrests
motorized
patrol
in
time
might
have
had
a
good
influence
on
police
racism
and
violence
against
people
of
color
since
it
subjected
police
to
the
centralized
controls
of
dispatchers
n
instead
the
new
imperatives
of
the
war
on
crime
made
what
had
seemed
modern
outmoded
and
allowed
a
radically
transformed
version
of
the
old
time
foot
patrol
model
to
return
in
the
form
of
a
deeply
hostile
sort
of
counterinsurgency
policing
n
some
of
hinton
s
best
work
is
tracing
ideals
forged
in
washington
to
their
implementation
in
places
like
detroit
los
angeles
and
other
large
cities
experiencing
the
dislocations
of
deindustrialization
and
middle
class
suburbanization
even
as
the
great
migration
continued
to
bring
blacks
from
the
south
to
cities
in
the
midwest
and
west
n
some
of
these
programs
funded
by
the
law
enforcement
assistance
administration
leaa
and
based
on
this
preemptive
model
like
detroit
s
stress
program
for
stop
the
robberies
enjoy
safe
streets
and
los
angeles
crash
for
community
resources
against
street
hoodlums
and
the
federal
government
s
office
of
drug
abuse
law
enforcement
odale
have
been
discussed
by
previous
studies
of
the
crime
war
n
but
never
with
as
much
detail
and
connection
between
model
and
outcome
in
retrospect
the
contradictions
of
these
programs
were
hiding
in
the
plain
sight
of
their
acronyms
who
was
supposed
to
enjoy
the
safe
streets
produced
by
stress
certainly
not
the
young
men
of
color
who
were
confronted
humiliated
and
sometimes
killed
outright
the
community
whose
resources
would
be
used
to
attack
street
hoodlums
obviously
did
not
include
young
black
men
living
in
segregated
neighborhoods
of
concentrated
poverty
if
police
were
the
foot
soldiers
of
america
s
parallel
vietnam
then
young
black
men
living
in
segregated
neighborhoods
of
concentrated
poverty
were
the
viet
cong
the
enemy
the
question
of
how
many
of
them
were
hardcore
combatants
whose
security
could
only
be
achieved
through
death
or
incapacitation
and
how
many
of
them
were
alienated
youths
who
could
be
nudged
back
into
channels
of
social
integration
created
a
space
for
some
contestation
within
the
overall
war
on
crime
paradigm
but
the
consensus
was
clear
on
the
question
of
dangerousness
of
this
population
and
agreed
that
this
danger
lay
in
the
traits
low
income
urban
youth
had
as
a
population
and
not
in
their
individual
characteristics
n
in
the
johnson
administration
youth
service
bureaus
were
imagined
to
be
institutional
substitutes
for
parents
where
police
officers
could
help
replace
the
lost
normative
force
of
proper
two
parent
households
n
by
the
ford
administration
the
focus
would
be
more
on
targeting
hard
core
youth
offenders
for
permanent
incapacitation
through
federal
prosecution
and
long
term
imprisonment
n
yet
throughout
liberals
and
conservatives
agreed
that
this
population
and
public
safety
would
be
best
served
through
exposure
to
ever
greater
treatments
of
aggressive
policing
n
the
chapters
on
the
ford
and
carter
administrations
were
some
of
the
most
rewarding
for
this
author
i
had
naively
suggested
in
my
own
study
of
the
war
on
crime
that
these
post
watergate
years
saw
some
relaxation
on
the
grip
of
battling
crime
by
the
american
presidency
and
its
pentagon
like
department
of
justice
n
in
fact
both
accelerated
the
war
on
crime
even
while
seeking
to
bring
a
more
technocratic
and
less
ideological
tone
to
it
consistent
with
both
trends
the
ford
administration
sought
to
increase
the
focus
on
particularly
dangerous
persons
supposed
career
criminals
or
at
least
those
with
a
long
record
of
being
arrested
for
crimes
or
gang
members
that
offered
the
prospect
of
a
more
efficient
war
on
crime
although
this
focus
was
mostly
added
on
to
existing
criminalization
marking
perhaps
the
beginning
of
the
new
penology
as
feeley
and
i
described
the
trend
toward
risk
rationalization
inside
the
carceral
state
n
hinton
s
story
of
the
path
toward
mass
incarceration
is
so
bleak
and
so
determined
that
it
is
difficult
to
notice
that
she
also
points
frequently
to
the
paths
not
taken
and
now
long
covered
by
the
success
of
mass
incarceration
as
a
project
n
the
kerner
commission
appointed
by
president
johnson
after
the
detroit
and
newark
riots
in
described
the
emerging
war
on
crime
as
heading
toward
a
spiral
of
segregation
violence
and
police
force
suggesting
that
only
a
substantial
effort
to
break
the
back
of
urban
segregation
could
escape
that
cycle
n
inside
the
segregated
neighborhoods
of
concentrated
poverty
activists
like
the
black
panthers
proposed
their
own
versions
of
antipoverty
and
crime
programs
n
either
of
these
projects
might
have
had
just
as
much
success
against
crime
and
collective
violence
as
the
war
on
crime
which
had
very
little
while
having
the
great
benefit
of
not
leading
us
inexorably
toward
mass
incarceration
in
retrospect
it
seems
difficult
to
believe
that
any
of
these
projects
could
have
moved
fast
enough
to
head
off
the
urban
riots
of
the
late
s
which
were
anchored
in
the
increasingly
violent
attacks
of
racist
big
city
police
forces
against
black
communities
a
violence
anchored
in
turn
in
police
resistance
to
changing
social
norms
brought
on
by
the
rise
of
the
civil
rights
movement
this
is
especially
true
when
you
consider
how
much
federal
policy
outside
the
crime
arena
was
altering
the
fate
of
the
great
cities
these
policies
including
promoting
the
movement
of
the
middle
class
to
segregated
all
white
suburbs
carving
freeways
through
dense
urban
corridors
to
facilitate
suburbanization
and
interstate
markets
the
deindustrialization
of
the
major
northern
cities
facilitated
by
that
subsidized
transportation
network
and
the
antiunion
tilt
of
federal
labor
law
after
the
s
left
central
cities
in
a
precarious
state
on
the
eve
of
the
s
n
the
emerging
post
modern
city
was
an
awkward
balance
between
fortified
central
business
districts
dependent
on
freeways
and
suburban
shoppers
and
segregated
neighborhoods
of
concentrated
poverty
places
inherently
susceptible
to
crime
and
difficult
to
police
based
on
traditional
foot
patrol
or
modern
car
patrol
linked
to
dispatch
methods
n
hinton
adopts
a
thoroughly
and
justifiably
skeptical
view
of
crime
statistics
in
this
period
convinced
crime
was
rising
rapidly
especially
in
the
large
cities
national
leaders
made
improving
the
collection
of
crime
reports
a
major
priority
for
improving
the
police
of
course
this
led
to
rises
sometimes
substantial
rises
in
reported
crime
rates
precisely
the
outcome
that
was
driving
fear
of
crime
n
the
war
on
crime
contributed
to
crime
in
even
more
insidious
ways
such
as
effect
that
aggressive
decoy
operations
made
on
the
homicide
rate
in
cities
like
detroit
n
yet
what
we
know
today
about
the
environmental
and
situational
roots
of
crime
suggests
serious
crime
probably
did
go
up
significantly
in
segregated
neighborhoods
of
concentrated
poverty
during
the
s
and
s
as
criminogenic
conditions
met
a
policing
strategy
that
was
uncertain
and
shifting
and
implemented
by
a
policing
work
force
that
at
that
time
in
history
was
undeniably
dominated
by
straight
up
racists
n
while
hinton
s
approach
is
the
right
one
for
a
history
of
state
power
we
still
lack
a
proper
history
of
the
war
on
crime
from
the
popular
perspective
the
wave
of
urban
histories
of
the
post
war
period
has
given
us
a
clear
view
of
the
disarray
created
even
before
reported
crime
rates
began
to
go
up
n
hinton
has
given
us
a
newly
precise
picture
of
how
washington
based
planners
saw
their
objectives
and
obstacles
from
the
pentagon
of
the
war
on
crime
we
next
need
new
histories
of

forces

their

of
a
wave
of
mass

hinton
s
study
of
the
war
on
crime
comes
several
years
after
a
widely
discussed
special
issue
of
the
journal
of

to
the

state

published
in
august
of
n
all
of
these
differ
from
earlier
histories
of
particular
prisons
or
even
state
prison
systems
because
they
make
mass
incarceration
as
such
the
subject
and
attempt
to
increase
our
understanding
of
both
the
causal
mechanisms
that
triggered
and
sustained
it
and
the
lost
possibilities
for
a
different
present
covered
over
by
the
success
of
mass

hinton
s
study
exemplifies
many
features
that
are
crucial
to
doing
the
history
of
broad
governmental
programs
like
the
war
on
crime
that
can
get
lost
between
the
appeals
of
social
history
on
the
one
hand
and
more
traditional
history
of
legislation
on
the
other
a
the
importance
of
ideas
and
specific
intellectuals
ideas
and
the
academic
entrepreneurs
behind
them
matter
greatly
in
hinton
s
analysis
looming
especially
large
is
the
trio
of
james
q
wilson
edward
banfield
and
daniel
moynihan
the
first
two
were
political
scientists
banfield
was
wilson
s
doctoral
supervisor
n
both
interested
primarily
in
race
and
the
governance
of
the
post
war
cities
especially
in
policing
banfield
is
best
remembered
for
his
sulfurous
but
fascinating
portrait
of
the
contradictions
underlying
urban
social
policy
in
the
s
n
wilson
the
student
would
be
much
more
important
to
the
actual
policy
stream
promoting
the
idea
that
a
modest
but
significant
increase
in
the
actual
use
and
length
of
imprisonment
could
substantially
reduce
then
rising
rates
of
reported
crime
and
later
the
idea
of
broken
windows
policing
n
later
still
in
the
s
wilson
promoted
racialized
ideas
about
what
had
driven
the
high
reported
crime
rates
of
the
late
s
n
and
in
the
work
of
one
of
his
students
john
dilulio
promoted
the
most
ideological
of
all
the
war
on
crime
constructions
the
super
predators
juveniles
who
were
brought
up
in
the
female
headed
homes
common
in
segregated
neighborhoods
of
concentrated
poverty
n
moynihan
a
sociologist
who
would
become
a
central
domestic
policy
advisor
to
both
the
johnson
and
nixon
administrations
and
eventually
a
long
serving
u
s
senator
from
new
york
authored
the
famous
internal
memo
known
as
the
moynihan
report
which
blamed
high
crime
levels
on
long
term
damage
done
to
the
black
family
structure
by
slavery
and
its
aftermaths
n
while
somewhat
different
in
their
specific
projects
wilson
and
moynihan
shared
a
common
focus
on
the
black
family
and
what
moynihan
called
the
tangle
of
pathology
that
tied
blacks
living
in
segregated
neighborhoods
of
concentrated
poverty
to
crime
n
hinton
argues
that
the
common
policy
conclusion
was
an
ever
tightening
noose
of
policing
and
prison
around
the
necks
of
young
black
males
living
in
these
pathology
tangled
neighborhoods
n
hinton
s
thorough
exploration
of
the
intellectual
grounds
of
the
war
on
crime
highlights
many
other
significant
social
science
interventions
not
all
of
them
as
intentionally
oriented
toward
enhancing
the
scale
of
the
carceral
state
as
the
previous
three
wilson
moynihan
and
dilulio
in
the
early
days
of
what
became
the
war
on
poverty
the
work
of
sociologists
lloyd
ohlin
and
richard
cloward
promoted
the
idea
of
direct
interventions
aimed
at
reversing
the
social
and
economic
isolation
that
channeled
youth
in
segregated
neighborhoods
of
concentrated
poverty
toward
crime
n
while
not
aimed
at
promoting
law
enforcement
strategies
the
underlying
theory
that
conditions
associated
with
black
segregated
neighborhoods
were
criminogenic
underscored
the
potential
threat
if
antipoverty
approaches
failed
hinton
persuasively
suggests
that
there
was
little
to
prevent
this
logic
from
supporting
a
police
first
approach
to
controlling
poverty
based
crime
n
one
of
the
most
important
and
under
recognized
social
scientists
that
hinton
covers
here
was
the
late
marvin
wolfgang
of
the
university
of
pennsylvania
whose
ideas
have
not
been
nearly
as
controversial
as
wilson
s
but
pointed
toward
the
same
racial
strategy
and
whose
statistical
studies
of
the
distribution
of
arrests
among
a
cohort
of
philadelphia
boys
born
in
the
baby
boomers
helped
to
crystalize
the
threat
posed
by
black
youth
n
wolfgang
s
headline
finding
that
a
small
percentage
of
the
youth
accounted
for
more
than
half
the
total
arrests
in
the
cohort
has
shaped
many
dreams
since
of
targeting
imprisonment
on
a
group
of
career
criminals
high
rate
offenders
or
super
predators
n
wolfgang
s
research
and
its
reception
crystalizes
many
of
hinton
s
themes
his
funding
was
coming
from
the
war
on
crime
and
his
uncritical
reliance
on
police
arrests
allowed
the
filter
of
police
selection
and
distribution
to
shape
who
the
dangerous
high
rate
persistent
youth
would
be
black
males
from
segregated
neighborhoods
of
concentrated
poverty
n
hinton
highlights
some
moments
when
social
science
offered
truth
telling
that
might
have
provided
reasons
to
resist
the
embrace
of
mass
incarceration
most
notable
are
two
policy
experts
who
combined
law
and
criminology
an
interdisciplinarity
rare
at
that
time
and
now
james
vorenberg
n
of
harvard
law
school
and
frank
zimring
n
then
of
chicago
and
more
recently
of
u
c
berkeley
both
criticized
efforts
at
prediction
and
preemption
as
misbegotten
and
likely
to
reinforce
patterns
of
racial
disadvantage
while
both
were
funded
by
war
on
crime
research
funds
their
policy
warnings
were
largely
ignored
n
of
course
the
ideas
that
triumphed
turned
out
to
be
highly
productive
precisely
because
they
promoted
forms
of
governmental
action
against
the
crime
threat
as
it
was
coming
to
be
politically
defined
without
creating
the
direct
public
strategy
on
the
economic
and
social
isolation
of
these
communities
that
the
kerner
commission
called
for
in
its
enrichment
strategy
n
yet
it
would
be
a
mistake
to
see
these
intellectual
interventions
as
serving
simply
an
ideological
purpose
of
providing
a
patina
of
social
science
respectability
to
a
control
agenda
forged
on
other
ground
and
by
other
strategists
although
some
examples
like
the
super
predator
concept
that
emerged
from
wilson
s
thought
via
dilulio
clearly
fit
an
ideological
role
these
intellectual
interventions
were
politically
effective
because
they
offered
anticrime
strategies
that
provided
real
objectives
for
federal
investments
to
shape
local
policing
and
imprisonment
strategies
around
in
that
sense
social
scientists
in
the
war
on
crime
are
examples
of
what
michel
foucault
called
specific
intellectuals
in
contrast
to
the
universal
intellectual
whose
broad
ideas
reshape
fundamental
principles

of
foucault
s
memorable
examples
n
use
their
theoretical
knowledge
to
forge
practical
projects
around
which
governmental
capacities
can
be
concentrated
like
the
manhattan
project
n
while
based
on
a
shockingly
thin
empirical
basis
the
winning
ideas
behind
the
war
on
crime
created
practical
linkages
between
the
crime
threat
and
ways
of
redeploying
and
expanding
existing
governmental
capacities
policing
and
incarceration
n
viewed
as
a
legal
phenomenon
law
breaking

on

is
an
impossible
metaphor
to
realize

as
a
sociological
phenomenon
black

in

neighborhoods
of
concentrated

a
war
on
crime
was
all
too
practical
b
technologies
of
carceral
power
another
strength
of
hinton
s
historiographical
strategy
is
its
description
of
the
way
administrative
policies
and
legal
amendments
created
new
and
unprecedented
governmental
capacities
to
surveil
and
incarcerate
citizens
two
of
the
most
important
were
stop
and
frisk
policing
and
mandatory
minimum
sentences
n
the
first
was
a
modification
of
the
motorized
patrol
approach
to
policing
that
was
being
promoted
as
a
modern
bureaucratic
alternative
to
the
old
foot
patrol
policing
when
the
war
on
crime
began
now
instead
of
responding
to
dispatched
calls
for
assistance
police
in
cars
or
on
foot
would
use
their
own
authority
to
engage
individuals
that
they
suspected
of
being
involved
in
crime
generally
on
starkly
racial
grounds
n
along
with
even
more
aggressive
methods
like
the
use
of
undercover
police
as
decoys
the
new
methods
decoupled
convictions
and
thus
potential
imprisonments
from
the
responses
of
ordinary
residents
and
produced
a
flow
of
potential
prisoners
far
larger
than
could
be
produced
by
solving
the
kinds
of
serious
crimes
people
report
to
the
police
the
supreme
court
removed
any
potential
legal
impediments
through
its
decisions
upholding
virtually
complete
police
discretion
to
use
any
kind
of
criminal
violation
as
the
basis
for
their
stops
removing
any
potential
judicial
check
on
aggressive
police
use
of
this
power
n
mandatory
minimums
an
idea
developed
in
the
first
nixon
crime
bills
n
expanded
in
the
reagan
years
and
heavily
promoted
to
the
states
n
distorted
the
whole
structure
of
sentencing
upward
in
many
instances
they
were
built
into
complex
matrix
systems
fixing
a
sentencing
range
based
on
crime
level
and
criminal
history
score
these
systems
were
designed
originally
to
assure
horizontal
equity
among
individuals
but
now
incorporated
extreme
punishments
with
no
judicial
discretion
to
respond
to
significant
individual
differences
as
hinton
notes
a
certain
kind
of
color
blind
antidiscrimination
principle
had
become
a
core
part
of
the
national
canon
in
the
s
and
mandatory
sentences
could
be
seen
as
protecting
individuals
from
disparate
judicial
treatment
due
to
race
although
it
did
nothing
to
control
prosecutorial
selection
n
c
resistance
hinton
s
story
although
anchored
in
the
strategies
of
the
federal
government
does
not
ignore
the
role
of
resistance
we
have
already
discussed
her
focus
on
urban
uprisings
as
even
more
than
any
perceived
rise
in
individual
violent
crimes
helping
to
define
the
war
on
crime
n
most
of
the
riots
began
as
collective
protest
action
against
the
existing
indignities
imposed
by
the
policing
of
the
s
generally
triggered
by
an
in
itself
not
extraordinary
attempt
to
exercise
police
arrest
powers
n
the
result
was
a
further
strengthening
of
the
most
offensive
elements
of
that
policing
model
political
activists
within
the
black
community
like
the
black
panthers
tried
to
discipline
resistance
to
police
violence
into
sustainable
legal
practices
but
were
met
with
criminalization
and
sometimes
murder
n
they
also
offered
alternative
security
proposals
for
segregated
neighborhoods
of
concentrated
poverty
that
did
not
rely
on
enhanced
policing
but
instead
on
community
organization
n
these
stories
of
resistance
long
covered
over
by
the
success
of
the
mass
incarceration
project
are
important
to
recover
as
we
consider
what
should
succeed
it
the
black
panthers
appeal
to
create
popular
patrols
to
protect
black
neighborhoods
from
both
crime
and
police
may
have
new
relevance
as
we
consider
the
paradox
that
despite
extraordinary
levels
of
public
spending
on
police
most
homicides
go
unsolved
in
segregated
neighborhoods
of
concentrated
poverty
iii
ending
mass
incarceration
hinton
s
account
is
both
sobering
and
inspiring
for
those
of
us
who
want
to
see
the
current
interest
in
criminal
justice
reform
achieve
enough
momentum
to
undo
the
tremendous
changes
in
the
american
carceral
state
wrought
by
the
war
on
crime
era
her
comprehensive
account
of
the
now
forgotten
first
half
of
the
war
on
crime
the
clinton
era
would
add
another
layer
including
more
urban
police
n
raises
serious
questions
about
whether
many
of
the
most
popular
reform
approaches
can
truly
break
with
the
past
yet
in
capturing
the
criminological
climate
of
the
mid
s
with
some
nuance
hinton
reminds
us
that
significant
reductions
in
the
use
of
imprisonment
and
the
need
for
major
reforms
of
policing
both
seemed
possible
even
urgent
on
the
eve
of
the
war
on
crime
despite
rising
crime
rates
a
evidence
based
law
enforcement
one
of
the
most
resonant
themes
in
criminal
justice
reform
today
is
refocusing
policing
and
incarceration
based
on
empirically
tested
strategies
n
in
part
the
emphasis
on
recidivism
and
how
to
reduce
it
is
a
counterbalance
to
the
extremism
of
the
s
when
laws
like
california
s
three
strikes
gave
prosecutors
largely
unaccountable
discretion
to
decide
when
to
use
life
sentences
n
but
establishing
empirical
evidence
for
effective
policing
and
rehabilitative
programs
was
also
a
major
goal
of
federal
funding
during
the
first
half
of
the
war
on
crime
n
this
wave
of
research
tended
to
reproduce
the
patterns
established
by
police
and
prosecutorial
discretion
in
the
form
of
arrest
and
conviction
statistics
and
to
undermine
hopes
for
alternatives
like
rehabilitation
n
an
important
component
of
these
evidence
based
strategies
is
their
focus
on
statistical
risk
assessment
in
the
face
of
chronic
overcrowding
in
many
of
the
nation
s
prison
systems
including
the
federal
system
and
jails
actuarial
risk
assessment
is
being
reexamined
with
enthusiasm
by
reformers
as
a
way
to
reduce
incarcerated
populations
while
rationalizing
a
system
that
from
the
pretrial
phase
to
the
distribution
of
lengthy
prison
sentence
enhancements
has
little
rational
relationship
to
risk
n
the
revival
of
what
malcolm
feeley
and
i
called
the
new
penology
is
another
sign
of
how
deeply
the
legitimacy
of
the
u
s
carceral
state
has
been
shaken
n
yet
as
hinton
s
history
reminds
us
this
refocusing
of
law
enforcement
and
custody
on
high
risk
categories
of
people
who
can
reliably
be
identified
using
ready
at
hand
bureaucratic
information
is
the
repetition
of
a
theme
that
has
run
throughout
the
war
on
crime
period
that
of
beating
crime
by
incapacitating
its
most
active
participants
repeatedly
and
despite
relying
on
somewhat
different
theories
and
methods
this
search
for
the
dangerous
has
always
rediscovered
the
priority
of
maintaining
surveillance
and
control
over
young
black
people
especially
men
living
in
segregated
neighborhoods
of
concentrated
poverty
there
is
every
reason
to
fear
that
renewed
actuarialism
would
rediscover
the
same
priorities
after
all
as
hinton
argues
throughout
the
intensification
of
policing
of
these
suspect
classes
in
these
neighborhoods
has
produced
in
criminal
records
a
knowledge
foundation
for
an
enduring
indeed
inescapable
racial
profile
n
b
war
on
violence
another
way
that
reformers
are
seeking
to
save
the
carceral
state
from
its
current
legitimacy
crisis
by
rationalizing
it
is
by
refocusing
the
war
on
crime
to
violence
by
abandoning
the
war
on
drugs
which
was
a
diversion
n
in
fact
the
system
has
steadily
been
deemphasizing
the
war
on
drugs
since
the
end
of
the
s
although
as
a
legal
matter
it
remains
fully
in
place
and
weaponized
n
and
our
long
experiment
in
incentivizing
policing
drug
seizures
almost
certainly
was
a
diversion
from
solving
serious
and
violent
crimes
not
to
mention
alienating
most
of
the
community
members
whose
cooperation
would
be
necessary
to
solve
those
crimes
yet
as
hinton
s
account
deftly
shows
the
war
on
drugs
was
always
bound
up
with
the
same
racialized
construction
of
the
serious
crime
problem
that
has
been
growing
in
political
and
scientific
authority
since
the
kennedy
administration
n
the
war
on
drugs
was
always
rationalized
as
a
way
to
harness
federal
funds
and
legal
authority
to
go
after
local
persons
that
were
believed
to
be
involved
in
serious
and
violent
crime
n
as
defenders
of
broken
windows
policing
continue
to
argue
even
now
aggressive
policing
against
drugs
and
other
low
level
crimes
can
provide
a
lever
on
serious
crime
through
various
theoretical
mechanisms
of
deterrence
and
incapacitation
n
moreover
a
refocusing
on
violent
crime
is
almost
certain
to
retain
the
racialized
concentration
of
policing
and
the
racial
makeup
of
the
carceral
population
while
naturalizing
a
punitive
sentencing
structure
that
makes
little
sense
in
terms
of
penological
objectives
c
supervision
the
very
disrepute
that
incarceration
especially
imprisonment
now
endures
is
such
that
a
tempting
pathway
of
reform
is
to
substitute
forms
of
carceral
supervision
over
people
convicted
or
convictable
of
crimes
as
an
alternative
to
incarceration
historically
probation
as
an
alternative
or
sequel
to
jail
or
as
a
substitute
for
imprisonment
when
it
follows
prison
carceral
supervision
it
is
often
known
as
parole
but
terminology
differs
from
state
to
state
has
meant
being
subject
to
special
conditions
more
or
less
active
supervision
by
a
correctional
agent
and
the
possibility
of
deeper
sanctioning
including
incarceration
based
on
a
summary
administrative
procedure
n
it
has
often
been
associated
with
efforts
to
help
those
being
supervised
achieve
a
sustainable
crime
free
life
in
the
community
but
with
deeply
inadequate
resources
to
make
a
credible
job
of
that
n
politically
shifting
from
incarceration
to
supervision
avoids
crossing
the
potential
red
line
of
declaring
these
highly
criminalized
people
no
longer
a
presumptive
menace
to
society
and
therein
lies
its
true
failing
as
a
solution
to
the
present
crisis
as
hinton
shows
carceral
supervision
either
by
police
or
probation
or
the
whole
of
what
victor
rios
calls
the
youth
control
complex
n
has
been
the
overarching
goal
of
the
federal
government
s
war
on
crime
n
these
methods
go
back
to
the
progressive
era
when
they
were
imagined
as
a
necessary
extension
of
social
control
over
immigrants
and
minority
citizens
whose
capacity
for
self
government
was
doubted
by
the
scientific
racism
then
part
of
the
dominant
intellectual
framework
of
state
power
n
the
war
on
crime
brought
the
federal
government
and
its
financing
and
expertise
into
expanding
this
sector
the
emphasis
on
incarceration
was
a
distinct
part
of
this
overall
strategy
a
shift
back
to
greater
reliance
on
supervision
may
save
the
system
some
money
and
avoid
some
of
the
inhumanity
brought
on
by
overcrowding
of
prisons
but
it
leaves
whole
communities
in
daily
exposure
to
degrading
treatment
by
the
carceral
state
almost
anyone
living
in
a
segregated
neighborhood
of
concentrated
poverty
is
exposed
to
having
their
home
searched
or
car
stopped
because
they
are
or
are
near
someone
under
correctional
supervision
carceral
supervision
also
remains
a
major
pathway
to
incarceration
d
abolition
if
recovering
the
fuller
history
of
the
war
on
crime
requires
us
to
abandon
some
of
the
narrowest
understandings
of
mass
incarceration
and
therefore
question
the
adequacy
of
some
of
the
politically
easiest
approaches
to
reforming
the
american
carceral
state
it
also
invites
us
to
consider
whether
a
far
more
substantial
departure
might
be
possible
as
hinton
shows
the
consensus
within
the
carceral
state
and
its
related
fields
of
expertise
on
the
eve
of
the
war
on
crime
was
for
substantial
shifts
in
the
dominant
twentieth
century
models
of
carceral
control
n
urban
police
professionalization
oriented
police
executives
imagined
a
new
more
modern
and
organizational
model
of
policing
built
around
the
automobile
and
radio
dispatch
by
pulling
police
out
of
their
embedded
positions
in
neighborhood
precincts
the
new
approach
promoted
in
los
angeles
and
chicago
sought
to
shorten
response
times
and
arrest
more
suspects
in
action
rather
than
waiting
for
victims
to
discover
crimes
often
hours
after
the
events
n
this
model
also
was
used
to
break
up
an
older
model
based
on
local
police
stations
and
foot
based
patrols
that
was
long
associated
with
both
corruption
and
racial
arbitrariness
n
it
was
also
promoted
as
capable
of
deterring
crime
through
shortening
response
times
and
increasing
the
chances
of
police
observing
a
crime
in
progress
n
by
the
s
it
would
be
framed
as
the
failed
old
order
against
which
a
neotraditionalist
model
of
problem
oriented
community
policing
was
posed
as
an
answer
n
in
retrospect
this
reform
view
appears
to
have
overstated
the
degree
to
which
this
model
was
ever
fully
implemented
or
tested
and
understated
how
much
it
was
overtaken
by
a
war
on
crime
that
promoted
more
aggressive
neighborhood
policing
that
could
be
disguised
as
community
policing
going
forward
we
could
do
worse
things
than
reinvent
mid
twentieth
century
efforts
to
make
police
truly
modern
and
bureaucratic
as
an
organization
policing
never
has
been
made
fully
bureaucratic
in
the
weberian
sense
of
being
subject
to
rules
and
accountability
as
police
shootings
in
questionable
circumstances
n
and
continuing
scandals
around
homophobic
and
racist
text
messages
in
san
francisco
exemplify
n
returning
police
to
a
more
responsive
role
and
using
technologies
to
break
up
racialized
presumptions
that
shape
law
enforcement
through
forms
of
randomization
might
provide
at
least
a
valuable
interim
approach
to
breaking
the
hold
of
racial
profiling
on
contemporary
policing
conclusion
observers
frequently
mistake
the
policies
of
the
federal
government
as
the
story
of
government
in
our
nation
this
is
especially
true
of
criminal
law
and
punishment
where
government
is
particularly
inapt
the
vast
majority
of
prisoners
are
under
state
custody
and
the
laws
and
policies
that
imprisoned
them
are
the
products
of
state
legislatures
county
prosecutors
and
local
police
indeed
it
takes
a
concerted
multifront
campaign
for
the
federal
government
to
influence
let
alone
transform
something
as
intrinsically
state
and
local
as
the
american
carceral
state
elizabeth
hinton
s
from
the
war
on
poverty
to
the
war
on
crime
the
making
of
mass
incarceration
provides
a
far
more
detailed
account
and
strong
interpretation
of
the
extraordinary
campaign
led
by
a
series
of
presidential
administrations
of
both
parties
and
importantly
championed
by
the
presidents
themselves
and
their
attorneys
general
this
project
of
reversing
the
presumptive
rise
in
crime
especially
in
american
cities
seemed
unlikely
from
the
start
given
that
the
kinds
of
crimes
receiving
political
attention
robberies
burglaries
and
homicides
are
among
the
most
local
of
activities
and
as
noted
completely
under
local
authorities
to
recognize
or
not
and
respond
to
although
this
project
never
succeeded
by
its
own
terms
in
reducing
crime
rates
which
didn
t
begin
to
fall
significantly
until
the
mid
s
and
then
appeared
unrelated
to
war
on
crime
innovations
it
did
work
to
transform
the
american
carceral
state
into
the
punitive
juggernaut
it
had
become
by
the
turn
of
the
twentieth
century
and
largely
remains
that
it
worked
is
a
triumph
of
soft
power
in
the
interest
of
hard
power
the
power
of
incentives
ideas
and
identities
to
drive
a
vast
investment
of
state
and
local
dollars
in
prisons
and
the
infrastructure
of
criminal
courts
necessary
to
keep
them
filled
the
first
step
in
this
one
taken
early
in
the
johnson
administration
was
to
make
police
officers
the
key
recruiters
for
participants
in
the
federal
government
s
effort
to
pacify
the
big
cities
ahead
of
multiple
uprisings
or
even
a
sustained
insurgency
n
with
federal
funds
supporting
the
hiring
of
more
police
officers
and
providing
more
hardware
for
them
to
use
to
suppress
rioting
and
arrest
criminal
suspects
the
scale
of
urban
policing
expanded
enormously
in
the
decade
between
the
mid
s
and
mid
s
this
happened
despite
grave
concerns
within
the
federal
government
itself
about
the
incompetence
and
racism
of
local
police
forces
and
with
no
substantial
commitment
to
reform
them
under
nixon
this
criminalization
wave
was
reinforced
and
the
goal
of
turning
those
arrests
into
successful
prosecutions
and
convictions
and
imposing
longer
prison
sentences
was
firmly
established
as
best
practice
n
by
the
time
ford
took
over
from
nixon
after
the
latter
s
own
conduct
became
subject
to
criminal
accusations
and
the
likelihood
of
impeachment
increased
mass
incarceration
as
a
project
was
already
fully
weaponized
and
ready
to
go
firmly
embraced
by
both
parties
with
a
few
issues
like
the
death
penalty
subject
to
party
debate
by
the
time
presidents
reagan
and
george
h
w
bush
renewed
the
war
on
drugs
brand
and
tied
it
to
the
new
folk
devils
of
urban
decline
crack
cocaine
dealers
and
users
prison
populations
in
the
states
were
rising
rapidly
and
the
core
focus
on
youth
of
color
in
segregated
neighborhoods
of
concentrated
poverty
was
firmly
established
n
the
reagan
bush
rhetoric
made
it
easy
for
contemporaneous
observers
to
blame
the
increasingly
visible
problem
of
prison
population
growth
on
right
wing
politics
and
its
obsession
with
the
dangers
and
moral
impurities
of
drugs
hinton
s
meticulous
recovery
of
the
first
phase
of
the
war
on
crime
arrives
at
a
perfect
time
to
help
ground
the
debate
about
future
criminal
justice
reform
many
of
the
most
promising
and
politically
popular
reforms
involve
rolling
back
the
war
on
drugs
that
reagan
and
bush
branded
and
which
president
clinton
sustained
with
his
eager
expansion
of
the
police
force
n
many
of
these
proposals
if
implemented
more
fully
would
move
us
back
toward
the
war
on
crime
strategies
of
the
ford
and
carter
years
that
might
remove
the
most
discredited
and
indefensible
features
of
mass
incarceration
but
it
would
leave
the
basic
political
project
of
governing
american
cities
through
the
surveillance
and
carceral
control
of
the
potential

of
black
and

to

about

in

how
has

and
how

predictive

has
been
used
in
california
to
identify
crime
hotspots
where
serious
crime
is
more
likely
to
occur
for
example
there
s
the
broken

effect
where
areas
of
the
city
that
are
not
looked

are

these

but
we

powerful
models
we
can
start
to

not

where
but
when
and
what
type
of
crime
is
likely

we
also
need
to
quantify
the
amount
of
uncertainty
in
any
of
these
predictions
so
that
police
and
policymakers
can
take
these
into
account
when
deciding
whether
to
allocate
resources
based
on
them
where
the
uncertainty
is
high
they
might
want
to
rely
more
on
their
previous
experience
and
knowledge
of
the
situation
who
are
you
working
with
on
this
project
we

the
universities
of
oxford
manchester

strathclyde
along
with
the
met
west
midlands
scotland
and
new

police
forces
we
also
have
on
board
software
companies
and
the
home
office
who
are
very
interested
in
issues
related
to
crime
and
security
once
we
have
some
software
to
trial
we
hope
to
deploy
prototypes
this
is
why
we
have
a
range
of
collaborating
police
forces
to
cover
the
uk
these
police
forces
came
to
us
the
police
forces
across
the
country
are
looking
at
efficiencies
in
operations
so
this
work
is
very
important
it
s
a
great
opportunity
to
do
some
fantastic
maths
but
also
to
roll
it
out
and
have
impact
on
uk
policing
it
sounds
like
a
great
tool
but
are
there
potential
pitfalls
to
predictive
policing
there
are
certainly
ethical
issues
to
take
into
account
for
example
some
police
forces
would
like
to
be
able
to
predict
who
might
become
a
serial
offender
and
make
an
intervention
at
an
early
stage
to
change
the
path
followed
the
ethical
issues
are
really
huge
there
should
we
even
be
thinking
about
such
interventions
the
alan
turing
institute
have
established
a
data
ethics
group
so
we
ve
set
up
an
initiative
with
them
and
west
midlands
police
to
actually
look
at
these
particular
issues
there
are
also
cultural
differences
for
example
between
the
us
and
the
uk
that
need
to
be
taken
into
account
when
predicting
crime
we
can
t
just
be
mathematicians
working
on
theorems
and
proofs
we
ve
brought
in
psychologists
and
social
scientists
specifically
so
that
we
understand
what
psychological
processes
are
at
play
what
we
re
hoping
to
do
is
have
that
inform
the
models
that
we
build
i
guess
if
we
were
working
in
some
totalitarian
state
we
wouldn
t
be
worried
about
the
ethics
of
using
data
to
profile
people
as
to
whether
they
were
going
to
be
serial
criminals
or
not
thankfully
we
don
t
and
therefore
this
is
a
much
more
constrained
issue
and
we
really
need
to
embed
all
of
that
in
the
mathematical
models
we
develop
what
else
could
the
tools
be
used
for
in
future
cities
we
aim
to
focus
on
crime
and
policing
for
the
first
two
years
of
the
grant
but
after
that
we
could
expand
the
models
use
to
other
areas
of
the
city
for
example
we
have
been
approached
by
a
leisure
chain
that
has
essentially
the
same
problem
as
the
police
force
when
do
we
need
more
staff
and
where
with
powerful
enough
models
this
could
be
predicted
on
an
hourly
basis
models
could
also
be
used
to
assess
the
local
economic
impact
of
new
developments
in
a
city
for
example
imperial
s
new
white
city
campus
and
its
associated
infrastructure
we
could
ask
questions
about
what
should
go
alongside
if
a
restaurant
chain
was
thinking
about
opening
up
an
outlet
there
for
example
what
size
should
it
be

and
how
can
it
be
improved
predictive
policing
has
been
used
in
california
to
identify
crime
hotspots
where
serious
crime
is
more
likely
to
occur
for
example
there
s
the
broken
window
effect
where
areas
of
the
city
that
are
not
looked
after
are
more
attractive
for
certain
crimes
these
models
are
based
on
crime
data
and
seem
to
work
well
but
we
can
make
improvements
to
provide
greater
levels
of
statistical
validity
of
model
based
predictions
with
more
powerful
models
we
can
start
to
predict
not
just
where
but
when
and
what
type
of
crime
is
likely
to
occur
we
also
need
to
quantify
the
amount
of
uncertainty
in
any
of
these
predictions
so
that
police
and
policymakers
can
take
these
into
account
when
deciding
whether
to
allocate
resources
based
on
them
where
the
uncertainty
is
high
they
might
want
to
rely
more
on
their
previous
experience
and
knowledge
of
the
situation
who
are
you
working
with
on
this
project
we
re
partnering
with
the
universities
of
oxford
manchester
and
strathclyde
along
with
the
met
west
midlands
scotland
and
new
york
police
forces
we
also
have
on
board
software
companies
and
the
home
office
who
are
very
interested
in
issues
related
to
crime
and
security
once
we
have
some
software
to
trial
we
hope
to
deploy
prototypes
this
is
why
we
have
a
range
of
collaborating
police
forces
to
cover
the
uk
these
police
forces
came
to
us
the
police
forces
across
the
country
are
looking
at
efficiencies
in
operations
so
this
work
is
very
important
it
s
a
great
opportunity
to
do
some
fantastic
maths
but
also
to
roll
it
out
and
have
impact
on
uk
policing
it
sounds
like
a
great
tool
but
are
there
potential
pitfalls
to
predictive
policing
there
are
certainly
ethical
issues
to
take
into
account
for
example
some
police
forces
would
like
to
be
able
to
predict
who
might
become
a
serial
offender
and
make
an
intervention
at
an
early
stage
to
change
the
path
followed
the
ethical
issues
are
really
huge
there
should
we
even
be
thinking
about
such
interventions
the
alan
turing
institute
have
established
a
data
ethics
group
so
we
ve
set
up
an
initiative
with
them
and
west
midlands
police
to
actually
look
at
these
particular
issues
there
are
also
cultural
differences
for
example
between
the
us
and
the
uk
that
need
to
be
taken
into
account
when
predicting
crime
we
can
t
just
be
mathematicians
working
on
theorems
and
proofs
we
ve
brought
in
psychologists
and
social
scientists
specifically
so
that
we
understand
what
psychological
processes
are
at
play
what
we
re
hoping
to
do
is
have
that
inform
the
models
that
we
build
i
guess
if
we
were
working
in
some
totalitarian
state
we
wouldn
t
be
worried
about
the
ethics
of
using
data
to
profile
people
as
to
whether
they
were
going
to
be
serial
criminals
or
not
thankfully
we
don
t
and
therefore
this
is
a
much
more
constrained
issue
and
we
really
need
to
embed
all
of
that
in
the
mathematical
models
we
develop
what
else
could
the
tools
be
used
for
in
future
cities
we
aim
to
focus
on
crime
and
policing
for
the
first
two
years
of
the
grant
but
after
that
we
could
expand
the
models
use
to
other
areas
of
the
city
for
example
we
have
been
approached
by
a
leisure
chain
that
has
essentially
the
same
problem
as
the
police
force
when
do
we
need
more
staff
and
where
with
powerful
enough
models
this
could
be
predicted
on
an
hourly
basis
models
could
also
be
used
to
assess
the
local
economic
impact
of
new
developments
in
a
city
for
example
imperial
s
new
white
city
campus
and
its
associated
infrastructure
we
could
ask
questions
about
what
should
go
alongside
if
a
restaurant
chain
was
thinking
about
opening
up
an
outlet
there
for
example
what
size
should
it
be
and
where
should

police

said
thursday
calling
s
numbers
a
sign
that
police
are
making
progress
against
the
city
s
stubborn
uptick
in
crime
as
of
july
overall

was
up
less
than
when
compared
with
the
first
six

of
notably
lower
than
the

the

reported
halfway
through

the
jump
the
year
before
beck
announced
the
figures
at
the
weekly
meeting
of
his
civilian
bosses
on
the
police
commission
he
later
credited
the
progress
to
a
variety
of
factors
shifting
department
resources
to
target
violent
crime
improving
predictive
policing
to
help
stem
property

adapting
to

in

and

beck
also
said
he
hoped
that
by
the
end
of
the
year
the
city
would
see
crime
drop
if
overall
crime
ultimately
falls
this
year
it
will
mark
the
first
such
decrease
since
i
am
cautiously
optimistic
beck
said
but
we
ll
see
the
most
significant
change
this
year
has
been
in
violent
crime
which
beck
said
has
risen
about
in
both
and
the
lapd
reported
double
digit
increases
in
violent
crime
at
the
midyear
mark
still
homicides
increased
about
in
the
first
six
months
of
this
year
beck
said
which
he
attributed
in
part
to
a
jump
in
gang
related
killings
the
number
of
gunshot
victims
across
the
city
rose
by
roughly
aggravated
assaults
he
added
were
about
even
beck

the

flooded

hot

officers
concentrating
on
areas
where
gangs
were
active
or
where
violence
had
recently
flared
much
like
anything
in
life
it
s
the
constant
application
of
things
that
you
believe
in
and
that
work
beck
said
sometimes
they
re
more
effective
than
others
but
over
time
they
will
always
succeed
the

of

officers
noted
however
that
violent
crime
was
still
significantly
higher
than

was
in

off

to
get
too
excited
about

protective

that

now
is
not
the
time
for
anyone
to
pat
themselves
on

rather
now
is

a

is

are
enjoying

the

is
about

and
approaching

what

here
the

will
wonder
maybe
he
was
not
aware
of
big

powered
predictive

which
will
soon
become
a
norm
in

the
big
question
here
is
will
such
usage
of

help
the

to
control

in

big

to

the

national
crime
records
bureau
which
is
responsible
for
collecting
and
storing
crime
related
data
all
over
india
has
decided
to
use
the
power
of
information
and
data
for
the
implementing
the
next
generation
of
crime
control
tactics
welcome
to
predictive
policing
which
has
made
some
great
inroads
in
countries
like
usa
and
is
about
to
break
the
backs
of
indian
criminals
by
march
national
crime
records
bureau
will
start
executing
big
data
based
predictive
policing
in
states
of
kerala
odisha
maharashtra
haryana
and
tripura
and
by
end
of
whole
of
india
will
be
covered
hyderabad
based
advanced
data
research
institute
adrin
is
right
now
creating
a
software
which
can
predict
crime
before
it
happens
using
the
enormous
amount
of
data
stored
with
national
crime
records
bureau
ncrb
predictive
policing
how
will
it
work
criminal
activities
are
often
interconnected
with
several
common
traits
and
the
new
software
will
pick
up
those
common
traits
and
predict
the
future
of
crime
for
instance
in
a
town
of
people
the
software
will
observe
that
maximum
number
of
burglaries
happen
between
st
and
th
which
are
the
pay
days
most
number
of
crimes
occur
between
pm
and
pm
between
the
bridge
and
the
main
junction
this
information
can
be
used
to
predict
further
crimes
in
future
multiply
it
with
millions
of
data
points
and
we
get
a
comprehensive
picture
a
source
said
it
is
basically
use
of
big
data
analytics
to
predict
geographical
areas
where
crime
is
most
likely
to
take
place
after
taking
into
account
various
factors
followed
by
analysis
based
on
this
information
police
can
step
up
surveillance
enforce
more
manpower
and
basically
stop
the
crime
before
it
happens
factors
like
geographical
location
of
the
crime
population
race
lifestyle
social
issues
etc
can
be
combined
and
big
data
and
analyzed
by
a
ai
platform
to
churn
out

deputy

john
a
sherman
commanding
officer

valley

took
the
helm
last
month
after
predecessor
robert

was
tapped
to
lead
the
department
s
new
transit
services
bureau
with
rising
crime
in
the
city
and
the

sherman
said
he
s
determined
to
use
all
available
tools
to
get
the
community
involved
to
fight
crime
while
deploying
the
valley
bureau
s
police
officers
most
effectively
i
m
an
enthusiastic
kind
of
guy
said
sherman
who
was
raised
in
reseda
from
his
office
at
the
operations
valley
bureau
in
panorama
city
on
tuesday
i
hope
to
bring
that
enthusiasm
and
energy
to
the
valley
and
help
keep
our
officers
going
in
the
right
direction
and
mobilize
our
community
even
further
the
valley
saw
some
crimes
last
year
up
from
about
crimes
in
following
years
of
declines
according
to
police
data
part
of
sherman
s
challenge
is
getting
the
public
to
lock
car
doors
not
leave
keys
or
other
valuables
inside
their
vehicles
and
encouraging
residents
to
talk
to
their
neighbors
he
said
our
biggest
numbers
are
property
crimes
he
explained
our
achilles
heel
is
when
people
break
into
cars
steal
cars
or
break
into
homes
violent
crime
is
down
in
the
valley
about
percent
so
far
this
year
sherman
said
but
property
crimes
are
up
about
percent
today
there
are
more
ways
for
the
public
to
become
involved
to
safeguard
their
neighborhoods
including
facebook
groups
as
well
as
social
networks
like
nextdoor
where
neighbors
can
exchange
information
and
tips
he
said
the
seven
los
angeles
police
stations
in
the
valley
also
are
using
predictive
policing
to
help
put
officers
in
areas
where
there
is
a
high
probability
that
property
crimes
will
occur
next
said
sherman
with
his
new
assistant
commanding
officer
jorge
r
rodriguez
by
his
side
sherman
joined
the
lapd
in
as
a

in

before
moving
to
the

described
sherman
as
a
strong
and
compassionate
leader
with
extensive
experience
across
ranks
sherman
recently
served
as
the
assistant
to
the
director
in
his
office
and
was
closely
involved
in
the
department
s
strategic
action
plan
for
the
next
five
years
john
is
experienced
as
an
executive
but
also
as
a
tradesman
and
also
understanding
strategies
and
tactics
that
can
prove
effective
in
fighting
crime
moore
said
for
sherman
who
is
married
to
wife
tracey
and
has
three
grown
children
and
three
grandchildren
policing
is
a
family
affair
one
of
sherman

his

as
a
lieutenant
at
the
devonshire
division
in
before
serving
as
a
police
chief
in
colorado
for
years
because
police
today
work
in
a
very
difficult
environment
sherman
said
he
aims
to
encourage
the
heart
of
his
officers
we
are
thrown
in
the
midst
of
all
sorts
of
challenges
in
the
midst
of
a
national
discussion
about
immigration
national
discussions
about

july
county
government
is
increasingly
leading
the
way
when
it
comes
to
deploying
technologies
that
matter
to
everyday
citizens
where
innovation
and
out
of
the
box
thinking
used
to
fall
to
bigger
better
funded
state
it
agencies
and
the
private
sector
regional
governments
have
turned
their
focus
to
being
more
adaptable
and
responsive
to
the
technology
needs
of
their
constituents
but
this
year
the
theme
among
the
five
first
place
winners
is
not
so
much
about
a
shiny
new
technology
as
much
as
it
is
about
knowing
when
and
how
to
introduce
it
whether
investing
in
new
tools
like
predictive
analytics
going
mobile
or
opening
data
to
the
public
these
organizations
are
making
very
real
differences
in
the
communities
they
serve
this
year
s
th
annual
digital

in
recent
years
county
cio
bill
kehoe
said
efforts
to
tie
everything
back
to
the
big
picture
it
strategy
have
resulted
in
better
efficiencies
and
a
more
deliberate
deployment
of
necessary
tools
that
s
the
movement
that
i
have
seen
in
the
last
few
years
the
organization
and
the
county
have
gone
mainly
from
operational
and
transactional
to
more
of
a
strategic
and
innovative
approach
he
said
we
still
have
a
way
to
go
but
the
culture
is
changing
in
that
direction
there
is
also
a
lot
at
stake
in
the
county
not
only
because
of
the
expectations
put
on
modern
digital
government
but
also
the
proximity
to
companies
like
amazon
and
microsoft
whenever
it
comes
to
rolling
out
new
tech
for
their
internal
customer
departments
kehoe
said
the
process
of
engaging
with
county
staff
and
educating
them
is
imperative
to
long
term
success
the
solution
tailor
made
classes
designed
to
fit
the
individual
customer
needs
we
threw
a
lot
of
new
technology
at
our
customers
over
the
last
five
to
seven
years
because
the
state
of
the
technology
in
the
county
coming
out
of
the
recession
was
very
outdated
both
from
a
basic
infrastructure
to
just
a
lot
of
outdated
technology
he
said
what
it
did
was
really
overloaded
some
of
our
customers
with
new
technology
that
they
didn
t
necessarily
know
how
to
use
despite
the
digital
counties
recognition
the
cio
said
they
still
have
their
eyes
turned
to
the
big
picture
issues
such
as
cybersecurity
and
the
growing
demand
for
data
services
within
the
larger
king
county
community
meeting
the
call
for
greater
digital
equity
and
social
justice
continue
to
percolate
in
the
minds
of
leadership
and
the
it
team
the
expectation
is
a
lot
higher
and
the
accountability
is
a
lot
higher
which
is
good
but
i
wouldn
t
say
that
it
is
looked
at
as
you
guys
are
doing
great
and
don
t
need
to
improve
he
said
i
think
we
are
always
looking
to
improve
and
really
understand
where
our
customers
pain
points
are
and
new
ways
to
engage
with
them
as
well
westchester

took

and

use

despite
his
title
county
cio
john
mccaffrey
isn
t
afraid
to
say
no
when
those
tools
don
t
add
value
to
the
county
s
overall
mission
in
recent
years
mccaffrey
has
noticed
the
growing
role
westchester
s
it
department
plays
in
the
daily
decision
making
process
rather
than
the
it
team
thinking
of
itself
as
customer
service
oriented
the
cio
said
they
are
now
considered
strategic
partners
they
consider
us
at
every
turn
where
technology
will
help
where
technology
should
lay
one
of
my
mantras
is
no
technology
for
technology
sake
he
said
sometimes
someone
is
trying
to
create
a
technology
project
around
something
that
shouldn
t
be
it
s
just
a
process
perhaps
where
it
s
skillset
is
most
valuable
is
in
the
business
process
improvement
arena
and
in
looking
at
the
way
departments
are
attacking
their
daily
workloads
from
weeding
out
duplicative
processes
to
implementing
a
new
solution
mccaffrey
said
his
it
staff
have
become
the
trusted
voice
when
it
comes
to
the
best
way
get
services
to
the
citizens
occasionally
he
joked
this
process
doesn
t
require
new
technology
at
all
just
a
new
way
to
use
it
one
of
our
things
that
we
have
been
getting
good
recognition
on
is
a
contract
reform
process
and
a
lot
of
it
is
around
workflow
and
document
management
and
the
process
itself
of
eliminating
paperwork
and
eliminating
procedures
that
were
just
duplicative
but
it
s
not
new
technology
per
se
in
looking
to
the
future
the
cio
said
he
would
like
to
see
the
county
expand
the
data
it
uses
to
make
informed
decisions
the
ever
expanding
internet
of
things
and
new
partnerships
could
soon
improve
the
ability
to
pinpoint
vital
service
deployments
across
all
county
departments
both
predictively
and
reactively

stance
in
delivering
powerful
and
relevant
tools
to
the
hands
of
their
department
customers
as
senior
it
manager
craig
vacura
explained
the
strategy
in
douglas
county
is
not
so
much
about
pouring
money
into
new
technology
as
it
is
about
building
from
a
good
foundation
like
their
colleagues
in
washington
s
king
county
the
it
team
in
douglas
county
serves
a
tech
savvy
constituency
some
of
whom
work
for
the
region
s
technology
companies
from
a
county
perspective
our
leadership
really
believes
in
technology
and
is
invested
in
technology
not
just
core
systems
but
in
areas
that
are
more
innovative
and
require
research
he
said
one
of
the
areas
that
was
really
invested
in
recently
is
open
data
and
shared
systems
and
partnering
with
other
counties
but
perhaps
as
important
as
providing
working
tools
to
the
personnel
and
departments
that
need
them
is
the
idea
of
breaking
down
the
barriers
between
departments
and
neighboring
county
partners
vacura
said
the
county
s
efforts
to
partner
with
other
jurisdictions
have
netted
some
great
returns
especially
with
regard
to
public
safety
moving
forward
vacura
said
the
county
is
looking
to
continue
its
work
with
gis
and
building
what
he
calls
a
fundamental
base
for
new
applications
but
they
also
will
be
continuing
efforts
to
look
deeper
into
the
capabilities
of
predictive
analytics
one
project
he
said
douglas
county
officials
are
excited
about
is
the
possibility
of
using
predictive
analytics
to
better
serve
child
welfare
and
human
services
functions
of
the
county
as
it
stands
the
county
is
collaborating
with
the
state
of
colorado
and
academic
partners
to
determine
if
and
how
such
a
tool
could
be
utilized
realistically

with
washington
d
c
said
thinking
about
and
acting
on
technology
is
not
something
that
happens
in
a
vacuum
instead
he
explained
it
happens
in
the
communities
it
will
ultimately
affect
what
we
see
technology
as
is
really
an
enabler
and
what
we
try
to
do
in
my
shop
you
ve
got
to
keep
the
trains
running
so
you
ve
got
to
make
sure
the
servers
work
the
networks
are
up
and
the
databases
are
secure
and
all
that
that
s
it
he
said
what
we
are
trying
to
do
is
advance
the
discussion
about
what
the
future
may
hold
for
the
community
he
calls
this
process
shaping
the
county
s
digital
destiny
regular
input
from
community
groups
and
leadership
through
facilitated
session
allow
the
county
s
it
team
to
respond
with
solutions
that
fit
within
the
county
s
long
term
strategy
what
we
ve
done
is
elevate
that
discussion
he
said
from
mobility
and
learning
to
wellness
and
livelihood
community
engagement
is
central
to
mapping
the
course
for
belcher
s
organization
where
it
comes
to
leadership
the
buy
in
and
engagement
as
well
as
a
realistic
perspective
tech
from
an
investment
review
board
has
garnered
a
trust
based
relationship
between
it
and
decision
makers
rather
than
investing
in
more
parking
lots
should
we
be
understanding
that
there
is
a
going
to
be
a
rise
in
autonomous
vehicles
he
said
maybe
we
need
to
understand
the
considerations
around
that
and
maybe
we
need
to
think
about
more
parks
and
less
parking
lots
we
try
to
put
it
in
terms
of
what
keeps
them

perhaps
the
most
impressive
achievements
for

those
made
in

chester
now
offers

one
of
the
first

in

to

also
built

an

aimed
at
providing
life
saving
assistance
for
victims
of
cardiac

if
someone
is
having
a
cardiac
emergency
pulsepoint
contacts
users
nearby
who
are
trained
in

giving
them
the

of

as
well
as

these
efforts
are
poised
to
continue

to
the
recent

th
dekalb
county
ga
making
their
first
appearance
as
a
digital
counties
survey
winner
dekalb
county
ga
is
working
to
reorient
government
services
to
accommodate
a
shifting
demographic
and
county
officials
have
taken
steps
to
provide
residents
with
the
best
information
technology
services
possible
improvement
began
with
an
open
and
honest
countywide
information
technology
assessment
pdf
conducted
in
summer
which
identified
several
opportunities
for
improvement
one
area
that
drives
the
county
s
evolution
is
their
cloud
and
mobile
first
strategy
by
aiming
to
host
applications
and
services
in
the
cloud
the
county
is
already
working
with
a
forward
thinking
industry
cloud
infrastructure
also
cuts
costs
of
onsite
storage
and
allows
for
flexibility
by
not
having
to
divert
employee
time
to
maintenance
of
systems
it
s
no
secret
that
smartphones
have
changed
the
way
residents
across
the
country
connect
to
the
internet
for
lower
income
families
phones
are
often
the
only
connection
they
have
to
the
web
so
prioritizing
those
users
for
dekalb
gets
at
the
hardest
to
reach
populations
when
the
county
redesigned
its
website
in
november
it
was
optimized
for
mobile
users
using
responsive
design
in
drupal
in
conjunction
with
a
targeted
social
media
campaign
across
all
major
platforms
and
the
county
s
agendas
were
made
publicly
available
through
granicus
perhaps
the
largest
gains
have
been
from
dekalb
s
efforts
toward
increasing
cybersecurity
and
protecting
valuable
data
the
county
introduced
a
suite
of
cyberapplications
including
intrusion
detection
systems
and
intrusion
prevention
systems
ids
ips
to
help
manage
threats
analytics
dashboards
are
also
reviewed
daily
to
evaluate
the
state
of
the

intrusion

vectors
and

are
monitored
continuously
with

set
up

calif
was
chosen
as
one
of

the
goal
was
to
import
some
of
the
company
s
trademark
moonshot
thinking
and
apply
it
to
local
government
problems
if
returning
to
the
top
of
the
digital

survey
is
any
indication
then
the
workshop
was
a
booming
success
one
of
the
major
goals
addressed
in
the
county
was
maintaining
a
well
trained
and
committed
workforce
sitting
adjacent
to
silicon
valley
the
it
department
suffered
from
tough
competition
but
through
a
series
of
internships
and
reforms
to
the
hiring
process
the
county
was
able
to
make
tremendous
strides
in
workforce
acquisition
and
retention
the
other
main
goal
for
county
officials
was
implementing
a
no
youth
in
the
justice
system
program
focusing
on
the
high
rate
of
recidivism
the
county
developed
a
program
that
utilized
technology
to
create
a
data
sharing
tool
that
provides
timely
identification
and
analysis
of
data
that
is
related
to
law
enforcement
dealings
with
youth
this
tool
and
data
will
be
used
across
departments
to
guide
placement
link
community
support
services
and
inform
the
virtual
team
with
the
goal
of
reducing

taking

in
an

can
be
identified
in

and
is
being
cross

results
to
help

the

also
maintains
strong
open

and
transparency
initiatives
including
making

that
was
commonly
requested
by
constituents
open
to
the

and
enabling

one
example

several
neighboring

have
a
cross

agreement
to
cover
the
cost
of
aerial

pays
for

the

photography
is
shared
across
all
agencies
hamilton
has
also
outsourced
several
tasks
rather
than
devoting
scarce
resources
to
an
issue
and
has
reaped
significant
cost
savings
according
to
county
officials
outsourcing
tends
to
be
less
costly
faster
to
implement
and
more
robust
compared
to
a

custom
application
leveraging

has
expanded
its

popular

matter
one
thing
officials
gleaned
from
the

was
the
frequency
with
which
constituents
were
requesting
gis
layers
and
shapefiles
and
after
releasing
the
county
s
entire
gis
data
library
free
to
the
public
officials
went
further
and
created
a

project
that

three

now
been
completed

is
a
high
priority
for

that
includes
implementing
several
artificial

also
impressive
is
the
county

expansion
of
its
opengov
platform
that
will
provide
interactive

capabilities
in
the

as
well
as
its
dedication

the
it
department
used
linkedin
recruiter
to
hire
a
systems
architect
from
florida
and
a
systems
engineer
from
north

perhaps
most
noteworthy
however
is
the
implementation
of
the
sheriff
s
office
s
automatic
injury
detection
aid
system
which
relies
on
plastic

slipped
inside

the

that
getting
police
reform
right
is
so
important
highlight
abstract
in
police
reform
circles
many
scholars
and
policymakers
diagnose
the
frayed
relationship
between
police
forces
and
the
communities
they
serve
as
a
problem
of
illegitimacy
or
the
idea
that
people
lack
confidence
in
the
police
and
thus
are
unlikely
to
comply
or
cooperate
with
them
the
core
proposal
emanating
from
this
illegitimacy
diagnosis
is
procedural
justice
a
concept
that
emphasizes
police
officers
obligation
to
treat
people
with
dignity
and
respect
behave
in
a
neutral
nonbiased
way
exhibit
an
intention
to
help
and
give
them
voice
to
express
themselves
and
their
needs
largely
in
the
context
of
police
stops
this
essay
argues
that
legitimacy
theory
offers
an
incomplete
diagnosis
of
the
policing
crisis
and
thus
de
emphasizes
deeper
structural
group
centered
approaches
to
the
problem
of
policing
the
existing
police
regulatory
regime
encourages
large
swaths
of
american
society
to
see
themselves
as
existing
within
the
law
s
aegis
but
outside
its
protection
this
essay
critiques
the
reliance
of
police
decision
makers
on
a
simplified
version
of
legitimacy
and
procedural
justice
theory
it
aims
to
expand
the
predominant
understanding
of
police
mistrust
among
african
americans
and
the
poor
proposing
that
legal
estrangement
offers
a
better
lens
through
which
scholars
and
policymakers
can
understand
and
respond
to
the
current
problems
of
policing
legal
estrangement
is
a
theory
of
detachment
and
eventual
alienation
from
the
law
s
enforcers
and
it
reflects
the
intuition
among
many
people
in
poor
communities
of
color
that
the
law
operates
to
exclude
them
from
society
building
on
the
concepts
of
legal
cynicism
and
anomie
in
sociology
the
concept
of
legal
estrangement
provides
a
way
of
understanding
the
deep
concerns
that
motivate
today
s
police
reform
movement
and
points
toward
structural
approaches
to
reforming

text
introduction
in
the
concluding
paragraphs
of
her
fiery
dissent
in
utah
v
strieff
n
justice
sotomayor
invoked
w
e
b
du
bois
james
baldwin
michelle
alexander
ta
nehisi
coates
and
marie
gottschalk
in
concluding
that
the
court
s
decision
which
further
weakened
the
power
of
the
exclusionary
rule
to
deter
unconstitutional
police
conduct
n
sent
a
message
particularly
to
people
of
color
that
you
are
not
a
citizen
of
a
democracy
but
the
subject
of
a
carceral
state
just
waiting
to
be
cataloged
n
justice
sotomayor
laments
treating
members
of
our
communities
as
second
class
citizens
n
yet
despite
the
boldness
of
her
statements
in
some
ways
justice
sotomayor
might
not
have
gone
quite
far
enough
in
articulating
the
troubling
implications
of
our
fourth
amendment
jurisprudence
justice
sotomayor
s
analysis
understates
the
problem
on
two
fronts
first
in
addition
to
the
jurisprudential
message
that
poor
people
of
color
are
subject
s
of
a
carceral
state
or
second
class
citizens
research
in
sociology
criminology
political
science
and
other
fields
suggests
that
these
groups
often
see
themselves
as
essentially
stateless
unprotected
by
the
law
and
its
enforcers
and
marginal
to
the
project
of
making
american
society
even
as
criminal
procedure
jurisprudence
sets
the
parameters
of
what
police
may
do
under
the
law
it
simultaneously
leaves
large
swaths
of
american
society
to
see
themselves
as
anomic
subject
only
to
the
brute
force
of
the
state
while
excluded
from
its
protection
the
message
conveyed
in
policing
jurisprudence
is
not
only
one
of
oppression
but
also
one
of
profound
estrangement
a
second
understatement
relates
to
the
understanding
of
whose
safety
is
at
risk
when
the
fourth
amendment
insufficiently
checks
the
power
of
the
police
justice
sotomayor
uses
the
second
person
pronoun
you
to
convey
to
a
public
audience
both
the
universality
and
the
personal
proximity
of
the
risk
of
police
control
n
yet
this
literary
technique
though
effective
obscures
the
reality
that
the
sense
of
alienation
in
a
carceral
regime
emanates
not
only
from
what
police
might
do
to
you
but
from
what
they
might
do
to
your
friends
your
intimate
partners
your
parents
your
children
to
people
of
your
race
or
social
class
and
to
people
who
live
in
the
neighborhood
or
the
city
where
you
live
in
other
words
estrangement
from
the
american
citizenry
is
not
merely
an
individual
feeling
to
which
people
of
color
tend
to
succumb
more
readily
than
white
americans
do
rather
estrangement
is
a
collective
institutional
venture
the
black
lives
matter
era
has
catalyzed
meaningful
discussion
about
the
tense
relationship
between
the
police
and
many
racially
and
economically
isolated
communities
and
about
how
policing
can
be
reformed
to
avoid
deaths
like
those
of
rekia
boyd
michael
brown
eric
garner
alton
sterling
philando
castile
and
more
however
contemporary
discourse
has
often
neglected
or
obscured
deeper
discussion
about
the
relationship
between
african
americans
especially
poor
african
americans
and
the
police
what
is
the
nature
of
these
relationships
how
can
scholars
and
policymakers
more
roundly
understand
their
contours
and
potential
strategies
for
change
many
scholars
and
policymakers
have
settled
on
a
legitimacy
deficit
as
the
core
diagnosis
of
the
frayed
relationship
between
police
forces
and
the
communities
they
serve
the
problem
this
argument
goes
is
that
people
of
color
and
residents
of
high
poverty
communities
do
not
trust
the
police
or
believe
that
they
treat
them
fairly
and
that
therefore
these
individuals
are
less
likely
to
obey
officers
commands
or
assist
with
investigations
n
this
argument
took
its
most
prominent
position
in
the
may
final
report
of
the
white
house
task
force
on
st
century
policing
the
report
sets
forth
the
goal
of
building
trust
and
legitimacy
as
both
the
first
pillar
of
its
proposed
approach
to
police
reform
and
as
the
foundational
principle
underlying
the
task
force
s
inquiry
into
the
nature
of
relations
between
law
enforcement
and
the
communities
they
serve
n
trust
is
a
broad
term
but
the
report
and
much
of
the
policymaking
energy
surrounding
shifts
in
police
governance
adopt
an
understanding
of
trust
that
treats
it
as
virtually
synonymous
with
legitimacy
n
ample
empirical
evidence
supports
the
idea
that
african
americans
and
residents
of
predominantly
african
american
neighborhoods
are
more
likely
than
whites
to
view
the
police
as
illegitimate
and
untrustworthy
along
several
axes
n
empirical
evidence
suggests
that
feelings
of
distrust
manifest
themselves
in
a
reduced
likelihood
among
african
americans
to
accept
law
enforcement
officers
directives
and
cooperate
with
their
crime
fighting
efforts
n
according
to
much
of
this
line
of
scholarship
the
primary
tool
to
achieve
greater
obedience
to
the
law
and
law
enforcement
regardless
of
race
is
procedural
justice
police
officers
treating
people
with
dignity
and
respect
behaving
in
a
neutral
nonbiased
way
exhibiting
an
intention
to
help
and
giving
people
voice
to
express
themselves
and
their
needs
in
interactions
n
yet
many
reformers
would
likely
disagree
that
obedience
to
law
enforcement
is
the
central
concern
in
america
s
current
conversation
on
police
reform
indeed
in
many
of
the
cases
that
have
most
catalyzed
the
black
lives
matter
movement
the
victims
of
police
violence
were
not
disobeying
the
law
n
were
complying
with
officers
demands
n
or
were
suspected
of
violating
petty
laws
that
are
likely
unworthy
of
strong
enforcement
efforts
or
penalties
n
a
large
body
of
scholarship
on
criminal
justice
attempts
to
denaturalize
the
assumed
link
between
obeying
the
law
and
criminal
justice
contact
n
scholars
have
shown
that
recent
trends
in
criminal
justice
such
as
pervasive
stop
and
frisk
increased
misdemeanor
prosecution
and
mass
incarceration
are
not
primarily
consequences
of
increases
in
criminal
offending
instead
these
scholars
suggest
that
the
american
criminal
justice
system
has
dual
purposes
only
one
of
which
is
crime
response
and
reduction
its
other
more
insidious
function
is
the
management
and
control
of
disfavored
groups
such
as
african
americans
latin
americans
the
poor
certain
immigrant
groups
and
groups
who
exist
at
the
intersection
of
those
identities
n
from
a
social
control
perspective
increasing
compliance
and
cooperation
with
law
enforcement
may
well
be
valuable
aims
but
they
should
not
be
at
the
root
of
police
reform
efforts
deploying
legitimacy
theory
and
procedural
justice
as
a
diagnosis
and
solution
to
the
current
policing
crisis
might
even
imply
at
some
level
that
the
problem
of
policing
is
better
understood
as
a
result
of
african
american
criminality
than
as
a
badge
and
incident
of
race
and
class
based
subjugation
reformers
emphasis
on
police
legitimacy
has
caused
them
to
focus
heavily
on
training
of
frontline
officers
to
behave
in
a
procedurally
just
manner
during
stops
with
a
goal
of
promoting
legitimacy
the

and

five
of
a
six

approach
and
training

as
an
action
item
under
all
of
the
five
other
pillars
n
numerous
news
reports
professional
reports
and
articles
in
professional
magazines
tout
procedural
justice
as
the
key
intervention
that
will
resolve
the
problems
that
have
catalyzed
black
lives
matter
n
police
departments
across
the
country
in
wide
ranging
cities
such
as
chicago
illinois
stockton
california
and
birmingham
alabama
have
implemented
procedural
justice
training
n
the
obama
justice
department
s
consent
decrees
with
troubled
departments
such
as
cleveland
and
ferguson
mandate
departments
to
adopt
and
implement
procedural
justice
principles
and
training
n
as
the
theory
is
at
times
presented
particularly
among
police
officers
responding
to
the
concerns
of
marginalized
communities
is
as
simple
as
following
the
golden
rule
n
while
momentum
for
procedural
justice
training
seems
persistent
on
a
local
level
n
the
trump
administration
seems
unlikely
to
embrace
and
advocate
for
this
sort
of
reform
trump
has
consistently
indicated
that
he
is
generally
supportive
of
police
officers
but
he
has
not
fully
articulated
what
support
means
at
a
concrete
level
while
candidate
trump
espoused
the
sanctity
of
state
and
local
control
over
policing
n
president
trump
took
to
twitter
to
threaten
to
send
the
feds
to
chicago
to
respond
to
shootings
which
generally
fall
within
the
jurisdiction
of
local
police
departments
n
candidate
trump
endorsed
aggressive
ineffective
stop
and
frisk
policies
n
meaning
policies
that
target
predominantly
black
and
brown
neighborhoods
in
the
style
declared
unconstitutional
in
new
york
city
n
not
the
stops
and
frisks
based
on
individualized
reasonable
suspicion
authorized
in
terry
v
ohio
n
meanwhile
president
trump
floated
a
preliminary
federal
budget
drafted
by
the
cato
institute
that
indicated
the
administration
would
seek
to
eliminate
funding
for
the
justice
department
s
office
of
community
oriented
policing
services
cops
n
the
cops
office
distributes
federal
funding
to
local
departments
to
hire
more
police
officers
which
enables
departments
to
hire
enough
officers
to
carry
out
intensive
approaches
like
stop
and
frisk
n
without
cops
funding
local
departments
may
lack
the
staffing
to
fulfill
trump
s
alleged
goal
of
ratcheting
up
stop
and
frisk
measures
recent
executive
orders
on
criminal
justice
issued
just
one
day
after
the
senate
confirmed
trump
s
attorney
general
jeff
sessions
continue
in
the
ambiguous
vein
of
supporting
the
police
while
gently
alluding
to
ways
that
impulse
might
conflict
with
responding
to
the
concerns
that
yielded
black
lives
matter
one
executive
order
for
example
creates
a
task
force
on
crime
reduction
and
public
safety
that
supports
law
and
order
and
authorizes
the
task
force
to
propose
new
legislation
that
could
be
enacted
to
improve
public
safety
and
reduce
crime
language
that
sounds
supportive
of
increased
criminalization
and
expansion
of
the
carceral
state
n
another
which
purports
to
prevent
violence
against
police
officers
similarly
proposes
new
federal
crimes
and
increase
d
penalties
for
existing
federal
crimes
against
officers
n
in
the
context
of
recent
debates
over
police
legitimacy
and
police
community
relations
these
orders
implicitly
paint
the
challenges
facing
criminal
justice
as
stemming
solely
from
criminality
they
ignore
the
institutional
failures
of
certain
police
departments
and
erase
the
structural
underpinnings
of
tense
police
community
relations
specifically
racial
isolation
and
class
marginalization
the
appointment
of
jeff
sessions
as
united
states
attorney
general
suggests
that
the
justice
department
s
civil
rights
division
will
end
its
investigations
of
local
departments
n
as
it
did
under
attorneys
general
alberto
gonzales
and
michael
mukasey
during
the
second
george
w
bush
administration
n
it
is
also
likely
that
the
doj
s
funding
support
for
the
national
initiative
for
building
community
trust
justice
founded
on
legitimacy
and
procedural
justice
principles
will
end
n
yet
given
the
wide
embrace
of
procedural
justice
on
a
local
level
and
through
national
policing
organizations
it
would
not
be
surprising
if
procedural
justice
remained
the
prevailing
approach
even
if
the
federal
government
steps
back
from
actively
pushing
it
n
choosing
a
theory
of
the
policing
crisis
and
its
solutions
is
critical
for
advancing
meaningful
effective
reform
in
the
world
of
police
governance
and
practice
perhaps
more
than
in
other
spheres
theory
matters
for
determining
what
police
departments
and
officers
do
on
the
ground
much
of
the
impetus
for
broken

n
community
policing

and
other
predictive
policing

and
now
procedural

from

in
the
academy
through
a
panoply
of
large

small
policy
decisions

into
the
daily
work

officers
thus
getting
the
theory
right
by
accurately
diagnosing
the

central
to
the
practical
project
of
reforming
policing
this
essay
broadens
the
usual
lens
by
proposing
legal
estrangement
as
a
corrective
to
the
prevailing
legitimacy
perspective
on
police
reform
like
justice
sotomayor
in
strieff
n
the
legal
scholars
who
are
setting
the
police
reform
agenda
have
not
fully
captured
the
nature
of
the
distrustful
relationship
between
the
police
and
poor
and
african
american
communities
the
theory
of
legal
estrangement
provides
a
rounder
more
contextualized
understanding
of
this
relationship
that
examines
the
more
general
disappointment
and
disillusionment
felt
by
many
african

the
blight
of
police
distrust
in
african
american
communities
for
as
long
as
scholars
have
studied
the
relationship
between
african
americans
and
criminal
justice
they
have
documented
deep
distrust
of
the
system
in
the
early
twentieth
century
w
e
b
du
bois
was
likely
the
first
scholar
to
empirically
document
this
distrust
n
as
part
of
a
series
of
studies
of
african
american
life
du
bois
and
his
collaborators
collected
survey
interview
and
administrative
data
on
crime
arrest
and
incarceration
n
they
found
among
other
things
that
white
officials
and
black
men
had
greatly
divergent
perspectives
on
the
possibilities
of
justice
for
african
americans
in
georgia
courts
n
du
bois
reasoned
that
punishment
practices
prevalent
at
the
time
such
as
lynching
spread
among
black
folk
the
firmly
fixed
idea
that
few
accused
negroes
are
really
guilty
n
he
also
condemned
the
relative
lack
of
legal
protection
for
african
americans
as
well
as
criminal
justice
practices
such
as
the
leasing
of
convicts
that
sent
a
message
to
african
americans
that
the
purpose
of
the
system
was
to
make
money
for
the
state
rather
than
to
rehabilitate
supposed
lawbreakers
n
du
bois
s
research
was
prescient
at

with
respect
to
the
direction
of
research
and
scholarship
on
african
americans
relationship
to
the
crime
control
system
over
the
next
century
a
high
watermark
was
the
kerner
commission
report
commissioned
by
the
johnson
administration
in
the
wake
of
twenty
three
episodes
of
urban
unrest
during
the
mid
and
late
s
n
the
report
concluded
that
for
many
african
americans
the
police
have
come
to
symbolize
white
power
white
racism
and
white
repression
n
like
du
bois
s
georgia
study
the
report
documented
tension
and
hostility
between
law
enforcement
and
urban
african
americans
blaming
the
abrasive
relationship
on
a
combination
of
increased
demands
for
protection
and
service
and
the
police
practices
thought
necessary
to
provide
those
services

in

northeastern
and
midwestern

belt

where
many
african
americans
relocated
during

forces

functioned
to
maintain
the
expulsion
of
african
americans
from
the
center
of
social
and

life

times

the
law
in

despite
pervasive
harsh
policing

ostensibly
was
intended
to
suppress
and
deter

african
americans
felt
inadequately
protected
n
the
litany
of
evidence
confirming
the
existence
of
a
tense
and
distrustful
relationship
between
african
americans
and
law
enforcement
mounted
steadily
over
the
ensuing
decades
john
hagan
and
celesta
albonetti
for
example
used
data
from
a
national
survey
conducted
in
the
late
s
to
conclude
that
although
african
americans
were
more
likely
than
whites
to
see
all
aspects
of
the
criminal
justice
system
as
unjust
they
perceived
the
police
as
the
most
unjust
aspect
of
the
criminal
justice
system
n
drawing
from
nationally
representative
survey
data
from
the
late
s
tracey
meares
argued
that
many
african
americans
experience
dual
frustration
with
drugs
on
the
one
hand
and
with
harsh
courts
and
law
enforcement
on
the
other
n
more
recently
lawrence
bobo
and
victor
thompson
reached
similar
conclusions
finding
that
while
sixty
eight
percent
of
white
respondents
expressed
at
least
some
or
a
lot
of
confidence
in
the
police
only
eighteen
percent
of
black
respondents
would
say
the
same

and
academic
attention

have
shed
new
light
on
longstanding
tensions
between
african
americans
and
law
enforcement
n
newer
research
embeds
the
problem
of
police
distrust
within
a
larger
framework
of
race
and
class
based
marginalization
examining
a
range
of
police
practices
and
neighborhood
conditions
n
much
of
this
research
documents
african
american
distrust
or
dissatisfaction
with
the
law
and
law
enforcement
without
clearly
articulating
the
meaning
of
distrust
or
the
precise
content
of
dissatisfaction
this
omission
could
exist
in
part
because
the
sources
of
distrust
and
dissatisfaction
are
seen
as
relatively
obvious
a
large
body
of
historical
research
has
documented
the
entanglement
of
police
in
the
long
running
national
project
of
racial
control
n
yet
our
failure
to
be
specific
about
the
meaning
origins
and
content
of
distrust
has
produced
a
worrisome
incompleteness
in
the
diagnosis
of
the
problem
and
thus
in
the
prognosis
and
program
of
treatment
n
trust
is
a
multidimensional
difficult
to
define
concept
that
scholars
operationalize
using
myriad
approaches
n
yet
in
the
world
of
policing
scholarship
the
leading
scholar
and
definer
of
trust
is
tom
tyler
rather
than
understanding
trust
and
legitimacy
as
synonymous
tyler
conceptualizes
trust
as
part
of
the
larger
umbrella
of
legitimacy
theoretically
tyler
defines
legitimacy
as
a
person
s
perceived
obligation
to
obey
the
law
n
or
the
belief
that
legal
authorities
are
entitled
to
be
obeyed
and
that
the
individual
ought
to
defer
to
their
judgments
n
different
surveys
and
experiments
define
legitimacy
in
distinctive
ways
but
the
core
formulation
considers
people
s
sense
of
obligation
to
follow
the
law
their
sense
of
whether
the
law
operates
to
protect
the
advantaged
which
tyler
and
huo
call
cynicism
about
the
law
n
their
trust
in
legal
institutions
specifically
police
officers
and
judges
and
their
favorability
toward
the
police
and
the
courts
in
their
city
n
the
conceptual
distinctions
between
all
of
the
manifestations
of
trust
that
appear
in
the
large
body
of
legitimacy
scholarship
can
become
blurry
and
it
is
beyond
the
scope
of
this
essay
to
reconcile
all
of
these
iterations
the
core
insight
to
keep
in
mind
is
that
in
the
version
of
legitimacy
theory
that
policing
policymakers
have
adopted
most
completely
trust
between
police
and
communities
is
understood
as
a
problem
of
illegitimacy
the
key
concern
is
the
degree
to
which
people
will
choose
to
obey
the
law
and
its
enforcers
much
literature
has
shown
that
regardless
of
how
trust
is
measured
or
conceived
african
americans
particularly
those
who
are
poor
or
who
live
in
high
poverty
or
predominantly
african
american
communities
tend
to
have
less
trust
not
only
in
police
but
also
in
other
governmental
institutions
in
their
neighbors
and
even
in
their
intimate
partner
relationships
in
comparison
to
other
racial
and
ethnic
groups
in
the
united
states
n
the
picture
that
emerges
from
the
full
body
of
research
on
race
and
trust
is
one
of
profound
marginalization
a
social
diminishment
that
while
not
encapsulating
the
fullness
of
the
african
american
experience
indicates
that
poor
african
americans
as
a
whole
tend
to
have
a
social
experience
distinctive
from
those
of
other
ethnic
and
class
groups
in
the
united
states
structural
disadvantage
yields
a
broader
cultural
structure
of
mistrust
most
discussions
of
african
american
distrust
of
the
police
only
skirt
the
edges
of
a
deeper
well
of
estrangement
between
poor
communities
of
color
and
the
law
and
in
turn
society
ii
two
diagnoses
a
a
crisis
of
legitimacy
the
most
widely
accepted
diagnosis
of
the
cleavage
between
the
police
and
african
americans
particularly
poor
african
americans
centers
on
legitimacy
scholars
argue
that
african
americans
are
less
likely
than
other
groups
to
see
the
police
as
legitimate
authorities
meaning
that
as
a
group
they
are
less
likely
to
have
a
feeling
of
obligation
to
obey
the
law
and
to
defer
to
the
decisions
made
by
legal
authorities
n
although
trust
and
legitimacy
are
distinct
concepts
scholars
and
policymakers
tend
to
treat
the
ideas
as
functionally
equivalent
for
reform
purposes
the
core
determinant
of
whether
law
enforcement
is
perceived
as
legitimate
and
thus
worthy
of
obedience
and
assistance
is
whether
police
officers
behave
in
a
procedurally
just
manner
n
procedural
justice
is
believed
to
encapsulate
several
components
including
treating
people
with
dignity
and
respect
voice
which
can
include
citizen
participation
and
allowing
individuals
to
express
their
concerns
neutrality
freedom
from
bias
and
conveying
trustworthy
motives
explaining
how
the
police
are
helping
reach
an
important
social
goal
n
tyler
and
his
colleagues
were
not
the
first
to
articulate
a
socio
legal
rationale
for
procedural
justice
n
but
their
formulation
has
had
the
greatest
influence
over
the
push
toward
procedural
justice
in
policing
an
overview
of
the
genealogy
of
police
legitimacy
theory
is
helpful
for
distinguishing
it
from
legal
estrangement
although
the
research
on
police
legitimacy
primarily
draws
from
social
psychology
the
theoretical
underpinnings
of
the
concept
like
much
of
the
scholarship
on
legal
legitimacy
across
domains
n
usually
derive
from
the
work
of
sociologist
max
weber
n
from
weber
s
standpoint
legitimation
is
a
subjective
process
it
does
not
inhere
in
an
authority
s
procedures
or
existence
but
is
continuously
negotiated
with
subjects
talcing
into
account
their
views
n
weber
classified
the
types
of
authority
that
legitimate
orders
tend
to
exhibit
into
three
ideal
types
n
charismatic
authority
or
authority
based
on
perceived
personal
divinity
or
exemplariness
traditional
authority
based
on
custom
and
epitomized
by
the
king
and
legal
rational
authority
the
form
of
authority
found
most
frequently
in
modern
advanced
society
which
is
based
on
process
and
consent
n
weber
believed
that
legal
rational
authority
the
focus
of
nearly
all
research
on
legitimacy
today
is
in
some
ways
the
preferred
version
of
legitimation
because
this
legitimation
strategy
makes
clear
that
in
choosing
government
through
transparent
rational
means
human
beings
are
exercising
their
autonomy
and
free
will
n
while
the
threat
of
violence
from
the
state
always
lurks
the
state
s
authority
over
its
citizens
primarily
comes
from
the
state
s
adherence
to
process
n
in
the
legal
and
political
realms
n
the
purpose
of
legitimacy
theory
is
to
understand
how
the
state
from
a
moral
perspective
justifies
its
power
and
how
as
an
empirical
matter
it
most
effectively
exercises
power
over
its
subjects
n
state
power
is
the
ultimate
focal
point
of
legitimacy
analysis
n
the
question
then
becomes
how
does
the
state
attain
power
over
its
subjects
theorists
such
as
habermas
refined
the
concept
of
legitimacy
to
emphasize
consent
adding
a
layer
of
deliberation
and
positing
that
legitimacy
can
be
built
through
dialogue
among
equal
citizens
n
along
these
lines
but
with
concern
about
the
normative
implications
of
consent
gramsci
argued
that
governments
and
more
precisely
capitalist
governments
gained
legitimacy
through
ideological
and
cultural
hegemony
legitimation
is
a
bundle
of
processes
that
elites
use
to
procure
public
buy
in
to
oppressive
systems
n
regardless
of
the
normative
valence
of
consent
its
emphasis
in
the
study
of
legitimacy
has
led
social
psychology
research
to
focus
largely
on
what
makes
people
voluntarily
obey
and
help
the
state
n
this
consent
based
conception
of
legitimacy
falls
in
line
with
a
focus
among
policymakers
on
how
to
increase
voluntary
adherence
to
the
law
n
the
empirical
work
also
tries
to
ascertain
how
the
circumstances
under
which
the
community
sees
legal
authority
as
legitimate
might
vary
across
groups
this
focus
on
consent
has
produced
some
insights
about
the
nature
of
racial
divergence
in
police
legitimacy
two
insights
have
been
most
central
first
across
racial
ethnic
groups
people
tend
to
view
police
as
legitimate
when
they
are
procedurally
just
and
people
tend
to
interpret
fairness
similarly
across
eth
no
racial
divides
n
second
the
primary
reason
african
americans
do
not
see
police
as
legitimate
is
because
they
tend
to
have
more
personal
experiences
in
which
police
officers
treat
them
in
a
procedurally
unjust
manner
n
although
little
is
known
about
the
specific
behaviors
and
practices
that
people
consider
fair
or
unfair
n
the
police
legitimacy
literature
empirically
shows
that
people
want
the
same
type
of
treatment
from
police
regardless
of
their
race
or
class
this
conclusion
means
that
african
americans
greater
distrust
of
the
police
results
not
from
supposed
subcultural
values
or
bad
culture
but
instead
arises
as
the
product
of
negative
personal
experiences
this
insight
has
driven
legal
scholarship
in
several
directions
n
most
central
to
the
analysis
of
this
essay
police
legitimacy
scholarship
encouraged
legal
scholars
to
explore
ways
that
the
law
might
better
facilitate
procedurally
just
policing
and
respond
to
procedurally
unjust
policing
policies
and
practices
steven
schulhofer
tom
tyler
and
aziz
huq
present
one
of
the
most
fully
elaborated
applications
of
legitimacy
theory
to
policing
applying
the
theory
to
both
conventional
and
counterterrorism
policing
n
they
set
forth
three
policy
goals
that
should
emanate
from
the
procedural
justice
policing
model
training
officers
to
treat
force
as
a
last
resort
and
to
view
every
citizen
contact
as
an
opportunity
to
build
legitimacy
through
the
tone
and
quality
of
the
interaction
n
eschewing
regulation
of
the
police
through
the
blunt
instruments
of
the
law
for
example
the
exclusionary
rule
in
favor
of
internal
department
management
policies
designed
to
positively
motivate
police
to
treat
the
public
fairly
n
and
in
the
counterterrorism
realm
avoiding
the
impulse
to
authorize
the
use
of
harsh
tactics
such
as
ethno
racial
profiling
and
random
checkpoints
n
schulhofer
tyler
and
huq
s
approach
is
distinctively
what
rachel
harmon
calls
non
law
n
in
the
sense
that
it
explicitly
rejects
legal
intervention
into
policing
their
core
suggestions
are
training
the
substance
of
which
is
highly
discretionary
and
rarely
encoded
directly
into
law
and
avoiding
litigation
based
pathways
toward
systemic
reform
such
as
the
department
of
justice
consent
decree
process
the
solutions
do
not
involve
creating
changing
or
enforcing
the
law
this
means
that
even
if
these
approaches
are
effective
they
largely
leave
intact
the
legal
structure
that
has
given
birth
to
distrust
and
illegitimacy
meares
has
made
several
proposals
to
encourage
departments
to
adopt
principles
of
procedural
justice
conceptually
she
has
advanced
the
notion
of
rightful
policing
the
idea
that
policing
should
be
designed
to
maximize
both
lawful
conduct
and
community
perceptions
of
police
legitimacy
n
building
in
part
from
schulhofer
tyler
and
huq
s
idea
that
persuading
and
incentivizing
police
to
treat
people
fairly
will
be
more
effective
than
forcing
them
to
do
so
meares
s
scholarship
has
embraced
community
policing
efforts
such
as
project
safe
neighborhoods
in
chicago
illinois
project
exile
in
richmond
virginia
and
operation
ceasefire
in
boston
massachusetts
these
programs
methods
include
organizing
meetings
with
ex
offenders
to
build
relationships
and
inform
them
of
alternative
opportunities
to
crime
as
well
as
holistic
problem
solving
approaches
such
as
legitimacy
based
hot
spots
policing
also
known
as
focused
deterrence
n
these
approaches
are
a
sort
of
proactive
policing
that
should
according
to
their
proponents
avoid
the
pitfalls
of
earlier
forms
of
broken
windows
policing
because
they
now
emphasize
procedural
justice
in
the
micro
level
interactions
of
police
contact
n
scholars
have
proposed
a
variety
of
other
interventions
to
build
legitimacy
as
well
for
example
some
have
proposed
that
law
enforcement
randomize
police
stops
and
searches
in
theory
randomization
should
allow
police
to
engage
in
hands
on
crime
prevention
without
negatively
impacting
the
legitimacy
of
the
system
by
making
specific
people
particularly
young
african
american
and
latino
men
feel
targeted
n
other
scholars
have
incorporated
these
concerns
about
spatial
and
racial
distribution
of
procedurally
unjust
policing
into
fourth
amendment
arguments
they
propose
that
courts
should
consider
whether
officers
were
making
an
individualized
determination
of
suspicion
as
constitutionally
required
n
or
rather
engaging
in
a
collective
determination
of
suspicion
based
on
race
and
geography
n
other
recent
work
proposes
using
a
disparate
impact
framework
similar
to
that
used
in
title
vii
analysis
to
assess
the
spatial
and
racial
impacts
of
stop
question
frisk
n
the
greatest
strength
of
the
police
legitimacy
approach
is
its
deceptive
simplicity
its
two
core
ideas
that
people
will
accept
unfavorable
police
decisions
so
long
as
the
preceding
processes
are
perceived
to
be
fair
and
that
the
police
should
treat
all
people
including
african
americans
and
the
poor
with
dignity
and
respect
in
order
to
be
more
effective
at
the
work
of
crime
deterrence
are
marked
deviations
from
the
prevailing
wisdom
about
policing
that
preceded
legitimacy
theory
for
example
as
noted
above
the
kerner
commission
report
partly
blamed
african
americans
cynicism
about
the
police
on
the
harsh
tactics
that
police
deemed
necessary
to
control
crime
in
predominantly
black
inner
city
neighborhoods
n
in
one
of
the
earliest
in
depth
studies
of
urban
police
william
l
a
westley
found
that
the
police
officers
he
studied
tended
to
view
both
african
americans
and
residents
of
poor
neighborhoods
as
requiring
a
fundamentall
different
type
of
policing
than
other
groups
because
those
two
groups
would
respond
only
to
fear
and
rough
treatment
n
officers
today
are
not
as
likely
to
overtly
express
racial
animus
but
they
might
use
different
language
focused
on
class
and
culture
to
make
a
similar
point
n
justifications
for
race
and
class
differentiated
policing
partly
derive
from
a
view
that
police
tactics
must
vary
by
the
type
of
community
in
order
to
be
effective
the
procedural
justice
approach
is
a
partial
corrective
to
that
common
wisdom
however
police
legitimacy
is
not
all
encompassing
and
it
is
often
disturbingly
oversimplified
in
practice
policymakers
and
police
department
leaders
attempting
to
apply
the
theory
often
condense
it
to
empirically
informed
officer
politeness
n
most
legitimacy
scholars
would
not
claim
that
the
lack
of
legitimacy
is
the
sole
problem
in
the
relationship
between
law
enforcement
and
african
american
and
poor
communities
or
that
procedural
justice
is
the
only
solution
needed
n
yet
much
of
the
current
reform
conversation
has
drawn
heavily
on
legitimacy
theory
and
the
procedural
justice
approach
as
if
they
are
silver
bullet
solutions
to
today
s
policing
crisis
reformers
have
done
so
in
part
because
the
proposals
that
emanate
from
the
procedural
justice
perspective
such
as
improved
officer
training
n
are
relatively
easy
for
police
agencies
to
implement
relatively
inexpensive
and
relatively
noncontroversial
while
offering
some
real
on
the
ground
benefits
to
civilians
who
encounter
the
police
n
if
the
solution
to
today
s
social
and
legal
policing
problems
is
training
the
path
forward
is
clear
yet
some
scholars
have
worried
that
without
an
emphasis
on
the
problem
of
collective
estrangement
through
social
and
racial
control
the
procedural
justice
solution
could
paradoxically
teach
officers
more
effective
ways
to
discriminate
and
violate
privacy
n
indeed
fourth
amendment
jurisprudence
on
the
voluntariness
of
searches
foregrounds
this
danger
courts
often
mention
the
politeness
or
courtesy
of
officers
when
using
a
totality
of
the
circumstances
analysis
to
decide
whether
a
warrantless
search
was
voluntary
at
times
debating
the
relative
importance
of
politeness
in
the
voluntariness
analysis
n
thin
conceptions
of
procedural
justice
could
produce
what
jeremy
bentham
called
sham
security
n
leaving
some
individuals
with
a
vague
sense
that
they
have
been
treated
justly
while
neglecting
more
fundamental
questions
of
justice
an
expanded
theoretical
approach
understands
distrust
as
a
problem
of
legal
estrangement
a
marginal
and
ambivalent
relationship
with
society
the
law
and
predominant
social
norms
that
emanates
from
institutional
and
legal
failure
in
the
following
part
i
discuss
estrangement
theory
and
its
distinctions
from
police
legitimacy
theory
in
greater
detail
the
legal
estrangement
perspective
can
provide
a
fresh
perspective
in
research
and
policy
on
the
extent
to
which
african
americans
and
people
who
live
in
high
poverty
communities
feel
a
sense
of
solidarity
with
law
enforcement
and
other
legal
institutions
moreover
this
approach
could
help
scholars
and
policymakers
imagine
new
ways
to
promote
solidarity
and
social
inclusion
through
law
and
policy
b
a
crisis
of
estrangement
while
legitimacy
theory
has
its
roots
in
weber
n
the
distinctive
elements
of
legal
estrangement
theory
are
rooted
in
mile
durkheim
for
durkheim
the
central
project
of
modern
society
is
to
maintain
organic
solidarity
defined
as
social
cohesion
based
on
fulfillment
of
the
different
functions
each
person
serves
within
society
n
ideally
law
s
function
is
to
create
and
maintain
social
cohesion
law
is
not
understood
as
an
end
in
itself
nor
solely
a
means
of
bodily
control
n
in
the
durkheimian
view
the
purpose
of
criminal
justice
is
to
restore
those
who
break
the
law
with
the
ultimate
goal
of
increasing
social
cohesion
by
reinforcing
moral
and
legal
norms
n
a
society
that
does
not
reinforce
moral
norms
and
does
not
promote
social
trust
leaves
its
inhabitants
in
a
state
of
anomie
with
broken
social
bonds
although
durkheim
originated
the
concept
of
anomie
the
idea
gained
greater
precision
and
liberation
from
its
purely
pro
state
perspective
in
the
work
of
robert
merton
for
merton
anomie
is
a
breakdown
in
the
cultural
structure
of
society
n
these
breakdowns
are
particularly
likely
to
occur
when
there
is
an
acute
disjunction
between
the
cultural
norms
and
goals
and
the
socially
structured
capacities
of
members
of
the
group
to
act
in
accord
with
them
n
in
other
words
cultural
structures
break
down
when
despite
a
group
s
adoption
of
mainstream
cultural
norms
and
goals
certain
aspects
of
the
social
structure
prevent
them
from
being
able
to
act
in
ways
that
support
those
norms
and
goals
although
the
suitability
of
durkheim
s
comprehensive
view
of
law
and
punishment
for
modern
contexts
is
questionable
n
the
broadest
reading
of
anomie
theory
that
the
purpose
of
the
legal
system
is
to
create
a
cohesive
and
inclusive
society
and
that
a
broken
social
order
leaves
some
people
without
the
resources
for
full
social
membership
is
at
the
root
of
legal
estrangement
theory
a
century
after
durkheim
originated
the
anomie
concept
and
decades
after
merton
refined
it
sociologists
robert
sampson
and
dawn
jeglum
bartusch
offered
legal
cynicism
as
a
framework
for
understanding
how
residents
of
predominantly
african
american
neighborhoods
in
chicago
thought
about
the
law
and
its
enforcers
n
sampson
and
bartusch
defined
legal
cynicism
as
anomie
about
law
n
anomie
is
more
than
distrust
instead
it
is
a
sense
that
the
very
fabric
of
the
social
world
is
in
chaos
a
sense
of
social
estrangement
meaninglessness
and
powerlessness
often
a
result
of
structural
instability
and
social
change
n
it
is
a
sense
founded
on
legal
and
institutional
exclusion
and
liminality
n
perhaps
the
strongest
articulation
of
legal
anomie
comes
from
eminent
ethnographer
elijah
anderson
who
credited
the
tendency
to
use
extra
legal
forms
of
violence
among
some
of
his
research
subjects
in
inner
city
philadelphia
to
the
profound
sense
of
alienation
from
mainstream
society
and
its
institutions
felt
by
many
poor
inner
city
black
people
n
in
contrast
law
that
is
well
designed
and
properly
enforced
should
reassure
community
members
that
society
has
not
abandoned
them
that
they
are
engaged
in
a
collective
project
of
making
the
social
world
one
concern
with
labeling
anomie
about
law
as
legal
cynicism
is
that
the
word
cynicism
suggests
that
the
attitudinal
perspective
of
communities
is
the
issue
of
interest
rather
than
the
process
that
led
to
a
cultural
orientation
toward
distrusting
the
police
the
legal
cynicism
term
works
for
the
approach
taken
by
sampson
and
bartusch
as
well
as
that
of
kirk
and
papachristos
as
both
seek
to
link
legal
cynicism
as
measured
in
a
survey
with
a
number
of
outcomes
however
anomie
refers
not
only
to
the
subjective
feeling
of
concern
it
is
also
meant
to
implicate
a
particular
set
of
structural
conditions
that
produced
that
subjective
feeling

i
use
legal
estrangement
in
this
essay
to
better
capture
the
fullness
of
the
idea
of
anomie
about
law
legal
estrangement
can
help
scholars
understand
situations
where
even
despite
the
embrace
of
legality
by
african
americans
and
residents
of
high
poverty
neighborhoods
and
regardless
of
the
degree
to
which
they
embrace
law
enforcement
officials
as
legitimate
authorities
they
are
nonetheless
structurally
ostracized
through
law
s
ideals
and
priorities
the
theoretical
and
empirical
genealogies
of
legitimacy
and
legal
cynicism
reveal
important
distinctions
first
the
overwhelming
majority
of
the
legitimacy
research
has
sought
to
describe
a
general
perception
of
law
enforcement
and
legal
authority
based
on
a
representative
sample
of
the
public
n
in
contrast
scholarship
on
legal
cynicism
the
attitudinal
portion
of
legal
estrangement
theory
has
generally
sought
to
describe
a
contextualized
ecological
view
of
law
enforcement
this
scholarship
has
particularly
focused
its
efforts
on
understanding
the
nature
of
the
fraught
relationship
between
african
americans
and
high
poverty
communities
on
the
one
hand
and
the
police
on
the
other
n
legal
estrangement
is
a
cultural
and
systemic
mechanism
that
exists
both
within
and
beyond
individual
perceptions
it
is
partly
representative
of
a
state
of
anomie
related
to
the
law
and
legal
authorities
and
it
interacts
with
legal
and
other
structural
conditions
for
example
poverty
racism
and
gender
hierarchy
to
maintain
segregation
and
dispossession
the
salience
of
a
targeted
collective
community
oriented
analysis
is
even
greater
when
seeking
to
understand
the
realities
that
gave
birth
to
black
lives
matter
many
scholars
and
advocates
have
argued
that
african
americans
are
particularly
likely
to
assess
the
legitimacy
effectiveness
and
justness
of
institutions
based
on
their
beliefs
about
how
these
institutions
treat
african
americans
as
a
group
and
not
just
their
individual
experiences
n
a
person
could
simultaneously
see
the
police
as
a
legitimate
authority
believing
that
individuals
should
obey
officer
commands
in
the
abstract
and
feel
estranged
from
the
police
believing
that
the
legal
system
and
law
enforcement
as
the
individual
s
group
experiences
these
institutions
are
fundamentally
flawed
and
chaotic
and
therefore
send
negative
messages
about
the
group
s
societal
belonging
n
some
scholarship
on
the
legal
mistrust
of
poor
african
americans
could
be
misread
to
suggest
that
a
large
subset
of
this
group
possesses
values
that
are
antithetical
to
law
abiding
behavior
almost
as
if
these
individuals
do
not
care
what
the
law
is
and
do
not
believe
they
should
be
bound
by
it
a
better
supported
interpretation
is
that
many
poor
african
americans
might
see
police
as
a
legitimate
authority
in
the
ideal
and
might
even
empathize
with
some
police
officers
plight
but
they
find
the
police
as
a
whole
too
corrupt
unpredictable
or
biased
to
deem
them
trustworthy
n
even
as
they
accept
the
ideal
vision
of
the
police
as
the
state
authorized
securers
of
public
safety
their
nonideal
working
theory
might
be
as
earlier
research
suggests
that
the
police
are
just
another
gang
n
estrangement
theory
can
improve
legitimacy
theory
in
three
main
ways
first
certainly
in
its
initial
stages
legitimacy
theory
has
emphasized
whether
people
feel
voluntarily
obligated
to
obey
or
cooperate
with
law
enforcement
the
theoretical
starting
point
of
legitimacy
analysis
is
whether
and
how
the
state
maintains
and
exercises
its
power
in
an
analysis
based
on
legal
estrangement
theory
increasing
the
power
of
the
state
bears
at
most
a
spurious
relationship
to
the
outcome
of
concern
which
is
social
inclusion
across
groups
from
a
robust
legal
estrangement
perspective
the
law
s
purpose
is
the
creation
and
maintenance
of
social
bonds
an
emphasis
on
inclusion
implies
concerns
not
only
about
how
individuals
perceive
the
police
and
the
law
and
thus
whether
those
individuals
cooperate
with
the
state
s
demands
but
about
the
signaling
function
of
the
police
and
the
law
to
groups
about
their
place
in
society
while
legitimacy
theorists
might
acknowledge
the
value
of
these
sorts
of
community
feelings
they
are
not
those
theorists
key
variables
of
interest
n
shifting
the
orientation
of
legitimacy
theory
from
governmental
power
to
social
inclusion
is
one
way
that
theory
can
better
capture
the
concerns
of
activists
in
the
era
of
black
lives
matter
second
given
its
origins
in
legal
cynicism
theory
a
legal
estrangement
perspective
emphasizes
cultural
orientation
toward
the
police
rather
than
individual
attitudes
about
the
police
a
cultural
inquiry
is
concerned
with
the
symbolic
and
structural
meaning
of
the
police

particular
groups
of
people
as
opposed
to

their

about
whether

be

and
the
symbolic
meanings
they
attach
to
the
police
can
be
sharply
divergent
from
each
other
n
third
while
most
legitimacy
theorists
treat
individuals
as
their
unit
of
analysis
and
theorization
the
legal
estrangement
framework
is
ultimately
focused
on
groups
and
communities
even
as
studies
are
unavoidably
conducted
by
looking
at
individual
experiences
the
broader
concern
of
legal
estrangement
is
with
understanding

in

distrust
of

as
a

day
every
day
nine
o
clock
in
the
morning
until
nine
o
clock
at
night
when
my
mom
was
calling
me
to
get
off
the
court
that
s
where
i
was
at
n
during
baltimore
s
sticky
summers
the
time
of
year
when
the
rate
of
violent
crime
is
at
its
apex
n
shawna
sought
freedom
and
community
on
sandtown
winchester
s
asphalt
basketball
courts
one
can
imagine
shawna
sucking
in
the
steamy
air
wearing
basketball
shoes
not
unlike
the
red
and
white
nikes
she
is
wearing
now
teasing
her
opponents
being
a
kid
i
wanted
to
stay
outside
as
long
as
i
can
she
explained
stay
outside
until
nine
or
ten
o
clock
in
the
summer
time
especially
yes
that
s
when
the
most
violence
happens
but
that
s
when
the
most
fun
happens
shawna
understood
pleasure
more
viscerally
than
danger
despite
everything
she
had
seen
one
of
shawna
s
first
virtues
was
vigilance
she
learned
early
how
to
manage
the
potentially
deadly
situation
of
being
outdoors
in
the
gilmor
homes
just
being
so
young
you
have
to
be
aware
i
mean
you
can
have
fun
but
just
be
aware
of
what
s
really
going
on
around
you
there
was
so
much
drug
activity
but
being
so
young
i
didn
t
really
pay
a
lot
of
attention
because
i
was
just
worried
about
having
fun
despite
the
pestilence
of
untimely
death
that
then
and
now
marks
her
neighborhood
n
shawna
has
thus
far
been
spared
the
memory
of
seeing
a
human
being
die
but
she
is
familiar
with
the
pop
pop
pop
of
gunshots
interrupting
a
basketball
game
she
can
still
hear
the
hum
of
an
open
windowed
truck
rolling
closer
while
prowling
for
targets
the
screams
of
neighbors
recognizing
a
familiar
horror
the
thumps
of
her
playmates
chests
hitting
the
ground
seeking
safety
and
the
thuds
of
their
shoes
rapidly
beating
the
hot
asphalt
where
they
had
been
dribbling
a
ball
moments
earlier
she
remembers
that
a
sudden
paralysis
afflicted
her
limbs
on
those
occasions
she
remembers
that
her
mother
would
run
to
her
corral
her
somebody
would
get
shot
somebody
would
get
killed
somebody
would
get
stabbed
outside
my
house
in
front
of
my
house
on
the
basketball
court
where
i
spent
most
of
my
time
there
for
real
shawna
s
mother
denise
was
in
shawna
s
estimation
paranoid
every
now
and
then
denise
got
fed
up
and
called
the
police
about
various
neighborhood
disturbances
she
s
a
good
person
shawna
explained
but
denise
avoided
calling
the
police
from
her
own
phone
and
instead
went
to
a
neighbor
s
home
to
call
to
be
sure
denise
sometimes
called
police
from
a
neighbor
s
phone
because
her
own
phone
was
disconnected
but
shawna
suspects
that
the
more
usual
reason
denise
called
from
her
neighbor
s
phone
was
so
the
call
would
come
from
a
number
other
than
hers
making
it
more
difficult
for
police
and
potential
retaliators
to
learn
that
she
was
the
snitch
she
had
to
call
from
some
other
number
because
she
just
it
was
unsafe
for
her
people
can
call
the
police
anonymously
n
but
denise
suspected
the
police
would
find
out
who
she
was
anyway
and
that
they
would
be
too
careless
to
protect
her
identity
denise
warned
shawna
about
crime
in
the
neighborhood
and
kept
shawna
indoors
as
much
as
the
active
extroverted
girl
could
tolerate
denise
also
warned
shawna
about
the
neighborhood
s
police
petrified
by
her
daughter
s
awe
of
them
w
hen
i
was
little
shawna
recalled
i
used
to
idolize
the
police
and
i
used
to
be
like
oh
can
i
be
like
you
when
i
grow
up
what
is
it
that
you
do
asking
them
a
whole
bunch
of
questions
her
mother
urged
her
to
stay
away
from
police
officers
once
when
shawna
was
about
eight
years
old
she
was
chatting
with
two
white
police
officers
who
she
thinks
were
in
the
neighborhood
to
investigate
drug
activity
as
shawna
remembers
it
she
asked
the
officers
what
they
do
how
she
could
become
a
police
officer
and
so
on
i
was
a
serious
young
lady
shawna
joked
denise
saw
shawna
with
the
officers
and
panicked
get
over
here
get
over
here
get
over
here
girl
shawna
asked
w
hat
did
i
do
denise
continued
agitated
who
told
you
to
talk
to
them
they
can
do
anything
to
you
they
can
take
you
and
kill
you
shawna
was
perplexed
they
re
police
why
would
they
just
take
me
and
kill
me
over
the
decade
or
so
since
that
incident
shawna
s
once
pristine
view
of
police
has
grown
ever
more
tainted
this
tarnishing
process
has
been
propelled
not
only
by
her
personal
experiences
but
also
through
witnessing
the
encounters
of
her
friends
and
neighbors
hearing
about
other
incidents
through
television
and
social
media
and
gaining
folk
wisdom
from
family
and
older
community
members
for
example
several
years
before
the
daniel
holtzclaw
case
broke
n
as
a
pubescent
girl
shawna
learned
from
her
grandmother
that
the
police
could
rape
her
i
don
t
know
the
whole
story
but
my
grandma
told
me
how
one
of
the
police
in
my
community
some
man
had
taken
this
little
girl
she
was
about
twelve
i
don
t
know
if
she
was
missing
or
if
he
just
took
her
anyway
he
took
her
and
he
raped
her
in
the
back
of
the
police
station
and
they
caught
it
on
camera
then
my
grandmother
told
me
about
it
i
was
like
twelve
at
the
time
which
was
just
a
couple
of
years
after
the
rape
i
was
like
wow
shawna
s
confusion
grew
the
police
is
supposed
to
have
power
and
supposed
to
be
using
it
for
good
but
the
police
also
did
that
to
that
little
girl
it
s
just
terrible
that
story
funneled
through
her
beloved
grandmother
is
now
embedded
in
her
psyche
and
colors
her
more
recent
experiences
with
and
observations
of
police
officers
that
just
made
me
think
twice
about
the
police
ever
since
then
i
just
don
t
know
the
case
shawna
is
likely
referencing
involved
william
d
welch
a
former
baltimore
police
officer
who
entered
an
alford
plea
n
to
a
charge
of
misconduct
in
office
in
early
when
shawna
was
ten
n
after
another
officer
arrested
a
sixteen
year
old
girl
based
on
an
open
warrant
for
prostitution
welch
allegedly
offered
to
dispose
of
marijuana
that
was
in
her
possession
if
she
sexually
serviced
him
according
to
the
accuser
she
and
welch
flushed
the
marijuana
down
a
police
station
toilet
and
returned
to
the
interview
room
where
she
complied
with
his
conditions
n
prosecutors
originally
charged
welch
with
second
degree
rape
however
after
the
police
department
s
evidence
control
unit
misplaced
much
of
the
physical
evidence
against
welch
prosecutors
offered
and
welch
accepted
a
plea
deal
n
welch
thus
avoided
prison
a
judge
sentenced
welch
to
a
suspended
ten
year
prison
term
after
three
years
of
probation
and
ordered
him
to
resign
from
the
baltimore
police
department
n
but
shawna
might
have
been
talking
about
a
different
case
there
were
other
prominent
rape
cases
against
baltimore
police
officers
in
roughly
the
same
time
period
like
the
welch
case
the
facts
of
those
cases
do
not
perfectly
align
with
the
story
lodged
in
shawna
s
mind
today
n
shawna
s
understanding
of
the
police
grew
darker
still
through
encounters
and
observations
at
the
bus
station
near
the
iconic
mondawmin
mall
arguably
west
baltimore
s
central
hub
mondawmin
one
of
the
city
s
oldest
enclosed
shopping
malls
is
more
than
a
retail
center
it
is
also
the
nerve
center
for
ten
west
baltimore
bus
lines
and
the
location
of
government
social
services
offices
and
various
health
clinics
n
inside
the
mall
uniformed
private
security
guards
are
tasked
with
maintaining
mondawmin
s
security
while
on
the
outside
western
district
police
officers
handle
the
job
shawna
does
not
distinguish
between
the
public
and
private
police
she
just
knows
that
when
she
is
in
or
near
mondawmin
she
encounters
hostile
people
in
uniform
n
shawna
reports
several
negative
encounters
there
but
nothing
that
would
earn
the
attention
of
journalists
researchers
or
most
advocates
she
has
experienced
at
most
possibly
idle
threats
that
the
next
time
a
police
officer
sees
her
he
will
mace
or
even
arrest
her
these
threats
these
forceful
words
would
not
register
as
uses
of
force
in
the
most
sophisticated
studies
of
police
encounters
n
yet
they
have
constrained
her
movement
the
grind
of
injustice
has
led
shawna
to
avoid
mondawmin
as
much
as
possible
though
the
mall
s
ubiquity
makes
it
hard
to
fully
escape
i
stopped
going
to
mondawmin
because
the
police
up
there
are
rude
i
mean
i
know
you
re
trying
to
keep
order
and
peace
but
you
don
t
have
to
disrespect
me
and
threaten
me
every
five
seconds
they
threatened
to
mace
people
if
they
don
t
get
to
their
bus
stop
then
the
man
told
me
he
was
going
to
arrest
me
because
i
was
talking
to
my
home
girl
and
i
wouldn
t
get
on
the
bus
it
wasn
t
my
bus
i
was
at
the
bus
stop
talking
to
her
why
are
you
threatening
to
arrest
me
shawna
claims
that
the
officer
followed
her
and
her
friend
after
they
began
to
walk
away
he
kept
getting
smart
with
his
little
cowboy
boots
i
was
just
like
who
are
these
police
like
where
did
they
come
from
shawna
had
a
few
stories
from
mondawmin
including
watching
a
young
man
get
arrested
who
wasn
t
probably
all
innocent
but
in
her
view
wasn
t
doing
anything
he
wasn
t
supposed
to
be
doing
the
gilmor
homes
where
shawna
spent
the
first
sixteen
of
her
nineteen
years
has
recently
been
in
the
national
media
as
the
home
of
freddie
gray
the
twenty
five
year
old
baltimore
man
who
died
in
police
custody
on
april
n
mondawmin
was
a
starting
site
of
the
ensuing
riots
n
shawna
was
nearby
when
the
riots
broke
out
trying
to
head
to
a
friend
s
house
for
spaghetti
shawna
s
views
on
the
riots
vacillate
from
empathy
for
the
good
police
officers
who
have
been
unfairly
demonized
to
frustration
at
the
destruction
of
already
limited
west
baltimore
institutions
to
condemnation
of
unjust
police
practices
to
pragmatic
belief
in
the
necessity
of
the
police
i
felt
bad
for
the
police
though
when
they
were
rioting
they
were
throwing
bricks
at
the
police
cars
and
all
this
other
stuff
first
of
all
you
re
going
to
need
them
second
of
all
every
police
officer
is
not
bad
belying
usual
portrayals
of
people
like
shawna
in
the
media
and
in
most
research
shawna
readily
acknowledges
the
humanity
of
officers
and
the
heterogeneity
of
police
forces
h
e
s
got
kids
too
he
s
got
to
live
too
he
s
got
to
eat
too
and
if
he
wanted
to
be
a
police
officer
that
doesn
t
mean
every
police
officer
is
bad
still
some
of
them
have
to
go
despite
the
negative
representation
of
baltimore
youth
in
the
national
media
during
the
riots
and
what
she
sees
as
the
inherent
wrong
of
riotous
behavior
shawna
has
ambivalently
started
to
believe
that
the
riots
were
a
necessary
catalyst
for
the
police
officers
to
face
criminal
charges
n
it
might
not
be
right
to
riot
but
if
they
wouldn
t
have
done
that
they
would
never
have
pressed
charges
on
the
police
officers
it
might
have
been
terrible
for
our
community
and
made
us
look
a
mess
especially
to
the
nation
to
everybody
who
saw
it
shawna
is
upset
that
some
leaders
used
the
controversial
term
thugs
when
referring
to
baltimore
rioters
despite
not
participating
in
the
riot
herself
shawna
felt
that
the
label
was
directed
at
young
african
american
west
baltimoreans
in
general
it
really
hurt
my
feelings
that
they
called
us
thugs
i
saw
a
video
on
that
too
they
included
president
obama
who
described
the
rioters
as
criminals
and
thugs
who
tore
up
the
place
n
maryland
governor
larry
hogan
who
depicted
them
as
gangs
of
thugs
whose
only
intent
was
to
bring
violence
and
destruction
to
the
city
n
baltimore
city
council
president
bernard
c
jack
young
who
distinguished
between
legitimate
sandtown
winchester
residents
and
thugs
seizing
upon
an
opportunity
n
and
baltimore
mayor
stephanie
rawlings
blake
who
lamented
that
young
rioters
were
disrespecting
the
legacy
of
people
who
had
fought
for
the
city
in
the
past
too
many
people
have
spent
generations
building
up
this
city
for
it
to
be
destroyed
by
thugs
who
in
a
very
senseless
way
are
trying
to
tear
down
what
so
many
have
fought
for
rawlings
blake
said
n
after
extensive
criticism
rawlings
blake
and
young
backed
away
from
using
the
term
thug
n
the
white
house
stood
behind
the
president
s
choice
of
words
n
talking
with
us
only
a
few
weeks
after
the
murder
of
nine
people
in
charleston
south
carolina
s
emanuel
african
methodist
episcopal
church
n
shawna
compared
charleston
officers
humane
treatment
of
shooter
dylann
roof
with
baltimore
officers
aggression
toward
freddie
gray
she
shook
her
head
with
disgust
they
bought
him
burger
king
they
bought
him
burger
king
but
they
couldn
t
even
get
freddie
gray
to
a
hospital
n
i
asked
shawna
how
she
knew
about
all
of
these
things
the
details
of
freddie
gray
s
arrest
the
series
of
thug
speeches
and
the
burger
king
trip
for
dylann
roof
it
was
on
facebook
a
lot
of
things
are
on
facebook
shawna
pointed
out
later
i
asked
her
do
you
want
to
be
a
police
officer
anymore
whoa
shawna
chuckled
i
gave
that
dream
up
now
entering
her
final
year
of
high
school
shawna
desultorily
explained
that
her
goals
for
the
next
several
years
are
to
just
better
myself
in
the
years
to
come
that
s
what
i
want
to
do
i
just
want
to
be
better
the
legitimacy
perspective
would
offer
an
incomplete
diagnosis
of
the
unsettled
relationship
between
the
police
and
someone
like
shawna
a
thoughtful
young
woman
who
has
never
had
any
serious
police
encounter
who
has
managed
to
avoid
getting
a
criminal
record
and
who
is
a
general
law
abider
wanting
to
trust
the
police
but
convinced
that
the
police
are
not
trustworthy
for
people
like
her
shawna
is
generally
compliant
with
the
law
and
believes
police
officers
should
be
respected
she
thinks
that
it
is
good
to
help
police
officers
and
she
appreciates
that
her
mother
would
stealthily
report
crime
from
a
law
enforcement
perspective
people
like
shawna
are
allies
and
assets
to
the
community
shawna
behaves
like
someone
who
views
the
police
as
a
legitimate
legal
authority
yet
shawna
s
views
also
reflect
a
deep
sense
of
alienation
about
police
she
stopped
going
to
the
mall
to
avoid
interacting
with
the
officers
there
she
abandoned
her
childhood
dream
of
becoming
a
police
officer
even
though
she
possesses
the
presence
personality
and
background
to
be
an
excellent
law
enforcement
official
she
fears
that
police
might
kill
or
sexually
assault
someone
like
her
a
young
low
income
black
woman
who
lives
in
west
baltimore
although
shawna
sees
the
law
and
its
enforcers
as
worthy
of
obedience
as
a
theoretical
matter
she
does
not
believe
that
law
enforcement
officials
see
her
and
people
like
her
as
a
true
part
of
the
polity
she
is
nothing
more
than
a
thug
this
understanding
of
her
group
s
place
in
the
world
does
not
lead
to
lawbreaking
or
noncooperation
as
a
legitimacy
perspective
might
predict
n
yet
her
words
nonetheless
reveal
a
cleavage
or
estrangement
from
the
enforcers
of
the
law
her
story
reveals
that
the
empirical
outcome
that
legitimacy
theory
is
best
used
to
explain
is
the
wrong
outcome
shawna
s
problem
is
not
noncompliance
but
symbolic
community
exclusion
iv
a
tripartite
theory
of
legal
estrangement
to
this
point
this
essay
has
argued
that
scholars
and
policymakers
should
understand
persistent
police
distrust
among
african
americans
and
residents
of
high
poverty
communities
as
a
problem
of
legal
estrangement
a
cultural
orientation
about
the
law
that
emanates
from
collective
symbolic
and
structural
exclusion
that
is
both
subjective
and
objective
factors
in
this
part
i
further
define
legal
estrangement
theory
i
argue
that
legal
estrangement
is
a
product
of
three
socio
legal
processes
procedural
injustice
vicarious
marginalization
and
structural
exclusion
all
of
these
processes
are
supported
in
the
empirical
literature
although
their
primary
justifications
emerge
from
theory
below
i
explain
each
process
in
greater
detail
drawing
upon
the
literature
and
offering
real
world
illustrations
from
qualitative
data
a
procedural
injustice
building
from
the
legitimacy
and
procedural
justice
scholarship
described
in
part
ii
i
argue
that
experiences
in
which
individuals
feel
treated
unfairly
by
the
police
are
one
key
provocateur
of
legal
estrangement
the
procedural
injustice
component
operates
at
the
individual
and
attitudinal
level
but
writ
large
expands
to
the
cultural
level
n
survey
research
indicates
that
a
feeling
that
the
police
have
behaved
disrespectfully
feeds
into
an
overall
disbelief
in
the
legitimacy
of
the
law
and
law
enforcement
n
the
path
to
legitimacy
from
a
procedural
justice
perspective
requires
treatment
with
dignity
and
respect
acknowledgment
of
one
s
rights
and
concerns
and
a
general
awareness
of
the
importance
of
recognizing
people
s
personal
status
and
identity
and
treating
those
with
respect
even
while
raising
questions
about
particular
conduct
n
consider
the
example
of
justin
n
an
eighteen
year
old
african
american
man
living
in
northeast
baltimore
who
is
heading
to
a
small
religious
college
out
of
state
on
an
athletic
scholarship
he
had
wanted
to
aim
for
an
ivy
league
school
because
his
high
school
grades
were
strong
but
according
to
him
his
sat
score
was
nearly
points
shy
of
the
baseline
justin
s
police
encounters
typify
and
bleed
into
a
general
feeling
that
he
is
socially
and
politically
powerless
the
criminal
justice
system
just
get
s
so
irritating
just
to
know
you
can
t
do
nothing
about
it
he
groused
you
have
a
voice
but
then
it
s
your
voice
and
billions
of
other
voices
if
everybody
s
not
together
and
its
one
side
against
the
other
your
voice
basically
doesn
t
matter
it
just
gets
so
frustrating
how
disrespectful
somebody
with
high
power
can
be
it
just
gets
annoying
to
illustrate
his
point
about
disrespect
from
people
in
power
justin
told
us
about
his
most
recent
police
encounter
n
he
and
his
friends
were
in
hunt
valley
a
small
suburb
just
north
of
baltimore
city
limits
known
for
its
expansive
recently
reinvigorated
outdoor
shopping
mall
at
around
pm
as
they
walked
toward
the
light
rail
station
that
would
carry
them
home
to
west
baltimore
they
were
stopped
by
a
police
officer
they
were
walking
in
the
street
along
one
side
they
felt
more
comfortable
walking
in
the
road
than
on
the
sidewalk
because
there
were
woods
on
either
side
of
the
street
it
s
night
time
i
don
t
want
to
be
over
there
for
one
you
got
to
think
there
s
mosquitoes
ticks
and
stuff
like
that
people
could
be
hiding
over
there
n
according
to
justin
the
officer
pulled
them
over
questioned
them
about
what
they
were
doing
and
ran
all
of
their
information
the
officer
ultimately
only
gave
them
warnings
for
walking
in
the
street
justin
repeated
the
charge
still
with
a
hint
of
disbelief
for
walking
in
the
street
for
walking
in
the
street
n
what
irked
justin
more
than
the
warning
though
was
the
police
officer
s
apparent
disregard
for
their
travel
timetable
while
they
were
stopped
justin
and
his
friends
told
the
officer
that
they
were
on
their
way
to
the
light
rail
station
and
that
they
needed
to
get
there
quickly
because
the
rail
stops
running
at
midnight
they
were
not
sure
when
the
last
train
to
baltimore
would
depart
so
they
were
trying
to
get
there
as
soon
as
possible
the
officer
assured
them
that
they
would
make
their
train
yet
by
the
time
he
checked
their
information
and
issued
their
warning
tickets
it
was
approximately
am
justin
s
bitterness
about
missing
the
train
had
not
yet
faded
when
i
say
they
didn
t
let
us
go
until
about
they
didn
t
let
us
go
until
and
only
gave
us
warnings
for
walking
in
the
street
justin
now
expects
that
the
police
will
not
value
his
time
he
has
resigned
himself
to
this
signal
of
his
own
inconsequentiality
whatever
it
is
whatever
you
need
go
ahead
because
now
i
know
we
on
your
time
now
once
you
stop
me
even
if
i
did
nothing
wrong
we
on
your
time
so
i
might
as
well
just
get
it
over
with
let
you
do
what
you
re
going
to
do
i
know
you
re
going
to
be
disrespectful
i
m
prepared
for
that
i
know
you
re
going
to
be
disrespectful
it
s
up
to
me
how
i
m
going
to
react
to
that
when
asked
if
he
had
other
experiences
like
that
one
justin
could
not
answer
precisely
he
knows
that
he
has
been
stopped
many
times
but
he
tries
not
to
dwell
on
those
encounters
preferring
to
focus
on
school
work
sports
and
females
he
also
tries
to
minimize
the
importance
of
race
in
this
unnamed
number
of
police
encounters
i
just
hate
the
way
how
they
can
be
so
disrespectful
to
us
like
we
re
not
human
or
nothing
it
s
like
this
stereotype
where
you
think
a
young
african
american
or
not
even
a
young
african
american
just
a
young
individual
period
just
walking
you
think
they
re
up
to
something
he
tries
instead
to
look
at
his
police
encounters
from
a
power
and
authority
perspective
in
part
just
to
avoid
the
stress
of
seeing
the
world
as
racist
n
people
who
have
never
had
power
before
they
finally
get
power
and
they
want
to
abuse
it
i
try
my
best
not
to
look
at
it
as
a
racial
thing
because
i
know
that
s
only
going
to
make
me
mad
and
stress
me
out
so
i
try
to
look
at
it
from
all
angles
justin
is
an
ambitious
young
man
one
of
the
few
in
the
sample
who
had
the
good
fortune
of
having
solid
college
plans
he
has
carefully
curated
his
group
of
friends
to
include
only
those
who
keep
each
other
focused
mostly
fellow
college
bound
athletes
if
justin
had
been
answering
a
survey
about
legal
compliance
there
is
a
reasonable
chance
that
he
would
have
marked
that
he
adheres
to
most
laws
and
believes
that
it
is
important
to
do
so
yet
he
deeply
distrusts
the
police
partly
because
he
believes
that
they
treat
him
and
other
young
baltimoreans
with
disrespect
in
order
to
assert
their
authority
n
in
addition
he
has
serious
doubts
about
whether
the
police
would
be
helpful
if
he
needed
them
saying
that
no
matter
what
the
issue
was
he
would
not
call
the
police
i
call
the
police
i
m
not
doing
nothing
for
nobody
if
i
call
the
police
there
s
a
possibility
they
might
turn
on
me
those
feelings
of
being
both
under
surveillance
and
unprotected
have
created
a
devil
s
brew
of
legal
estrangement
such
that
even
a
youth
like
justin
who
has
thus
far
been
able
to
avoid
the
criminalization
process
common
for
young
men
of
color
n
would
rather
pursue
extralegal
help
with
neighborhood
concerns
than
trust
in
the
police
as
for
the
midnight
police
encounter
on
the
facts
as
justin
presented
them
there
is
little
doubt
that
the
stop
was
lawful
the
officer
saw
justin
and
his
friends
walking
in
the
middle
of
the
street
in
violation
of
maryland
state
law
n
he
stopped
them
asked
them
what
they
were
doing
ran
their
identification
apparently
finding
no
open
warrants
and
sent
them
on
their
way
with
only
a
warning
justin
had
two
problems
with
the
stop
he
feels
that
the
very
reason
they
were
stopped
was
generalized
suspicion
of
young
people
and
possibly
young
black
people
and
that
the
officer
did
not
care
that
this
stop
caused
them
to
miss
their
ride
home
this
stop
was
less
awful
than
it
could
have
been
but
it
factors
heavily
into
justin
s
concerns
about
the
police
and
the
larger
social
structure
justin
s
story
illustrates
how
procedural
injustice
even
at
a
relatively
minor
level
creates
and
reinforces
legal
estrangement
the
legitimacy
literature
though
concerned
with
procedural
injustice
does
not
offer
an
account
that
illuminates
justin
s
concerns
about
the
police
he
willingly
complied
with
the
officer
s
commands
not
out
of
fear
but
from
a
sense
that
generally
speaking
he
ought
to
obey
the
instructions
of
law
enforcement
officers
however
the
experience
nonetheless
contributed
to
his
sense
that
there
is
a
schism
between
young
baltimoreans
and
the
police
yet
procedural
injustice
is
only
one
leg
of
legal
estrangement
s
three
legged
stool
the
benefits
of
a
legal
estrangement
perspective
emerge
more
clearly
when
considering
the
additional
processes
of
vicarious
marginalization
and
structural
exclusion
b
vicarious
marginalization
the
second
contributor
to
legal
estrangement
discussed
here
is
vicarious
marginalization
the
marginalizing
effect
of
police
maltreatment
that
is
targeted
toward
others
although
the
literature
on
legal
socialization
legitimacy
and
legal
cynicism
vaguely
acknowledges
the
influence
of
police
experiences
within
people
s
social
networks
and
the
impact
of
highly
publicized
misconduct
on
cultural
orientations
about
the
law
the
scholarly
treatment
of
vicarious
experience
is
thin
relative
to
the
treatment
of
personal
experience
n
this
deficit
is
in
part
a
disciplinary
artifact
most
legal
socialization
and
legal
legitimacy
research
draws
from
social
psychology
which
by
definition
focuses
primarily
on
understanding
individuals
internal
lives
and
how
they
relate
to
their
personal
interactions
and
behaviors
n
the
legitimacy
literature
has
been
interested
in
generalized
views
and
societal
orientations
but
it
focuses
mostly
on
whether
one
can
generalize
from
personal
experiences
instead
of
whether
and
how
impersonal
vicarious
experiences
also
contribute
to
social
orientations
n
sociological
and
socio
legal
theory
in
contrast
provides
a
theoretical
grounding
for
the
idea
that
other
people
s
negative
experiences
with
the
police
whether
those
people
are
part
of
one
s
personal
network
or
not
feed
into
a
more
general
cultural
sense
of
alienation
from
the
police
n
legal
estrangement
is
born
of
the
cumulative
collective
experience
of
procedural
and
substantive
injustice
in
the
study
of
incarceration
scholars
have
developed
a
clearer
view
of
the
cultural
contagiousness
of
criminal
justice
contact
for
example
naomi
sugie
finds
that
the
female
romantic
partners
of
formerly
incarcerated
men
are
less
likely
to
vote
to
register
to
vote
and
to
believe
that
voting
is
important
than
similarly
situated
women
who
are
not
partnered
with
a
formerly
incarcerated
man
n
while
voting
and
registering
are
behaviors
the
belief
that
voting
is
important
is
an
attitude
that
might
in
the
aggregate
reach
the
level
of
a
cultural
orientation
along
similar
lines
megan
comfort
argues
that
the
romantic
partners
of
men
serving
time
in
prison
undergo
a
process
of
secondary
prisonization
adopting
routinized
behaviors
styles
of
self
presentation
ways
of
speaking
and
even
sexual
desires
that
are
shaped
by
their
vicarious
incarceration
n
researchers
are
exploring
the
effects
of
incarceration
on
the
worldviews
of
the
children
of
incarcerated
parents
n
moreover
the
vicarious
effects
of
incarceration
are
not
limited
to
the
intimate
partners
and
children
of
the
incarcerated
for
example
in
their
study
of
the
relationship
between
race
mass
incarceration
and
distrust
in
the
law
christopher
muller
and
daniel
schrage
find
that
african
americans
who
had
a
formerly
incarcerated
close
friend
or
family
member
were
more
likely
than
other
african
americans
to
blame
bias
among
the
police
and
courts
for
the
criminal
justice
system
s
racial
disparities
n
yet
at
the
front
end
of
the
criminal
justice
continuum
scholars
rarely
probe
these
cultural
emergences
n
more
work
needs
to
be
done
to
examine
the
collective
memory
of
police
interaction
defined
as
the
cultural
conception
of
what
it
is
like
to
interact
with
the
police
that
emanates
in
part
from
membership
in
a
group
or
identity
category
here
in
various
degrees
being
african
american
or
residing
in
a
racially
and
socioeconomically
isolated
neighborhood
collective
memories
are
based
on
some
combination
of
personal
experience
observing
and
hearing
about
the
experiences
of
others
passing
accumulated
wisdom
from
parent
to
child
observing
interactions
in
public
space
seeing
or
not
seeing
murals
and
other
forms
of
public
commemoration
watching
television
scrolling
through
social
media
and
sharing
all
of
these
personal
and
vicarious
experiences
in
the
community
n
in
other
areas
of
legal
inquiry
such
as
constitutional
interpretation
state
sponsored
mass
violence
interracial
marriage
and
general
racial
inequality
scholars
have
probed
the
role
that
collective
memory
plays
in
the
law
and
legal
institutions
n
through
a
combination
of
major
social
upheavals
and
everyday
forms
of
information
gathering
people
come
to
understand
themselves
and
gain
perspective
on
what
it
means
to
be
a
part
of
a
group
be
it
a
religion
a
race
or
even
a
business
n
most
studies
of
collective
memory
focus
on
clear
often
tragic
historical
events
that
had
a
cognizable
beginning
and
end
such
as
american
slavery
or
the
holocaust
n
however
some
research
and
theory
argue
that
there
can
be
broader
sorts
of
collective
memory
such
as
a
collective
memory
of
racism
and
discrimination
that
ground
people
s
interpretations
of
day
to
day
interracial
experiences
n
in
this
sense
police
maltreatment
and
discrimination
can
also
become
sites
for
collective
memory
and
collective
identity
construction
vicarious
marginalization
in
the
context
of
policing
then
is
ultimately
about
how
people
draw
upon
information
other
than
their
own
experiences
as
police
targets
or
suspects
to
understand
their
group
s
common
experience
with
law
enforcement
there
is
no
better
illustration
of
how
vicarious
marginalization
might
operate
and
what
its
repercussions
might
be
than
current
events
involving
police
officer
maltreatment
of
african
americans
as
explained
above
distrustful
relationships
between
police
officers
and
african
american
communities
are
longstanding
and
deep
seated
however
the
recent
stream
of
videos
of
violent
police
interactions
has
along
with
organizing
techniques
given
birth
to
the
black
lives
matter
movement
this
movement
has
elevated
police
violence
to
the
national
collective
consciousness
sparking
community
organizing
and
policy
advocacy
n
some
have
claimed
that
the
seemingly
ceaseless
stream
of
grisly
scenes
on
television
and
social
media
are
giving
birth
to
a
new
form
of
race
based
posttraumatic
stress
n
but
short
of
or
in
addition
to
race
based
trauma
the
ritualistic
observation
of
black
men
and
women
having
unjust
and
often
deadly
interactions
with
law
enforcement
conveys
a
message
to
their
coethnics
and
other
similarly
situated
observers
n
that
message
might
be
that
the
police
as
a
whole
are
dangerous
untrustworthy
and
opposed
to
the
idea
that
african
americans
and
the
poor
are
truly
members
of
the
polity
group
conversations
both
in
person
and
through
social
media
can
crystallize
that
message
n
legal
estrangement
emerging
out
of
personal
and
vicarious
experiences
serves
as
a
lens
through
which
many
african
americans
interpret
past
and
future
engagements
with
law
enforcement
officials
videos
of
negative
police
interactions
may
elevate
personal
experiences
to
a
cultural
level
by
demonstrating
to
people
who
have
had
negative
police
interactions
that
their
experiences
are
not
unique
media
coverage
that
emphasizes
particular
aspects
of
police
interactions
such
as
race
gender
or
perceived
criminality
provide
a
schema
for
interpreting
one
s
own
experiences
in
ways
that
positive
experiences
may
not
fully
overcome
by
contributing
to
conceptions
of
how
police
treat
particular
groups
n
media
coverage
may
heighten
legal
estrangement
by
providing
evidence
that
we
are
living
in
a
moment
of
cultural
and
legal
instability
regarding
race
and
the
police
and
it
may
increase
culture
s
power
to
drive
perhaps
undesirable
behavior
such
as
avoiding
the
police
refusing
to
call
on
them
for
help
or
engaging
in
law
breaking
activity
n
yet
the
mechanisms
that
give
birth
to
vicarious
marginalization
are
not
limited
to
television
and
social
media
some
youth
in
the
baltimore
sample
reported
observing
the
police
mistreating
others
whether
strangers
parents
and
friends
and
they
factored
those
observations
into
their
assessments
of
police
untrustworthiness
others
talked
about
the
experiences
of
parents
siblings
and
friends
that
they
did
not
personally
witness
but
that
were
nonetheless
salient
in
developing
their
orientations
toward

year
old
jamila
n
lives
in
the
mcculloh
homes
family
public
housing
development
n
with
her
mother
her
mother
s
boyfriend
and
her
eight
siblings
the
space
is
crowded
and
the
neighborhood
is
dotted
with
liquor
stores
payday
lenders
and
street
memorials
institutional
and
symbolic
indicators
of
concentrated
poverty
and
heavy
crime
n
but
jamila
is
grateful
to
be
there
more
or
less
having
spent
significant
periods
of
her
childhood
bouncing
through
a
series
of
homes
and
homeless
shelters
as
her
mother
cycled
through
abusive
relationships
jamila
s
four
years
in
the
mcculloh
homes
have
been
in
a
way
a
welcome
reprieve
the
first
time
jamila
remembers
interacting
with
the
police
she
was
ten
and
her
mother
got
into
a
physical
fight
with
her
boyfriend
the
officers
who
were
both
people
of
noncolor
a
term
jamila
prefers
to
white
spoke
to
jamila
and
her
sister
using
words
they
could
understand
they
walked
the
two
young
girls
to
the
store
for
snacks
hoping
to
momentarily
distract
them
from
the
violence
at
home
and
shield
them
from
the
sight
of
their
mother
s
contused
face
she
said
it
was
a
good
experience
but
she
does
not
believe
police
officers
today
about
eight
years
later
could
reproduce
that
positive
interaction
people
in
enforcement
now
there
are
a
lot
of
younger
officers
in
the
force
today
than
it
was
then
people
really
cared
about
their
job
then
now
people
just
look
at
it
for
the
money
that
they
are
going
to
make
n
when
jamila
graduated
from
high
school
in
she
became
the
first
person
in
generations
of
her
family
to
do
so
this
triumph
has
inspired
her
younger
brothers
that
s
very
big
for
them
very
very
big
and
they
look
up
to
me
now
jamila
explained
to
us
one
of
them
like
a
younger
shawna
aspires
to
enroll
in
the
police
academy
and
join
the
ranks
of
police
officers
jamila
appreciates
this
goal
as
she
thinks
police
have
an
important
social
role
to
play
police
men
and
women
at
the
end
of
the
day
we
kind
of
need
them
to
keep
the
city
safe
but
it
s
how
you
do
it
is
what
really
matters
because
you
can
t
just
walk
into
a
neighborhood
and
get
scared
jamila
herself
has
recently
completed
the
first
stage
of
an
intensive
and
competitive
college
readiness
program
and
is
preparing
to
start
community
college
intending
to
transfer
into
a
local
bachelor
s
degree
granting
college
in
two
years
her
long
term
goals
include
studying
philosophy
and
becoming
a
lawyer
she
believes
that
practicing
law
would
be
the
best
way
to
help
people
i
love
law
too
because
i
like
giving
people
second
chances
everyone
s
not
a
bad
person
despite
her
positive
early
experience
with
police
her
model
citizenship
her
brother
s
goal
of
becoming
a
police
officer
her
own
goal
of
joining
the
bar
and
her
embrace
of
the
broad
role
that
police
can
serve
jamila
is
profoundly
skeptical
that
the
police
and
government
officials
more
generally
value
people
from
her
community
we
need
real
real
people
that
care
about
people
any
kind
of
state
official
anything
that
has
to
do
with
dealing
with
people
we
need
better
people
jamila
s
assessment
of
police
seems
to
stem
from
a
mixture
of
community
wisdom
and
the
experiences
of
her
friends
and
neighbors
a
few
months
ago
jamila
and
her
friend
rock
were
waiting
outside
of
a
middle
school
to
walk
rock
s
brother
a
student
at
the
school
home
jamila
and
rock
were
about
fifteen
minutes
early
they
were
hanging
out
outside
to
pass
the
time
and
a
police
officer
came
by
and
asked
them
to
leave
jamila
immediately
started
to
walk
away
as
she
did
not
have
any
reason
to
be
there
rock
however
started
running
away
according
to
jamila
running
away
from
police
is
a
standard
practice
for
young
men
even
when
they
are
clean
i
e
not
carrying
anything
illegal
n
when
the
officer
caught
up
with
rock
he
pushed
rock
to
the
ground
pulled
out
his
baton
and
started
beating
him
with
it
the
officer
may
have
searched
rock
but
if
so
jamila
did
not
mention
it
the
officer
did
not
lock
rock
up
then
but
he
seems
to
have
cited
him
for
loitering
or
some
other
minor
offense
as
rock
lay
on
the
ground
jamila
called
his
mother
the
officer
just
beat
him
walked
off
and
left
him
there
in
the
parking
lot
jamila
bitterly
recounted
jamila
fears
that
if
she
had
not
been
there
rock
might
have
died
then
what
would
it
still
have
mattered
then
or
does
it
not
matter
at
all
and
i
feel
like
they
re
given
too
much
power
because
they
feel
like
okay
they
re
officers
i
have
a
gun
i
have
a
badge
you
have
to
listen
to
me
you
have
to
do
this
you
have
to
do
that
when
really
you
re
the
same
as
you
re
the
same
person
as
me
whether
you
know
right
away
you
re
the
same
person
we
breathe
just
like
i
breathe
you
breathe
you
bleed
just
like
i
bleed
we
re
the
same
people
jamila
s
anger
is
not
born
primarily
of
her
own
experiences
most
of
her
personal
experiences
have
been
positive
or
neutral
instead
she
tells
stories
of
the
mistreatment
of
her
friends
and
of
african
americans
more
generally
n
we
don
t
have
a
good
relationship
black
people
with
police
because
of
what
they
re
known
to
be
doing
she
does
not
specify
who
knows
what
police
are
doing
there
is
no
active
person
or
group
passing
these
stories
along
they
are
just
known
jamila
also
distrusts
the
media
including
both
network
news
and
social
media
she
believes
that
both
of
these
sources
are
advancing
a
destructive
racial
trope
about
the
nature
of
police
community
relations
in
baltimore
m
edia
is
the
cause
of
all
of
this
jamila
pontificated
at
rapid
speed
t
hey
kept
putting
emphasis
on
white
white
white
white
cop
white
guy
white
cop
white
cop
white
guy
they
were
putting
emphasis
on
it
jamila
thinks
that
the
narrative
about
freddie
gray
promoted
through
broadcast
and
social
media
is
responsible
for
the
april
unrest
if
the
media
didn
t
broadcast
it
as
big
as
they
did
she
argued
it
wouldn
t
have
happened
like
this
because
people
started
reacting
when
they
came
on
to
the
news
and
it
came
across
on
that
social
media
on
that
timeline
of
facebook
and
stuff
like
that
sticking
to
her
preference
for
class
based
rather
than
race
based
arguments
jamila
contends
that
the
broadcast
media
promotes
a
racial
narrative
to
make
money
i
used
to
think
that
they
just
want
people
to
be
aware
of
what
was
going
on
but
then
how
they
started
wording
things
another
white
cop
kills
blacks
another
unarmed
black
teen
i
feel
they
got
the
outcome
they
wanted
i
feel
like
they
wanted
people
to
react
and
get
mad
because
as
views
go
up
they
get
paid
more
money
jamila
rejects
this
narrative
arguing
that
instead
of
race
it
s
bigger
than
that
this
is
a
nation
al
problem
it
s
worldwide
although
jamila
s
specific
critique
of
the
media
s
racial
analysis
was
at
times
hard
to
follow
her
general
argument
was
that
the
government
is
interested
in
maintaining
brute
authority
in
any
way
that
it
can
thus
the
media
narrative
surrounding
baltimore
s
policing
troubles
distracts
people
with
a
partial
explanation
race
instead
of
forcing
them
to
confront
the
fuller
explanation
maintenance
of
social
and
economic
hegemony
at
all
levels
of
course
not
all
baltimore
youth
shared
jamila
s
particular
take
on
the
role
of
race
or
her
skepticism
of
all
media
myron
n
for
example
was
thrilled
at
the
broadcast
media
s
coverage
of
the
freddie
gray
incident
using
news
like
a
verb
he
related
i
m
glad
they
finally
newsed
our
shit
myron
is
pleased
that
these
incidents
which
have
been
going
on
for
years
in
his
estimation
were
deemed
newsworthy
the
broadcast
media
attention
spurred
a
shift
in
the
social
media
experience
as
well
finally
facebook
and
instagram
went
to
something
other
than
us
killing
each
other
or
fighting
each
other
they
finally
went
to
something
like
helping
us
broadcasting
what
they
re
doing
to
us
johnson
n
had
yet
another
take
disparaging
broadcast
media
coverage
in
similar
tones
to
jamila
but
viewing
the
use
of
video
and
social
media
as
a
way
to
offer
an
alternative
narrative
i
f
the
media
was
here
now
they
would
be
saying
some
crazy
things
about
a
situation
instead
of
the
truth
about
it
he
contended
that
s
another
reason
why
people
need
to
actually
be
active
into
social
media
a
little
bit
more
i
n
order
to
find
the
truth
you
need
to
have
your
phone
out
tweet
things
take
videos
about
things
while
opinions
of
these
media
sources
vary
young
people
commonly
consume
them
and
deploy
them
as
filters
to
understand
the
experience
of
being
policed
in
baltimore
a
few
days
before
our
interview
jamila
saw
an
officer
in
her
courtyard
surrounded
by
a
crowd
of
children
blasting
the
popular
song
watch
me
whip
nae
nae
n
and
dancing
some
of
the
children
took
out
their
phones
to
record
indeed
there
have
been
several
similar
officer
dance
videos
from
jurisdictions
across
the
country
over
the
past
two
years
often
using
the
whip
nae
nae
song
n
when
the
officer
left
the
children
told
him
goodbye
a
nicety
between
community
kids
and
the
police
that
jamila
had
never
seen
before
jamila
appreciated
the
gesture
when
i
seen
that
i
was
like
yeah
i
kind
of
like
gave
the
officer
a
nod
because
that
s
a
good
thing
you
usually
don
t
see
that
at
the
same
time
she
does
not
expect
the
encounter
to
make
much
of
a
change
in
the
way
she
sees
police
or
in
the
way
other
adults
from
her
community
perceive
police
once
a
man
s
mind
s
already
made
up
there
s
no
telling
him
different
pathways
of
vicarious
marginalization
such
as
stories
from
family
members
witnessing
friends
interactions
and
watching
videos
and
media
coverage
of
strangers
experiences
of
police
related
violence
and
injustice
are
poorly
considered
in
current
theory
and
policy
the
legitimacy
approach
tends
to
deemphasize
the
importance
of
interlocking
social
contexts
including
peer
influences
n
the
existence
of
these
pathways
is
not
surprising
though
when
one
considers
what
social
scientists
have
long
understood
about
the
stickiness
of
negative
events
in
the
human
memory
n
the
socialization
function
of
family
and
friend
networks
n
the
ways
culture
is
created
and
transmitted
n
and
the
social
construction
of
knowledge
n
personal
experience
with
the
police
is
only
one
stick
in
the
bundle
of
information
that
people
use
to
form
their
perspectives
on
law
enforcement
how
they
understand
the
policing
experiences
of
others
varies
based
in
part
on
their
relationship
with
the
person
who
had
the
interaction
and
especially
when
the
vicarious
experience
comes
through
a
viral
police
video
varies
based
on
how
well
the
experience
at
issue
matches
up
with
metanarratives
about
the
police
shared
narratives
about
how
the
police
treat
african
americans
and
people
who
live
in
poor
communities
propel
legal
estrangement
to
reduce
legal
estrangement
counternarratives
that
focus
on
respect
and
value
for
black
and
poor
lives
must
emerge
and
take
root
c
structural
exclusion
the
third
part
of
the
theory
of
legal
estrangement
is
structural
exclusion
this
component
describes
the
ways
in
which
policies
that
may
appear
facially
race
and
class
neutral
distribute
policing
resources
so
that
african
americans
and
residents
of
disadvantaged
neighborhoods
tend
to
receive
lower
quality
policing
than
whites
and
residents
of
other
neighborhoods
n
laws
and
policies
produce
and
normalize
vastly
different
experiences
by
race
and
class
n
the
apparent
neutrality
of
most
modern
laws
and
policies
means
that
even
those
who
are
disadvantaged
under
them
might
not
fully
perceive
them
as
discriminatory
n
these
policies
serve
as
a
form
of
legal
closure
a
means
of
hoarding
legal
resources
for
the
socially
and
socioeconomically
advantaged
while
locking
marginalized
groups
out
of
the
benefits
of
law
enforcement
this
idea
draws
from
the
theory
of
social
closure
n
the
process
of
legal
closure
leaves
some
areas
essentially
lawless
harshly
policed
yet
underprotected
n
while
others
may
be
rigorously
defended
over
and
above
the
degree
to
which
they
are
at
risk
the
concept
of
legal
closure
acknowledges
that
there
are
both
losers
and
winners
in
the
current
policing
regime
current
scholarship
and
policymaking
focuses
on
how
to
address
problems
with
the
losers
without
examining
the
current
system
s
beneficiaries
part
of
the
reason
that
the
harshest
and
least
effective
police
officers
can
be
found
in
high
poverty
communities
is
because
department
policies
on
pay
and
seniority
as
well
as
state
laws
on
officer
wages
and
additional
employment
send
the
most
experienced
and
highest
paid
police
officers
to
the
wealthiest
areas
residents
of
wealthier
urban
and
suburban
neighborhoods
benefit
from
the
current
policing
regime
this
insight
reframes
the
problem
that
police
reform
attempts
to
address
as
not
only
a
problem
of
racism
or
poverty
but
a
problem
of
inequality
in
access
to
the
machinery
of
the
law
n
the
structural
exclusion
prong
of
legal
estrangement
theory
also
emphasizes
that
police
violence
is
not
primarily
a
problem
of
wayward
officers
or
misunderstood
suspects
but
instead
a
problem
embedded
in
the
legal
system
itself
one
indicator
that
poor
african
americans
in
particular
have
been
excluded
from
police
resources
is
that
police
repeatedly
fail
to
respond
or
to
respond
in
a
timely
fashion
when
they
are
called
n
structural
exclusion
often
occurs
in
ways
that
community
members
do
not
recognize
but
police
nonresponse
is
an
inequality
that
community
members
often
notice
and
it
is
usually
evidence
of
local
state
and
federal
policy
decisions
in
response
to
police
abandonment
marginalized
people
seeking
protection
or
redress
of
grievances
have
generally
turned
to
self
help
either
by
calling
upon
family
members
or
friends
and
thus
increasing
violence
in
the
aggregate
n
or
by
creating
or
enlisting
the
help
of
informal
institutions
for
example
sudhir
alladi
venkatesh
s
historical
and
ethnographic
account
of
life
in
chicago
s
now
defunct
robert
taylor
homes
describes
a
series
of
alternative
community
law
enforcement
groups
indigenous
law
enforcement
that
residents
used
to
police
themselves
after
the
police
abandoned
the
development
as
early
as
the
s
n
in
the
early
s
however
as
the
drug
trade
grew
and
gangs
evolved
from
largely
familial
enterprises
to
more
impersonal
almost
corporate
entities
n
those
gangs
ultimately
took
over
the
pseudo
law
enforcement
role
from
the
community
law
enforcement
groups
n
at
no
point
did
police
step
in
to
reclaim
meaningful
authority
within
the
neighborhood
n
the
incentive
structure
for
police
officers
was
to
avoid
neighborhoods
like
the
robert
taylor
homes
particularly
in
the
era
before
federal
policy
incentivized
police
departments
to
prevent
crime
in
high
crime
neighborhoods
n
of
course
policing
has
changed
since
the
early
days
of
the
robert
taylor
homes
much
of
the
early
critique
of
police
officers
treatment
of
racially
and
socioeconomically
marginalized
neighborhoods
or
what
many
scholars
call
the
ghetto
stemmed
from
law
enforcement
s
neglect
of
those
communities
n
leading
to
some
mid
twentieth
century
racial
justice
advocates
to
urge
police
to
become
more
active
in
poor
urban
neighborhoods
n
yet
several
forces
converged
in
the
s
s
and
s
that
shifted
the
problem
from
one
of
utter
neglect
to
the
current
problem
of
overpolicing
and
underprotection
first
policing
underwent
a
move
toward
professionalization
which
brought
about
improvements
such
as
the
use
of
technology
reliance
on
evidence
rather
than
confessions
given
during
investigations
and
requirements
that
police
undergo
more
extensive
education
and
standardized
training
n
however
as
part
of
the
professionalization
package
and
because
of
shifts
in
technology
and
the
sprawl
of
cities
departments
shifted
their
tactics
from
having
officers
walk
a
beat
an
area
that
they
specifically
focused
on
to
using
cars
and
technology
to
respond
to
calls
for
service
n
second
partly
in
reaction
to
the
massive
increase
in
urban
crime
during
the
s
broken
windows
policing
also
known
as
order
maintenance
or
quality
of
life
policing
took
root
in
the
s
and
s
this
type
of
policing
moved
in
the
opposite
direction
of
the
call
for
service
model
by
urging
officers
to
heavily
and
proactively
enforce
laws
against
minor
criminal
activity
particularly
in
distressed
communities
the
shift
meant
that
people
in
racially
and
socioeconomically
isolated
communities
first
felt
abandoned
then
felt
heavily
monitored
but
primarily
monitored
only
for
minor
crimes
that
were
not
at
the
heart
of
their
public
safety
and
security
concerns
the
war
on
drugs
altered
policing
as
well
although
much
of
the
critique
of
the
war
on
drugs
has
focused
on
its
hotly
debated
role
in
the
rise
of
mass
incarceration
n
the
war
on
drugs
altered
the
front
end
of
the
criminal
justice
system
policing
just
as
significantly
beginning
in
the
s
and
increasingly
throughout
the
s
and
s
the
war
on
drugs
funded
special
narcotics
enforcement
police
units
and
gang
units
across
the
country
arming
regular
police
departments
with
military
grade
armor
and
weaponry
and
authorizing
virtually
free
reign
over
marginalized
neighborhoods
n
because
police
often
relied
on
bad
information
when
making
busts
and
conducting
raids
whole
communities
felt
under
police
suspicion
regardless
of
whether
particular
individuals
had
done
anything
to
earn
that
suspicion
n
the
twin
perils
of
harsh
policing
and
neglectful
policing
indicate
structural
exclusion
from
public
safety
an
exclusion
that
corresponds
with
intersecting
race
class
and
geographic
marginalization
some
scholarship
on
overpolicing
and
underprotection
portrays
the
phenomenon
as
a
gendered
and
generational
issue
meaning
that
young
people
especially
young
men
feel
overpoliced
while
older
decent
people
in
poor
african
american
communities
feel
underprotected
n
the
reality
is
far
more
complex
many
young
men
too
would
ideally
want
the
police
to
protect
them
and
their
communities
patrick
carr
laura
napolitano
and
jessica
keating
reached
this
finding
in
their
qualitative
criminology
study
of
an
ethnically
diverse
latinx
white
and
african
american
sample
of
young
men
and
women
ages
twelve
to
twenty
three
in
three
highcrime
socioeconomically
challenged
philadelphia
neighborhoods
although
most
of
the
youths
regardless
of
race
or
gender
had
a
negative
disposition
toward
the
police
most
of
them
including
young
african
american
men
also
suggested
greater
presence
of
police
and
harsher
enforcement
of
the
law
as
ways
to
address
crime
in
their
communities
n
one
way
to
understand
this
result
is
as
a
kind
of
bounded
creativity
because
these
youths
were
growing
up
in
high
crime
urban
neighborhoods
in
the
s
and
s
a
time
and
place
where
the
police
were
highly
visible
and
when
alternative
community
social
control
resources
were
relatively
limited
perhaps
they
could
not
imagine
a
world
where
the
government
could
use
noncriminal
justice
means
to
deter
crime
this
view
would
counsel
hesitancy
before
relying
on
youths
words
as
true
statements
of
their
ideals
n
yet
the
authors
settle
on
the
explanation
that
despite
the
youths
negative
experiences
with
the
police
they
cling
to
the
mainstream
cultural
ideal
that
police
should
protect
them
and
their
communities
along
with
protection
the
youths
desire
procedurally
just
policing
n
the
critical
point
about
structural
exclusion
is
that
despite
the
youths
cynicism
about
the
police
they
nonetheless
believe
that
the
police
are
failing
to
provide
protective
services
to
their
communities
this
conflicted
desire
for
police
protection
is
observable
in
lemuel
s
story
lemuel
is
a
twenty
four
year
old
african
american
young
man
who
grew
up
in
the
lexington
terrace
housing
project
in
west
baltimore
n
lemuel
unlike
shawna
justin
and
jamila
has
spent
a
large
portion
of
his
youth
engaged
in
criminal
activity
n
unlike
his
brothers
one
of
whom
is
incarcerated
and
one
of
whom
was
murdered
seven
years
ago
lemuel
managed
to
avoid
becoming
an
official
member
of
any
street
gang
or
clique
in
his
terms
he
was
a
thug
not
a
gangster
mostly
he
stole
food
sports
jerseys
cars
and
other
property
with
his
brother
and
dealt
small
amounts
of
marijuana
to
earn
a
baseline
income
when
i
was
robbing
people
there
was
a
reason
why
i
was
doing
it
my
stomach
was
literally
growling
nothing
to
do
either
i
die
starve
or
i
do
something
i
was
too
young
for
a
job
i
mean
i
cut
grass
during
the
summer
i
shoveled
snow
through
the
winter
but
what
do
you
do
in
between
lemuel
s
family
was
so
poor
that
his
parents
made
deliberate
choices
to
forego
necessities
for
their
male
children
lemuel
mimicked
his
stepfather
with
an
acerbic
chuckle
my
father
he
always
said
they
boys
they
don
t
need
no
shoes
they
don
t
need
no
underwear
they
don
t
need
socks
the
first
time
he
remembers
feeling
scared
and
realizing
that
his
family
was
very
poor
was
when
the
eviction
people
came
and
we
re
holding
the
door
so
they
won
t
come
in
petty
theft
was
lemuel
s
family
s
livelihood
what
we
going
to
do
whatever
you
can
do
so
we
made
sure
we
ate
not
surprisingly
lemuel
had
numerous
run
ins
with
the
police
in
his
younger
delinquent
years
he
likened
the
police
he
encountered
the
knockers
plainclothes
officers
assigned
to
flex
squads
focused
on
drugs
and
violent
crime
n
to
denzel
washington
s
character
in
the
movie
training
day
n
according
to
lemuel
these
officers
all
african
american
n
often
wore
ski
masks
he
don
t
want
you
to
know
who
he
is
because
he
s
about
to
do
something
that
he
ain
t
supposed
to
do
lemuel
says
that
the
knockers
would
give
him
an
ultimatum
during
every
run
in
they
could
either
take
him
to
jail
or
they
could
allow
him
to
go
home
when
a
boy
took
the
go
home
option
they
sit
you
in
the
back
seat
with
a
knocker
back
there
and
they
ll
beat
your
ribs
take
all
your
money
out
your
pocket
leave
you
in
the
hood
that
you
ain
t
supposed
to
be
in
one
of
lemuel
s
most
formative
experiences
with
a
police
officer
took
place
at
a
high
school
located
in
the
heart
of
gang
territory
one
day
when
he
was
about
fifteen
years
old
lemuel
showed
up
to
school
drunk
on
bacardi
gold
rum
at
the
time
i
was
doing
a
lot
of
drinking
i
was
going
through
stuff
he
explained
he
was
also
carrying
drugs
for
his
personal
use
and
a
knuckle
knife
a
set
of
brass
knuckles
with
a
knife
attached
for
protection
as
is
common
at
baltimore
s
public
high
schools
security
was
on
high
alert
n
in
addition
to
the
usual
metal
detectors
officers
were
on
hand
to
frisk
the
students
a
female
officer
patted
lemuel
down
and
found
the
drugs
in
his
pocket
according
to
lemuel
the
officer
grabbed
his
scrotum
and
squeezed
she
allegedly
told
him
you
better
not
say
nothing
as
he
remembers
it
she
told
him
that
if
he
screamed
she
would
remove
the
drugs
from
his
pocket
perhaps
simply
taking
them
or
turning
them
in
so
that
he
would
get
into
legal
trouble
though
tears
welled
in
lemuel
s
eyes
he
stayed
silent
and
the
officer
let
him
go
but
he
returned
home
swollen
and
in
pain
n
despite
those
horrific
recollections
procedural
injustice
seems
too
clinical
a
word
for
bodily
assault
there
have
been
times
when
lemuel
has
wanted
to
call
the
police
for
help
when
lemuel
was
younger
someone
from
his
neighborhood
robbed
him
and
took
his
sports
jersey
an
item
that
was
relatively
expensive
given
his
financial
background
and
thus
had
great
significance
to
him
he
wished
that
he
could
call
the
police
to
report
the
crime
and
get
the
jersey
back
but
instead
he
reluctantly
fought
the
older
boy
who
took
it
got
my
ass
whipped
got
my
jersey
back
though
there
have
been
other
times
when
he
has
wanted
to
call
the
police
as
well
times
when
an
old
fashioned
schoolyard
brawl
would
not
be
of
much
help
people
have
shot
near
him
and
things
was
a
little
bit
out
of
my
control
yet
he
still
did
not
call
the
police
because
it
s
never
good
lemuel
s
uncle
is
a
police
officer
but
instead
of
making
him
feel
closer
to
the
police
he
thinks
the
job
reflects
poorly
on
his
uncle
s
character
lemuel
told
us
chuckling
even
my
uncle
my
uncle
s
an
asshole
he
don
t
come
to
no
family
reunions
or
nothing
lemuel
does
not
think
the
problems
of
policing
that
he
has
experienced
and
that
gave
rise
to
the
freddie
gray
unrest
are
attributable
to
race
in
his
view
the
problems
of
police
community
relations
are
problems
of
neighborhood
income
inequality
black
white
hispanic
it
doesn
t
matter
your
race
it
matters
where
you
live
it
s
almost
your
income
because
lemuel
has
committed
crimes
in
higher
income
neighborhoods
he
has
seen
firsthand
that
police
respond
quickly
in
those
areas
he
and
a
friend
attempted
to
burglarize
a
home
in
a
wealthier
part
of
baltimore
county
and
they
assumed
that
because
the
house
was
in
a
semirural
area
it
would
take
the
police
a
long
time
to
arrive
they
were
wrong
someone
called
the
police
and
officers
arrived
very
quickly
when
you
re
in
another
neighborhood
you
get
treated
with
more
respect
i
realized
that
when
i
went
to
try
to
do
my
first
home
invasion
the
cop
response
was
so
quick
it
was
so
quick
i
never
seen
the
cops
respond
to
this
neighborhood
so
quickly
lemuel
believes
that
slow
police
response
is
inevitably
part
of
the
experience
of
living
in
the
projects
including
trailer
parks
one
distinction
between
the
police
in
west
baltimore
and
the
police
where
lemuel
attempted
the
burglary
is
jurisdictional
west
baltimore
located
within
baltimore
s
city
limits
is
under
the
jurisdiction
of
the
baltimore
city
police
department
by
contrast
outside
the
city
limits
in
baltimore
county
the
baltimore
county
police
department
handles
policing
assuming
lemuel
s
experience
is
representative
the
alleged
discrepancy
in
response
times
could
come
from
the
differences
in
policies
and
workloads
between
the
city
and
the
county
police
departments
the
differences
between
these
jurisdictions
might
relate
to
their
relative
emphases
on
responding
to
crime
reactively
versus
implementing
preventive
or
proactive
approaches
it
might
be
the
case
that
in
the
county
the
police
department
still
places
heavy
emphasis
on
responding
to
calls
for
service
while
in
the
city
particularly
in
high
crime
areas
there
is
greater
emphasis
on
patrolling
these
different
approaches
could
explain
city
residents
simultaneous
sense
that
there
is
a
heavy
presence
of
police
cars
n
and
delayed
response
to
calls
for
service
n
more
research
is
needed
to
compare
police
response
times
across
and
between
jurisdictions
and
to
locate
the
department
level
policies
and
practices
that
might
explain
any
undue
delay
lemuel
s
earlier
experiences
of
procedural
injustice
could
also
be
attributable
not
only
to
individual
bad
officers
but
to
policies
and
department
cultures
that
incentivize
bad
behavior
as
noted
above
lemuel
s
most
vivid
negative
experiences
were
with
the
knockers
the
plainclothes
police
officers
who
work
in
units
that
focus
solely
on
violent
crime
and
drug
crime
in
distressed
baltimore
neighborhoods
these
units
which
have
been
called
flex
squads
in
the
past
but
are
often
renamed
are
allowed
broad
discretion
including
whether
they
wear
uniforms
whether
they
drive
marked
cars
where
they
police
they
are
not
limited
to
a
post
and
the
hours
they
work
n
they
usually
carry
out
drug
raids
as
well
although
baltimore
s
flex
squads
came
under
fire
in
the
mid
s
due
to
deep
corruption
in
the
southwest
police
district
s
squad
including
the
rapes
that
shawna
fears
n
the
squads
now
exist
with
somewhat
greater
oversight
yet
some
people
including
former
police
officers
claim
that
street
enforcement
units
are
still
given
wide
discretion
that
they
often
grievously
misuse
n
arrest
incentives
and
the
more
general
culture
of
arrest
n
might
also
have
contributed
to
experiences
like
lemuel
s
although
he
reports
being
arrested
only
once
and
not
through
an
encounter
with
a
knocker
it
is
possible
that
police
were
more
present
in
his
neighborhood
because
they
were
looking
for
people
to
arrest
perhaps
because
lemuel
was
so
young
police
were
slower
to
arrest
him
while
we
do
not
have
evidence
of
what
those
specific
officers
believed
insider
accounts
suggest
that
department
policy
encouraged
greater
police
presence
in
predominantly
poor
and
african
american
neighborhoods
even
for
officers
who
were
not
assigned
to
those
areas
former
baltimore
police
officer
michael
wood
told
reporters
that
after
getting
a
plum
assignment
to
an
upper
middle
class
predominantly
white
neighborhood
he
would
sometimes
leave
his
post
to
go
to
a
poor
predominantly
black
neighborhood
to
make
arrests
he
needed
to
meet
his
expected
number
of
arrests
but
even
though
there
were
people
using
drugs
and
committing
other
crimes
in
the
neighborhood
where
he
was
assigned
he
knew
there
would
be
trouble
if
he
arrested
the
wrong
person
so
even
though
it
technically
violated
policy
for
wood
to
patrol
for
arrests
outside
of
his
post
his
supervisors
signed
of
on
his
work
they
knew
that
judges
and
court
officials
lived
in
that
neighborhood
if
i
locked
up
the
judge
s
year
old
son
for
drugs
or
whatever
things
could
get
really
bad
for
me
wood
told
reporters
n
several
scholars
have
described
the
perils
of
arrest
incentives
arguing
that
such
policies
have
contributed
to
mass
penal
control
through
misdemeanor
arrests
and
noncarceral
forms
of
state
supervision
n
lemuel
s
story
and
the
baltimore
context
suggest
that
incentives
to
arrest
might
also
simply
bring
more
people
into
contact
with
aggressive
policing
even
if
those
people
are
never
arrested
and
even
if
they
do
not
become
suspects
of
any
particular
crime
this
contact
might
have
negative
effects
on
their
perceptions
of
police
reminding
them
of
their
relative
worthlessness
in
the
eyes
of
the
state
consequently
arrest
incentivizing
policies
may
serve
to
deepen
legal
estrangement
on
a
broader
scale
of
course
structural
exclusion
through
policing
is
layered
atop
deeper
structural
disadvantages
that
arise
in
the
contexts
of
growing
up
poor
and
african
american
and
living
in
the
city
of
baltimore
good
policing
is
just
one
additional
resource
or
another
form
of
capital
n
from
which
the
law
writ
large
may
exclude
people
like
shawna
justin
jamila
and
lemuel
v
dismantling
estrangement
how
can
police
reform
dismantle
legal
estrangement
there
is
little
scholarship
that
tackles
this
question
in
even
a
cursory
way
research
suggests
that
procedural
justice
can
unsettle
the
psychological
process
that
leads
people
to
perceive
the
police
as
illegitimate
evidence
also
indicates
that
the
procedural
justice
solution
can
effectively
increase
perceptions
of
legitimacy
across
race
and
to
some
extent
class
n
yet
other
than
the
well
trodden
but
hazy
path
of
community
policing
n
there
has
been
little
discussion
of
reforms
that
can
disrupt
the
sociological
process
leading
whole
communities
to
see
the
police
as
a
symbol
of
their
status
on
the
social
periphery
measures
that
emanate
from
legitimacy
theory
and
the
procedural
justice
approach
such
as
police
training
are
ultimately
an
impoverished
response
to
estrangement
n
one
might
reasonably
view
legal
estrangement
not
as
a
problem
of
policing
but
as
a
problem
of
concentrated
poverty
and
racial
inequality
certainly
as
is
apparent
in
the
vignettes
offered
in
this
essay
concentrated
poverty
and
systemic
racial
injustice
are
major
structural
problems
that
produce
legal
estrangement
fully
dismantling
legal
estrangement
will
be
impossible
without
more
fundamental
shifts
in
economic
distribution
and
eradication
of
racial
discrimination
the
problems
of
policing
that
have
motivated
black
lives
matter
are
problems
of
america
s
broken
opportunity
structure
n
the
root
causes
of
estrangement
similar
to
the
root
causes
of
crime
and
mass
incarceration
may
seem
inappropriate
to
address
through
the
criminal
justice
system
n
admittedly
the
structural
factors
believed
to
contribute
most
fundamentally
to
cynicism
such
as
concentrated
poverty
segregation
and
residential
instability
n
are
not
generally
seen
as
the
province
of
police
practice
and
policy
yet
to
demand
that
curing
poverty
and
eliminating
race
discrimination
are
the
only
ways
to
meaningfully
effect
change
in
policing
is
to
accept
paralysis
the
root
causes
mentality
encourages
scholars
and
policymakers
to
ignore
ways
that
police
practices
and
policy
directly
and
actively
contribute
to
legal
estrangement
and
its
concomitant
racial
and
socioeconomic
conditions
for
instance
some
scholars
have
argued
that
police
practices
directly
contribute
to
persistent
residential
segregation
n
police
contact
can
negatively
influence
the
prison
reentry
process
making
it
difficult
for
returning
citizens
to
maintain
employment
and
familial
relationships
n
multiple
experiences
with
arrest
of
a
parent
can
result
in
court
dates
for
children
that
keep
them
out
of
school
and
siphon
them
into
the
criminal
justice
apparatus
this
process
interrupts
their
education
and
ultimately
places
them
at
risk
for
incarceration
and
its
related
perils
n
because
there
has
been
insufficient
attention
to
legal
estrangement
in
the
regulation
of
policing
opportunities
to
link
the
structural
factors
in
estrangement
with
concrete
reforms
to
policing
have
been
underexplored
the
proposals
here
are
not
offered
as
a
cure
all
to
legal
estrangement
but
are
instead
an
opening
salvo
to
encourage
police
reformers
to
dedicate
energy
toward
new
strategies
and
structures
of
police
governance
a
using
federal
tools
to
change
local
practices
scholars
often
overlook
many
of
the
structural
issues
that
confront
policing
outside
the
purview
of
federal
law
because
the
policing
crisis
is
embedded
in
state
and
local
laws
and
policies
even
though
federal
law
and
policy
has
brought
some
uniformity
to
local
policing
through
spending
initiatives
since
the
s
police
administrative
rules
and
practices
still
vary
intensely
among
states
counties
and
municipalities
n
in
addition
there
is
rich
debate
over
the
appropriate
institutional
actors
that
should
regulate
local
police
behavior
n
faced
with
disagreement
over
the
depth
of
the
solutions
needed
issues
of
federalism
and
potentially
limited
institutional
capacities
one
would
be
hard
pressed
to
find
a
legal
silver
bullet
capable
of
resolving
the
legal
and
social
problems
of
policing
one
tool
that
provides
the
federal
government
with
leverage
to
force
local
departments
to
change
or
eliminate
structurally
exclusive
policies
is
section
of
the
violent
crime
control
and
law
enforcement
act
of
also
known
as
the
clinton
crime
bill
n
section
authorizes
the
u
s
attorney
general
to
sue
a
local
police
department
for
engaging
in
a
pattern
or
practice
of
violating
constitutional
and
legal
rights
the
department
of
justice
doj
may
use
the
threat
of
litigation
to
reach
an
agreement
with
the
agency
to
pursue
specific
reforms
or
take
the
agency
to
court
and
mandate
actions
through
a
consent
decree
although
section
has
many
merits
for
example
the
law
is
credited
with
providing
a
path
to
successful
long
term
reform
for
police
departments
in
cincinnati
los
angeles
and
pittsburgh
n
many
scholars
have
offered
an
array
of
potential
improvements
to
the
law
n
one
of
the
biggest
shortcomings
of
section
is
that
its
use
is
politically
cyclical
n
during
the
second
term
of
president
george
w
bush
the
doj
did
not
enter
into
a
single
consent
decree
with
a
police
agency
opting
instead
to
enter
into
nonbinding
agreements
with
wayward
departments
n
in
contrast
the
obama
administration
has
investigated
dozens
of
departments
n
even
this
figure
is
relatively
small
considering
that
there
are
more
than
police
departments
across
the
united
states
many
scholars
believe
that
the
costly
and
invasive
nature
of
the
process
limits
its
capacity
to
reach
the
full
set
of
departments
that
may
require
oversight
n
one
suspects
that
a
trump
doj
will
investigate
very
few
if
any
police
departments
indeed
perhaps
the
major
drawback
of
relying
on
is
that
it
likely
allows
so
much
unlawful
and
procedurally
unjust
policing
to
go
undetected
baltimore
provides
an
excellent
example
of
this
issue
on
august
the
doj
released
a
page
report
lambasting
the
baltimore
police
department
for
its
persistent
violations
of
the
rights
of
baltimore
s
african
american
population

in
particular
the

s
mistreatment
of
youth

sixteen
months
earlier
in

the
final
report
of
the

s

force
on

first
century

described

s
efforts
to
build
community
legitimacy

testimony
from

police
commissioner
anthony
batts
touting
the

establishment
of
a
new
professional
standards
and
accountability
bureau
tasked
with
rooting
out
corruption
holding

accountable

i
es

the
doj
report
which
denounces
the
department
for
its
failure
to
properly
train
officers
does
not
even
mention
this
bureau
in
fact
the
report
only
briefly
mentions
the
baltimore
police
department
s
other
efforts
to
address
its
legacy
of
bias
n
it
took
the
death
of
freddie
gray
and
the
corresponding
public
uproar
to
push
the
doj
to
commence
this
investigation
and
issue
the
report
while
section
provides
a
helpful
backstop
it
allows
departments
to
maintain
a
veneer
of
community
orientation
until
a
crisis
strikes
major
pushes
for
structural
reform
should
not
rely
on
litigation
that
is
rarely
initiated
before
tragedy
occurs
while
recognizing
the
inherent
insufficiency
of
incremental
interventions
as
a
full
remedy
for
legal
estrangement
in
this
part
i
provisionally
discuss
fourth
amendment
jurisprudence
and
four
areas
of
police
governance
reform
that
could
contribute
to
dismantling
estrangement
these
reforms
have
garnered
much
less
attention
in
the
most
recent
police
reform
debates
than
police
training
community
policing
initiatives
or
even
structural
reform
litigation
whereas
most
scholarship
on
police
regulation
tends
to
focus
on
constitutional
criminal
procedure
n
these
reforms
are
aimed
at
statutory
and
municipal
law
at
the
federal
state
and
local
levels
unlike
the
legitimacy
approach
legal
estrangement
theory
directly
suggests
structural
reform
the
theory
demands
attention
to
group
societal
membership
and
the
deep
seated
laws
policies
and
structures
that
have
produced
the
policing
crisis
microlevel
procedural
justice
reforms
aimed
at
producing
individual
level
feelings
of
legitimacy
are
anemic
responses
to
legal
estrangement
b
paying
the
police
the
police
wage
system
is
a
structural
factor
that
functionally
excludes
many
poor
people
and
african
americans
from
policing
resources
thereby
contributing
to
legal
estrangement
the
wage
structure
under
which
police
officers
generally
operate
works
inversely
to
the
way
it
should
some
of
the
busiest
and
most
dangerous
jobs
in
law
enforcement
often
pay
the
least
particularly
in
cities
towns
and
counties
that
are
financially
strapped
finding
the
means
to
retain
police
officer
talent
is
a
serious
challenge
moreover
officers
are
frequently
aware
of
localized
pay
disparities
for
example
a
journalistic
report
on
st
louis
county
claimed
that
officers
in
some
parts
of
the
county
were
making
poverty
wages
as
low
as
per
hour
n
the
doj
ferguson
consent
decree
required
that
the
city
increase
officer
salaries
as
part
of
its
recruitment
plan
n
low
officer
wages
introduce
two
major
perversions
to
the
system
first
when
salaries
are
too
low
the
most
skilled
and
experienced
officers
will
rationally
leave
higher
crime
areas
to
work
in
easier
areas
where
they
are
paid
more
second
low
wages
mean
that
many
officers
feel
pressure
to
pursue
large
amounts
of
overtime
hours
and
off
duty
work
also
known
as
secondary
employment
or
moonlighting
n
police
officers
typically
receive
a
base
hourly
wage
but
many
earn
a
significant
amount
of
their
take
home
pay
through
overtime
in
baltimore
for
example
over
one
hundred
officers
in
fiscal
year
earned
more
than
in
overtime
pay
in
that
year
the
highest
paid
employee
of
the
baltimore
city
police
department
earned
in
overtime
pay
and
in
base
pay
for
a
total
of
more
than
the
city
s
mayor
and
more
than
the
police
commissioner
n
in
six
of
the
ten
highest
paid
people
in
baltimore
city
government
were
employees
of
the
police
department
n
only
one
of
those
employees
the
police
commissioner
had
a
top
ten
base
salary
the
others
received
substantial
amounts
of
money
in
what
appears
to
be
overtime
pay
n
the
stress
and
burden
of
extended
work
hours
can
make
even
the
most
promising
officers
terrible
at
their
job
n
the
president
s
task
force
report
devotes
one
of
its
six
pillars
to
officer
wellness
and
safety
with
emphasis
on
mental
health
n
it
stresses
the
riskiness
and
trauma
of
the
job
and
blames
officer
judgment
errors
on
fatigue
it
even
discusses
shift
length
as
a
potential
contributor
to
officer
fatigue
n
but
the
report
does
not
directly
draw
a
link
between
fatigue
exposure
to
risk
and
trauma
long
shifts
and
wage
related
pressures
and
overwork
all
factors
that
may
affect
economically
depressed
jurisdictions
more
than
other
jurisdictions
wage
disparity
is
a
structural
issue
that
occurs
far
upstream
from
the
events
that
have
catalyzed
the
police
reform
movement
bringing
greater
transparency
and
equity
to
officer
salaries
will
likely
decrease
procedural
injustice
and
vicarious
marginalization
on
the
ground
which
could
over
time
reduce
legal
estrangement
even
where
officers
are
paid
on
the
same
scale
within
the
same
departments
they
still
may
be
earning
less
to
police
tougher
neighborhoods
collective
bargaining
means
that
departments
are
often
bound
to
pay
salary
assign
shifts
assign
beats
and
give
promotions
or
transfers
on
the
basis
of
seniority
n
and
even
where
collective
bargaining
is
not
in
place
decision
making
based
on
seniority
is
often
embedded
into
police
culture
seniority
rules
mean
that
new
patrol
officers
tend
to
get
the
least
desired
assignments
graveyard
shifts
and
tough
neighborhoods
while
receiving
the
lowest
compensation
n
although
problems
of
police
wage
inequality
and
job
insecurity
are
tied
partly
to
local
governments
financial
insolvency
n
federal
intervention
could
help
bring
balance
between
urban
and
suburban
wages
since
the
establishment
of
the
federal
office
of
community
oriented
policing
services
in
federal
funding
has
flowed
to
local
departments
to
incentivize
various
reforms
n
federal
funding
then
could
partially
close
the
gap
between
the
wages
that
local
taxes
can
fund
and
the
wages
needed
to
attract
the
most
skilled
officers
to
the
highest
need
areas
state
legislation
could
help
as
well
in
indiana
for
example
legislators
have
proposed
requiring
the
state
s
office
of
management
and
budget
to
prepare
an
annual
report
comparing
the
salaries
of
state
police
with
salaries
in
the
three
largest
local
police
departments
and
to
make
recommendations
about
wage
parity
n
it
is
difficult
to
tell
whether
such
legislation
will
be
effective
but
this
bill
represents
one
way
that
states
could
help
reduce
local
wage
disparity
between
officers
another
practice
that
allocates
policing
resources
to
wealthier
neighborhoods
to
the
detriment
of
poorer
neighborhoods
is
police
departments
practice
of
taking
on
secondary
employment
n
under
secondary
employment
arrangements
private
entities
such
as
sports
teams
or
neighborhood
associations
can
pay
the
police
department
extra
money
to
provide
additional
police
services
the
doj
has
criticized
such
local
government
arrangements
for
contribut
ing
to
inequitable
policing
n
for
example
when
the
doj
first
investigated
the
new
orleans
police
department
in
some
of
its
most
significant
criticism
fell
upon
the
department
s
paid
detail
program
n
paid
detail
gave
officers
the
opportunity
to
earn
extra
money
by
working
overtime
for
private
pay
and
most
of
the
places
they
worked
were
the
areas
lowest
in
crime
the
breadth
and
prevalence
of
the
detail
system
has
essentially
privatized
officer
overtime
at
nopd
resulting
in
officers
working
details
in
the
areas
of
town
with
the
least
crime
while
an
insufficient
number
of
officers
are
working
in
the
areas
of
new
orleans
with
the
greatest
crime
prevention
needs
those
with
means
in
new
orleans
are
essentially
able
to
buy
additional
protection
while
those
without
such
means
are
unable
to
pay
for
the
services
and
extra
protection
needed
to
make
up
for
insufficient
or
ineffective
policing
while
any
community
that
wants
extra
security
certainly
has
a
right
to
pay
for
it
it
raises
troubling
legal
and
ethical
questions
when
that
extra
security
might
otherwise
have
been
focused
on
parts
of
the
city
most
in
need
of
police
assistance
n
this
language
might
have
been
a
clarion
call
to
municipal
governments
to
prohibit
or
at
least
to
regulate
more
effectively
the
use
of
sworn
police
officers
as
private
security
for
overtime
pay
however
perhaps
because
the
investigation
revealed
such
a
massive
number
of
issues
the
report
s
critique
of
paid
detail
did
not
gain
national
traction
n
in
addition
the
doj
did
not
mention
paid
detail
in
its
ultimate
consent
decree
with
the
new
orleans
police
department
n
importantly
the
report
s
critique
of
paid
detail
is
not
general
it
does
not
state
that
officer
moonlighting
is
per
se
corrupt
it
limits
its
analysis
to
the
particularities
of
new
orleans
and
even
suggests
an
acceptable
alternative
paid
detail
governance
structure
based
on
that
suggestion
local
governments
might
do
well
to
heed
doj
s
call
and
centralize
requests
for
private
employment
of
off
duty
officers
so
that
they
can
better
monitor
the
practice
and
use
it
to
bring
additional
funds
into
their
police
departments
n
another
option
would
be
to
bar
sworn
police
officers
from
taking
on
this
type
of
secondary
employment
altogether
instead
local
governments
could
expect
private
entities
who
want
extra
security
to
hire
staff
through
private
firms
some
seattle
neighborhoods
have
instituted
this
approach
n
yet
there
are
reasons
to
hesitate
to
take
this
path
private
police
do
not
have
the
same
powers
nor
operate
under
the
same
constitutional
constraints
that
apply
to
sworn
police
officers
n
private
security
officers
might
be
used
only
for
neighborhood
observation
and
suspect
tracking
but
they
need
to
contact
public
police
to
conduct
searches
and
arrests
in
any
event
finding
a
way
to
maintain
a
public
private
distinction
in
policing
would
solve
the
ethical
problem
of
allowing
the
training
equipment
and
culture
that
the
public
provides
to
sworn
police
officers
to
directly
reproduce
neighborhood
inequality
secondary
employment
is
thus
a
mechanism
through
which
poorer
communities
are
structurally
excluded
from
good
policing
officers
may
receive
overtime
pay
for
working
as
officers
in
wealthier
areas
while
they
only
earn
paltry
wages
to
keep
distressed
neighborhoods
safe
this
dynamic
sends
a
stark
message
that
protecting
wealthier
areas
is
more
lucrative
than
protecting
higher
poverty
areas
secondary
employment
policies
like
these
might
even
suggest
at
least
symbolically
that
african
american
and
poor
lives
truly
lack
value
c
reorganizing
the
police
there
are
more
than
twelve
thousand
police
departments
in
the
united
states
nearly
half
of
which
employ
fewer
than
ten
police
officers
n
even
as
philosophies
of
policing
have
shifted
dramatically
over
the
past
century
governance
structures
of
policing
have
largely
remained
intact
n
consolidation
of
very
small
police
districts
might
be
another
way
to
ameliorate
the
structural
exclusion
from
police
resources
that
contributes
to
legal
estrangement
although
consolidating
districts
would
not
constitute
a
total
reorganization
of
departments
it
might
be
a
strong
first
step
toward
creating
a
structure
more
amenable
to
meaningful
community
engagement
and
checks
on
police
power
the
proliferation
of
many
small
police
departments
means
that
some
neighborhoods
can
essentially
become
individual
fiefdoms
for
certain
officers
the
issue
of
unchecked
power
in
extremely
small
rural
or
suburban
police
departments
came
to
national
attention
for
a
very
short
time
in
late
when
a
south
carolina
prosecutor
attempted
twice
to
win
the
conviction
of
richard
combs
the
police
chief
and
sole
police
officer
in
eutawville
south
carolina
a
town
with
a
population
of
combs
was
charged
with
murder
for
shooting
bernard
bailey
a
fifty
four
year
old
unarmed
african
american
man
in
the
parking
lot
of
eutawville
s
town
hall
in
may
bailey
had
intervened
when
combs
issued
a
traffic
ticket
to
bailey
s
daughter
and
the
shooting
allegedly
occurred
a
few
days
later
when
combs
attempted
to
serve
bailey
with
a
warrant
for
obstruction
of
justice
some
onlookers
saw
combs
as
an
example
of
an
officer
who
because
he
functioned
as
the
sole
traffic
officer
regular
patrol
officer
and
police
chief
had
unfettered
power
to
use
the
machinery
of
criminal
justice
for
vindictive
purposes
a
structure
that
seems
almost
destined
to
produce
corrupt
police
action
n
yet
after
the
briefest
of
moments
as
combs
ultimately
took
a
guilty
plea
for
misconduct
in
office
and
as
bigger
city
shootings
took
over
news
cycles
again
the
issue
of
small
police
department
governance
returned
to
obscurity
n
small
departments
can
also
create
various
interjurisdictional
inconsistencies
ranging
from
the
amount
of
training
officers
receive
to
the
equipment
available
to
keep
themselves
and
civilians
safe
for
example
one
of
the
arguments
that
combs
s
attorney
made
to
explain
his
decision
to
shoot
bailey
was
that
because
the
town
he
policed
is
very
small
they
did
not
have
less
lethal
equipment
such
as
a
stun
gun
taser
or
pepper
spray
this
meant
that
the
only
means
of
force
he
had
available
was
his
gun
n
whether
giving
combs
a
taser
or
pepper
spray
would
have
saved
bailey
s
life
is
a
difficult
question
however
it
does
seem
likely
that
in
part
because
of
the
governance
structure
of
his
department
combs
did
not
have
access
to
expensive
taser
technology
moreover
the
prevalence
of
very
small
departments
in
close
proximity
to
each
other
increases
the
likelihood
that
an
officer
fired
from
one
jurisdiction
for
serious
reasons
could
find
work
as
an
officer
in
another
poor
communities
are
more
likely
to
hire
gypsy
cops
officers
with
spotty
work
histories
who
have
been
fired
elsewhere
because
their
resource
constraints
make
it
more
difficult
for
them
to
discriminate
between
good
and
bad
officers
n
again
the
officers
least
likely
to
conduct
their
work
in
a
procedurally
just
manner
are
siphoned
toward
poor
communities
some
have
claimed
in
line
with
strong
federalism
advocates
and
some
basic
tenets
of
public
choice
theory
that
having
more
police
agencies
within
close
proximity
increases
competition
which
in
turn
could
improve
their
responsiveness
to
community
needs
and
allow
dissatisfied
people
to
vote
with
their
feet
by
relocating
elsewhere
n
yet
there
is
little
evidence
that
these
benefits
emerge
from
the
existence
of
very
small
police
departments
that
lack
meaningful
external
oversight
while
there
is
some
evidence
that
the
current
extreme
fragmentation
is
detrimental
to
the
overall
quality
of
policing
n
historically
one
argument
against
department
consolidation
was
that
administrative
centralization
could
threaten
officers
ability
to
engage
in
community
policing
n
however
it
may
not
be
empirically
true
that
fragmentation
of
police
administration
is
correlated
with
let
alone
a
catalyst
of
effective
community
oriented
policing
indeed
some
of
the
most
celebrated
efforts
to
link
police
and
community
have
taken
place
in
larger
departments
n
by
contrast
the
sheer
volume
of
locally
controlled
police
departments
all
of
which
have
slightly
different
policies
and
issues
creates
a
major
barrier
to
systemic
reform
the
seemingly
infinite
variations
on
police
policy
means
that
scholars
and
policymakers
may
observe
common
problems
across
local
contexts
but
find
it
difficult
to
sufficiently
address
those
problems
on
a
larger
scale
consolidation
would
help
if
only
because
it
would
decrease
the
number
of
departments
and
make
it
easier
to
gain
a
picture
of
their
policies
and
practices
unlike
many
of
the
structural
reforms
proposed
in
this
part
department
consolidation
has
gained
some
support
from
advocates
for
money
saving
in
criminal
justice
after
the
recession
municipal
budgets
shrank
and
many
officers
were
furloughed
or
laid
off
n
local
executives
are
increasingly
considering
police
consolidation
as
a
potential
cost
effective
structural
reform
and
some
departments
have
already
consolidated
as
a
way
to
cut
redundancies
n
thus
consolidation
could
win
the
mutual
support
of
fiscal
conservatives
and
liberals
building
a
coalition
reminiscent
of
the
left
right
nexus
on
cutting
mass
incarceration
n
however
significant
hurdles
could
impede
such
a
reform
for
one
members
of
the
public
who
live
in
very
small
towns
may
interpret
consolidation
of
small
departments
as
a
cut
to
their
public
safety
and
to
local
control
of
their
police
force
in
addition
consolidation
would
mean
that
some
people
who
have
immense
power
would
be
required
to
yield
it
these
fundamental
issues
mean
that
securing
support
for
department
consolidation
in
local
areas
will
pose
a
significant
challenge
d
raising
the
stakes
of
fourth
amendment
jurisprudence
understanding
today
s
policing
crisis
as
a
problem
of
legal
estrangement
clarifies
and
raises
the
stakes
of
our
fourth
amendment
jurisprudence
when
judges
rule
on
the
lawfulness
of
police
conduct
in
a
single
case
they
are
ruling
on
a
program
n
that
program
is
bigger
than
systematic
terry
stops
and
frisks
of
young
african
american
and
latino
men
n
the
program
is
endemic
to
policing
itself
including
serving
warrants
n
and
responding
or
not
responding
to
calls
for
assistance
because
of
the
longstanding
social
cultural
and
symbolic
meaning
of
the
police
among
african
americans
and
in
racially
and
socioeconomically
marginalized
communities
policing
cases
more
than
others
send
messages
to
groups
about
social
inclusion
and
indeed
social
citizenship
legitimacy
theory
does
not
offer
a
consistent
mode
of
response
to
this
problem
n
what
messages
are
conveyed
in
fourth
amendment
jurisprudence
justice
sotomayor
s
impassioned
dissent
in
strieff
showed
her
understanding
that
this
case
even
though
it
involved
a
white
defendant
blessed
police
discretion
to
behave
in
ways
that
denigrate
and
alienate
minority
populations
to
illustrate
we
can
return
to
the
facts
of
strieff
n
in
strieff
a
narcotics
detective
douglas
fackrell
conducted
surveillance
outside
a
home
in
southern
salt
lake
city
utah
for
about
a
week
fackrell
had
received
an
anonymous
tip
that
people
were
selling
and
purchasing
methamphetamine
there
fackrell
saw
several
people
enter
and
leave
the
home
after
short
periods
of
time
behavior
that
in
his
view
was
consistent
with
drug
dealing
and
purchasing
edward
strieff
was
one
of
the
people
who
visited
the
home
on
one
of
these
surveillance
days
strieff
left
the
home
in
question
and
went
to
a
nearby
convenience
store
even
though
fackrell
only
knew
that
strieff
had
visited
the
home
information
that
did
not
amount
to
reasonable
suspicion
to
justify
a
search
fackrell
followed
strieff
to
the
convenience
store
stopped
him
and
questioned
him
about
what
he
was
doing
at
the
home
in
question
fackrell
also
took
strieff
s
identification
card
and
shared
his
information
with
a
police
dispatcher
the
dispatcher
told
fackrell
that
strieff
had
an
open
warrant
for
his
arrest
on
a
minor
traffic
violation
fackrell
then
arrested
strieff
and
in
a
search
incident
to
arrest
found
the
evidence
he
was
looking
for
strieff
was
holding
a
small
baggie
of
meth
and
other
drug
paraphernalia
n
why
is
this
case
troubling
fackrell
violated
the
fourth
amendment
by
stopping
strieff
in
the
first
place
even
the
prosecutor
conceded
that
point
n
yet
the
court
ruled
that
because
fackrell
learned
that
strieff
had
an
open
warrant
for
arrest
even
if
just
for
a
minor
traffic
violation
the
search
he
conducted
was
sufficiently
attenuated
from
the
unconstitutional
stop
that
the
evidence
fackrell
discovered
was
admissible
in
a
world
where
few
people
had
open
warrants
this
decision
might
seem
somewhat
troubling
but
not
catastrophic
yet
in
a
scenario
where
a
substantial
number
of
people
have
open
warrants
often
for
the
most
minor
of
infractions
often
for
noncriminal
violations
of
probation
and
parole
conditions
and
often
because
of
their
poverty
n
the
strieff
decision
authorizes
tremendous
power
police
officers
are
now
free
to
arbitrarily
and
even
unconstitutionally
stop
people
ask
them
for
their
identification
have
a
dispatcher
search
their
record
find
an
arrest
warrant
for
a
long
unpaid
parking
ticket
or
a
missed
appointment
with
a
probation
officer
and
use
that
ticket
as
a
reason
to
conduct
any
physical
search
that
they
would
like
to
conduct
if
they
find
any
contraband
that
contraband
could
be
used
as
evidence
in
court
while
police
officers
need
discretion
in
order
to
locate
and
deter
crime
this
ruling
gives
them
a
worrisome
amount
of
license
when
one
views
this
ruling
in
context
and
imagines
strategies
like
fackrell
s
playing
out
in
racially
and
socioeconomically
marginalized
places
like
west
baltimore
one
understands
more
clearly
that
the
court
has
endorsed
the
wholesale
exclusion
of
poor
african
americans
and
often
latinx
communities
from
the
protection
of
the
law
and
from
their
rightful
place
in
society
in
whren
v
united
states
the
court
ruled
inter
alia
that
challenges
to
police
investigations
based
on
race
based
selective
enforcement
must
proceed
through
fourteenth
amendment
equal
protection
analysis
rather
than
fourth
amendment
analysis
n
given
the
very
high
bar
for
proving
racial
discrimination
under
the
equal
protection
clause
post
washington
v
davis
n
whren
significantly
curtails
the
degree
to
which
fourth
amendment
jurisprudence
on
police
investigation
could
be
used
to
correct
racial
discrimination
in
the
conduct
of
police
investigations
thus
state
courts
might
under
some
circumstances
be
better
suited
than
federal
courts
to
factor
in
the
local
context
of
racial
discrimination
and
disparity
reflective
of
legal
estrangement
for
example
in
late
the
massachusetts
supreme
judicial
court
ruled
in
commonwealth
v
warren
that
an
african
american
man
s
decision
to
flee
from
the
police
is
not
on
its
own
sufficiently
probative
of
reasonable
suspicion
n
the
court
partly
based
its
reasoning
on
statistical
evidence
that
african
american
men
in
boston
disproportionately
experience
stops
based
on
racial
profiling
n
black
male
bostonians
the
court
cautioned
might
just
as
easily
be
motivated
by
the
desire
to
avoid
the
recurring
indignity
of
being
racially
profiled
as
by
the
desire
to
hide
criminal
activity
n
in
other
words
in
an
environment
where
the
police
have
signaled
strongly
to
african
american
men
that
their
group
is
not
a
full
part
of
society
entitled
to
the
presumption
of
innocence
the
natural
response
to
that
communication
is
to
avoid
the
police
regardless
of
any
involvement
in
crime
this
was
a
judicial
acknowledgement
of
the
potential
effects
of
legal
estrangement
judges
who
rule
on
the
constitutionality
of
searches
should
keep
in
mind
the
stakes
of
giving
too
much
leeway
to
the
police
stakes
that
legal
estrangement
theory
illuminates
traditionally
we
think
of
the
potential
harms
of
policing
gone
awry
as
violations
of
privacy
and
individual
dignity
and
on
the
opposite
side
we
weigh
the
police
s
ability
to
respond
to
and
reduce
crime
n
yet
as
important
as
individual
privacy
is
the
collective
stakes
are
even
higher
moreover
some
have
argued
that
the
text
of
the
fourth
amendment
emphasizing
reasonableness
demands
that
courts
consider
distributional
outcomes
of
searches
and
seizures
by
race
gender
and
other
group
categories
n
the
question
of
reasonableness
has
grown
obscure
as
fourth
amendment
jurisprudence
has
come
to
focus
so
heavily
on
warrants
consent
probable
cause
and
so
forth
perhaps
distracting
courts
from
the
fundamental
reasonableness
inquiry
that
should
take
into
account
distributional
concerns
between
groups
n
getting
fourth
amendment
rulings
wrong
by
giving
the
police
too
much
power
risks
both
individual
and
collective
membership
in
the
american
social
order
e
democratizing
the
police
legal
estrangement
demands
a
deep
meaningful
approach
to
democratizing
police
governance
bringing
about
cohesion
and
solidarity
between
police
and
african
american
and
poor
communities
will
require
a
more
aggressive
infusion
of
deliberative
participation
in
policing
than
most
proposals
demand
a
legitimacy
approach
might
not
object
to
deep
democratization
these
processes
would
arguably
make
the
police
more
effective
in
securing
voluntary
compliance
and
would
arguably
encourage
the
police
to
use
procedurally
just
methods
but
legitimacy
would
not
require
it
barry
friedman
and
maria
ponomarenko
have
recently
argued
against
police
exceptionalism
in
policymaking
they
propose
that
police
policies
such
as
the
use
of
swat
teams
and
warrantless
searches
require
legislative
authorization
administrative
rulemaking
with
notice
and
comment
or
some
other
democratic
process
similar
to
other
areas
of
regulation
n
while
their
argument
is
persuasive
the
communities
most
affected
by
legal
estrangement
are
often
locked
out
of
the
democratic
process
more
generally
for
a
panoply
of
reasons
ranging
from
the
education
gap
to
felony
disenfranchisement
and
its
chilling
effects
on
turnout
in
high
incarceration
communities
to
active
efforts
at
voter
suppression
to
gerrymandering
to
the
capture
of
policymaking
through
high
stakes
lobbying
african
americans
particularly
if
they
live
in
high
poverty
communities
have
relatively
little
say
in
who
their
representatives
are
or
in
the
legislation
that
their
representatives
ultimately
pass
n
the
public
in
general
participates
sparingly
in
administrative
rulemaking
and
race
and
class
distributed
access
gaps
have
long
been
seen
in
that
area
of
lawmaking
as
well
n
shifting
toward
more
democratic
processes
is
important
on
the
grounds
of
democracy
and
the
rule
of
law
and
it
does
provide
an
opening
for
meaningful
change
however
it
is
unlikely
on
its
own
to
unsettle
legal
estrangement
in
the
communities
that
are
most
affected
by
it
n
combining
these
processes
with
other
democracy
enhancing
reforms
might
be
necessary
transparency
measures
including
data
collection
and
hot
ticket
reforms
such
as
police
officer
body
cameras
can
also
contribute
to
the
overall
democratization
of
policing
in
a
way
that
could
begin
to
root
out
legal
estrangement
n
currently
the
most
widely
distributed
videos
that
focus
on
police
generally
show
officers
either
engaging
in
forceful
or
other
distasteful
behavior
or
performing
acts
such
as
dancing
playing
basketball
or
distributing
ice
cream
the
former
are
unsettling
because
they
emphasize
police
wrongdoing
rather
than
police
officers
effective
interactions
with
the
public
which
are
likely
more
common
the
latter
are
unsettling
because
they
suggest
such
acts
are
core
to
today
s
iteration
of
community
policing
data
might
alert
scholars
and
activists
to
overlooked
systemic
problems
but
they
could
also
illuminate
police
agencies
and
officers
that
are
doing
their
work
properly
if
one
suspects
that
most
police
interactions
go
the
way
that
they
should
data
and
transparency
can
potentially
be
a
boon
to
solidarity
between
officers
and
communities
data
can
perhaps
put
what
police
actually
do
most
of
the
time
in
clearer
perspective
when
then
state
senator
obama
led
the
illinois
legislature
in
passing
antiracial
profiling
legislation
in
n
he
emphasized
that
the
purpose
of
the
bill
was
to
collect
data
on
police
activity
he
convinced
the
fraternal
order
of
police
that
the
data
would
give
them
an
opportunity
to
show
that
they
were
doing
valid
police
work
not
engaging
in
racial
discrimination
n
this
initiative
represents
only
one
example
of
a
transparency
measure
that
could
serve
both
to
root
out
estrangement
and
to
provide
a
more
informed
understanding
of
police
yet
perhaps
an
even
more
effective
approach
would
include
ways
to
make
policing
more
qualitatively
transparent
for
instance
making
videos
of
regular
police
work
more
publicly
available
opening
access
to
police
departments
and
perhaps
even
finding
ways
to
support
more
adversarial
forms
of
transparency
and
accountability
such
as
organized
cop
watching
n
reconciliation
is
a
third
type
of
democratic
reform
that
the
legal
estrangement
perspective
might
suggest
criminologist
and
activist
david
kennedy
along
with
leaders
of
the
doj
funded
national
initiative
for
building
community
trust
and
justice
have
proposed
that
police
departments
undertake
a
reconciliation
process
between
officers
and
historically
distressed
communities
n
although
the
specific
mechanisms
that
would
be
officially
instituted
are
unclear
the
proposed
process
would
involve
a
method
of
facilitating
frank
engagements
between
minority
communities
police
and
other
authorities
that
allow
them
to
address
historical
tensions
grievances
and
misconceptions
and
reset
relationships
n
the
idea
of
reconciliation
builds
on
kennedy
s
groundbreaking
work
as
founder
of
operation
ceasefire
and
the
national
network
for
safe
communities
nnsc
through
these
two
organizations
kennedy
and
others
engaged
in
a
deep
strategy
of
violence
prevention
by
working
with
local
gangs
and
bringing
those
offenders
together
with
key
stakeholders
including
the
police
n
the
newly
proposed
reconciliation
efforts
represent
an
effort
to
scale
up
some
of
the
insights
gained
from
these
local
violence
reduction
interventions
the
mechanics
of
this
reconciliation
proposal
remain
unclear
the
proposal
is
distinct
from
prevailing
democratic
reform
recommendations
because
it
takes
very
seriously
the
historical
roots
of
legal
estrangement
accommodates
the
complexity
of
the
dynamics
between
officers
and
communities
and
in
some
ways
meets
the
habermasian
ideal
of
a
truly
deliberative
consent
based
approach
to
policing
taking
full
account
of
historical
distrust
is
essential
to
the
success
of
cultural
change
to
avoid
merely
replacing
one
modality
of
domination
with
another
n
however
governments
usually
use
truth
and
reconciliation
processes
to
address
injustices
that
occurred
over
a
cognizable
bounded
time
period
and
involved
a
fairly
identifiable
set
of
wrongdoers
n
to
deal
with
the
problem
of
legal
estrangement
a
restorative
reconciliation
model
would
have
to
recognize
the
deeply
systemic
nature
of
the
problem
moreover
nnsc
s
goal
of
reducing
violence
is
not
the
same
as
rooting
out
legal
estrangement
a
key
insight
that
drives
the
innovation
in
operation
ceasefire
and
other
programs
is
that
most
of
the
violence
in
a
community
is
concentrated
within
relatively
confined
networks
n
thus
deeply
targeting
those
networks
in
a
deliberative
legitimacy
building
way
is
a
successful
approach
legal
estrangement
in
contrast
is
more
dispersed
and
broadly
influential
however
the
basic
intuitions
of
reconciliation
intentionally
bringing
police
and
communities
together
to
build
trust
on
a
group
level
and
actively
reckoning
with
the
collective
memories
of
harsh
policing
reflect
the
type
of
intensive
deeply
democratic
process
that
might
produce
long
lasting
cultural
change
f
shrinking
refining
the
footprint
of
the
police
finally
the
legal
estrangement
perspective
raises
fundamental
questions
about
the
role
of
police
in
society
police
and
more
broadly
the
criminal
justice
system
have
become
the
primary
vehicle
through
which
the
state
responds
to
social
deprivation
n
at
times
police
can
play
a
positive
role
in
channeling
resources
to
people
who
need
them
particularly
as
a
conduit
into
diversion
and
decarceration
programs
that
may
for
example
help
people
get
into
counseling
and
narcotics
rehabilitation
programs
n
yet
as
a
matter
of
principle
routing
rehabilitation
and
social
services
through
the
police
could
perversely
widen
the
carceral
net
and
reify
the
culture
of
control
n
the
expansion
of
policing
control
has
added
to
police
departments
coffers
over
the
past
three
decades
leading
to
the
growth
of
many
forces
n
yet
even
police
officers
complain
that
the
system
expects
them
to
play
an
outsized
role
in
poor
people
s
daily
lives
performing
functions
that
supplant
work
ideally
done
by
the
welfare
state
and
social
services
n
this
work
responding
to
mental
health
crisis
n
truancy
n
homelessness
n
and
more
n
is
done
by
civil
serv
ants
who
are
authorized
to
carry
guns
and
use
lethal
force
n
it
is
done
by
civil
servants
who
through
the
mechanisms
of
self
selection
n
institutional
culture
n
and
perhaps
more
may
be
more
punitive
or
less
empathetic
than
the
average
civil
servant
n
the
legal
estrangement
perspective
should
encourage
serious
reflection
on
whether
and
how
much
armed
officials
should
inhabit
the
role
of
social
caretaker
recently
scholars
and
policymakers
have
pushed
for
a
cultural
shift
in
policing
proposing
that
officers
see
themselves
as
guardians
rather
than
warriors
n
while
this
work
is
commendable
it
demands
greater
discussion
of
the
nature
and
scope
of
the
guardianship
that
we
should
expect
the
police
to
provide
it
might
be
that
reforms
that
enable
greater
collaboration
between
police
and
social
services
could
make
the
police
more
legitimate
at
an
individual
level
but
it
might
also
in
the
aggregate
worsen
disparities
in
criminal
justice
treatment
by
race
and
class
this
aggregate
effect
would
increase
legal
estrangement
ultimately
the
legal
estrangement
perspective
demands
a
more
holistic
discussion
of
institutional
competence
a
legitimacy
analysis
often
examines
institutions
in
a
decontextualized
way
assessing
whether
a
particular
institution
here
the
police
has
legitimacy
or
not
legal
estrangement
encourages
a
more
relational
examination
of
institutions
the
frailty
of
one
bundle
of
institutions
here
the
welfare
state
might
chip
away
at
the
legitimacy
of
the
police
of
other
institutions
and
perhaps
the
state
itself
shrinking
the
footprint
of
armed
bureaucrats
and
creating
a
more
robust
system
of
civil
supports
might
bring
more
legitimacy
to
these
institutions
and
increase
their
capacity
to
produce
social
inclusion
conclusion
this
essay
argues
that
legal
estrangement
a
theory
that
focuses
on
the
symbolic
and
structural
marginalization
of
african
americans
and
the
poor
from
society
provides
richer
theoretical
grounding
for
police
reform
legal
estrangement
theory
incorporates
procedural
justice
a
solution
derived
from
legitimacy
theory
as
a
first
step
toward
understanding
police
distrust
among
african
american
and
poor
communities
yet
legal
estrangement
surpasses
legitimacy
theory
by
fully
considering
two
larger
levels
at
which
distrust
operates
vicarious
marginalization
and
structural
exclusion
vicarious
experiences
range
from
the
mistreatment
of
a
friend
as
jamila
experienced
or
through
learning
about
more
distant
negative
treatment
as
shawna
experienced
when
she
learned
about
the
officer
rapes
structural
aspects
of
policing
the
drug
searches
that
happened
at
lemuel
s
school
the
knockers
that
he
encountered
in
his
neighborhood
and
the
discretion
to
enforce
questionable
walking
ordinances
against
kids
like
justin
exclude
whole
groups
of
people
from
experiencing
policing
as
a
protective
benefit
and
create
a
dividing
line
between
the
valued
and
the
valueless
drawing
on
these
theoretical
insights
i
have
proposed
a
number
of
areas
for
reform
that
taken
together
should
help
create
the
deep
and
lasting
cultural
change
that
will
be
required
to
truly
overcome
legal
estrangement
these
reforms
range
widely
including
more
technocratic
reforms
restructuring
police
wages
and
consolidating
districts
judicial
measures
rethinking
fourth
amendment
levels
of
interpretation
community
centered
measures
democratization
reconciliation
and
transparency
and
a
fundamental
revisitation
of
institutional
roles
shrinking
and
refining
the
police
footprint
while
linking
it
to
a
shoring
up
of
critical
social
welfare
institutions
these
solutions
offer
a
deeper
path
forward
than
the
legitimacy
perspective
does
pushing
beyond
procedural
justice
they
do
of
course
remain
incomplete
the
legal
estrangement
perspective
demands
taking
account
of
historically
rooted
group
marginalization
and
the
collective
consciousness
of
discrimination
and
mistreatment
this
historical
and
collective
perspective
is
central
to
the
project
of
police
reform
accordingly
the
perspective
sensitizes
police
reformers
to
the
idea
that
while
modifications
within
the
institution
of
policing
are
critical
and
should
move
beyond
individual
line
officers
their
work
will
not
be
finished
until
it
spurs
change
in
the
full
array
of
institutions
that
perpetuate
poverty

in

it
is

to
note
that

uses
of

can
be
unreasonable
and

law
or
failing
to

test

procedural

procedural

is
not
just
a

a

it

alleged
assault
occurred
years
before

emerged
as
a
response
to
harsh
police
tactics
n
for
example
one
young
man
who
resides
primarily
in
northwest
baltimore
s
park
heights
neighborhood
said
that
there
are
so
many
cars
on
every
corner
in
that
neighborhood
that
he
constantly
feels
that
he
is
being
watched
i
ll
go
up
to
park
heights
and
every
corner
i
go
to
i
m
going
to
see
a
police
car
i
m
not
trying
to
say
that
s
a
bad
thing
i
m
not
even
saying
a
cop
is
watching
but
when
you
see
a
police
car
eventually
that
s
somebody
saying
you
re
being
watched
for
real
that
s
how
i
feel
and
i
guess
that
s
how
people
see
it
when
they
see
a
cop
car
it
s
like
they
re

watched
this
quote
was
recorded
during
an
interview
conducted
by
kaitlin
edin
nelson
and
janice
bonsu
on
june
n
one
young
woman
discussing
the
same
neighborhood
said
that
it
takes
the
police
about
twenty
five
minutes
to
arrive
when
someone
calls
about
a
murder
accident
or
other
major
event
despite
their
common
presence
geena
i
heard
you
say
earlier
that
a
situation
has
to
be
serious
before
you
call
the
police
what
kind
of
situation
would
that
be
respondent
like
murder
or
a
robbery
accident
somebody
being
injured
not
just
a
little
dispute
or
fuss
somebody
that
has
an
injury
or
someone
in
trouble
geena
how
long
would
the
police
take
to
respond
and
get
there
respondent
i
don
t
know
i
think
like
twenty
five
minutes
unless
they
re
in
the
area
and
they
just
got
called
over
monica
do
you
see
the
police
around
a
lot
like
you
said
unless
they
re
in
the
area
are
they
in
the
areas
where
you
are
that
much
respondent
ye
ah
they
do

the

purposes
of
police
have
changed
sometimes
quite
dramatically
and
new
tactics
increasingly
define
how
they
deploy
their
resources
but
studies
of
police
budgets
and
working
practices
suggest
that
the
daily
practices
of
most
police
forces
have
not
changed
so
drastically
as
this
would
suggest
and
moreover
these
new
priorities
and
tactics
have
not
as
yet
led
to
any
basic
reorganization
of
the

while
some
media
focused
on
gaines
s
actions
as
a
catalyst
for
the
police
response
and
her
death
activists
have
claimed
more
in
line
with
a
legal
estrangement
perspective
that
the
officers
decision
to
fire
on
gaines
when
she
was
holding
her
five
year
old
son
was
symbolic
of
their
devaluation
of
african
american
lives
from
a
legitimacy
perspective
the
fact
that
gaines
was
carrying
a
shotgun
which
she
allegedly
fired
could
be
relevant
officers
can
explain
in
a
seemingly
neutral
way
why
they
made
the
decision
to
fire
from
an
estrangement
perspective
regardless
of
whether
the
officers
decision
was
objectively
reasonable
it
was
subjectively
unreasonable
and
reproductive
of
the
social
exclusion
of
african
americans
n
one
exception
to
this
characterization
is
some
of
tracey
meares
s
scholarship
in
particular
in
a
lecture
on
the
legitimacy
of
police
among
young
african
american
men
meares
argues
that
legitimacy
based
policing
can
build
trust
between
this
population
and
the
police
meares
legitimacy
of
police
supra
note
at
yet
meares
notes
that
a
core
assumption
of
legitimacy
theory
that
noncompliance
with
the
law
and
law
enforcement
is
attributable
to
a
lack
of
belief
in
the
legitimacy
of
the
law
or
law
enforcement
may
not
be
fully
supported
in
research
including
her
own
id
the
faultiness
of
this
assumption
particularly
as
applied
to
young
african
american
men
calls
into
question
whether
it
is
correct
to
assume
that
legitimacy
based
policing
will

introduction
the
potential
benefits
of
smart
city
technologies
are
numerous
by
becoming
smart
a
city
can
not
only
deliver
more
and
better
services
with
greater
efficiency
it
can
capture
the
cultural
cach
of
the
tech
savvy
label
what
city
leader
would
not
want
the
economic
growth
that
comes
with
a
thriving
startup
community
everyone
wants
to
be
the
next
silicon
valley
or
seattle
and
these
regions
want
to
maintain
their
status
as
hot
tech
hubs
so
smart
city
initiatives
race
ahead
in
pittsburgh
new
york
los
angeles
kansas
city
atlanta
and
elsewhere
driving
innovation
to
bring
the
american
city
into
the
st
century
n
however
privacy
advocates
are
voicing
concerns
over
some
of
the
privacy
risks
and
other
unintended
consequences
that
can
crop
up
with
smart
city
programs
the
purpose
of
this
essay
is
not
to
deny
the
benefits
of
smart
city
initiatives
or
argue
against
their
implementation
rather
it
seeks
to
help
policy
makers
avoid
problems
by
identifying
them
early
on
before
they
become
baked
into
smart
city
systems
it
cautions
them
to
adopt
the
front
page
test
when
evaluating
potential
projects
to
make
this
point
the
essay
posits
hypothetical
headlines
that
distill
the
way
privacy
risks
from
smart
cities
can
capture
the
public
s
imagination
it
also
highlights
common
assumptions
and
mistakes
that
give
rise
to
these
privacy
and
other
risks
and
urges
policy
makers
to
reframe
the
way
they
think
about
privacy
and
smart
cities
the
beauty
of
the
smart
cities
movement
is
the
diversity
of
ideas
enabled
by
the
focus
on
locality
cities
all
over
the
world
are
experimenting
with
novel
projects
all
the
time
and
no
one
person
could
chronicle
all
the
potential
privacy
risks
rather
than
attempt
the
impossible
this
essay
hopes
to
impact
policy
by
identifying
motivating
examples
and
advocating
a
measured
approach
where
policy
makers
question
the
assumptions
that
lead
to
privacy
risks
and
enact
strong
structural
safeguards
to
minimize
those
risks
figure

the
potential
ways
smart
city
privacy
or
other
problems
could
manifest
on
the
front
page
many
inspired
by
real
life
examples
the
rest
of
the
essay
is
devoted
to
explaining
reframing
and
preventing
these
issues

attempt
to
highlight
major
privacy

that
can

programs
part

will
identify
the
assumptions
and

that
might
lead
to
such

what
is
a
smart
city
a
smart
city
is
one
that
integrates
information
and
communication
technologies
icts
and
the
internet
of
things
iot
to
manage
the
city
s
assets
and
delivery
of
services
city
assets
and
services
may
include
local
departments
information
systems
schools
libraries
transportation
systems
hospitals
power
plants
law
enforcement
and
other
community
services
n
essentially
smart
cities
seek
to
improve
city
life
by
gathering
more
data
analyzing
and
processing
that
data
sharing
it
and
using
it
to
deliver
services
a
typical
smart
city
initiative
might
include
installation
of
internet
connected
sensors
in
public
places
value
added
services
like
free
wi
fi
or
public
information
kiosks
big
data
analytics
of
publicly
held
data
an
online
portal
through
which
to
share
municipal
data
or
some
combination
of
the
above
and
more
these
sorts
of
projects
offer
substantial
benefits
to
cities
and
their
residents
a
central
plank
of
most
smart
city
projects
is
the
deployment
of
internet
connected
sensors
to
provide
the
city
with
the
data
it
needs
to
be
smart
for
example
in
kansas
city
sensity
s
led
streetlights
not
only
consume
much
less
electricity
than
a
traditional
bulb
but
have
visual
sensors
that
can
track
when
a
vehicle
is
blocking
the
path
of
the
new
streetcar
and
alert
authorities
to
have
it
ticketed
and
removed
this
system
allows
the
city
s
public
transit
to
operate
unimpeded
other
cities
have
systems
to
monitor
traffic
flow
or
listen
for
gunshots
and
dispatch
police
sensors
are
not
the
only
smart
city
tool
however
many
cities
wish
to
use
technology
to
improve
governance
and
streamline
service
delivery
police
departments
have
tools
that
analyze
crime
patterns
and
can
inform
them
where
crimes
are
likely
to
occur
in
the
future
allowing
for
more
efficient
resource
allocation
a
city
might
employ
an
app
that
lets
citizens
report
potholes
or
other
road
hazards
for
expedited
repair
some
cities
have
gone
even
further
by
experimenting
with
algorithmic
decision
making
in
city
services
and
programs
municipal
open
data
initiatives
seek
to
share
the
data
held
by
the
city
with
the
public
generally
through
an
online
portal
the
hope
is
that
such
data
will
empower
citizens
to
accomplish
civic
projects
or
allow
business
to
better
inform
their
work
for
example
advocacy
groups
might
be
able
to
track
patterns
of
discriminatory
housing
practices
or
local
entrepreneurs
may
build
an
app
for
better
real
time
traffic
updates
value
added
services
are
another
publicly
recognizable
smart
city
benefit
the
most
common
of
these
services
is
free
public
wi
fi
but
could
also
include
public
kiosks
that
provide
real
time
information
on
events
restaurants
or
public
transit
new
york
and
kansas
city
are
leading
the
way
with
such
kiosks
clearly
the
rewards
of
a
smart
city
are
great
but
such
rewards
also
come
with
risks
this
essay
s
chief
concerns
are
the
risks
posed
to
privacy
and
civil
liberties
iii
the
problem
with
smart
cities
just
as
the
nature
of
smart
city
projects
and
their
intended
benefits
are
diverse
so
are
the
potential
problems
they
encompass
multiple
forms
of
privacy
and
security
risks
as
well
as
threats
to
civil
liberties
a
common
concern
is
the
increase
in
data
collection
that
smart
cities
naturally
entail
if
smart
city
sensors
are
deployed
in
public
areas
which
is
kind
of
the
point
they
potentially
introduce
government
surveillance
technology
into
the
public
square
at
an
unprecedented
level
as
the
reaction
to
the
snowden
revelations
demonstrates
the
public
can
react
quite
strongly
to
programs
they
interpret
as
unbridled
government
surveillance
the
proliferation
of
sensors
is
not
the
only
smart
city
problem
however
the
prospect
of
free
public
wi
fi
is
appealing
to
many
but
sometimes
the
label
free
doesn
t
fully
account
for
the
cost
of
the
service
when
it
entails
turning
users
into
data
subjects
and
then
monetizing
them
n
further
cities
run
the
risk
of
discrimination
and
disparate
impact
that
can
be
entirely
unintentional
for
example
transportation
schemes
that
rely
solely
on
smartphone
hailed
ride
sharing
services
could
exclude
elderly
or
homeless
populations
without
access
to
that
technology
in
many
cases
the
unforeseen
consequences
and
burdens
of
a
smart
city
initiative
will
fall
most
heavily
on
the
disadvantaged
poor
ubiquitous
surveillance
may
combat
crime
but
it
will
also
cast
its
eye
most
heavily
upon
people
who
use
public
services
and
spaces
most
frequently
and
may
exacerbate
the
criminalization
of
homelessness
n
those
with
means
can
purchase
wi
fi
in
the
home
while
those
without
may
be
relegated
to
free
public
networks
where
they
exchange
personal
information
for
services
even
worse
the
poor
often
have
the
least
voice
in
public
debates
and
decision
making
who
will
speak
for
them
when
the
city
s
big
data
analytics
route
services
away
from
the
urban
core
to
avoid
safety
issues
or
systemically
recommend
against
granting
bail
based
on
race
n
other
problems
of
inequity
may
emerge
along
the
rural
urban
digital
divide
n
well
funded
and
technically
savvy
city
governments
can
afford
dedicated
privacy
officers
but
smaller
cities
may
rush
to
implement
smart
city
technologies
while
lacking
the
capacity
or
expertise
to
address
privacy
these
issues
need
serious
consideration
now
not
after
smart
city
programs
are
already
in
place
and
the
damage
has
been
done
it
is
likely
that
most
policy
makers
care
about
privacy
at
least
in
the
abstract
nevertheless
the
rush
to
capture
the
benefits
of
smart
cities
can
blind
policy
makers
to
important
privacy
considerations
this
blindness
is
often
the
result
of
some
faulty
assumptions
or
a
mistaken
framing
of
the
privacy
issue
whatever
the
reason
cities
can
pay
the
price
for
ignoring
privacy
in
the
form
of
bad
publicity
in
the
worst
cases
the
stories
about
smart
city
privacy
issues
can
morph
out
of
control
based
on
misinformation
and
scuttle
entire
projects
n
at
a
minimum
policy
makers
should
apply
the
front
page
test
when
planning
and
implementing
their
smart
city
programs
asking
themselves
how
the
public
might
react
if
their
decision
were
splashed
on
tomorrow
morning
s
front
page
city
policy
makers
should
recognize
as
a
baseline
that
privacy
is
important
for
utilitarian
if
not
outright
ethical
reasons
and
seek
to
mitigate
privacy
problems
wherever
they
can
the
efforts
of
smart
city
leaders
like
seattle
and
kansas

demonstrate
that
privacy
can
be
a
smart

a

data
collection

its

tends
to
create
privacy
problems

utility
standpoint
a

constantly
storing

vast
quantities
of

is
an
ideal
smart
city
tool
not
so
much
from

the

of
such

can
be
thought

risks
could

through

noisetube
says
nothing

identification
is
quite
difficult
to
accomplish
because
the
prevalence
of
big
data
often
allows
determined
actors
to
reverse
the
de
identification
process
and
compromise
a
data
subject
s
privacy
n
in
a
classic
example
researchers
were
able
to
re
identify
medical
records
from
knowing
only
the
sex
date
of
birth
and
zip
code
of
the
patient
n
the
mosaic
effect
becomes
a
concern
when
multiple
data
sets
are
available
for
combination
the
very
core
of
big
data
n
the
combination
of
data
sets
can
reveal
information
that
was
thought
to
be
anonymous
for
instance
linking
various
records
through
a
common
zip
code
n
and
in
some
cases
can
lead
to
complete
re
identification
moreover
even
aggregate
or
meta
data
can
be
misused
n
headline

problems
when
city
s

changes
hands
going
back
to
the
boston
license
plate
example
that
data
became
exposed
after
it
passed
through
the
hands
of
multiple
vendors
the
last
of
which
failed
to
take
common
sense
precautions
with
sensitive
information
even
if
a
smart
city
makes
strong
privacy
commitments
those
commitments
are
meaningless
if
they
aren
t
enforceable
on
downstream
parties
for
instance
an
analysis
of
the
city
of
seattle
s
vendor
contracts
revealed
that
only
a
small
minority
made
any
mention
of
protecting
the
privacy
and
cybersecurity
of
the
data
sets
n
in
addition
city
residents
and
smart
city
users
may
consent
to
their
data
being
used
in
one
way
by
a
certain
set
of
actors
but
not
in
other
ways
by
other
entities
for
example
a
homeowner
might
wish
to
share
meter
data
to
improve
energy
efficiency
but
would
not
want
that
data
shared
to
target
advertising
or
they
might
consent
to
advertising
but
not
to
having
their
appliances
shut
off
during
peak
usage
times
what
s
more
because
of
bounded
rationality
and
the
limitations
of
privacy
policies
users
may
not
even
be
aware
of
the
myriad
ways
their
information
is
being
used
and
reused
bought
and
sold
n
again
economically
disadvantaged
communities
may
be
at
a
greater
risk
because
they
may
lack
the
sophistication
and
technical
fluency
to
navigate
the

first

headline
city
prefers
manipulation
over
legislation
to
control
citizen
behavior
city
policy
makers
have
numerous
tools
at
their
disposal
to
influence
citizen
behavior
cities
routinely
legislate
through
city
codes
and
ordinances
scholars
have
also
been
exploring
alternative
means
of
regulation
such
as
nudging
designing
around
cognitive
biases
to
push
people
toward
salutary
behavior
n
this
regulatory
approach
grew
in
standing
when
cass
sunstein
ascended
to
the
head
of
the
office
of
information
and
regulatory
affairs
under
obama
other
works
show
that
digitizing
platforms
can
lead
to
problematic
asymmetries
of
information
and
power
leaving
consumers
subject
to
unprecedented
manipulation
n
taken
together
these
two
bodies
of
literature
suggest
that
digital
i
e
smart
cities
will
present
numerous
and
novel
opportunities
for
policy
makers
to
influence
citizens
as
smart
cities
move
to
digitize
their
interactions
with
citizens
the
interface
between
city
and
citizen
will
be
increasingly
subject
to
the
design
caprice
of
policy
makers
but
cities
should
be
wary
of
abusing
these
techniques
even
the
originators
of
nudging
warn
that
such
techniques
should
be
constrained
by
the
front
page
test
n
if
warnings
to
heed
the
front
page
test
are
not
enough
judicial
concerns
over
separation
of
powers
may
haunt
or
even
end
well
intentioned
regulation
for
example
in
a
decidedly
analogue
case
the
new
york
city
department
of
health
recently
attempted
to
nudge
people
toward
drinking
smaller
portions
of
sugary
drinks
by
capping
soda
serving
sizes
one
of
the
reasons
the
new
york
appellate
division
struck
down
the
regulation
because
it
violated
separation
of
powers
n
they
reasoned
that
the
board
usurped
legislative
role
of
identifying
new
health
hazards
n
by
relying
on
digital
design
and
architecture
policy
makers
will
have
even
greater
opportunities
to
circumvent
democratic
processes
they
may
also
inadvertently
violate
other
legal
constraints
like
due
process
or
equal
protection
the
digitization
of
cities
no
less
than
market
places
or
service
platforms
will
bring
disruptive
change
that
may
challenge
existing
legal
structures
and
theories
c

inequity
and
discrimination
smart
city
programs
have
the
potential
to
ease
inequity
and
discrimination
and
deliver
better
services
for
all
city
residents
but
as
with
privacy
unthinking
or
careless
adoption
can
threaten
civil
rights
and
increase
or
entrench
inequity
headline
city
wi
fi
program
discriminates
against
the
poor
and
elderly
for
example
many
smart
city
initiatives
rely
on
smartphones
as
a
predeployed
network
of
sensors
and
trackers
however
it
is
easy
to
forget
that
not
everyone
has
ready
access
to
this
technology
while
smartphone
penetration
in
the
u
s
has
reached
an
impressive
of
the
mobile
phone
market
n
that
still
leaves
of
the
population
without
this
so
called
ubiquitous
technology
and
that
is
not
even
counting
people
without
cellphones
if
a
service

to
provide
first
mile
last
mile
transit
services
getting
people
from
their
front
doors
to

and
vice

relies
solely
on

then
one
in
every
five
people
will
be
left
out
other
projects
may
simply
fail
to
deliver
the
intended
benefits
to
certain
communities
because
of
a
lack
of
understanding
of
those
community
s
needs
n
or
as
mentioned
earlier
the
design
of
some
projects
might
create
disparate
impacts
between
communities
such
as
ad
supported
projects
catering
more
to
rich
users
with
more
valuable
eyeballs
n
much
of
the
foregoing
discussion
has
focused
on
the
ways
in
which
a
lack
of
privacy
can
have
a
disparate
impact
on
the
poor
large
databases
can
discriminate
in
prosaic
and
unintended
ways
for
instance
through
simple
data
entry
errors
people
who
change
their
names
often
women
and
those
with
multiple
surnames
often
people
of
color
like
hispanics
are
more
likely
to
have
errors
in
identity
databases
n
however
big
data
also
poses
risks
of
more
pernicious
forms
of
discrimination
there
are
significant
worries
this
technology
could
be
used
to
digitally
redline
certain
ethnic
or
otherwise
unwanted
groups
from
retail
commerce
employment
tenancy
or
credit
n
much
of
the
data
collected
and
process
by
a
smart
city
program
is
not
subject
to
the
protections
of
the
fair
credit
reporting
act
yet
some
companies
have
found
a
way
to
use
it
as
a
proxy
for
credit
risk
all
the
same
n
recall
that
mosaic
effects
allow
multiple
data
points
in
city
open
data
initiatives
to
link
information
to
zip
code
this
fact
could
revive
the
specter
of
good
old
fashion
redlining
where
information
available
through
city
open
data
portals
inadvertently
links
people
to
zip
codes
who
are
then

increased
reliance

algorithmic
decision
making
is
a
more
cutting
edge
application
early
adopters
hope
it
can
improve
municipal
governance
and
efficiency
for
example
washington
d
c
has
begun
basing
bail
decisions
for
city
jails
based
not
on
ability
to
pay
but
on
a
computer
algorithm
s
assessment
of
the
accused
s
flight
and
recidivism
risk
n
at
first
blush
removing
ability
to
pay
as
a
factor
seems
a
more
equitable
solution
however
civil
rights
activists
have
expressed
concerns
that
the
data
feeding
these
algorithms
may
reflect
and
perpetuate
system
bias
already
prominent
in
the
criminal
justice
system
n
if
such
systems
are
built
without
giving
thought
to
the
potential
for
discrimination
they
will
preserve
it
under
the
guise
of
scientific
fairness
algorithms
like
all
technologies
are
designed
by
people
and
design
choices
will
always
reflect
the
biases
or
lack
of
knowledge
of
the
designer
n
iv
common
assumptions
and
mistakes
what
are
the
assumptions
and
mistakes
that
underpin
these
smart
city
risks
part
iv
will
identify
a
few
of
the
most
pernicious
ones
and
recommend
simple
reframes
to
mitigate
them
sometimes
the
remedy
is
merely
to
recognize
the
potential
risks
in
other
cases
it
will
question
longstanding
practices
in
the
commercial
internet
a
assumption
google
does
it
so
we
can
too
in
the
prevailing
price
model
for
services
in
the
information
economy
users
divulge
some
private
information
and
or
assent
to
tracking
in
exchange
for
free
services
but
in
that
model
when
the
service
is
free
the
user
is
the
product
as
people
become
more
accustomed
to
giving
up
privacy
for
free
services
the
temptation
to
borrow
the
private
sector
model
only
grows
after
all
governments
always
need
more
money
and
the
monetary
value
of
incoming
data
from
smart
cities
is
hard
to
ignore
why
shouldn
t
cities
sell
this
data
to
raise
revenue
or
at
least
offset
the
cost
of
delivering
smart
city
services
the
answer
lies
in
the
different
responsibilities
of
private
and
public
sector
actors
private
companies
have
a
responsibility
to
deliver
value
to
their
shareholders
they
care
about
privacy
only
insofar
as
it
is
good
for
the
bottom
line
what
s
more
every
individual
customer
strikes
their
own
bargain
with
a
company
when
they
use
the
company
s
services
they
may
not
negotiate
the
individual
terms
of
the
contract
but
they
can
at
least
choose
whether
to
transact
the
social
contract
is
different
from
a
commercial
contract
governments
have
an
inherent
responsibility
to
safeguard
the
interest
of
their
citizens
and
among
those
interests
is
privacy
most
individuals
cannot
feasibly
opt
out
of
public
life
nor
should
they
be
forced
to
in
order
to
protect
their
privacy
further
every
citizen
already
pays
for
services
in
the
form
of
taxes
there
are
already
defined
pathways
through
which
governments
raise
money
to
step
outside
those
pathways
can
violate
the
implicit
bargain
between
people
and
their
governments
b
assumption
notice
and
consent
is
always
enough
to
protect
privacy
notice
and
consent
the
idea
that
institutions
must
properly
notify
users
and
obtain
their
consent
before
collecting
and
using
their
data
has
been
the
cornerstone
of
privacy
regulation
in
the
us
for
years
though
many
privacy
scholars
have
looked
at
this
regime
and
found
it
lacking
n
such
notices
may
be
incomprehensible
to
the
average
user
n
or
simply
too
numerous
to
deal
with
as
a
practical
matter
n
notice
and
consent
faces
further
difficulty
in
iot
applications
such
as
public
cameras
or
light
poles
because
meaningful
opportunities
to
provide
notice
and
consent
are
few
or
non
existent
and
citizens
do
not
have
a
meaningful
choice
to
avoid
city
streets
there
are
other
more
privacy
protecting
regimes
that
cities
can
and
should
employ
n
c
assumption
this
will
be
better
because
it
involves
technology
some
policy
makers
may
pursue
technological
solutions
uncritically
out
of
blind
faith
that
because
they
involve
technology
they
must
be
better
smart
cities
do
after
all
have
the
word
smart
in
their
name
but
policy
makers
would
do
well
to
remember
that
new
technological
breakthroughs
often
come
with
new
risks
or
present
risks
in
new
ways
cathy
o
neil
author
of
the
book
weapons
of
math
destruction
has
documented
the
myriad
ways
in
which
the
unthinking
application
of
algorithms
and
big
data
analytics
can
have
negative
consequences
n
technology
is
still
built
by
human
beings
and
will
often
reflect
the
human
goals
ideologies
and
biases
n
d
assumption
free
services
have
zero
cost
the
information
economy
offers
an
ever
expanding
number
of
services
without
asking
for
a
penny
in
exchange
instead
users
give
their
consent
sometimes
explicit
though
often
tacit
to
divulge
personal
information
up
front
and
have
their
online
activities
tracked
this
arrangement
has
created
tremendous
value
for
both
users
and
service
providers
but
is
it
truly
without
cost
chris
hoofnagle
and
jan
whittington
have
documented
how
the
free
label
allows
companies
to
generate
contractual
hazards
for
consumers
ignore
consumer
preferences
for
privacy
and
mislead
consumers
by
creating
the
impression
that
a
given
transaction
will
be
free
n
policy
makers
should
not
be
similarly
misled
privacy
is
not
free
and
if
smart
cities
are
to
protect
it
they
will
likely
need
to
bear
those
costs
for
example
in
the
san
francisco
mayor
s
office
greenlit
a
municipal
wi
fi
project
in
partnership
with
earthlink
and
google
n
the
deal
would
have
subjected
users
particularly
free
users
to
invasive
tracking
n
however
a
study
by
the
city
budget
analyst
showed
that
although
a
municipally
owned
service
posed
some
risks
it
was
fiscally
feasible
and
more
privacy
protective
n
cities
should
consider
the
true
costs
of
free
services
and
consider
whether
other
models
can
suit
their
purposes
while
protecting
privacy
e
assumption
de
identification
aggregation
eliminates
privacy
risks
i
have
already
covered
the
difficulties
of
creating
truly
de
identified
and
anonymous
data
sets
above
and
others
have
done
the
same
task
much
more
skillfully
than
i
ever
could
n
in
privacy
as
in
life
there
are
no
silver
bullets
or
one
size
fits
all
solutions
de
identification
has
a
role
to
play
but
it
cannot
be
the
only
privacy
protection
in
place
f
assumption
more
data
is
always
better
the
benefits
of
big
data
are
so
tempting
that
it
can
be
easy
to
fall
into
this
trap
however
increasing
the
amount
of
data
held
also
increases
the
risks
discussed
above
recall
that
state
open
records
acts
may
require
disclosure
of
vast
swathes
of
city
held
records
which
will
only
grow
in
volume
as
smart
cities
hold
on
to
more
data
for
example
washington
state
s
law
requires
disclosure
of
all
records
except
for
six
specifically
enumerated
categories
greatly
increasing
the
risk
of
unintended
information
spillage
as
cities
like
seattle
collect
more
data
n
data
minimization
is
a
powerful
tool
to
avoid
these
risks
in
another
example
kansas
city
s
sensity
light
posts
process
all
of
their
visual
data
locally
in
the
lighting
unit
via
machine
learning
algorithm
that
can
determine
whether
to
take
action
without
a
human
ever
laying
eyes
on
the
video
feed
therefore
this
data
does
not
need
to
be
transmitted
or
stored
at
a
central
location
nor
does
it
even
need
to
be
recorded
g
mistake
forgetting
about
security
hopefully
with
the
rise
in
high
profile
attacks
and
data
breaches
this
mistake
is
becoming
less
common
but
even
when
organizations
attempt
to
address
security
it
is
notoriously
difficult
to
do
well
cities
also
need
to
ensure
that
their
vendors
and
other
third
parties
treat
their
data
with
an
appropriate
level
of
care
h
mistake
proceeding
without
transparency
or
public
engagement
as
this
essay
s
headlines
illustrate
privacy
or
lack
thereof
can
make
the
public
nervous
and
stories
about
privacy
abuses
can
go
viral
quickly
this
seems
to
be
a
lesson
that
governments
will
be
learning
for
as
long
as
governments
exist
but
transparency
and
public
engagement
are
the
best
way
to
avoid
a
bad
headline
they
also
make
for
better
governance
and
hopefully
better
privacy
protections
kansas
city
s
smart
city
advisory
board
is
a
model
of
transparency
in
this
respect
and
may
be
credited
with
the
quiet
and
quiescent
implementation
of
their
smart
city
plan
v
models
the
potential
benefits
of
smart
cities
are
too
great
to
let
a
privacy
fundamentalist
approach
prevent
their
implementation
instead
policy
makers
should
be
pragmatic
and
clear
eyed
about
the
privacy
and
discrimination
risks
many
policy
makers
are
already
thinking
about
these
risks
n
fortunately
there
is
a
great
deal
of
precedent
for
protecting
the
privacy
of
institutionally
and
government
held
data
while
delivering
benefits
to
consumers
and
citizens
a
seattle
s
privacy
vetting
process
while
seattle
has
had
its
share
of
run
ins
with
privacy
advocates
in
the
past
n
recent
efforts
demonstrate
a
strong
commitment
both
to
transparency
open
data
and
privacy
while
the
city
has
made
commitments
to
open
up
its
data
across
all
departments
n
it
has
also
implemented
an
extensive
privacy
intake
and
review
process
to
handle
this
data
n
the
program
is
pragmatic
it
recognizes
that
different
departments
have
varying
levels
of
sophistication
when
it
comes
to
privacy
and
therefore
utilizes
an
easily
understood
privacy
review
process
n
the
program
consists
of
a
series
of
straightforward
questions
many
of
them
yes
no
and
all
of
them
in
plain
english
to
walk
civil
servants
through
the
process
of
deciding
how
to
handle
city
data
n
the
city
created
a
chief
privacy
officer
that
can
work
across
departments
to
ensure
citywide
compliance
with
the
privacy
program
rather
than
being
confined
to
the
department
of
information
technology
n
it
also
designates
privacy
champions
within
individual
departments
to
help
inculcate
a
culture
of
privacy
within
the
bureaucracy
and
implement
programs
n
finally
the
city
conducted
an
extensive
privacy
impact
assessment
with
local
partners
at
the
university
of
washington
to
identify
weaknesses
in
its
programs
one
finding
of
the
assessment
was
that
vendor
contracts
were
often
weak
or
agnostic
on
privacy
protection
n
after
the
assessment
the
city
found
that
one
of
its
vendor
contracts
enabled
a
vendor
to
sell
the
traffic
location
data
from
bluetooth
and
wi
fi
sensors
on
secondary
markets
with
this
realization
the
city
was
able
to
successfully
renegotiate
its
contract
and
is
working
on
standard
terms
that
will
protect
privacy
cities
should
remember
that
have
tremendous
market
power
in
negotiating
contracts

san

san
francisco
s

initiative
employs
a
comprehensive
step
by
step
model
to
balance
privacy
risks
vs
data
utility
when
deciding
whether
to
disclose
city
data
while
perhaps
overly
complex
for
city
employees
unfamiliar
with
the
nuances
of
data
privacy
the
model
is
keenly
aware
of
the
privacy
risks
discussed
in
this
essay
particularly
re
identification
it
astutely
calls
for
regular
penetration
testing
and
re
assessment
of
privacy
impacts
n
c
hipaa
the
health
insurance
portability
and
accountability
act
starts
with
the
assumption
of
confidentiality
and
privacy
and
only
deviates
from
that
norm
under
specific
enumerated
circumstances
n
in
addition
to
strict
though
imperfect
n
requirements
for
de
identification
n
hipaa
s
privacy
rules
have
strong
proscriptions
against
using
patient
data
for
marketing
n
the
law
is
not
without
its
faults
of
course
but
emphasizes
patient
control
of
data
and
has
become
synonymous
with
strong
privacy
protection
while
allowing
for
salutary
uses
of
data
for
things
like
research
n
d
the
u
s
census
what
does
a
year
old
accounting
of
american
households
run
by
a
federal
bureaucracy
have
to
do
with
privacy
it
turns
out
quite
a
lot
when
it
involves
collecting
personal
information
on
every
single
american
or
at
least
trying
to
the
census
bureau
collects
vast
amounts
of
personal
information
on
americans
while
maintaining
strong
privacy
protections
related
to
disclosure
n
misuse
n
and
access
for
research
n
at
the
same
time
the
bureau
allows
the
data
subject
access
to
and
use
of
their
own
data
n
e
the
privacy
act
the
privacy
act
of
was
one
of
the
earliest
codifications
of
the
fair
information
practices
fips
it
protects
personal
information
held
by
the
federal
government
from
disclosure
n
the
interplay
between
the
privacy
act
and
the
freedom
of
information
act
foia
n
can
be
a
model
for
cities
struggling
to
balance
privacy
and
transparency
f
state
privacy
acts
state
privacy
acts
are
too
numerous
to
detail
here
but
the
laboratory
of
democracy
offers
a
myriad
of
ways
to
protect
citizen
privacy
in
publicly
held
data
conclusion
nothing
in
this
essay
should
be
taken
as
a
comprehensive
list
of
the
privacy
problems
and
solutions
facing
smart
cities
for
instance
the
fair
information
practices
or
fips
have
been
a
leading
example
of
strong
privacy
protections
when
organizations
actually
follow
them
and
the
federal
trade
commission
has
been
regulating
privacy
for
decades
the
us
has
other
well
developed
sector
specific
privacy
regimes
such
as
the
fair
credit
reporting
act
and
the
graham
leach
bliley
act
there
are
also
many
examples
to
draw
from
internationally
lest
we
assume
the
smart
cities
movement
is
confined
to
the
us
indeed
these
issues
are
too
vast
to
resolve
with
a
single
effort
they
will
require
collaboration
and
conversation
from
numerous
stakeholders
but
the
work
begins
by
acknowledging
the
problems
and
committing
to
address
them
early
on
protecting
privacy
is
well
within
the
power
of
policy
makers
who
are
aware
of
the
problems
and
committed
to
fixing
them
in
doing
so
they
have
an
opportunity
to
challenge
some
of
the
underlying
assumptions
and
longstanding
practices
that
pose
risks
in
the
first
place
hopefully
improving
privacy
as
a
whole
at
the
very
least
they
may
prevent
valuable
innovative
smart
city
projects
from
falling
victim
to
public
ire

analytics
as
a
business
discipline
has
existed
for
decades
its
application
and
acceptance
have
increased
recently
because
of
the
pace
and
scale
of
data
generation
the
increase
in
processing
speeds
rapidly
reducing
storage
costs
and
the
sophistication
of
enabling
tools
and
technology
these
advances
have
led
to
the
promise
of
better
business
decisions
informed
by
the
science
of
analytics
analytics
now
sits
at
the
top
of
the
business
agenda
for
many
leading
organizations
looking
for
new
ways
to
create
competitive
advantage
government
agencies
have
significant
volumes
of
data
and
more
often
than
not
there
is
little
no
dialogue
between
departments
the
insights
that
can
be
derived
out
of
tapping
into
the
collective
knowledge
of
various
departments
is
left
to
one
s
imagination
it
would
generate
outcomes
more
than
sum
of
its
parts
governments
can
harness
the
power
of
analytics
in
a
way
that
very
few
organizations
can
for
example
to
reduce
eliminate
financial
leakages
from
social
welfare
schemes
to
detect
the
most
crime
prone
areas
in
a
city
to
plug
revenue
leakage
by
identifying
fraudulent
transactions
in
taxation
and
expenditure
to
improve
emergency
services
and
to
improve
disaster
response
using
predictive
analytics
these
are
just
a
few
ways
that
governments
can
utilize
the
potential
of
analytics
and
big
data
to
help
serve
people
better
current
scenario
analytics
for
governments
implies
handling
processing
and
sharing
massive
amounts
of
data
that
data
may
be
structured
data
such
as
the
data
managed
within
a
database
system
or
it
might
be
unstructured
data
requiring
additional
technologies
for
interpretation
and
conversion
into
a
usable
format
it
also
requires
having
the
right
skill
sets
with
different
kinds
of
analytics
solutions
such
as
descriptive
analytics
analyzing
what
happened
predictive
analytics
in
which
historical
data
is
scanned
to
find
behavior
patterns
that
can
be
used
to
predict
upcoming
events
or
decisions
and
prescriptive
analytics
which
uses
the
discovered
patterns
to
decide
the
course
of
action
the
government
and
public
sector
are
harnessing
the
benefits
of

government
agencies
around
the

have
already
started
adopting

at
the
beginning
of
the

represents
a
paradigm

in
how
governments
work

the
potential
for

but
there
are
times
when
the
desire
to
adopt

are
hindered
by

and
the
overall
complexity
of

governments
need
to
look
for
solutions
that
enable
incremental

introduction
beginning
in
the
s
police
departments
in
major
american
cities
started
aggressively
deploying
pedestrian
stops
and
body
searches
in
response
to
escalating
violent
crime
rates
n
the
programmatic
deployment
of
stop
and
frisk
or
stop
question
and
frisk
sqf
in
new
york
n
chicago
n
philadelphia
n
and
other
major
cities
n
involved
large
numbers
of
street
stops
and
frisks
often
concentrated
in
a
handful
of
minority
neighborhoods
given
the
volume
of
individuals
stopped
sqf
likely
became
the
modal
form
of
police
citizen
contact
for
many
urban
residents
n
between
may
and
august
for
example
police
in
chicago
stopped
more
than
people
which
translates
into
stops
per
inhabitants
n
in
philadelphia
police
have
stopped
between
and
people
per
year
since
n
in
baltimore
the
department
of
justice
estimates
roughly
people
were
stopped
in
n
at
its
peak
in
new
york
s
sqf
policy
generated
more
than
stops
per
year
n
between
and
that
city
s
inhabitants
experienced
roughly
five
million
street
stops
n
given
the
sheer
scale
of
these
intrusions
into
citizens
daily
lives
it
is
hardly
surprising
that
sqf
would
provoke
some
public
controversy
sharp
elbowed
debate
has
ensued
as
to
whether
african
americans
and
hispanics
are
being
inappropriately
stopped
and
searched
n
in
addition
to
catalyzing
a
wider
national
argument
about
race
and
policing
n
sqf
has
sparked
large
scale
public
protests
n
mayoral
campaigns
n
threats
to
sue
n
and
litigation
itself
in
the
wake
of
legal
challenges
settlements
or
consent
decrees
regulating
the
use
of
street
stops
have
been
reached
in
the
past
few
years
in
several
cities
in
the
last
year
or
so
new
york
n
chicago
n
philadelphia
n
cincinnati
n
new
orleans
n
seattle
n
baltimore
n
cleveland
n
and
newark
n
have
all
entered
into
either
a
judicial
decree
or
a
similar
form
of
settlement
process
two
cities
boston
and
oakland
did
not
wait
for
litigation
but
engaged
expert
consultants
in
both
cases
the
consultant
isolated
evidence
of
racial
discrimination
in
street
policing
n
the
debate
over
sqf
is
heated
in
part
because
of
disagreement
about
how
the
core
moral
wrong
of
intensive
street
policing
if
one
exists
should
be
conceived
the
law
provides
a
starting
point
for
this
inquiry
but
ultimately
not
a
satisfying
answer
the
legal
framework
employed
by
many
of
the
aforementioned
settlements
and
consent
decrees
is
modeled
on
a
body
of
black
letter
constitutional
doctrine
that
is
focused
centrally
on
the
motivations
and
beliefs
of
specific
individual
officers
for
example
in
new
york
the
case
of
floyd
v
city
of
new
york
which
has
yielded
the
only
extensive
judicial
decision
on
sqf
focused
first
on
the
supreme
court
s
decision
terry
v
ohio
n
which
held
that
officers
need
reasonable
articulable
suspicion
of
criminality
to
make
a
nonconsensual
street
stop
consistent
with
the
fourth
amendment
n
then
citing
the
supreme
court
s
decision
in
personnel
administrator
v
feeney
n
the
floyd
court
held
that
plaintiffs
had
to
show
that
sqf
not
only
had
a
racially
disparate
effect
but
had
been
adopted
at
least
in
part
because
of
not
merely
in
spite
of
its
adverse
effects
upon
certain
racial
groups
n
other
consent
decrees
and
settlements
are
also
crafted
in
the
shadow
of
terry
and
feeney
the
seattle
settlement
is
typical
in
commanding
that
the
police
department
adopt
a
street
stop
policy
that
explicitly
conforms
to
constitutional
requirements
that
officers
be
annually
trained
on
fourth
amendment
and
related
law
and
that
patrolling
police
act
free
of
unlawful
bias
n
similarly
the
philadelphia
settlement
condemns
stops
frisks
or
searches
made
without
the
requisite
reasonable
suspicion
and
envisages
policies
and
practices
to
ensure
that
stops
and
frisks
are
not
conducted
on
the
basis
of
the
race
or
ethnic
origin
of
the
suspect
except
where
the
law
permits
race
or
ethnic
origin
to
be
considered
n
this
individualist
black
letter
doctrine
means
that
even
absent
litigation
to
a
final
judgment
courts
and
legal
reform
efforts
have
to
use
a
relatively
narrow
lens
trained
solely
upon
discrete
interpersonal
transactions
similarly
the
dominant
economic
model
of
racial
bias
in
policing
focuses
on
the
identification
of
individual
officers
taste
based
discrimination
over
and
above
statistical
discrimination
n
this
article
argues
that
sqf
presents
a
normative
challenge
that
is
not
well
captured
by
the
individualistic
lens
of
terry
and
feeney
or
by
a
focus
on
taste
based
discrimination
as
a
more
general
matter
the
distinctive
moral
harm
of
sqf
does
not
turn
on
racial
animus
per
feeney
or
weak
evidentiary
predicates
per
terry
although
both
might
well
exist
and
even
be
pervasive
on
the
ground
this
harm
indeed
does
not
arise
within
the
narrow
individualist
transactional
frame
that
currently
dominates
both
law
and
economics
n
sqf
today
is
defined
by
its
large
scale
and
group
based
application
n
its
distinctive
moral
wrong
is
inextricably
related
to
this
programmatic
quality
not
the
happenstance
of
individual
officers
motives
n
the
core
of
this
wrong
is
structural
accordingly
the
welfarist
analysis
i
propose
in
part
i
is
focused
on
the
large
scale
programmatic
use
of
sqf
as
observed
in
new
york
chicago
and
philadelphia
in
contrast
i
have
no
cavil
with
the
retail
use
of
terry
stops
as
an
element
of
nonprogrammatic
street
policing
when
operationalized
at
a
large
scale
however
sqf
is
an
important
link
in
the
reproduction
of
social
and
racial
stratification
in
this
regard
it
typically
has
large
regressive
distributional
effects
and
surprisingly
little
value
added
as
a
crime
control
measure
more
specifically
sqf
should
be
understood
as
a
historically
situated
innovation
that
responds
to
late
twentieth
century
urban
pathologies
in
a
manner
that
predictably
perpetuates
those
criminogenic
pathologies
the
call
for
sqf
arose
in
important
measure
because
local
and
state
governments
had
engaged
in
policies
that
over
time
fostered
minority
neighborhoods
that
remain
entrenched
in
concentrated
poverty
and
suffer
from
high
violent
crime
rates
rather
than
addressing
those
underlying
conditions
local
and
state
policy
makers
have
chosen
to
respond
with
a
policy
that
has
stigmatizes
minority
residents
that
has
limited
crime
control
benefits
and
that
imposes
large
negative
spillovers
on
disadvantaged
neighborhoods
viewed
in
this
dynamic
perspective
sqf
catalyzes
an
entangled
set
of
individual
and
neighborhood
level
harms
through
mutually
reinforcing
interactions
these
various
harms
reinforce
the
social
and
racial
stratification
that
initially
set
the
stage
for
massive
street
policing
expenditures
without
a
clear
grasp
of
this
ecological
and
dynamic
context
current
remedial
interventions
are
likely
to
fall
short
or
to
go
astray
in
response
to
such
ecological
and
dynamic
dimensions
constitutional
law
is
now
disarmed
some
other
tool
is
needed
consistent
with
a
growing
body
of
scholarship
that
resists
the
narrow
transactional
frame
of
current
constitutional
doctrine
n
and
the
dominant
doctrinal
focus
on
individual
officials
fault
n
i
argue
that
our
current
doctrinal
models
for
capturing
the
harms
of
aggressive
policing
fall
woefully
short
instead
a
more
structural
and
capacious
legal
framework
is
needed
to
encapsulate
the
core
moral
objections
to
sqf
an
alternative
more
promising
legal
framework
is
a
version
of
the
disparate
impact
standard
familiar
from
the
employment
discrimination
n
and
fair
housing
contexts
n
a
disparate
impact
framework
is
better
able
to
account
for
the
evidentiary
problems
involved
in
accounting
for
the
diverse
forms
of
discrimination
manifested
in
a
complex
system
characterized
by
a
high
degree
of
diffused
discretion
n
to
be
clear
this
alternative
approach
is
by
no
means
perfect
it
does
not
provide
a
proxy
for
the
thorough
evaluation
of
both
costs
and
benefits
presented
in
this
article
rather
disparate
impact
isolates
a
subset
of
problematic
cases
in
which
sqf
s
heavy
burden
is
asymmetrically
assigned
to
minority
communities
it
demands
a
robust
justification
from
the
state
for
that
potentially
regressive
subordinating
and
demoralizing
situation
in
this
regard
it
is
better
placed
than
either
fourth
amendment
or
equal
protection
doctrine
to
resist
the
exacerbation
of
racial
hierarchies
n
no
theory
of
liability
however
will
be
a
comprehensive
panacea
to
a
complex
and
entrenched
social
phenomenon
like
concentrated
racialized
poverty
disparate
impact
liability
for
sqf
captures
the
instances
in
which
the
moral
wrong
of
sqf
is
at
its
acme
even
if
it
does
not
capture
all
instances
in
which
that
wrong
arises
it
helps
ensure
that
policing
responses
make
matters
no
worse
it
is
emphatically
only
a
piece
of
the
larger
mosaic
of
needful
policing
reform
that
ought
to
be
pursued
through
both
judicial
and
political
avenues
disparate
impact
liability
is
often
overlooked
because
it
has
not
been
part
of
equal
protection
doctrine
since
the
early
s
n
because
of
the
constitution
centered
focus
of
much
scholarship
it
is
easy
to
forget
it
is
available
but
a
disparate
impact
standard
is
available
under
both
federal
statutes
that
regulate
local
police
departments
n
and
also
in
california
n
and
illinois
n
state
law
n
the
chicago
settlement
and
the
new
orleans
settlement
invoke
some
of
these
disparate
impact
rules
as
guiding
authorizations
n
nevertheless
neither
elaborates
upon
their
bare
bone
textual
references
as
a
result
the
analytic
and
practical
advantages
of
a
disparate
impact
lens
for
police
remain
underappreciated
the
theoretical
questions
raised
by
its
translation
to
the
policing
context
also
remain
poorly
understood
my
final
aim
is
to
show
how
disparate
impact
can
serve
as
a
lens
for
analyzing
street
policing
in
practice
to
that
end
i
consider
how
disparate
racial
impacts
might
be
sifted
from
the
granular
policing
data
increasingly
being
collected
by
large
police
departments
as
a
result
of
settlements
and
consent
decrees
n
specifically
i
sketch
three
tractable
empirical
strategies
for
identifying
disparate
impact
in
street
stop
related
policies
first
deployment
related
disparities
between
beats
or
districts
within
a
jurisdiction
can
be
measured
to
ascertain
whether
a
municipality
s
overall
distribution
of
policing
resources
can
be
justified
on
race
neutral
grounds
n
second
within
a
given
beat
or
district
disparities
in
how
stops
are
allocated
among
different
ethnic
and
racial
groups
can
be
evaluated
n
finally
at
the
level
of
given
officers
disparities
in
the
quantum
of
suspicion
deployed
for
whites
and
nonwhites
can
be
assessed
by
using
a
range
of
empirical
tools
n
by
aggregating
and
contrasting
disparities
at
these
different
levels
the
empirical
approach
that
i
sketch
roughly
enables
a
better
understanding
of
the
causes
and
extent
of
sqf
s
disparate
impact
that
understanding
in
turn
can
serve
as
a
foundation
for
more
targeted
less
disruptive
and
more
effective
remedial
interventions
these
empirical
approaches
moreover
enable
disparate
impact
s
translation
to
the
policing
context
while
avoiding
the
constitutional
and
practical
problems
encountered
in
the
employment
discrimination
context
for
each
empirical
approach
posited
i
consider
the
range
of
legitimate
exculpatory
justifications
that
might
be
offered
to
diffuse
a
prima
facie
finding
of
racial
disparity
n
i
further
respond
to
weaknesses
made
apparent
by
disparate
impact
s
extant
operation
in
other
contexts
in
the
employment
discrimination
context
for
example
there
has
been
disagreement
about
how
to
identify
business
justifications
that
can
justify
racial
disparities
n
and
the
magnitude
of
ultimate
disparities
required
for
liability
n
the
use
of
disparate
impact
in
the
employment
context
has
also
generated
worries
about
the
doctrine
s
constitutionality
n
and
its
efficacy
in
promoting
structural
policy
change
n
in
translating
disparate
impact
to
the
policing
context
i
consider
and
reject
each
of
these
reasons
as
a
reason
for
abandoning
the
translation
the
possibility
of
disparate
impact
as
a
template
for
rethinking
urban
policing
has
yet
to
be
explored
in
any
detail
although
an
earlier
article
by
david
sklansky
and
colleagues
touches
on
the
question
n
but
my
analysis
aligns
with
penetrating
work
by
tracey
meares
jeffrey
fagan
and
amanda
geller
all
of
whom
correctly
emphasize
that
sqf
is
a
distinctive
mode
of
urban
policing
that
cannot
be
analyzed
in
terms
of
discrete
interactions
because
programmatic
stops
are
imposed
from
the
top
down
at
a
massive
scale
n
furthermore
i
echo
richard
banks
worry
about
the
potential
inadequacy
as
a
policy
framework
of
much
constitutional
doctrine
although
my
diagnosis
and
response
to
the
problem
of
race
in
policing
differ
from
his
approach
n
in
addition
my
analysis
diverges
sharply
from
the
large
literature
on
racial
profiling
n
which
more
narrowly
focuses
on
intentional
animus
or
the
purposive
use
of
race
as
a
criterion
in
enforcement
decisions
n
unlike
these
analyses
my
approach
does
not
focus
on
individual
fault
or
bad
intent
instead
i
argue
that
legal
intervention
should
be
organized
around
the
interaction
between
a
specific
kind
of
common
policing
strategy
and
larger
social
dynamics
of
racial
segmentation
and
stratification
n
the
argument
proceeds
in
three
steps
in
part
i
i
provide
a
comprehensive
empirically
robust
account
of
sqf
as
a
distinctive
modality
of
urban
policing
highlighting
the
dynamic
negative
effects
of
sqf
upon
minority
communities
in
concentrated
urban
poverty
part
ii
turns
to
the
constitutional
doctrine
developed
pursuant
to
the
fourth
amendment
and
the
equal
protection
clause
to
regulate
such
policing
using
terry
and
feeney
as
focal
points
i
demonstrate
that
constitutional
doctrine
systematically
fails
to
account
for
the
harms
that
flow
from
sqf
the
gap
reveals
inconsistencies
and
internal
contradictions
within
the
doctrine
having
rejected
the
default
framework
for
legal
analysis
of
sqf
i
sketch
in
part
iii
an
alternative
lens
of
disparate
impact
concluding
i
illustrate
three
empirical
strategies
that
might
be
used
to
determine
whether
remedial
intervention
is
warranted
in
so
doing
i
hope
to
show
that
disparate
impact
is
a
practicable
and
plausible
approach
for
use
by
courts
and
other
supervisory
and
regulatory
bodies
i
the
costs
and
benefits
of
stop
and
frisk
policing
to
evaluate
stop
and
frisk
as
a
way
of
eliciting
public
order
requires
an
understanding
of
its
costs
and
benefits
in
historical
and
social
context
this
part
therefore
begins
by
offering
a
definition
of
sqf
as
a
historically
situated
strategy
employed
by
urban
police
forces
it
then
develops
a
careful
tally
of
its
pros
and
cons
some
courts
have
analyzed
sqf
in
terms
of
costs
while
bracketing
its
benefits
n
i
disagree
with
this
approach
appreciation
of
the
distinctive
wrong
of
sqf
demands
a
comprehensive
understanding
of
related
justifications
criticisms
and
benefits
all
nested
in
an
ecological
and
dynamic
context
a
defining
stop
and
frisk
sqf
stop
question
and
frisk
or
sqf
is
an
urban
policing
measure
that
involves
the
large
scale
deployment
of
officers
in
public
spaces
e
g
sidewalks
alleys
the
communal
outdoor
spaces
of
public
housing
tasked
with
conducting
frequent
investigative
stops
under
a
line
of
cases
beginning
with
terry
v
ohio
n
an
officer
is
entitled
to
make
a
brief
nonconsensual
investigatory
stop
if
she
has
a
reasonable
articulable
suspicion
that
a
crime
either
has
occurred
or
is
about
to
occur
n
separately
if
the
officer
has
a
further
reasonable
articulable
suspicion
that
the
person
stopped
is
armed
and
presently
dangerous
to
the
officer
or
to
others
he
may
conduct
a
limited
protective
search
for
concealed
weapons
n
in
either
the
stop
or
the
frisk
context
reasonable
articulable
suspicion
is
a
less
demanding
standard
than
probable
cause
but
it
still
requires
a
minimal
level
of
objective
justification
n
in
addition
to
a
stop
and
a
frisk
officers
may
take
further
actions
ranging
from
a
verbal
caution
or
a
citation
to
an
arrest
arrests
vary
widely
in
character
they
can
be
discretionary
or
mandatory
n
they
may
be
based
on
conduct
or
evidence
discovered
by
the
officer
during
the
stop
or
they
might
be
predicated
on
an
outstanding
warrant
revealed
when
a
person
s
name
is
cross
referenced
with
state
local
or
federal
databases
the
jurisprudence
of
terry
stops
and
frisks
focuses
on
discrete
transactions
between
specific
officers
and
specific
defendants
but
this
is
misleading
n
sqf
as
i
have
defined
it
is
a
policy
that
operates
today
at
scale
not
tens
or
hundreds
of
individuals
but
tens
or
hundreds
of
thousands
are
arrested
over
the
course
of
months
in
new
york
for
example
there
were
documented
stops
in
and
stops
in
n
in
philadelphia
a
city
with
one
fifth
new
york
s
population
there
were
more
than
stops
each
of
the
last
three
years
despite
the
existence
of
a
court
supervised
consent
decree
n
the
analysis
in
this
section
is
focused
on
sqf
as
deployed
en
masse
sqf
has
similarities
to
and
can
overlap
somewhat
with
the
strategy
of
broken
windows
or
quality
of
life
policing
n
but
the
tactics
are
distinct
whereas
broken
windows
policing
relies
on
arrests
to
remove
undesirable
persons
from
a
neighborhood
n
sqf
can
involve
a
relatively
low
rate
of
arrests
n
sqf
tends
to
be
a
direct
response
to
violent
crime
it
is
not
a
prophylactic
response
to
the
possibility
that
the
sight
of
broken
windows
will
induce
escalating
forms
of
disorder
n
hence
criticisms
of
broken
windows
policing
cannot
be
translated
to
sqf
in
any
mechanical
fashion
one
more
detail
is
essential
to
my
functional
definition
of
sqf
within
a
city
sqf
is
typically
employed
with
greatest
intensity
on
a
small
subset
of
neighborhoods
n
typically
its
deployment
is
highest
in
neighborhoods
characterized
by
concentrated
poverty
where
crime
rates
tend
to
be
higher
than
in
other
parts
of
the
city
n
in
chicago
for
example
one
study
of
stops
in
found
stops
per
residents
in
the
african
american
neighborhood
of
englewood
but
stops
per
residents
in
the
white
neighborhood
of
lincoln
foster
n
in
particular
sqf
tends
to
be
concentrated
upon
minority
i
e
african
american
and
hispanic
neighborhoods
in
new
york
the
district
court
in
floyd
found
that
the
racial
composition
of
a
neighborhood
was
a
better
predictor
of
the
density
of
stops
than
its
lagged
crime
rate
n
and
at
the
height
of
new
york
s
sqf
an
african
american
resident
of
new
york
city
had
a
ninety
two
percent
chance
of
being
stopped
in
a
single
year
period
n
sqf
in
short
is
not
just
a
high
frequency
policing
strategy
it
is
also
a
highly
geographically
concentrated
one
in
minority
african
american
and
hispanic
neighborhoods
so
even
if
it
entails
a
low
rate
of
arrest
therefore
it
is
likely
that
sqf
at
least
contributes
to
the
exceedingly
high
rates
of
minority
arrests
in
the
jurisdictions
in
which
it
is
deployed
n
in
summary
sqf
is
best
understood
as
the
large
scale
use
of
terry
stops
in
predominantly
black
and
hispanic
urban
neighborhoods
in
response
to
violent
crime
its
architects
are
cognizant
of
and
indeed
embrace
this
racial
asymmetry
n
but
rather
than
dwelling
on
whether
their
views
should
be
ranked
as
invidious
discrimination
i
engage
in
a
more
consequentialist
inquiry
i
consider
the
gains
and
the
harms
from
sqf
these
i
contend
must
be
understood
in
light
of
geographic
and
historical
context
to
be
appreciated
properly
it
is
the
benefits
of
sqf
that
i
focus
upon
first
before
considering
costs
b
the
crime
control
benefits
of
sqf
in
context
the
case
for
sqf
aggressive
use
of
street
stops
at
a
high
volume
has
a
long
historical
pedigree
n
by
they
had
become
so
endemic
that
the
kerner
commission
established
by
president
johnson
to
investigate
the
urban
riots
singled
out
the
police
s
excessive
use
of
investigative
stops
n
and
the
wholesale
harassment
by
certain
elements
of
the
police
community
of
which
minority
groups
particularly
negros
frequently
complain
n
today
s
fires
are
residues
of
yesterday
s
conflagrations
sqf
in
its
modern
form
is
a
direct
response
to
an
uptick
of
violent
crime
in
the
s
collocated
with
what
william
julius
wilson
called
the
persistence
of
ghetto
poverty
n
the
political
sponsors
of
the
policy
consistently
identified
violent
crime
control
as
its
core
aim
n
because
violent
crime
is
disproportionately
committed
by
african
americans
and
concentrated
in
black
neighborhoods
they
argued
it
is
no
surprise
that
sqf
focuses
on
those
predominantly
minority
neighborhoods
n
rather
than
proof
of
anti
minority
animus
the
use
of
sqf
is
evidence
for
this
view
that
police
are
exerting
special
efforts
to
protect
minorities
from
crime
the
persuasive
force
of
this
argument
from
crime
control
is
the
subject
of
this
subpart
while
the
tally
of
sqf
s
costs
is
addressed
in
the
following
subpart
the
genesis
of
an
argument
for
sqf
s
crime
control
benefits
is
found
in
the
early
s
in
the
sociologist
james
q
wilson
published
an
influential
opinion
piece
in
the
new
york
times
entitled
just
take
away
their
guns
a
phrase
that
succinctly
encapsulated
the
distinctive
appeal
of
sqf
n
wilson
argued
for
the
aggressive
use
of
terry
stops
as
a
means
to
reduce
the
number
of
people
who
carry
guns
unlawfully
especially
in
places
on
streets
in
taverns
where
the
mere
presence
of
a
gun
can
increase
the
hazards
we
all
face
n
his
call
responded
directly
to
what
by
any
measure
was
a
grave
crisis
of
law
and
order
at
the
time
new
york
city
was
suffering
from
a
high
homicide
rate
n
of
the
murders
that
occurred
in
new
york
in
the
year
ending
as
wilson
wrote
more
than
were
committed
by
firearm
n
wilson
s
call
for
aggressive
street
policing
as
a
prophylaxis
for
gun
violence
found
a
measure
of
empirical
support
the
following
year
in
the
criminologist
lawrence
sherman
and
colleagues
published
the
results
of
a
quasi
experiment
conducted
for
twenty
nine
weeks
in
kansas
city
of
gun
based
intensive
street
policing
and
found
a
forty
nine
percent
decline
in
gun
crimes
without
any
spillover
to
neighboring
areas
n
results
of
this
kind
prompted
scores
of
cities
to
rush
to
follow
the
kansas
city
model
n
by
seizing
upon
sqf
as
a
tool
for
lowering
violent
crime
rates
the
earliest
adopter
of
sqf
new
york
city
seems
to
have
begun
aggressive
use
of
terry
stops
as
distinct
from
broken
windows
policing
around
a
parallel
aggressive
use
of
stops
in
philadelphia
came
to
public
attention
in
after
a
scandal
involving
hundreds
of
unlawful
arrests
searches
and
prosecutions
in
the
th
police
district
led
to
the
disclosure
of
incident
reports
showing
a
high
rate
of
illegal
stops
n
in
the
early
s
constitutional
litigation
over
chicago
s
gang
loitering
ordinance
in
part
hinged
on
the
stops
executed
under
that
measure
over
three
years
n
the
chicago
police
department
s
limited
collection
of
information
about
its
stops
and
frisks
meant
that
it
was
not
until
that
data
emerged
showing
that
the
city
s
sqf
intensity
had
exceeded
its
usage
patterns
of
the
s
and
incidentally
also
overshot
new
york
city
s
per
capita
stop
rates
n
crucially
the
policing
strategy
endorsed
by
wilson
and
implicitly
supported
by
the
kansas
city
evidence
does
not
lend
itself
to
uniform
application
across
entire
cities
violent
crime
in
urban
contexts
has
long
been
closely
correlated
with
a
subset
of
geographic
areas
typically
characterized
by
concentrated
poverty
n
in
turn
concentrated
urban
poverty
both
in
the
s
and
today
is
not
evenly
spread
across
racial
ethnic
groups
rather
it
is
a
disproportionately
minority
phenomenon
n
not
only
impoverished
african
americans
but
also
black
middle
class
cohorts
are
disproportionately
represented
in
extremely
poor
urban
neighborhoods
n
one
side
effect
of
this
is
that
urban
violent
crime
impacts
minority
groups
more
grievously
than
non
minority
groups
n
in
the
year
before
james
wilson
wrote
his
times
op
ed
the
african
american
homicide
victimization
rate
per
population
was
the
white
rate
was
n
from
the
perspective
of
its
political
sponsors
sqf
has
to
train
upon
african
american
and
hispanic
neighborhoods
not
because
of
some
theory
of
race
and
crime
but
because
that
is
where
the
murders
the
murders
of
minority
citizens
are
happening
n
if
american
cities
were
making
progress
toward
meaningful
racial
integration
this
nexus
between
policing
and
race
might
be
expected
to
have
waned
by
today
but
despite
increasing
ethnic
and
racial
diversity
within
cities
racial
segregation
endures
in
many
cities
n
indeed
as
many
american
cities
are
as
hypersegregated
today
as
they
were
in
n
the
experience
of
residential
segregation
moreover
has
remained
especially
stable
for
african
americans
regardless
of
class
nationally
the
proportion
of
african
american
areas
lacking
racial
diversity
has
remained
stubbornly
set
at
around
percent
throughout
the
s
n
even
relatively
advantaged
black
neighborhoods
continue
to
be
unique
in
the
degree
to
which
they
are
spatially
linked
with
communities
of
severe
concentrated
disadvantage
n
the
argument
in
favor
of
sqf
in
short
rests
on
its
ability
to
mitigate
the
costs
of
violent
crime
particularly
associated
with
urban
minority
dominated
neighborhoods
to
the
extent
that
areas
of
concentrated
poverty
persist
in
cities
and
to
the
extent
they
are
predominantly
black
or
hispanic
sqf
might
even
be
viewed
as
a
form
of
affirmative
action
it
is
a
positive
subsidy
to
impoverished
minority
communities
a
surplus
provision
of
the
public
good
of
policing
in
former
new
york
police
commissioner
ray
kelly
s
words
the
real
problem
with
urban
policing
is
then
that
african
americans
are
being
understopped
in
light
of
the
violent
crime
experienced
by
black
communities
n
the
difficulties
of
sqf
as
violent
crime
control
the
benefits
of
sqf
however
are
more
qualified
than
its
advocates
suggest
i
analyze
here
how
those
benefits
are
properly
characterized
before
turning
to
the
policy
s
costs
focusing
solely
upon
sqf
s
suppression
of
violent
crime
there
are
both
reasons
for
skepticism
of
the
magnitude
of
the
ensuing
welfare
gain
and
grounds
for
treating
such
benefits
as
morally
problematic
these
concerns
i
stress
bear
on
sqf
s
efficacy
not
the
moral
urgency
of
addressing
the
hecatomb
of
contemporary
urban
homicide
in
cities
such
as
chicago
today
if
there
is
no
convincing
evidence
that
sqf
in
fact
meaningfully
improves
policing
outcome
and
if
there
is
also
evidence
that
it
has
substantial
deleterious
effects
then
it
should
be
considered
a
moral
wrong
in
the
same
class
as
employment
discrimination
or
housing
segregation
moreover
evidence
that
sqf
imposes
concentrated
costs
on
minority
populations
without
remotely
commensurate
benefits
points
toward
the
need
for
a
distinct
programmatic
remedy
such
as
disparate
impact
liability
i
highlight
four
interrelated
grounds
for
concern
first
the
evidence
for
an
absolute
crime
control
effect
from
sqf
is
surprisingly
fragile
second
the
evidence
of
a
marginal
effect
from
sqf
in
comparison
to
other
methods
is
nonexistent
what
evidence
exists
suggests
many
of
the
crime
control
benefits
of
sqf
might
be
obtained
without
its
aggregate
racially
disparate
aspect
third
and
relatedly
the
claim
that
sqf

african
americans
rests
on
complex
and
controversial
assumptions
finally
even
assuming
firm
evidence
of
large
crime
control
gains
from
sqf
there
is
a
normative
objection
to
the
state
taking
credit
for
those
benefits
when
the
governmental
entities
responsible
for
sqf
also
contributed
to
minority
segregation
into
neighborhoods
of
concentrated
poverty
first
notwithstanding
sherman
s
kansas
city
study
it
is
very
difficult
to
connect
sqf
to
any
crime
reduction
n
two
subsequent
efforts
at
replicating
the
former
study
in
indianapolis
and
pittsburgh
have
produced
ambivalent
results
n
the
indianapolis
study
for
example
found
that
homicide
rates
decreased
in
one
of
two
treatment
areas
but
remained
unchanged
in
the
other
n
its
authors
concluded
that
the
present
state
of
knowledge
does
not
allow
us
to
answer
the
theoretical
questions
of
what
produced
the
effects
observed
in
kansas
city
n
a
meta
analysis
of
six
policing
experiments
involving
increased
police
patrols
in
north
and
south
america
reexamined
the
pittsburgh
data
this
data
found
that
while
the
earlier
studies
had
found
a
statistically
significant
reduction
in
gun
violence
alternative
specifications
strongly
suggest
the
estimated
drop
in
shots
fired
incidents
was
due
at
least
in
part
to
a
preintervention
trend
a
seasonal
pattern
or
chance
n
nevertheless
the
authors
of
the
meta
study
found
themselves
ultimately
generally
favorable
to
the
method
pioneered
in
kansas
city
even
as
they
raised
substantial
concern
as
to
whether
sherman
s
experiment
could
be
scaled
up
beyond
the
level
of
small
neighborhoods
n
in
an
operational
context
sqf
fares
less
well
rigorous
empirical
studies
of
sqf
s
post
deployment
are
rare
existing
results
though
provide
sparse
support
for
its
crime
control
effects
for
example
a
study
of
the
effects
of
sqf
on
burglary
and
robbery
rates
in
new
york
between
and
found
few
significant
effects
n
another
quantitative
study
of
new
york
found
that
the
number
of
shooting
incidents
was
virtually
unchanged
during
the
years
in
which
stops
and
frisks
grew
at
an
extraordinary
rate
suggesting
that
it
was
extremely
unlikely
that
these
stops
could
have
reduced
the
homicide
rate
by
reducing
gun
ownership
or
carrying
n
the
most
detailed
and
comprehensive
study
of
overall
trends
in
recent
crime
rates
in
new
york
by
franklin
zimring
also
concluded
that
in
the
new
york
city
context
there
is
no
way
to
separately
measure
the
value
added
by
aggressive
intervention
in
new
york
city
n
a
leading
criminologist
and
the
paramount
expect
on
new
york
policing
zimring
has
seemed
of
two
minds
about
street
policing
in
general
on
the
one
hand
he
has
identified
aggressive
measures
such
as
hot
spot
policing
the
elimination
of
open
air
drug
markets
and
firearm
reduction
as
probably
successful
n
on
the
other
hand
he
has
been
much
more
confident
that
data
driven
crime
mapping
and
patrol
strategy
management
and
the
hiring
of
police
officers
did
likely
have
large
and
negative
effects
on
crime
rates
n
at
the
very
best
zimring
s
evidence
leaves
open
the
possibility
that
sqf
had
some
role
to
play
in
crime
reduction
it
casts
little
light
on
the
magnitude
of
that
role
and
it
has
little
to
say
about
whether
the
same
gains
in
public
order
might
have
been
achieved
through
alternate
means
another
potential
means
of
examining
sqf
s
impact
is
to
examine
the
aftermath
of
the
policy
s
unexpected
discontinuance
but
there
has
also
been
no
detailed
study
of
what
happened
after
the
new
york
city
police
department
reduced
the
number
of
stops
dramatically
in
in
the
three
years
after
that
decline
began
however
murder
rates
have
remained
essentially
flat
n
in
chicago
a
different
and
more
complicated
story
prevails
a
sharp
rise
in
murder
and
decline
in
arrests
followed
the
november
release
of
long
suppressed
video
footage
of
a
fatal
police
shooting
that
provoked
sharp
public
outcry
against
the
chicago
police
department
n
immediately
thereafter
in
january
changes
to
how
stops
and
frisks
are
recorded
but
no
change
to
operational
policy
went
into
effect
n
given
that
the
highly
critical
public
reaction
to
the
video
likely
had
a
significant
effect
on
multiple
aspects
of
police
morale
and
hence
police
behavior
it
is
hard
to
disentangle
any
discrete
effect
from
changes
in
sqf
policy
from
changes
due
to
the
critical
public
reaction
to
the
demoralizing
release
of
evidence
of
unlawful
police
violence
those
who
rush
to
judgment
or
seek
to
cast
blame
based
on
the
chicago
or
new
york
data
trends
may
well
be
ensnared
unwittingly
in
a
species
of
motivated
reasoning
the
empirical
case
for
a
crime
control
benefit
from
sqf
in
short
does
not
stand
on
strong
foundations
n
while
there
is
some
empirical
support
for
an
effect
from
sqf
in
small
scale
experiments
there
is
no
existing
evidence
that
this
effect
can
be
replicated
at
a
citywide
level
n
the
weakness
of
its
evidentiary
predicate
contrasts
with
firmer
evidentiary
basis
for
other
kinds
of
reform
including
the
deployment
of
more
officers
and
the
use
of
more
data
driven
approaches
more
than
forty
years
after
wilson
s
initial
intervention
therefore
sqf
remains
largely
predicated
on
a
mere
prediction
about
the
effect
of
intensive
street
stops
on
violent
crime
levels
second
econometric
studies
of
sqf
s
effect
on
crime
of
the
kind
discussed
above
aim
to
isolate
the
marginal
effect
of
the
policy
after
controlling
for
all
other
relevant
variables
in
effect
they
strive
to
hold
all
else
constant
and
then
search
for
an
effect
of
sqf
on
crime
rates
but
the
assumption
that
all
else
remains
constant
is
an
obvious
artifice
a
police
force
that
foregoes
sqf
is
likely
to
employ
an
alternative
policing
strategy
that
does
not
involve
nonconsensual
interventions
or
facially
racial
disparities
in
treatment
the
marginal
negative
effect
on
crime
control
of
shifting
from
sqf
to
an
alternative
modality
of
policing
is
likely
to
be
smaller
than
the
absolute
effect
of
simply
foregoing
sqf
entirely
a
police
force
that
chooses
to
forego
sqf
can
redeploy
the
substantial
personnel
resources
that
it
occupies
for
other
tactical
uses
there
are
moreover
other
modalities
of
policing
that
are
positively
associated
with
crime
control
in
rigorous
empirical
studies
consider
for
example
the
empirical
literature
on
hot
spot
policing
a
technique
that
has
some
parallels
with
sqf
but
that
can
also
be
distinguished
from
it
hot
spot
policing
involves
the
application
of
police
interventions
at
very
small
geographic
units
of
analysis
n
a
range
of
studies
and
meta
studies
suggests
that
the
highly
localized
deployment
of
officers
has
a
meaningful
and
statistically
significant
effect
on
crime
rates
n
hot
spot
policing
and
sqf
have
some
similarities
but
their
differences
are
critical
to
begin
there
is
a
question
of
scale
i
have
already
stressed
more
than
once
that
sqf
as
i
use
the
term
involves
tens
or
hundreds
of
thousands
of
arrests
hot
spot
policing
does
not
require
similarly
massive
deployments
the
one
study
of
an
existing
sqf
policy
to
consider
the
question
concluded
that
deployments
tended
to
occur
across
areas
that
were
too
large
to
be
characterized
as
hot
spots
as
that
term
is
technically
used
n
even
if
the
distinction
in
scale
between
sqf
and
hot
spot
policing
is
hard
to
quantify
in
practice
it
seems
easy
enough
to
draw
n
moreover
hot
spot
policing
does
not
require
stops
let
alone
frisks
or
arrests
to
be
effective
there
is
instead
evidence
that
increased
police
presence
alone
dampens
crime
rates
and
the
strongest
impact
is
associated
with
situational
prevention
strategies
that
disrupt
situational
dynamics
that
allow
crime
to
occur
for
example
by
razing
abandoned
buildings
n
one
study
of
street
stops
at
microgeographic
hot
spots
examined
in
one
week
increments
in
new
york
generated
reductions
in
crime
but
cautioned
that
evidence
suggests
that
crime
prevention
can
be
achieved
without
resorting
to
an
unrestricted
sqf
policy
n
in
this
new
york
data
moreover
sqf
was
pursued
at
the
expense
of
other
strategies
leaving
open
questions
about
the
potential
of
other
policing
strategies
n
hot
spot
policing
plainly
requires
a
nontrivial
number
of
officers
so
it
is
important
to
emphasize
that
my
argument
here
solely
concerns
the
style
of
policing
not
the
sheer
volume
of
officers
deployed
n
and
increasing
stops
or
arrests
do
not
appear
to
be
a
necessary
component
of
hot
spot
policing
to
the
contrary
in
one
leading
study
the
authors
noted
approvingly
that
officers
in
the
treatment
condition
i
e
engaged
in
hot
spot
policing
were
not
evaluated
on
their
stop
count
but
rather
were
held
accountable
for
reducing
citizen
calls
for
service
and
for
ameliorating
social
and
physical
incivilities
in
targeted
hot
spot
areas
n
a
recent
meta
analysis
of
nineteen
studies
of
hot
spot
policing
separately
examined
the
effects
of
two
distinct
versions
of
that
policy
that
involved
either
increasing
the
volume
of
traditional
policing
or
using
a
problem
solving
approach
n
three
of
the
ten
existing
studies
of
the
traditional
policing
model
found
small
positive
effects
on
crime
reduction
n
but
the
overall
mean
effect
size
of
problem
oriented
hot
spot
policing
was
twice
the
effect
size
of
the
traditional
policing
model
n
it
would
seem
that
the
decision
to
simply
increase
traditional
policing
activities
at
hot
spots
is
dominated
in
practice
by
problem
solving
measures
the
contrast
between
sqf
and
hot
spot
policing
usefully
underscores
a
more
general
point
policing
is
not
a
single
undifferentiated
public
good
rather
policing
is
mutative
and
takes
several
forms
it
can
entail
the
pursuit
of
diverse
ends
of
crime
control
order
maintenance
and
social
provision
with
divergent
tools
n
police
forces
now
engaged
in
sqf
have
at
other
times
employed
other
quite
different
approaches
which
focus
instead
on
service
provision
n
community
relations
n
or
prophylactic
street
policing
some
of
these
policies
aim
to
reduce
crime
others
such
as
community
policing
seek
to
build
a
reservoir
of
public
support
to
tap
in
moments
of
strain
n
these
different
services
can
be
bundled
in
different
ways
in
at
least
some
of
the
jurisdictions
in
which
sqf
is
employed
neighborhoods
subject
to
aggressive
street
policing
do
not
necessarily
receive
high
levels
of
other
policing
services
n
indeed
racial
segregation
at
the
municipal
level
is
systematically
correlated
to
depressed
levels
of
public
service
provision
n
in
chicago
for
example
african
american
and
hispanic
neighborhoods
are
subject
to
sqf
on
the
one
hand
but
on
the
other
hand
experience
substantially
longer
delays
than
non
minority
neighborhoods
when
seeking
police
aid
via
calls
n
policing
is
thus
both
under
supplied
and
over
provided
simultaneously
defenders
of
sqf
therefore
mislead
when
they
equate
sqf
with
a
police
force
focusing
its
resources
where
people
most
need
protection
n
rather
it
is
both
possible
and
in
fact
often
seems
to
be
the
case
that
sqf
is
accompanied
by
serious
deficiencies
in
respect
to
other
elements
of
the
bundle
of
police
services
estimation
of
the
margin
costs
of
ending
sqf
must
as
a
result
account
for
the
possibility
of
variance
across
these
other
elements
of
the
police
function
third
the
assumption
of
sqf
s
advocates
particularly
in
new
york
has
been
that
its
benefits
accrue
to
the
minority
residents
of
high
crime
neighborhoods
more
than
they
accrue
to
residents
of
low
crime
neighborhoods
n
implicitly
these
advocates
are
drawing
a
comparison
between
sqf
and
affirmative
action
both
they
suggest
are
policies
that
disproportionately
benefit
african
american
and
hispanic
minorities
but
consider
another
possibility
since
the
s
the
fear
of
crime
has
been
a
concern
that
has
powerfully
mobilized
white
electorates
n
it
may
be
that
among
the
gains
of
sqf
is
a
reduction
in
the
fear
of
crime
n
and
that
this
gain
is
diffused
among
the
wider
urban
population
the
latter
of
course
is
typically
much
larger
than
the
urban
subpopulation
subject
to
sqf
even
assuming
there
is
a
substantial
marginal
crime
control
gain
in
substituting
sqf
for
the
next
best
policy
n
it
is
necessarily
the
case
that
whereas
the
predominantly
minority
residents
of
impoverished
neighborhoods
experience
both
costs
and
benefits
the
predominantly
white
non
residents
of
other
neighborhoods
experience
only
benefits
albeit
in
expectation
at
a
much
lower
rate
there
are
also
likely
to
be
many
more
white
non
residents
of
targeted
areas
than
minority
non
residents
the
former
group
benefits
from
being
able
to
access
more
of
the
city
as
well
as
from
a
more
general
reduction
in
their
fear
of
crime
n
depending
on
the
magnitude
of
these
various
costs
and
benefits
for
different
racial
groups
it
is
at
least
possible
that
the
adoption
of
sqf
might
create
larger
net
benefits
for
the
class
of
white
nonresidents
as
a
whole
than
for
the
class
of
minority
residents
of
highly
policed
neighborhoods
in
a
manner
that
is
racially
regressive
even
without
accounting
for
the
potential
costs
of
sqf
n
the
claim
that
sqf
disproportionately
benefits
minorities
is
an
important
part
of
the
moral
case
in
favor
of
the
policy
closer
examination
of
the
assumptions
underlying
the
claim
however
uncovers
its
contingency
it
is
hardly
clear
that
again
even
bracketing
the
costs
of
sqf
it
is
true
that
a
disproportionate
share
of
the
social
benefits
of
sqf
run
to
minority
communities
much
depends
on
the
welfare
effects
from
crime
reductions
and
from
mitigation
of
crime
related
fears
fourth
the
final
reason
for
skepticism
of
the
positive
case
for
sqf
based
on
its
crime
control
effects
is
not
based
on
empirical
data
or
calculations
of
its
welfare
related
consequences
rather
it
is
moral
in
nature
and
depends
on
a
distinctive
and
controversial
moral
logic
the
idea
that
no
one
shall
be
permitted
to
profit
by
his
own
fraud
or
to
take
advantage
of
his
own
wrong
or
to
found
any
claim
upon
his
own
iniquity
or
to
acquire
property
by
his
own
crime
n
applying
that
concededly
raw
intuition
to
the
case
of
sqf
reveals
the
following
line
of
argument
the
problem
of
violent
crime
to
which
sqf
responds
flows
from
the
existence
of
neighborhoods
of
concentrated
and
racialized
poverty
although
there
are
many
forces
molding
the
latter
governmental
actors
at
the
state
and
local
level
have
a
large
share
of
responsibility
those
same
governmental
bodies
if
not
the
exact
same
individual
politicians
also
resorted
to
sqf
n
but
having
exposed
minority
communities
to
the
harm
of
high
violent
crime
rates
governmental
bodies
cannot
then
take
advantage
of
this
wrong
to
seek
a
measure
of
legal
and
policy
leeway
that
they
otherwise
would
not
have
at
a
minimum
they
should
elect
the
policing
strategy
that
imposes
the
minimum
burden
on
minority
communities
that
as
a
result
of
persisting
state
policy
have
been
subjected
to
concentrated
poverty
and
high
crime
rates
policing
that
is
should
be
subject
to
a
hippocratic
constraint
the
threshold
premise
of
this
argument
that
states
and
localities
bear
a
measure
of
responsibility
for
concentrated
minority
poverty
has
substantial
support
in
the
historical
and
empirical
literature
to
be
sure
macrostructural
forces
such
as
the
deindustrialization
of
central
cities
and
the
exit
of
some
middle
class
and
wealthy
african
americans
have
driven
the
growth
of
concentrated
racialized
poverty
n
but
these
forces
have
been
magnified
by
deliberate
policy
decisions
to
concentrate
minorities
and
the
poor
in
public
housing
n
in
chicago
for
example
alderman
and
the
mayor
thwarted
efforts
from
the
s
onward
to
disperse
african
americans
outside
traditionally
black
neighborhoods
n
across
the
country
zoning
restrictions
and
permitting
requirements
have
been
extensively
deployed
to
perpetuate
racially
exclusionary
residential
patterns
n
the
implications
of
state
involvement
in
the
creation
of
concentrated
racialized
poverty
turn
on
the
sort
of
moral
fault
one
attributes
to
a
collective
entity
such
as
a
municipality
the
precise
mix
of
state
action
and
private
actions
responsible
for
residential
segregation
and
the
extent
to
which
any
historical
responsibility
is
mitigated
by
the
passage
of
time
and
the
burdens
that
remediation
would
impose
on
innocent
third
parties
n
i
do
not
aim
to
resolve
that
complex
suite
of
questions
here
rather
my
more
limited
claim
is
that
a
city
s
claims
on
behalf
of
sqf
must
at
a
minimum
be
contextualized
by
its
general
historical
responsibility
for
the
burdens
imposed
by
concentrated
poverty
particularly
on
the
racial
minorities
whose
efforts
to
move
beyond
that
condition
in
search
of
employment
and
educational
opportunities
have
so
often
been
thwarted
n
at
an
absolute
minimum
it
would
seem
appropriate
to
demand
a
heightened
burden
of
proof
for
claims
about
the
benefits
of
disparate
crime
control
measures
tendered
by
the
very
entity
responsible
for
racial
segregation
stated
in
brief
then
my
fourth
point
is
that
the
institutional
author
of
racial
segregation
should
do
no
further
harm
to
minorities
when
it
addresses
the
costs
of
such
segregation
having
created
the
problem
that
sqf
is
intended
to
address
municipalities
have
no
entitlement
to
a
benefit
of
empirical
doubt
more
ambitiously
cities
partial
culpability
for
the
underlying
condition
of
concentrated
poverty
might
justify
a
demand
for
special
efforts
to
ensure
that
no
policy
response
to
crime
imposes
a
disproportionate
share
of
costs
on
the
legatees
of
historical
discrimination
or
that
denies
them
a
disproportionate
share
of
its
benefits
to
summarize
then
this
section
has
examined
the
crime
control
benefits
of
sqf
the
evidence
for
those
is
surprisingly
fragile
the
case
for
thinking
sqf
has
marginal
benefits
in
comparison
to
a
next
best
policy
option
such
as
hot
spot
policing
is
even
shakier
accounting
for
sqf
s
more
diffuse
effect
on
the
fear
of
crime
moreover
suggests
that
defenses
of
sqf
as
a
form
of
affirmative
action
may
well
fail
finally
an
analysis
based
on
the
state
s
historical
responsibilities
for
the
underlying
conditions
that
motivate
sqf
suggests
a
need
to
view
the
state
s
celebration
of
the
policy
s
benefits
with
a
measure
of
skepticism
c
the
ecological
and
dynamic
costs
of
sqf
this
section
turns
from
sqf
s
putative
benefits
to
its
costs
in
my
view
sqf
has
an
intertwined
set
of
individual
and
collective
costs
that
largely
but
not
exclusively
sound
in
an
equality
related
rather
than
a
fourth
amendment
register
my
starting
assumption
is
that
sqf
s
costs
no
less
than
its
benefits
cannot
be
properly
understood
or
evaluated
once
they
are
detached
from
the
historical
origins
of
concentrated
poverty
nor
can
they
be
evaluated
without
thinking
carefully
about
the
ways
in
which
sqf
might
perpetuate
the
underlying
conditions
of
social
and
racial
stratification
into
concentrated
poverty
in
short
rather
than
analyzing
racial
discrimination
as
a
single
point
outcome
i
embrace
here
the
dominant
emphasis
in
recent
sociological
scholarship
on
modeling
discrimination
as
a
process
n
i
identify
eight
pathways
by
which
sqf
can
impose
harms
on
individuals
and
communities
defined
by
race
i
began
the
analysis
of
costs
by
focusing
on
the
immediate
encounter
between
police
and
an
individual
having
documented
costs
in
that
proximate
context
i
then
widen
my
lens
to
capture
a
diverse
array
of
adverse
spillovers
from
that
immediate
encounter
not
only
to
the
individual
but
also
for
his
or
her
social
network
and
for
racial
minorities
his
or
her
larger
racial
cohort
the
latter
effects
of
sqf
it
should
be
noted
diffuse
through
social
networks
and
families
n
several
critically
depend
upon
vicious
cycles
or
positive
feedback
mechanisms
that
entangle
individual
and
neighborhood
level
effects
n
often
with
regressive
distributive
consequences
more
generally
it
is
plausible
to
view
all
eight
causal
pathways
as
intertwined
and
to
an
extent
mutually
reinforcing
first
the
supreme
court
in
terry
recognized
that
even
brief
stops
and
frisks
have
immediate
and
substantial
costs
chief
justice
warren
described
even
a
temporary
police
stop
as
a
serious
intrusion
upon
the
sanctity
of
the
person
which
may
inflict
great
indignity
and
arouse
strong
resentment
and
it
is
not
to
be
undertaken
lightly
n
in
subsequent
cases
however
the
court
has
tended
to
downplay
the
immediate
psychological
and
dignitary
costs
of
being
stopped
n
but
ethnographic
data
and
qualitative
studies
demonstrate
that
chief
justice
warren
s
initial
intuition
was
correct
the
immediate
toll
of
a
nonconsensual
police
intrusion
even
absent
physical
content
or
formal
consequence
is
substantial
perhaps
the
best
evidence
derives
from
a
recent
survey
of
young
men
in
new
york
conducted
by
amanda
geller
and
colleagues
the
latter
found
that
contact
with
the
police
primarily
in
the
form
of
terry
stops
was
consistently
associated
with
persisting
stigma
trauma
anxiety
and
depressive
symptoms
n
on
reflection
it
should
be
no
surprise
that
these
effects
flow
from
a
terry
stop
the
latter
is
an
unexpected
encounter
with
heavily
armed
police
typically
characterized
by
a
sense
of
utter
helplessness
and
a
sharp
fear
of
violence
and
deadly
force
n
this
fear
may
be
amplified
by
a
worry
of
more
prolonged
detention
a
real
concern
in
a
jurisdiction
where
police
have
arrest
quotas
to
fill
n
this
psychological
toll
is
not
immediately
visible
it
may
be
shameful
even
to
confess
these
are
perhaps
the
least
troubling
explanations
for
why
such
costs
have
largely
fallen
out
of
judicial
accounts
of
sqf
second
a
different
racial
asymmetry
afflicts
judicial
consideration
of
the
risks
of
bodily
harm
attendant
on
a
terry
stop
on
the
one
hand
the
court
has
punctiliously
attended
to
the
risk
of
bodily
harm
to
officers
during
a
stop
n
on
the
other
hand
the
court
has
been
largely
silent
about
the
possibility
that
terry
stops
expose
the
individual
subject
to
police
attention
to
a
substantial
risk
of
physical
violence
n
nor
has
it
accounted
for
the
possibility
that
these
risks
will
be
positively
correlated
with
minority
status
recent
empirical
work
by
roland
fryer
using
the
terry
stop
related
records
of
new
york
s
police
found
large
racial
differences
in
police
use
of
non
lethal
force
including
slapping
grabbing
and
pushing
individuals
into
a
wall
or
onto
the
ground
n
even
assuming
perfectly
compliant
behavior
african
americans
were
twenty
one
percent
more
likely
to
experience
force
than
whites
n
in
chicago
wesley
skogan
has
found
higher
rates
of
nonlethal
force
in
the
context
of
stops
of
blacks
than
in
white
citizen
stops
n
given
such
large
racial
differentials
in
the
use
of
force
it
would
hardly
be
surprising
if
a
large
proportion
of
the
innocent
minority
residents
of
high
crime
neighborhood
who
are
stopped
and
frisked
objected
to
aggressive
sqf
even
if
it
had
public
safety
benefits
that
diffused
to
their
benefit
n
third
the
effects
of
terry
stops
on
the
individuals
subjected
to
police
attention
do
not
expire
when
their
participants
are
released
from
police
control
rather
negative
experiences
with
the
police
breed
cynicism
about
the
law
n
an
unwillingness
to
invoke
the
police
s
aid
and
a
diminished
proclivity
to
comply
with
the
law
or
cooperate
with
legal
authorities
the
connections
between
negative
police
treatment
and
strongly
aversive
views
of
the
police
are
empirically
well
grounded
albeit
not
in
contexts
where
sqf
has
been
implemented
n
but
studies
from
the
specific
cities
where
sfq
is
employed
demonstrate
vividly
that
intensive
street
policing
has
lingering
effects
on
the
dispositions
and
upon
the
beliefs
of
any
population
routinely
subject
to
its
rigors
for
instance
a
recent
qualitative
study
of
young
men
living
in
three
high
crime
neighborhoods
in
philadelphia
found
that
less
than
ten
percent
were
willing
to
call
the
police
in
any
circumstance
in
part
because
many
had
themselves
had
negative
experiences
with
the
police
in
the
past
n
tellingly
the
same
study
also
found
resentment
directed
at
police
because
of
their
failure
to
respond
to
calls
in
a
timely
fashion
n
police
that
is
are
not
seen
reflexively
in
a
negative
light
it
is
their
intrusive
and
disrespectful
behavior
toward
minority
citizens
in
particular
coupled
with
their
failure
to
provide
non
coercive
public
safety
that
elicits
negative
perceptions
of
the
badge
this
study
however
focused
on
negative
experiences
of
police
rather
than
the
mere
fact
of
being
stopped
although
the
philadelphia
study
suggests
that
young
men
in
particular
perceive
police
contact
generally
as
negative
it
does
not
test
for
different
effects
of
any
police
contact
n
in
contrast
a
recent
study
in
new
york
examining
young
subjects
specifically
in
areas
affected
by
sqf
found
that
increasing
experience
of
stops
whether
negative
or
positive
experiences
diminished
perceptions
of
police
legitimacy
n
another
study
in
chicago
has
found
not
only
that
african
americans
have
strikingly
lower
levels
of
trust
in
police
but
those
caught
up
in
enforcement
and
investigative
stops
were
less
trusting
of
police
by
almost
forty
five
percent
n
a
larger
body
of
empirical
findings
from
the
united
states
and
beyond
demonstrates
that
diminished
police
legitimacy
is
associated
with
a
diminished
disposition
to
follow
the
law
and
a
lesser
willingness
to
cooperate
with
police
n
relatedly
a
high
volume
of
stops
concentrated
in
a
specific
geographically
locale
can
create
a
vicious
circle
feedback
loop
that
flows
from
individual
legal
cynicism
to
increased
collective
victimization
and
then
back
again
when
police
are
perceived
as
endorsing
excessive
force
against
racial
minorities
members
of
that
minority
population
tend
to
become
more
reluctant
to
seek
police
aid
in
a
time
series
study
of
how
highly
publicized
incidents
of
police
violence
in
milwaukee
influenced
the
use
of
matthew
desmond
andrew
papachristos
and
david
kirk
found
that
such
incidents
have
a
clear
and
significant
negative
impact
on
citizen
crime
reporting
n
other
studies
have
found
that
when
sqf
is
perceived
as
being
distributed
on
racial
grounds
perhaps
because
african
americans
and
hispanics
are
in
fact
at
a
much
greater
per
capita
risk
of
being
stopped
than
whites
n
cynicism
about
the
law
and
police
is
likely
to
be
sharpened
within
minority
communities
at
the
margin
violations
of
the
law
become
more
frequent
n
as
the
expected
risk
of
being
victimized
rises
therefore
residents
of
heavily
policed
areas
become
less
willing
to
proactively
reach
out
to
police
this
further
lowers
the
expected
cost
of
criminality
rather
than
alleviating
it
as
sqf
s
advocates
hoped
n
more
crime
in
turn
leads
to
more
aggressive
sqf
which
starts
the
cycle
anew
a
version
of
one
element
of
this
dynamic
has
been
termed
the
ferguson
effect
this
rather
loaded
term
captures
the
possibility
that
high
visibility
instances
of
police
misconduct
lead
to
increases
in
crime
because
of
reduced
confidence
in
police
or
because
of
increased
risk
averseness
on
police
s
part
evidence
for
a
broad
ferguson
effect
however
is
weak
and
is
confined
to
certain
crimes
in
certain
cities
n
if
further
evidence
were
to
emerge
of
such
an
effect
it
would
nevertheless
strengthen
the
vicious
circle
argument
developed
in
the
previous
paragraphs
fourth
is
yet
another
vicious
circle
related
to
legal
cynicism
if
minorities
have
consistently
negative
views
of
the
police
and
respond
to
stops
accordingly
police
may
come
to
anticipate
more
resistance
from
those
minorities
shared
police
expectations
of
a
greater
risk
of
african
american
violence
in
response
to
a
police
stop
is
one
potential
explanation
for
the
higher
rates
of
force
for
black
suspects
that
fryer
finds
in
the
new
york
sqf
data
n
consistent
with
this
possibility
greater
perceived
minority
threat
appears
to
predict
higher
levels
of
police
use
of
force
controlling
for
other
relevant
predictors
n
appearances
in
this
way
influence
realities
n
the
perception
of
racial
disproportionality
in
stops
on
this
theory
influences
individual
residents
behavior
which
in
the
aggregate
creates
racial
differences
in
violence
by
police
this
of
course
merely
strengthens
minorities
negative
expectations
of
police
n
in
this
way
large
racial
disparities
in
the
physical
harms
associated
with
sqf
can
be
reconciled
with
the
nearly
uniform
support
for
the
principle
of
equal
treatment
found
in
polling
data
n
fifth
just
as
legal
cynicism
leads
to
higher
victimization
rates
so
too
can
the
carceral
consequences
of
sqf
have
negative
effects
more
punitive
police
enforcement
and
parole
surveillance
leads
to
a
higher
frequency
of
repeat
admissions
from
a
given
neighborhood
which
begets
more
incarceration
which
in
turn
begets
more
crime
n
to
the
extent
sqf
does
not
result
in
arrests
or
incarceration
of
course
this
dynamic
is
forestalled
sixth
sqf
might
solidify
stereotypical
assumptions
about
the
correlation
of
race
and
criminality
when
neighborhoods
targeted
for
sqf
are
predominantly
african
american
and
hispanic
sqf
is
likely
to
strengthen
the
widely
shared
perception
of
a
connection
between
race
and
crime
n
careful
empirical
studies
have
demonstrated
that
the
racial
composition
of
a
neighborhood
already
provides
a
cue
for
people
s
estimates
of
its
disorderly
character
n
and
its
crime
rate
n
sqf
especially
when
explicitly
justified
on
the
basis
of
black
criminality
works
as
an
official
imprimatur
upon
this
popular
stereotype
and
by
instantiating
state
policy
on
the
basis
of
that
spurious
correlation
it
deepens
and
ratifies
racial
stereotypes
that
predate
any
known
disparity
in
crime
rates
and
invidious
generalizations
that
depend
not
on
empirics
but
rather
on
profound
and
harmful
assumptions
about
racial
differences
n
consistent
with
this
dynamic
empirical
evidence
already
suggests
that
suspects
with
darker
skin
pigmentation
are
more
likely
to
identified
as
criminal
n
and
punished
more
severely
n
than
similarly
situated
lighter
toned
suspects
it
may
also
be
that
the
tighter
perceived
correlation
between
race
and
criminality
reinforces
residential
segregation
by
marking
off
black
from
white
neighborhoods
n
seventh
another
probable
effect
of
sqf
is
a
dampening
of
civil
participation
by
residents
of
affected
neighborhoods
in
ways
that
over
time
conduce
to
diminished
collective
political
power
important
recent
work
by
amy
lerman
and
vesla
weaver
has
demonstrated
empirically
that
contact
with
the
criminal
justice
system
including
nonconsensual
stops
has
a
substantial
and
statistically
significant
effect
on
trust
in
government
n
in
one
national
sample
the
probability
of
voting
declined
by
percent
for
those
who
have
been
stopped
n
once
again
there
is
a
potent
vicious
circle
in
operation
here
sqf
is
a
form
of
policing
that
allocates
most
of
its
costs
to
minorities
living
in
concentrated
poverty
but
the
downstream
effect
of
a
high
stop
rate
is
that
roughly
one
in
ten
of
those
subjected
to
sqf
become
less
likely
to
vote
like
felon
disenfranchisement
laws
sqf
thus
has
the
effect
of
sapping
low
income
minority
communities
influence
on
public
policy
and
on
the
political
distribution
of
valued
public
goods
n
even
as
it
purports
to
empower
those
communities
eighth
and
finally
is
yet
another
potential
aggregate
level
effect
this
time
upon
the
level
of
collective
efficacy
within
a
neighborhood
developed
by
the
harvard
sociologist
robert
sampson
the
concept
of
collective
efficacy
involves
the
linkage
of
mutual
trust
and
the
shared
willingness
to
intervene
n
in
repeated
studies
high
levels
of
collective
efficacy
have
been
found
to
boost
neighborhoods
ability
to
realize
the
common
values
of
residents
and
maintain
effective
social
controls
is
a
major
source
of
neighborhood
variation
in
violence
and
in
particular
homicide
n
although
there
is
no
study
of
the
effect
of
sqf
on
levels
of
collective
efficacy
there
is
little
reason
to
think
it
will
be
positive
if
contact
with
the
police
breeds
legal
cynicism
intracommunal
violence
anxiety
and
an
unwillingness
to
engage
politically
it
is
hard
to
see
how
it
could
foster
collective
efficacy
if
that
is
so
sqf
suppresses
a
key
determinant
of
public
safety
within
neighborhoods
in
considering
these
eight
pathways
it
is
important
to
note
that
in
many
respects
their
effects
are
likely
endure
across
generations
most
impoverished
african
american
youth
as
well
as
a
significant
proportion
of
middle
income
ones
live
in
urban
neighborhoods
of
concentrated
poverty
of
the
kind
subject
to
sqf
n
sqf
is
likely
pivotal
in
the
formation
of
many
minority
children
s
understandings
of
their
status
and
possibilities
in
america
an
effect
compounded
by
the
further
fact
that
one
in
four
black
children
already
experiences
parental
incarceration
n
to
think
that
sqf
s
structural
harms
will
be
transient
therefore
is
to
be
far
too
optimistic
this
is
a
long
list
its
items
though
should
not
be
viewed
in
isolation
rather
these
mechanisms
operate
in
simultaneous
and
overlapping
ways
all
of
these
pathways
generate
costs
concentrated
on
the
minority
individuals
and
communities
in
which
sqf
is
imposed
in
this
their
effects
are
intersecting
and
cumulative
impoverished
minority
individuals
and
through
them
their
communities
become
more
demoralized
alienated
anxious
crime
ridden
and
politically
powerless
the
net
effect
of
sqf
s
eight
costs
therefore
is
singular
it
is
to
maintain
and
even
deepen
social
and
geographic
schisms
that
separate
neighborhoods
and
racial
groups
it
is
for
this
reason
that
sqf
cannot
be
understood
as
merely
an
individual
level
intervention
it
sets
in
motion
a
range
of
important
social
processes
largely
detrimental
to
the
shared
interests
of
a
neighborhood
and
a
racial
group
in
ways
that
reiterate
and
recapitulate
extant
racial
and
social
hierarchies
these
dynamics
finally
may
help
explain
the
surprising
lack
of
empirical
evidence
of
crime
reduction
from
sqf
n
at
an
aggregate
level
communities
subject
to
sqf
are
likely
to
see
their
political
efficacy
their
collective
efficacy
and
their
shared
commitment
to
the
law
wither
one
effect
of
these
changes
is
an
expected
increase
in
levels
of
crime
this
may
offset
whatever
gains
the
direct
application
of
sqf
achieves
partially
or
in
full
sqf
in
short
is
a
short
term
panacea

in
the
medium

may
well
prove
self
defeating
d
the
distinctive
moral
wrong
of
sqf
this
part
has
so
far
provided
a
definition
and
analysis
of
the
positives
and
negatives
of
sqf
with
the
aim
of
refashioning
the
case
against
sqf
rather
than
cabining
the
inquiry
by
imposing
artificial
constitutional
categories
at
the
threshold
i
have
identified
both
individual
and
neighborhood
level
costs
and
benefits
with
a
clear
picture
of
both
positives
and
negatives
in
hand
it
is
possible
to
recapitulate
the
argument
against
sqf
in
a
more
nuanced
form
to
be
sure
absent
precise
quantification
of
both
costs
and
benefits
that
argument
necessarily
has
a
provisional
aspect
i
have
no
proof
that
the
policy
s
costs
exceed
its
benefits
nevertheless
i
view
the
weakness
of
benefit
related
evidence
and
the
accumulation
of
cost
related
evidence
as
sufficiently
clear
to
suggest
that
a
working
account
of
the
distinctive
moral
wrong
of
sqf
is
feasible
the
core
of
the
case
against
sqf
is
dynamic
and
ecological
in
character
it
rests
on
the
policy
s
effect
not
just
on
the
specific
persons
stopped
by
police
on
the
street
but
on
the
dynamic
role
that
sqf
plays
in
the
social
and
racial
stratifications
that
concatenate
with
each
other
to
create
urban
residential
segregation
it
is
an
analysis
moreover
that
proceeds
without
making
any
assumption
of
racial
animus
or
individual
officer
fault
in
the
early
s
sqf
was
adopted
as
a
response
to
rising
violent
crime
associated
with
minority
dominated
neighborhoods
characterized
by
concentrated
poverty
in
that
respect
it
was
at
its
origin
a
response
to
an
unexpected
externality
from
the
urban
residential
segregation
that
had
been
promoted
by
state
actors
from
world
war
ii
onward
local
and
state
officials
might
have
taken
another
path
n
from
the
s
onwards
historian
elizabeth
hinton
has
demonstrated
national
and
local
politics
gradually
blended
opportunity
development
and
training
programs
of
the
war
on
poverty
with
the
surveillance
patrol
and
detention
programs
of
the
war
on
crime
n
by
the
s
however
the
war
on
crime
would
eventually
completely
supplant
great
society
antipoverty
programs
as
a
solution
to
urban
discontent
n
non
coercive
solutions
in
short
had
already
been
tabled
by
the
time
the
crime
wave
of
the
late
s
and
early
s
was
in
full
flush
n
nevertheless
the
policy
response
to
that
crime
wave
has
had
ironically
limited
crime
control
related
payoff
while
at
the
same
time
ratifying
racial
stereotypes
emasculating
minority
communities
politically
and
exacerbating
their
social
and
political
weaknesses
especially
given
the
backdrop
of
municipal
policies
that
consciously
enabled
and
entrenched
the
urban
ghetto
this
policy
choice
was
a
morally
problematic
one
it
was
in
effect
a
choice
by
the
state
to
exacerbate
a
form
of
racial
stratification
for
which
the
state
itself
bears
large
moral
if
not
constitutional
responsibility
sqf
is
thus
but
one
link
in
a
larger
process
n
of
social
and
racial
stratification
in
ways
that
extend
well
beyond
the
discrete
effects
of
an
isolated
encounter
between
one
officer
and
one
resident
n
given
its
exiguous
benefits
shared
across
the
whole
of
society
and
its
multifarious
costs
largely
concentrated
within
already
impoverished
minority
communities
it
is
hard
to
imagine
that
sqf
would
have
anything
but
regressive
distributive
effects
as
between
racial
groups
n
on
the
assumption
that
my
judgments
about
the
relative
magnitude
of
costs
and
benefits
are
sustained
therefore
i
believe
that
sqf
can
fairly
be
characterized
as
a
systemic
and
institutional
phenomenon
that
reproduces
racial
inequality
and
the
presumption
of
black
and
brown
criminality
n
it
is
one
of
the
mechanisms
by
which
racial
division
in
american
society
is
produced
and
reproduced
given
this
characterization
i
resist
claims
that
the
problem
of
race
in
policing
is
a
distraction
and
that
it
would
be
better
to
focus
reforming
energies
on
say
the
problem
of
mass
incarceration
n
or
structural
inequality
n
sqf
even
absent
any
racial
animus
cannot
be
separated
from
larger
processes
of
subordination
along
social
and
racial
lines
and
efforts
to
distinguish
the
two
phenomena
are
deeply
misguided
equally
beside
the
point
are
claims
that
sqf
is
based
on
an
accurate
generalization
about
racial
minorities
criminality
n
such
background
regularities
are
themselves
functions
of
state
action
given
the
state
s
role
in
perpetuating
racialized
concentrated
poverty
which
is
in
turn
correlated
with
crime
a
policy
choice
that
reinforces
rather
than
dissipates
the
force
of
that
pernicious
generalization
is
hardly
entitled
to
deference
based
on
its
putative
accuracy
n
a
legal
remedy
might
not
be
able
to
capture
all
of
the
diverse
causal
pathways
i
have
identified
here
but
a
legal
remedy
should
nonetheless
respond
in
part
to
sqf
s
distinctive
moral
wrong
by
identifying
those
instances
of
policing
choice
that
have
the
least
positive
effect
on
security
with
the
largest
stratification
related
spillovers
it
is
this
question
of
the
aptitude
of
constitutional
doctrine
and
its
subconstitutional
counterpart
in
disparate
impact
law
to
which
i
now
turn
ii
street
policing
and
the
limits
of
constitutional
doctrine
this
part
turns
to
the
core
doctrines
of
constitutional
law
invoked
and
applied
in
challenges
to
sqf
the
fourth
amendment
doctrine
associated
with
terry
and
the
equal
protection
clause
rules
that
have
coalesced
around
feeney
i
argue
that
there
is
a
mismatch
between
these
doctrinal
vehicles
and
the
core
normative
challenge
posed
by
sqf
as
i
have
articulated
it
in
part
i
this
mismatch
renders
current
constitutional
law
ill
suited
to
accounting
for
the
normative
challenges
of
sqf
thinking
about
the
costs
and
benefits
of
sqf
in
terms
of
fourth
amendment
and
equal
protection
law
instead
reveals
a
troublingly
asymmetrical
gap
cutting
across
both
doctrinal
structures
to
wit
fourth
amendment
law
and
equal
protection
law
alike
employ
narrow
transactional
frames
to
tally
the
costs
imposed
by
state
action
to
traditionally
subordinate
minorities
but
are
periodically
open
to
dynamic
and
ecological
effects
in
ways
that
serve
to
obscure
or
exculpate
harms
to
racial
minorities
to
see
the
mismatch
between
current
constitutional
doctrine
and
sqf
programs
in
a
nutshell
consider
a
simple
hypothetical
imagine
a
police
force
in
which
every
officer
had
internalized
both
terry
and
feeney
each
officer
in
consequence
understood
that
she
could
not
make
a
nonconsensual
street
stop
without
the
relevant
reasonable
articulable
suspicion
of
criminality
and
that
she
could
not
make
that
stop
because
of
not
merely
in
spite
of
n
the
perceived
racial
identity
of
the
individual
to
be
stopped
what
would
change
in
the
actual
practice
of
sqf
would
the
concerns
about
the
volume
and
racial
disparities
in
stops
be
assuaged
the
short
answer
is
probably
not
consistent
with
the
weak
terry
rule
it
may
well
be
possible
for
a
police
force
to
conduct
a
very
large
volume
of
stops
consistent
with
feeney
those
stops
might
be
constitutionally
valid
even
if
they
were
distributed
in
a
way
that
deepens
racial
stratification
indeed
racial
disparities
are
particularly
likely
to
persist
if
police
sincerely
believe
that
african
americans
commit
a
disproportionate
share
of
offenses
and
thus
ought
to
comprise
a
higher
per
capita
rate
of
street
stops
the
application
of
conventional
constitutional
doctrine
under
the
fourth
amendment
and
the
equal
protection
clause
therefore
is
consistent
with
preservation
of
sqf
at
its
present
volume
and
as
characterized
by
current
racial
disparities
this
part
first
considers
the
fourth
amendment
law
and
shows
its
inadequacies
it
then
analyzes
equal
protection
doctrine
to
reveal
why
it
has
utterly
failed
to
address
the
problem
of
street
policing
a
the
limits
of
fourth
amendment
doctrine
the
fourth
amendment
law
of
street
stops
cannot
impose
a
meaningful
constraint
upon
sqf
in
minority
neighborhoods
characterized
by
concentrated
poverty
to
the
contrary
fourth
amendment
doctrine
systematically
lowers
the
cost
of
such
stops
in
comparison
to
others
conducted
outside
the
distinctive
urban
ecologies
of
sqf
to
the
extent
that
the
fourth
amendment
law
of
street
policing
takes
account
of
changing
social
and
institutional
contexts
though
it
is
thoroughly
asymmetrically
it
accounts
for
such
contexts
only
when
doing
so
expands
state
authority
the
reasonable
articulable
suspicion
predicates
for
a
terry
stop
and
a
related
frisk
are
not
demanding
hurdles
they
focus
solely
on
the
ex
ante
evidentiary
basis
for
a
stop
and
wholly
ignore
the
manner
in
which
a
stop
is
conducted
terry
that
is
takes
no
account
of
variance
in
the
potential
dignitary
and
demoralization
externalities
imposed
by
aggressive
or
demeaning
police
behavior
moreover
the
court
has
not
defined
reasonable
articulable
suspicion
beyond
warning
that
an
officer
must
be
able
to
articulate
something
more
than
a
hunch
n
the
court
has
instead
underscored
that
this
evaluation
be
made
under
the
totality
of
the
circumstances
n
this
gives
officers
a
wide
array
of
predicate
facts
to
choose
from
when
making
their
case
with
one
exception
officers
subjective
beliefs
and
knowledge
are
as
a
result
available
as
bases
for
a
terry
stop
n
even
though
such
subjective
factors
are
not
relevant
to
the
fourth
amendment
analysis
in
other
contexts
n
the
exception
is
also
telling
even
where
race
is
the
real
i
e
subjective
basis
of
the
stop
the
fourth
amendment
provides
no
remedy
where
alternative
factual
grounds
for
reasonable
articulable
suspicion
can
be
conjured
n
quite
apart
from
this
peculiar
gerrymandering
of
the
legally
relevant
grounds
for
evaluating
the
quality
of
a
stop
officers
discretion
is
rarely
in
practice
subject
to
rigorous
adversarial
testing
in
a
subsequent
criminal
adjudication
where
the
sole
witnesses
to
a
stop
are
the
suspect
and
arresting
officers
there
is
little
reason
to
think
the
resulting
testimonial
contest
will
result
in
accurate
outcomes
police
have
a
strong
incentive
to
color
the
facts
in
their
favor
or
even
outright
lie
n
a
recent
ethnographic
account
of
the
chicago
criminal
courts
for
example
paints
a
bleak
picture
of
judges
who
routinely
laughed
at
the
fabrication
of
police
reports
as
if
it
were
a
novelty
rather
than
an
abuse
of
power
n
chicago
s
pathologies
might
be
extreme
but
it
is
hard
to
imagine
such
practices
are
wholly
absent
from
other
large
metropolitan
court
systems
n
in
many
urban
jurisdictions
therefore
there
will
be
little
effectual
incentive
for
officers
to
comply
with
terry
s
meager
epistemic
exhortation
nevertheless
the
general
trend
in
judicial
reworkings
of
terry
has
been
deflationary
i
will
just
give
one
example
as
it
happens
one
that
is
particularly
relevant
to
sqf
whereas
the
terry
court
allowed
the
stop
and
frisk
only
when
an
officer
suspected
crime
was
afoot
n
subsequent
cases
extended
that
power
to
instances
in
which
a
crime
has
been
completed
n
while
at
first
blush
it
might
seem
innocuous
and
sensible
this
subtle
shift
in
practice
dramatically
expands
police
discretion
under
terry
the
constellation
of
facts
that
might
be
invoked
to
justify
a
stop
was
bounded
by
what
an
officer
could
observe
at
a
specific
moment
in
time
n
now
an
officer
can
rely
on
a
far
greater
universe
of
historical
facts
available
through
a
police
forces
index
of
suspect
descriptions
to
support
reasonable
articulable
suspicion
in
a
handful
of
controversial
cases
descriptions
identifying
african
american
suspects
have
been
employed
to
conduct
blanket
searches
n
in
the
controversial
case
of
brown
v
city
of
oneonta
for
example
a
description
of
a
black
male
suspect
provoked
oneonta
police
to
stop
more
than
two
hundred
non
white
persons
including
women
encountered
on
the
streets
n
even
absent
the
broad
search
at
issue
in
brown
a
large
enough
pool
of
suspect
descriptions
as
is
likely
to
be
the
case
in
large
cities
means
that
police
discretion
to
stop
becomes
orders
of
magnitude
larger
than
the
authority
defined
in
terry
n
subsequent
refinements
to
the
terry
regime
have
rendered
sqf
more
attractive
relative
to
other
ways
of
deploying
policing
resources
as
the
late
william
stuntz
noted
criminal
procedure
rules
can
act
as
subsidies
making
some
kinds
of
law
enforcement
cheaper
than
others
n
stuntz
applied
this
logic
to
make
a
comparison
between
policing
street
markets
which
is
cheap
for
the
police
and
the
more
expensive
regulation
of
indoor
upscale
drug
markets
n
his
point
though
can
be
extended
to
the
neighborhood
level
for
a
parallel
differential
arises
between
neighborhoods
of
concentrated
poverty
and
areas
of
comparative
wealth
because
of
two
fourth
amendment
precedents
first
the
court
in
illinois
v
wardlow
held
that
a
suspect
s
mere
presence
in
a
high
crime
area
and
more
particularly
an
area
of
heavy
narcotics
trafficking
was
relevant
to
the
legality
of
a
terry
stop
n
evidence
from
new
york
s
sqf
practice
also
demonstrates
that
this
term
is
vulnerable
to
subjective
and
highly
contextualized
interpretation
n
this
may
be
of
particular
concern
to
the
extent
that
an
increasing
proportion
of
minorities
tends
to
create
a
belief
of
disorderliness
and
criminality
as
multiple
studies
show
n
wardlow
creates
an
incentive
to
target
minority
neighborhoods
indeed
even
setting
aside
the
question
of
how
a
high
crime
area
is
to
be
identified
or
bounded
wardlow
explicitly
subsidizes
police
activity
in
neighborhoods
of
concentrated
poverty
in
comparison
to
wealthy
neighborhoods
n
second
the
supreme
court
s
recent
decision
in
utah
v
streiff
n
creates
an
incentive
for
officers
to
target
for
stops
populations
that
are
likely
to
have
a
higher
per
capita
rate
of
bench
warrants
in
streiff
the
arresting
officer
was
conducting
a
stakeout
of
a
house
where
drug
sales
were
suspected
to
happen
n
he
saw
strieff
leave
the
house
and
stopped
him
despite
lacking
the
terry
predicate
of
reasonable
articulable
suspicion
n
as
a
result
of
what
the
state
conceded
to
be
an
illegal
stop
the
officer
asked
streiff
for
identification
n
upon
checking
the
produced
documentation
with
his
dispatcher
the
officer
learned
of
an
outstanding
warrant
for
streiff
and
arrested
him
n
a
search
incident
to
arrest
found
methamphetamine
and
drug
paraphernalia
n
the
issue
before
the
court
was
whether
this
evidence
should
be
excluded
as
fruit
of
the
initial
illegal
stop
n
writing
for
five
justices
justice
thomas
said
no
n
characterizing
the
initial
unlawful
stop
as
negligent
and
a
good
faith
mistake
n
the
court
found
the
search
incident
to
arrest
that
had
produced
the
narcotics
to
be
sufficiently
attenuated
by
the
pre
existing
arrest
warrant
n
hence
the
evidence
found
during
the
search
incident
to
arrest
was
not
subject
to
exclusion
in
streiff
s
criminal
adjudication
n
as
justice
sotomayor
s
dissent
pointed
out
outstanding
warrants
are
surprisingly
common
n
a
recent
ethnography
of
misdemeanor
courts
in
new
york
illustrates
how
courts
and
prosecutors
generate
a
large
volume
of
outstanding
warrants
for
failures
to
appear
at
repeatedly
rescheduled
hearings
and
then
seek
dispositions
with
little
effect
other
than
to
facilitate
later
arrests
n
in
streiff
justice
sotomayor
did
not
contextualize
the
use
of
outstanding
warrants
in
the
sqf
context
but
she
cited
evidence
gathered
by
the
justice
department
in
ferguson
missouri
and
explained
that
the
astounding
numbers
of
warrants
can
be
used
by
police
to
stop
people
without
cause
and
flagged
that
it
is
no
secret
that
people
of
color
are
disproportionate
victims
of
this
type
of
scrutiny
n
justice
sotomayor
s
analysis
is
hard
to
dispute
police
indeed
have
long
been
cognizant
of
the
strategic
potential
for
outstanding
warrant
checks
during
street
stops
and
have
strategically
exploited
it
n
the
decision
in
streiff
creates
a
new
incentive
for
police
to
engage
in
negligent
stops
n
lacking
even
with
the
minimal
accouterments
of
reasonable
articulable
suspicion
in
order
to
check
for
warrants
this
incentive
becomes
more
powerful
as
the
expected
number
of
such
outstanding
warrants
in
a
neighborhood
increases
n
here
then
is
yet
another
incentive
pressing
police
to
focus
street
patrols
on
neighborhoods
of
concentrated
poverty
even
if
they
cannot
muster
the
minimal
evidentiary
predicate
of
terry
officers
have
a
sure
fire
way
of
showing
progress
simply
by
making
illegal
stops
and
arresting
based
on
either
outstanding
warrants
or
contraband
found
during
a
search
incident
to
arrest
streiff
allows
officers
to
employ
stops
even
absent
terry
suspicion
and
demonstrate
success
decisions
such
as
wardlow
and
streiff
mean
that
current
fourth
amendment
jurisprudence
systematically
tilts
in
favor
of
sqf
the
doctrinal
framework
at
work
in
these
cases
minimizes
both
proximate
and
distant
harms
to
individuals
stopped
it
also
ignores
the
ecological
harms
and
dynamic
stratification
effects
associated
with
sqf
n
indeed
it
seems
fair
to
say
that
the
vocabulary
of
the
fourth
amendment
does
not
at
present
contain
the
resources
even
to
account
for
those
harms
let
alone
hold
them
in
the
balance
with
terry
stops
positive
crime
control
effects
one
indication
of
this
is
that
justice
sotomayor
s
comments
about
the
ecological
context
of
street
policing
were
so
strikingly
at
odds
with
the
normative
verbiage
of
the
court
s
fourth
amendment
cases
that
they
generated
national
media
attention
n
if
the
mere
fact
a
justice
is
cognizant
of
the
larger
policy
context
in
which
a
legal
question
arises
stimulates
the
press
into
action
it
is
because
the
modal
fourth
amendment
decision
is
hermetically
detached
from
the
distinctive
ecological
and
dynamic
costs
flowing
from
urban
policing
nevertheless
that
jurisprudence
is
not
wholly
bounded
by
a
narrow
transactional
focus
rather
the
court
selectively
and
asymmetrically
accounts
for
dynamic
effects
consider
the
streiff
court
s
treatment
of
the
exclusionary
remedy
n
the
court
s
foundational
decisions
about
the
scope
of
that
remedy
focus
on
its
effects
on
officers
incentives
n
the
court
has
repeatedly
stressed
that
it
is
willing
to
allow
the
costly
exclusionary
remedy
only
when
its
downstream
incentive
effects
in
relation
to
police
compliance
with
the
fourth
amendment
are
substantial
n
notionally
acknowledging
this
point
the
streiff
court
stated
that
only
purposeful
or
flagrant
police
misconduct
needed
to
be
deterred
by
exclusion
n
but
why
this
would
be
so
is
not
clear
tort
liability
for
negligence
for
example
can
easily
be
premised
on
a
deterrence
theory
n
in
streiff
itself
the
court
gave
no
thought
to
the
possibility
that
its
rule
might
elicit
less
care
by
officers
in
their
use
of
terry
stops
let
alone
a
differential
impact
in
neighborhoods
characterized
by
high
rates
of
outstanding
or
bench
warrants
streiff
suggests
that
the
court
is
willing
to
think
about
the
dynamic
effects
of
the
exclusionary
rule
on
incentives
when
doing
so
narrows
fourth
amendment
remedies
but
it
is
not
willing
to
entertain
a
dynamic
analysis
when
doing
so
would
expand
those
remedies
n
in
other
cases
the
justices
have
similarly
been
willing
to
account
for
increases
in
police
professionalism
n
yet
judicial
decisions
on
the
exclusionary
rule
systematically
ignore
potential
institutional
problems
of
police
perjury
and
abusive
conduct
n
there
is
in
short
little
reason
to
expect
that
the
court
s
current
fourth
amendment
doctrine
will
provide
a
vehicle
for
capturing
the
distinctive
wrong
of
sqf
indeed
to
the
extent
it
nudges
police
conduct
of
urban
street
policing
in
one
way
or
another
the
court
has
abetted
the
core
wrong
of
sqf
more
than
it
has
ameliorated
it
for
this
reason
it
seems
wise
to
also
analyze
sqf
in
terms
of
its
racial
impact
a
topic
addressed
at
length
below

iii
b
the
limits
of
equal
protection
doctrine
the
supreme
court
s
decisions
on
race
and
the
equal

clause
provide
no
better
traction
on
the
distinctive
wrong
of
sqf
to
the
contrary
thinking
about
racial
equality
doctrine
through
the
lens
of
sqf
illuminates
a
gap
between
the
court
s
articulated
justifications
and
its
current
doctrinal
specifications
to
take
seriously
the
normative
concerns
i
have
flagged
would
mean
treating
sqf
as
a
paradigmatic
equal
protection
violation
today
however
the
doctrine
relegates
policing
disparities
to
the
margin
two
core
prohibitions
are
embodied
in
current
equal
protection
clause
jurisprudence
first
explicit
racial
classifications
trigger
strict
scrutiny
and
require
government
to
demonstrate
with
clarity
that
its
purpose
or
interest
is
both
constitutionally
permissible
and
substantial
and
that
its
use
of
the
classification
is
necessary
to
the
accomplishment
of
its
purpose
n
in
the
absence
of
an
explicit
racial
classification
n
a
government
action
motivated
by
a
discriminatory
purpose
with
an
adverse
effect
on
a
discrete
protected
class
establishes
an
equal
protection
clause
violation
but
the
court
s
gloss
on
discriminatory
purpose
promulgated
in
personnel
administrator
of
massachusetts
v
feeney
is
cast
in
exacting
terms
n
it
compels
litigants
to
show
that
a
state
actor
selected
or
reaffirmed
a
particular
course
of
action
at
least
in
part
because
of
not
merely
in
spite
of
its
adverse
effects
upon
an
identifiable
group
n
in
contrast
a
disparate
impact
on
a
racial
group
alone
does
nothing
to
impugn
the
constitutionality
of
a
state
action
n
in
the
criminal
justice
context
this
doctrinal
framework
leaves
the
state
with
a
largely
free
hand
at
the
supreme
court
few
equal
protection
cases
have
arisen
in
the
criminal
justice
context
concerning
systemic
or
structural
inequalities
as
opposed
to
discrete
instances
of
bias
on
the
part
of
individual
actors
such
as
jurors
or
more
rarely
prosecutors
only
one
recent
case
has
grappled
with
an
explicit
racial
classification
in
johnson
v
california
a
state
prison
used
a
racial
classification
to
sort
inmates
temporarily
before
cell
assignments
could
be
determined
n
the
court
rejected
the
state
s
call
to
derogate
from
strict
scrutiny
n
in
contrast
the
court
declined
to
grant
certiorari
in
brown
v
city
of
oneonta
a
case
that
would
have
required
it
to
consider
whether
the
second
circuit
had
correctly
held
that
a
race
based
suspect
description
was
not
a
racial
classification
subject
to
strict
scrutiny
n
under
feeney
there
are
a
handful
of
cases
in
which
prosecutorial
use
of
preemptory
challenges
is
held
to
be
racially
motivated
and
thus
to
violate
the
equal
protection
clause
n
but
more
systemic
challenges
to
the
operation
of
the
criminal
justice
institutions
have
been
wholly
absent
from
the
court
s
docket
since
the
case
of
mcclesky
v
kemp
n
in
large
measure
this
is
because
mccleskey
established
a
near
insurmountable
barrier
to
such
challenges
n
in
that
capital
case
the
court
declined
to
infer
discriminatory
purpose
from
unrebutted
statistical
evidence
that
georgia
s
capital
punishment
treated
defendants
differently
based
on
their
race
and
the
race
of
their
victim
n
among
the
reasons
the
court
offered
for
declining
to
entertain
even
powerful
statistical
evidence
n
it
worried
that
if
we
accepted
mccleskey
s
claim
that
racial
bias
has
impermissibly
tainted
the
capital
sentencing
decision
we
could
soon
be
faced
with
similar
claims
as
to
other
types
of
penalty
including
noncapital
sentencing
n
this
concern
about
what
justice
brennan
acerbically
characterized
as
a
fear
of
too
much
justice
n
reoccurs
in
other
instances
in
which
criminal
justice
disparities
have
been
challenged
n
absent
the
miraculous
happenstance
of
testimonial
or
documentary
evidence
of
bias
a
stroke
of
luck
that
befell
plaintiffs
in
the
challenge
to
new

s
sqf
policy
n
mccleskey
means
that
the
courthouse
door
is
effectively
shut
to
discriminatory
purpose
challenges
in
the
criminal
justice
context
n
mccleskey
in
tandem
with
the
narrow
definition
of
racial
classifications
evinced
by
the
court
s
treatment
of
johnson
and
brown
drastically
narrows
litigants
opportunities
to
challenge
the
role
of
race
in
criminal
justice
institutions
the
substance
of
current
equal
protection
doctrine
in
short
evinces
no
concern
for
either
the
ecological
spillovers
of
enforcement
actions
onto
larger
racial
cohorts
and
much
like
the
fourth
amendment
cases
canvassed
above
it
is
heedless
of
dynamic
effects
except
perhaps
for
its
evident
concern
with
maintaining
the
criminal
justice
status
quo
finally
neither
the
rule
against
racial
classification
nor
the
bar
to
discriminatory
motivations
takes
into
account
the
possibility
that
officials
are
aware
that
a
policy
pursued
for
nonracial
ends
has
a
wholly
foreseeable
negative
effects
on
other
members
of
a
racial
or
ethnic
cohort
n
or
the
possibility
that
race
is
so
pervasively
correlated
with
nonracial
traits
such
as
residence
socioeconomic
status
and
the
like
that
official
decision
makers
simply
cannot
disentangle
racial
from
nonracial
criteria
n
there
is
something
of
a
puzzle
here
in
glossing
the
equal
protection
clause
the
court
has
invoked
ideas
of
racial
stigma
n
racial
balkanization
n
and
the
dignitary
interest
in
being
judged
on
one
s
own
merits
n
and
then
it
has
been
largely
silent
about
policing
but
it
is
not
hard
to
see
that
sqf
as
described
in
part
i
implicates
each
of
these
concerns
it
is
most
importantly
often
expressly
predicated
on
a
putative
relationship
between
race
to
criminality
n
it
is
indeed
explicitly
defended
on
the
basis
of
a
generalization
a
stereotype
about
racial
minorities
that
is
not
merely
derogatory
but
that
has
historically
been
a
keystone
of
discriminatory
legal
architectures
and
its
advocates
make
no
bones
that
the
price
of
public
safety
will
be
borne
disproportionately
by
only
some
and
only
because
of
the
color
of
their
skin
further
it
not
only
thrives
upon
the
festering
racial
segregation
that
scars
our
cities
but
it
reinforces
segregation
to
the
extent
that
minorities
are
subject
to
increased
stops
when
they
leave
their
neighborhoods
quite
literally
it
echoes
and
embeds
the
balkanization
of
our
cities
into
black
and
white
quarters
in
addition
thanks
to
the
weak
evidentiary
threshold
of
terry
it
enables
police
to
engage
in
aggregate
deprivations
of
individual
liberty
that
are
predicated
only
fractionally
on
individual
behavior
and
largely
on
race
and
place
if
one
takes
the
court
s
justifications
on
face
value
policing
tactics
such
as
sqf
in
short
ought
to
be
the
sine
qua
non
of
what
the
equal
protection
clause
prevents
the
equal
protection
doctrine
in
conclusion
provides
the
moral
justifications
but
not
the
doctrinal
tools
for
dealing
with
sqf
it
is
beholden
to
the
default
narrow
and
atomistic
transactional
frame
of
constitutional
doctrine
which
shears
away
both
ecological
and
dynamic
contexts
and
ultimately
it
lacks
the
courage
of
its
notional
convictions
for
these
reasons
it
is
not
well
adapted
to
the
task
of
fixing
sqf
iii
the
disparate
impact
lens
on
sqf
this
part
turns
from
critique
to
a
more
constructive
proposal
not
all
instruments
to
mitigate
moral
wrongs
have
to
reside
in
the
constitution
so
i
look
elsewhere
i
argue
that
a
disparate
impact
framework
of
liability
now
found
in
both
federal
statutes
and
state
law
provides
a
better
but
not
a
perfect
framework
for
analyzing
urban
street
policing
policy
the
purpose
of
the
disparate
impact
lens
advanced
here
is
diagnostic
it
is
also
second
best
in
the
sense
that
it
does
not
track
the
loose
cost
benefit
analysis
that
is
fleshed
out
in
part
i
that
cost
benefit
analysis
in
my
view
impugns
all
programmatic
use
of
sqf
in
racially
diverse
cities
at
present
more
modestly
a
disparate
impact
lens
provides
a
way
to
identify
when
a
police
department
s
programmatic
use
of
terry
stops
is
especially
likely
to
be
unjustified
because
it
is
characterized
by
distinctive
ecological
and
dynamic
harms
a
disparate
impact
lens
in
other
words
flushes
out
the
subset
of
municipal
policing
practices
from
which
the
harms
identified
in
part
i
are
most
likely
to
flow
it
does
not
flag
every
instance
in
which
sqf
is
unjustified
on
welfarist
terms
formally
a
disparate
impact
framework
identifies
a
set
of
policing
practices
in
which
the
likely
proximate
costs
of
sqf
are
concentrated
on
minority
communities
without
an
adequately
supported
justification
the
analysis
developed
in
part
ii
suggested
that
the
proximate
costs
of
sqf
which
include
the
hassle
and
humiliation
of
stops
are
only
a
fraction
of
the
total
costs
of
sqf
the
latter
comprise
the
larger
set
of
dynamic
costs
to
individuals
families
and
communities
but
if
even
the
proximate
costs
of
sqf
are
highly
concentrated
it
is
likely
that
aggregate
costs
are
also
extremely
concentrated
where
the
state
cannot
identify
a
strong
public
policy
justification
for
that
concentration
sqf
should
be
ranked
as
legally
problematic
more
specifically
where
the
state
cannot
adequately
make
the
case
that
the
concentration
of
sqf
responds
to
a
real
crime
problem
and
in
fact
mitigates
that
problem
it
should
be
required
to
reconsider
its
policing
strategy
in
this
sense
the
avoidance
of
disparate
impact
is
a
modest
second
best
demand
which
nudges
the
state
s
attention
toward
the
right
elements
of
policing
strategy
n
it
invites
that
is
remedial
attention
to
systemic
rather
than
individualistic
pathologies
and
it
avoids
the
moralizing
and
potentially
polarizing
language
of
individual
blame
and
liability
to
flesh
out
this
alternative
lens
onto
sqf
this
part
defines
and
defends
disparate
impact
liability
as
a
legally
available
approach
for
analyzing
policing
decisions
in
particular
i
develop
the
reasons
for
which
disparate
impact
is
superior
to
the
currently
dominant
constitutional
approaches
described
in
part
ii
having
dealt
with
potential
objections
to
its
translation
to
the
policing
context
i
conclude
by
sketching
how
in
practice
disparate
impact
liability
can
be
applied
to
sqf
in
practice
a
disparate
impact
analysis
requires
econometric
studies
of
the
aggregate
data
about
stops
frisks
and
other
outcomes
as
well
as
fine
grained
judgments
about
how
to
specify
and
interpret
such
studies
i
set
forth
three
general
lines
of
inquiry
that
might
profitably
be
applied
to
such
aggregate
data
to
determine
whether
a
disparate
impact
exists
i
largely
bracket
however
more
technical
questions
of
econometric
specification
together
these
empirical
strategies
nevertheless
provide
a
rough
template
for
making
disparate
impact
an
effective
and
practicable
instrument
of
legal
reform
a
the
availability
of
disparate
impact
the
theory
of
disparate
impact
liability
in
race
discrimination
cases
is
associated
with
the
supreme
court
s
construction
of

of
the
civil

act
of

griggs
v

power
co

somewhat
chastened
form

remains
available
to
plaintiffs

cases

also
a
cognizable
theory
of
liability
under

age

in

and
the

act
fha

be
understood
as
either
an
instrument
for
rooting
out
bad
intent
or
as
a
freestanding
ground
of
liability

is
in
contrast
a
road
not
taken
in

protection
law
n
disparate

liability
in

available
under

explicit
grant
of
rule
making
authority
under
the
statute
federal
agencies
including
the
department
of
justice
have
promulgated
regulations
prohibiting
disparate
racial
impacts
as
well
as
disparate
racial
treatment
n
the
justice
department
s
disparate
impact
regulation
applies
to
any
program
for
which
federal
financial
assistance
is
authorized
under
a
law
administered
by
the
department
n
because
local
police
departments
receive
federal
funding
from
dozens
of
separate
programs
many
administered
by
the
department
of
justice

the
title

on

applies
to
most
state

local
police
forces
that
prohibition
however
may
be
enforced
by
public
suits

not
via
individuals

of
action

the
new

consent
decree
and
the
baltimore
settlement
obtained
by
the

example
both
invoke
title
vi
authority
albeit
in
nebulous
terms
n
second
at

two
states
prohibit

measures
with

the
illinois
civil

in
at

one
case
it
has
been
applied

n
california

to
the

agencies
interpreting

have
long
used
a
four
fifth

to
single
out
cognizable

the
supreme
court
has
approvingly
cited
this
interpretation
adding
that
a
simple
significant
statistical
disparity
and
nothing

is
needed
at
the
threshold
n
this
prima
facie
case
however
may
be
rebutted
by
evidence
that
the
challenged

is
job
related
for
the

consistent

b
the
comparative
advantage
of
disparate
impact
black
letter
constitutional
law
largely
ignores
the
ecological
and
dynamic
aspects
of
sqf
it
therefore
fails
to
provide
a
useful
analytic
lens
for
determining
when
and
how
urban
street
policing
is
a
moral
wrong
why
would
a
disparate
impact
lens
do
any
better
it
is
not
a
form
of
cost
benefit
analysis
of
the
kind
developed
above
after
all
rather
a
disparate
impact
analysis
is
appropriate
here
because
it
is
a
way
to
isolate
the
proximate
costs
of
a
policy
excluding
that
is
its
social
familial
and
intergenerational
effects
and
to
compare
those
to
its
affirmative
policy
justifications
in
the
policing
context
disparate
impact
thus
weighs
a
subcategory
of
the
costs
imposed
on
minority
populations
against
almost
all
the
crime
control
related
benefits
of
the
policy
given
its
failure
to
capture
the
full
range
of
costs
adumbrated
in
part
ii
and
given
that
it
will
likely
account
for
most
of
the
benefits
of
sqf
a
disparate
impact
lens
is
likely
to
be
radically
under
inclusive
it
will
only
capture
a
subset
of
cases
in
which
sqf
imposes
a
moral
wrong
nevertheless
there
are
three
reasons
for
thinking
that
disparate
impact
is
a
better
fit
for
identifying
the
distinctive
moral
wrong
of
sqf
identified
in
part
i
even
if
it
does
not
track
precisely
a
cost
benefit
analysis
first
disparate
impact
liability
is
at
least
focused
on
aggregate
rather
than
individual
outcomes
it
is
panoramic
rather
than
microscopic
the
institutional
focus
of
disparate
impact
widens
the
array
of
relevant
institutional
decisions
that
can
be
considered
as
causes
of
harm
policing
is
not
simply
a
matter
of
officers
on
the
street
making
ad
hoc
decisions
like
any
other
complex
organizations
a
police
force
is
channeled
through
policies
practices
and
bureaucratic
norms
developed
at
competing
institutional
nodes
from
city
hall
to
chief
of
police
s
office
to
the
precinct
house
the
capacious
lens
used
by
disparate
impact
captures
more
relevant
state
actions
than
an
approach
focused
on
bad
motives
analysis
under
a
wide
angle
disparate
impact
rubric
is
also
not
limited
to
the
consequences
of
a
discrete
individual
s
action
it
focuses
more
capaciously
on
all
the
effects
of
a
practice
n
sqf
as
i
have
described
it
in
part
i
need
not
rest
on
pernicious
individual
motivations
to
generate
a
distinctive
moral
wrong
rather
that
wrong
can
flow
from
the
effects
of
institutional
policies
and
practices
disparate
impact
is
sensitive
to
a
wide
range
of
effects
and
is
in
particular
able
to
capture
the
interaction
between
past
distributions
and
present
policing
practice
an
institutional
practice
such
as
sqf
will
produce
different
effects
depending
on
the
context
to
which
is
applied
when
employed
in
a
fashion
that
tracks
patterns
of
existing
racial
segregation
its
race
related
patterns
will
be
different
from
an
application
that
cuts
across
extant
forms
of
racial
stratification
this
difference
is
captured
in
the
broad
scope
of
disparate
impact
analysis
which
accounts
for
history
as
well
as
institutional
context
in
a
way
that
discriminatory
treatment
analysis
cannot
second
disparate
impact
analysis
focuses
attention
on
the
morally
relevant
question
of
whether
the
crime
control
benefits
of
the
policy
as
a
whole
justify
its
costs
once
a
racial
effect
is
identified
at
the
threshold
the
second
step
of
the
disparate
impact
analysis
involves
careful
consideration
of
the
affirmative
justifications
for
the
disparity
in
effect
the
analysis
roughly
weighs
positives
against
negatives
in
the
discriminatory
treatment
context
by
contrast
there
is
no
opportunity
to
identify
or
weigh
all
relevant
costs
as
a
result
when
a
race
based
criteria
is
used
as
in
brown
v
city
of
oneonta
n
a
court
inclined
to
permit
race
based
suspect
descriptions
as
cost
justified
will
find
it
easier
to
avoid
strict
scrutiny
by
declining
to
perceive
a
racial
classification
at
work
in
the
first
instance
n
on
the
other
side
of
the
ledger
disparate
impact
analysis
also
considers
the
aggregate
outcomes
of
a
policy
in
the
sqf
context
for
example
this
would
mean
counts
of
the
numbers
of
different
racial
groups
who
are
stopped
again
it
is
important
to
emphasize
that
this
is
not
a
full
tally
of
the
ecological
and
dynamic
spillovers
from
aggressive
sqf
policing
but
it
accounts
for
the
policy
s
sheer
size
and
hence
reflects
at
least
approximately
the
effect
of
a
large
number
of
minority
stops
on
self
worth
residential
patterns
and
the
diffusion
of
stereotypical
beliefs
about
the
links
between
race
and
crime
far
better
than
a
legal
framework
pinched
to
fit
cleanly
around
individual
motives
finally
disparate
impact
liability
obviates
the
need
to
make
controversial
judgments
about
individuals
intentions
beliefs
and
attitudes
by
focusing
attention
on
these
elusive
psychological
facts
both
terry
and
feeney
invite
self
deception
and
perjury
on
the
part
of
police
and
municipal
policymakers
the
feeney
framework
in
particular
also
ratchets
up
emotional
stakes
by
predicating
a
remedy
on
the
finding
that
a
specific
person
is
motivated
by
discriminatory
intent
a
standard
that
has
the
potential
to
induce
backlash
within
regulated
entities
such
as
police
forces
n
by
honing
in
upon
consequentialist
criteria
instead
the
disparate
impact
standard
obviates
loaded
and
easily
deflected
allegations
of
bad
intent
even
as
it
draws
salutary
attention
to
the
deeper
and
more
enduring
costs
of
sqf
to
be
clear
no
judicially
enforceable
theory
of
liability
will
provide
a
panacea
to
the
problem
of
concentrated
racialized
poverty
or
the
complex
network
of
state
action
and
inaction
that
created
and
perpetuated
it
the
case
for
disparate
impact
liability
in
the
policing
context
rests
on
the
more
modest
claim
that
it
captures
a
wider
array
of
morally
relevant
costs
and
benefits
than
the
available
alternatives
it
does
not
imply
perfection
c
the
objections
to
disparate
impact
in
the
policing
context
three
objections
to
the
application
of
disparate
impact
liability
to
the
policing
context
are
worth
resolving
before
turning
to
the
nitty
gritty
of
application
they
concern
its
constitutionality
its
efficacy
and
the
availability
of
popular
support
to
begin
with
there
has
recently
been
a
question
about
the
constitutionality
of
disparate
impact
liability
even
though
in
its
infancy
in
the
s
it
was
understood
as
an
important
strand
of
equal
protection
law
n
paradoxically
at
least
one
member
of
the
court
has
intimated
that
disparate
impact
might
itself
violate
the
equal
protection
clause
because
it
forces
race
consciousness
n
nevertheless
more
recent
precedent
suggests
that
there
is
no
constitutional
problem
in
the
existence
of
disparate
impact
prohibitions
but
that
those
prohibitions
might
raise
such
problems
in
their
application
n
in
particular
the
court
has
suggested
that
the
second
step
of
the
analysis
the
proffer
of
legitimate
justifications
for
a
disparity
is
key
in
glossing
the
fha
s
disparate
impact
prong
the
court
in
its
texas
department
of
housing
and
community
affairs
v
inclusive
communities
project
opinion
cautioned
that
constitutional
problems
would
arise
if
liability
were
imposed
based
solely
on
a
showing
of
a
statistical
disparity
n
rather
it
is
only
artificial
arbitrary
and
unnecessary
barriers
that
legitimately
and
constitutionally
trigger
such
liability
n
this
places
great
stress
on
the
opportunity
a
defendant
must
have
in
a
disparate
impact
proceeding
to
point
to
non
arbitrary
and
necessary
grounds
for
a
justification
n
more
specifically
a
regression
analysis
used
to
identify
a
race
effect
must
include
controls
for
legitimate
justifications
for
a
disparity
n
a
second
concern
raised
by
a
number
of
recent
commentators
is
that
the
disparate
impact
theory
has
produced
no
substantial
social
change
and
there
is
no
reason
to
think
that
extending
the
theory
to
other
contexts
would
have
produced
meaningful
reform
n
a
common
thread
uniting
these
concerns
is
the
premise
that
courts
are
unwilling
to
broadly
restructure
social
institutions
n
or
interfere
with
the
private
intra
firm
ordering
n
to
be
sure
the
frailty
of
the
judicial
will
to
enforce
constitutional
norms
on
behalf
of
disfavored
groups
cannot
be
overstated
nevertheless
blanket
pessimism
is
unwarranted
for
two
reasons
to
begin
with
several
cities
are
already
operating
under
consent
decrees
or
settlements
that
either
include
an
independent
monitor
or
envisage
much
judicially
supervised
reorganization
of
street
policing
n
further
there
is
no
reason
to
think
that
municipal
officials
involved
in
the
negotiation
and
operationalizing
of
these
deals
lack
any
interest
at
all
in
mitigating
the
fierce
public
pressure
to
diminish
the
racial
tensions
of
urban
policing
the
application
of
disparate
impact
liability
provides
a
more
cogent
way
for
them
to
understand
how
to
do
so
than
available
alternatives
in
addition
precise
agency
regulations
such
as
those
issued
in
under
the
fha
have
the
potential
to
stabilize
disparate
impact
law
and
to
provide
clarity
to
regulated
entities
subject
to
different
judicial
standards
n
there
is
no
reason
such
stabilization
cannot
be
achieved
in
the
policing
context
through
more
specific
justice
department
regulations
however
unlikely
these
might
be
in
the
near
term
indeed
the
more
granular
account
of
how
to
think
about
disparate
impact
in
the
context
of
policing
data
that
follows
in
part
iii
c
itself
can
do
double
duty
by
providing
a
framework
for
such
regulations
finally
it
might
be
argued
that
broad
support
for
aggressive
street
policing
within
minority
communities
provides
a
sufficient
justification
for
racially
disparate
allocation
of
terry
stops
n
if
the
very
communities
that
suffer
the
costs
of
intensive
policing
also
clamor
for
such
policing
the
moral
case
for
disparate
impact
liability
seems
thin
indeed
yet
evidence
for
community
demand
in
the
context
of
sqf
is
thin
on
the
ground
protests
in
chicago
new
york
and
philadelphia
about
stop
and
frisk
have
been
led
by
organizations
from
minority
communities
n
more
generally
to
the
extent
that
african
american
political
leaders
have
sought
increased
policing
there
have
been
accompanying
demands
to
redirect
power
and
economic
resources
to
low
income
minority
communities
n
but
when
blacks
ask
for
better
policing
legislators
tend
to
hear
more
instead
n
disparate
impact
liability
is
more
sensitive
to
the
marginal
crime
control
benefits
attached
to
sqf
as
well
as
its
costs
it
is
therefore
a
sensible
way
to
reconcile
minority
communities
demands
for
both
better
public
security
and
also
freedom
for
excessive
street
policing
cannot
d
disparate
impact
in
action
this
final
section
sketches
how
a
disparate
impact
analysis
of
sqf
data
might
be
put
into
action
its
twofold
aim
is
to
show
that
such
inquiries
are
feasible
and
to
start
to
make
progress
on
some
of
the
knotty
theoretical
puzzles
raised
by
disparate
impact
s
implementation
to
set
the
stage
for
this
inquiry
it
is
useful
to
consider
its
practical
context
the
settlements
in
philadelphia
and
chicago
which
were
both
reached
without
information
generating
litigation
require
ongoing
collection
of
extensive
data
concerning
the
timing
justifications
suspect
demographics
and
consequences
of
stops
n
how
might
this
data
be
interrogated
for
evidence
of
disparate
impact
how
concretely
can
one
inquiry
into
whether
a
discrete
practice
or
policy
causes
a
racially
disparate
impact
that
is
not
justified
on
legitimate
and
necessary
grounds
be
executed
in
answering
these
questions
i
focus
on
the
theoretical
questions
of
what
kinds
of
disparities
should
count
not
more
technical
questions
of
econometric
identification
strategy
a
disparate
racial
impact
can
result
from
one
of
three
elements
of
policing
strategy
each
of
the
latter
warrants
separate
and
distinct
analysis
at
each
level
racial
disparities
salient
to
the
distinctive
moral
wrong
of
sqf
can
emerge
and
at
each
level
the
state
can
also
avail
itself
of
different
legitimate
justifications
for
the
disparity
if
anything
the
feasible
analytic
tools
favor
the
state
as
a
result
disparate
impact
analysis
in
the
fashion
developed
here
is
decisively
under
inclusive
insofar
as
it
does
not
capture
all
the
ecological
and
dynamic
externalities
from
sqf
the
availability
of
plural
tests
to
capture
a
racially
disparate
effect
only
partially
compensate
for
this
lacuna
nevertheless
it
is
the
best
extant
doctrinal
framework
for
the
problem
and
also
likely
superior
to
anything
that
can
be
created
from
scratch
in
current
political
conditions
for
the
purpose
of
illustration
here
i
hypothesize
a
municipal
jurisdiction
that
has
just
entered
a
consent
decree
we
can
assume
that
like
new
york
philadelphia
and
chicago
this
municipality
is
racially
and
economically
segregated
with
race
and
socioeconomic
status
closely
covarying
we
can
also
assume
that
the
city
is
divided
into
precincts
which
are
the
foundational
elements
of
the
geographic
allocation
of
police
the
municipality
s
sqf
as
in
real
life
cases
is
directed
at
neighborhoods
of
concentrated
poverty
and
high
crime
which
are
also
predominantly
minority
the
municipality
is
required
to
gather
data
about
stops
of
the
kind
elicited
by
the
chicago
and
philadelphia
settlements
i
will
assume
police
collect
that
data
faithfully
n
i
focus
here
on
the
legal
question
of
what
questions
can
be
asked
of
the
resulting
data
i
discuss
each
three
levels
of
analysis
in
turn
for
each
level
i
identify
the
relevant
element
of
state
policy
or
practice
the
outcome
across
which
racial
disparities
may
be
observed
and
the
range
of
feasible
justifications
a
municipality
might
offer
where
possible
i
also
note
if
the
question
has
been
examined
in
an
existing
study
or
litigation
between
precinct
disparities
the
first
level
of
analysis
that
should
be
tested
is
the
rate
of
sqf
deployment
by
precinct
recall
that
the
core
justification
for
sqf
tendered
by
its
defenders
is
that
street
police
are
deployed
where
crime
occurs
racial
disparities
arise
only
because
crime
is
concentrated
in
minority
neighborhoods
n
but
this
may
not
be
the
case
perceptions
of
crime
can
also
be
a
function
of
the
racial
composition
of
a
neighborhood
n
a
threshold
policy
decision
to
be
tested
is
the
volume
of
terry
stop
per
precinct
with
a
lagged
measure
of
crime
as
a
control
this
is
a
way
of
determining
whether
the
geographical
distribution
of
policing
resources
turns
on
racial
demographics
or
crime
rates
n
for
example
jeffrey
fagan
tested
whether
the
number
of
stops
per
precinct
in
new
york
city
was
disproportionate
to
the
racial
composition
of
the
precinct
after
controlling
for
several
different
types
of
historical
crime
rate
n
his
analysis
suggested
that
crime
based
justification
for
sqf
s
allocation
was
unfounded
n
using
an
ordinary
least
squares
regression
he
found
that
the
percentage
of
african
american
residents
was
a
stronger
predictor
of
terry
stop
volume
than
lagged
rates
of
violent
crime
narcotics
offices
weapons
offenses
and
trespass
n
only
property
and
quality
of
life
rates
outperformed
race
as
predictors
of
stop
volume
n
this
is
an
especially
striking
result
given
sqf
s
justification
in
the
wake
of
the
kansas
city
experiment
as
a
means
of
reducing
violent
crime
and
as
an
alternative
to
broken
windows
policing
n
it
is
also
striking
because
the
assumption
that
an
increase
in
crime
rates
should
predict
a
subsequent
increase
in
street
stops
is
dubious
insofar
as
it
stacks
the
deck
in
the
state
s
favor
in
a
normative
troubling
way
the
use
of
lagged
crime
rates
as
a
control
assumes
that
the
only
available
or
perhaps
the
best
available
policing
response
to
upticks
in
crime
concern
is
more
intensive
street
policing
but
this
is
false
n
as
i
have
argued
the
evidence
that
sqf
has
a
large
crime
control
effect
is
weak
especially
in
comparison
to
alternative
policing
instruments
n
the
use
of
crime
rates
as
a
baseline
further
assumes
that
terry
stops
are
responsive
to
all
species
of
violent
crime
but
at
least
for
the
proportion
of
violent
crimes
that
occur
within
the
home
against
partners
or
other
intimates
it
is
hard
to
see
how
terry
stops
are
responsive
n
in
short
there
is
no
good
reason
to
assume
the
best
only
or
most
effective
response
to
rising
crime
rates
in
a
specific
neighborhood
is
to
increase
the
number
of
people
being
stopped
n
a
between
precinct
measure
of
racial
disparities
can
be
combined
with
a
range
of
other
measures
to
develop
a
more
nuanced
rendering
of
how
policing
resources
are
allocated
across
geographic
areas
hence
simple
descriptive
statistics
can
provide
useful
confirmatory
evidence
even
if
they
cannot
on
their
own
prove
disparate
impact
liability
consistent
with
inclusive
communities
n
the
data
might
be
further
interrogated
by
comparing
the
determinants
of
precinct
level
deployments
with
the
rate
of
stops
per
resident
conditional
on
racial
identity
n
where
such
citywide
tests
find
that
not
only
do
minority
neighborhoods
bear
a
disproportionate
toll
of
stops
but
minority
individuals
also
bear
a
larger
share
of
those
stops
there
is
reason
for
concern
that
sqf
is
not
only
regressive
in
effect
but
also
triggers
the
dynamic
vicious
circle
processes
described
in
part
i
c
in
addition
the
between
precinct
distribution
of
street
policing
is
usefully
contrasted
with
the
distribution
of
other
policing
resources
if
precincts
that
receive
intensive
terry
treatments
for
example
are
associated
with
lower
rates
of
other
policing
measures
e
g
they
have
fewer
officers
deployed
across
both
reactive
and
proactive
policing
or
they
have
persistently
longer
wait
times
for
calls
then
there
is
further
reason
for
skepticism
that
crime
control
simpliciter
in
fact
explains
or
justifies
racial
disparities
in
stops
across
geographic
subunits
within
the
municipality
within
precinct
disparities
the
next
level
of
analysis
focuses
on
the
distribution
of
terry
stops
by
racial
or
ethnic
group
within
a
precinct
between
precinct
tests
are
incomplete
because
even
if
there
are
no
between
precinct
disparities
a
disparate
racial
impact
might
emerge
within
a
given
precinct
if
racial
minorities
engaged
in
the
same
potentially
criminal
conduct
as
non
minorities
are
more
likely
holding
all
else
constant
to
be
stopped
or
otherwise
policed
than
non
minorities
in
the
same
position
the
intuition
that
racial
minorities
may
be
overpoliced
in
comparison
to
similar
non
minority
citizens
is
easy
to
see
in
the
context
of
racially
heterogeneous
central
business
districts
where
minority
citizens
may
be
perceived
as
categorically
out
of
place
and
hence
suspicious
but
the
same
disparity
can
arise
even
in
poorer
majority
minority
neighborhoods
a
pair
of
studies
of
narcotics
policing
in
seattle
by
katherine
beckett
and
her
colleagues
nicely
illustrate
how
race
might
figure
in
within
precinct
dynamics
in
this
way
their
first
study
demonstrated
among
other
things
that
in
the
capitol
hill
neighborhood
of
seattle
three
percent
of
those
purchasing
narcotics
were
african
american
while
of
those
arrested
were
african
american
n
their
second
study
found
that
predominantly
white
outdoor
drug
markets
received
far
less
attention
from
police
than
racially
diverse
ones
such
that
the
geographic
concentration
of
law
enforcement
resources
was
a
significant
cause
of
racial
disparity
n
indeed
a
qualitative
component
of
the
study
found
that
police
officers
flagged
one
racially
diverse
crack
market
while
failing
to
mention
a
similar
but
overwhelmingly
white
market
for
prescription
drugs
operating
alongside
it
n
of
special
note
here
beckett
and
her
collaborators
explicitly
consider
the
possibility
that
differences
in
the
policing
of
crack
cocaine
and
prescription
drug
markets
may
have
been
due
to
different
levels
of
associated
violence
n
they
find
however
that
the
association
between
crack
and
violence
does
not
appear
to
have
existed
in
seattle
during
the
period
under
investigation
n
these
studies
findings
echo
sociological
findings
of
how
racial
composition
often
predicts
perceptions
of
crime
and
historical
findings
about
the
deep
roots
of
stereotypes
of
black
criminality
they
demonstrate
the
importance
of
a
nuanced
and
contextualized
analysis
of
what
is
happening
within
heavily
policed
neighborhoods
rather
than
a
blase
assumption
that
heavy
policing
in
high
crime
neighborhoods
is
necessarily
even
handed
or
efficacious
a
within
precinct
analysis
usefully
considers
whether
the
rate
of
minority
stops
is
better
predicted
by
legitimate
policing
grounds
or
suspects
race
conditional
on
certain
precinct
level
characteristics
within
a
pool
of
stop
related
data
the
number
of
stops
per
ethnic
group
within
a
given
time
period
would
be
the
outcome
i
e
dependent
variable
to
be
explained
n
for
a
given
precinct
one
could
ask
whether
there
is
a
statistically
significant
correlation
between
the
rate
of
stops
and
the
fact
individual
suspects
are
african
american
or
hispanic
rather
than
white
after
controlling
for
relevant
precinct
level
characteristics
some
existing
studies
deploy
a
method
called
multilevel
modeling
to
control
simultaneously
for
individual
and
precinct
level
factors
n
i
will
assume
that
approach
is
valid
although
nothing
rests
on
that
assumption
so
long
as
some
parallel
econometric
technique
is
available
the
pivotal
question
for
such
multilevel
models
is
the
choice
of
control
variables
to
capture
non
arbitrary
and
necessary
justifications
n
a
disparate
impact
model
should
include
only
control
variables
that
provide
normatively
valid
justifications
for
a
within
precinct
racial
disparity
in
this
regard
it
is
fundamentally
dissimilar
from
tests
for
discriminatory
motives
a
regression
based
test
for
the
latter
operates
by
excluding
all
possible
explanations
for
a
stop
except
for
the
race
of
a
suspect
the
study
employed
in
the
new
york
litigation
for
example
controls
for
the
foreign
born
proportion
of
a
precinct
socioeconomic
status
and
the
presence
of
a
business
district
n
but
a
racial
disparate
impact
as
a
matter
of
law
arises
not
only
when
there
is
no
other
possible
explanation
for
a
racial
gap
in
stop
rates
it
additionally
arises
when
there
is
no
legitimate
explanation
related
to
policing
goals
for
that
gap
in
this
regard
the
economic
analysis
of
disparate
impacts
is
unlike
the
large
array
of
econometric
studies
that
focus
on
a
causal
if
then
question
and
treat
randomized
trials
as
an
ideal
n
variables
such
as
the
socioeconomic
character
of
a
precinct
its
foreign
born
populace
and
officer
race
have
no
place
in
disparate
impact
analysis
n
their
inclusion
leads
to
included
variable
bias
insofar
as
they
would
not
plausibly
justify
a
racial
disparity
in
outcomes
n
even
when
included
in
disparate
treatment
analyses
they
result
in
bloated
statistical
models
so
chock
full
of
covariates
i
e
control
variables
that
any
evidence
of
disparate
treatment
disappears
n
in
several
existing
studies
lagged
crime
or
violent
crime
rates
are
used
as
the
baseline
control
in
this
sort
of
multilevel
model
n
this
parameter
at
least
relates
directly
to
the
notional
justification
that
a
municipality
has
for
increased
street
stops
i
e
crime
related
patterns
subject
to
the
concerns
raised
above
n
it
captures
the
ways
in
which
deployment
levels
might
fluctuate
in
response
to
shifts
in
the
geographic
distribution
of
crime
it
is
also
likely
to
be
superior
to
a
benchmark
of
lagged
arrest
rates
which
is
employed
in
some
models
n
the
latter
are
potentially
influenced
by
officers
racial
beliefs
to
this
end
a
recent
metastudy
of
the
effect
of
suspect
race
on
arrest
decisions
found
that
minorities
are
at
least
thirty
percent
more
likely
to
be
arrested
as
similar
non
minority
suspects
n
historical
arrest
rates
thus
provide
a
distorted
baseline
which
obscures
potential
racial
disparities
in
stops
by
implicitly
controlling
for
officer
bias
it
is
worth
underscoring
once
more
that
the
racial
composition
of
the
pool
of
those
suspected
of
a
crime
or
arrested
for
a
crime
is
by
no
means
an
unproblematic
benchmark
for
the
racial
composition
of
those
subject
to
a
terry
stop
even
within
a
particular
neighborhood
the
best
argument
from
using
such
data
as
a
benchmark
in
my
view
focuses
solely
on
racial
composition
of
the
local
violent
offender
population
it
hypothesizes
that
police
focus
either
on
people
or
places
associated
with
higher
violent
crime
risk
given
racial
segregation
and
racial
divides
between
social
groups
it
is
then
predicted
that
the
racial
composition
of
the
stopped
population
will
track
that
of
the
at
risk
population
setting
aside
questions
about
the
efficacy
of
sqf
generally
as
a
crime
control
measure
there
are
nonetheless
three
reasons
for
skepticism
of
even
this
benchmark
first
this
logic
assumes
that
municipalities
can
accurately
zero
in
on
not
just
places
but
persons
who
present
a
risk
of
violence
it
is
not
clear
that
this
is
so
for
example
a
recent
study
of
chicago
s
strategic
subjects
list
which
was
used
in
this
fashion
found
that
individuals
on
the
city
s
list
were
no
more
or
less
likely
to
be
victimized
by
violence
than
a
control
group
n
second
if
sqf
focuses
on
places
rather
than
persons
the
number
of
individuals
involved
in
violent
crime
is
still
a
small
fraction
of
the
volume
of
people
stopped
n
in
the
exceptionally
bloody
month
of
august
in
chicago
for
example
ninety
people
were
killed
by
gunfire
n
the
number
of
stops
that
month
was
likely
at
least
two
orders
of
magnitude
greater
even
assuming
that
the
chicago
police
in
that
month
were
focused
accurately
on
corners
where
violence
was
likely
to
occur
more
than
one
hundred
instances
of
reasonable
articulable
suspicion
were
being
targeted
for
every
one
act
of
violence
and
even
if
police
then
have
reason
to
anticipate
a
particular
corner
or
street
will
witness
violence
at
a
minimum
some
ninety
nine
out
of
every
one
hundred
stops
will
have
no
relation
to
that
violence
historical
patterns
of
violence
cannot
explain
why
reasonable
articulable
suspicion
existed
for
those
individuals
the
racial
demographics
of
violent
crimes
or
violent
crime
related
arrests
on
a
given
street
or
corner
do
not
necessarily
predict
the
racial
distribution
of
reasonable
articulable
suspicion
that
police
can
witness
at
any
given
moment
in
time
for
most
stops
most
of
the
time
therefore
it
seems
likely
that
historical
crime
rates
will
be
orthogonal
to
the
incidence
of
a
terry
stop
finally
imagine
a
municipality
that
affirmatively
directs
its
police
to
engage
in
a
pattern
of
stops
that
mimics
the
racial
distribution
of
violent
crime
offenders
in
many
contexts
that
distribution
will
skew
heavily
towards
african
americans
and
to
a
lesser
extent
hispanics
this
is
in
effect
a
system
of
racial
quotas
where
some
large
fraction
of
those
subject
to
state
coercion
suffer
that
fate
based
solely
on
their
race
rather
than
their
own
past
conduct
especially
given
the
weak
empirical
support
for
sqf
s
efficacy
such
a
policy
raises
stark
equal
protection
concerns
even
under
the
supreme
court
s
current
highly
restrictive
view
of
the
doctrine
n
instead
of
using
crime
rates
violent
crime
rates
or
analogous
arrest
rates
as
a
benchmark
of
just
policing
therefore
a
study
of
disparate
impact
would
ideally
track
beckett
and
colleagues
seattle
study
in
estimating
the
racial
composition
of
the
baseline
population
subject
to
police
action
through
ethnographic
observation
of
open
air
drug
markets
and
other
means
n
ideally
that
is
data
would
be
sampled
perhaps
from
police
body
cameras
to
estimate
the
racial
composition
of
the
population
observed
on
patrol
for
whom
reasonable
articulable
suspicion
obtained
if
like
police
in
beckett
s
studies
officers
tended
to
ignore
non
minority
offenders
while
stopping
minority
offenders
a
within
precinct
disparity
would
be
established
with
certainty
such
an
approach
is
hardly
impossible
indeed
a
recent
study
of
oakland
policing
used
text
analysis
of
sound
recordings
from
officers
body
cameras
to
identify
differential
racial
treatment
of
citizens
during
street
encounters
n
within
and
between
officer
disparities
finally
racial
disparities
can
emerge
not
only
at
the
aggregate
levels
of
between
and
within
precincts
n
they
can
also
arise
either
because
some
or
all
officers
within
a
precinct
differentiate
between
minority
and
non
minority
suspects
without
a
legitimate
justification
this
level
of
police
action
which
comprises
the
dispersed
exercise
of
individual
officers
discretion
demands
attention
to
the
specific
sequence
of
distinct
police
actions
embedded
within
a
particular
interaction
ranging
from
the
decision
to
stop
the
decision
to
frisk
the
use
of
force
and
the
imposition
of
subsequent
consequences
such
as
citations
or
arrests
given
the
existence
of
outstanding
warrants
as
a
reason
for
arrests
however
the
latter
are
a
particularly
tricky
variable
to
analyze
because
they
may
be
unrelated
to
the
initial
stop
i
sketch
here
the
most
promising
approaches
for
identifying
racial
disparities
at
the
individual
officer
level
i
then
caution
against
the
use
of
the
most
popular
economic
model
of
police
stops
commonly
known
as
the
kpt
model
as
neither
apposite
nor
realistic
as
a
framework
for
analyzing
sqf
individual
officers
might
create
racially
disparate
effects
in
two
distinct
ways
first
the
terry
standard
of
reasonable
articulable
suspicion
is
a
vague
term
with
a
range
of
possible
calibrations
n
some
or
all
officers
might
apply
stronger
or
weaker
evidentiary
predicates
for
stops
of
different
racial
groups
second
as
fryer
s
powerful
analysis
of
new
york
policing
demonstrates
officers
might
differentially
treat
minorities
who
have
been
stopped
by
employing
a
greater
quantum
of
violence
other
outcomes
such
as
citations
and
arrests
might
also
be
disparately
allocated
disparities
in
both
stop
rates
and
post
stop
outcomes
should
be
analyzed
in
a
disparate
impact
analysis
on
the
stop
rate
question
a
simple
measure
is
to
rerun
the
multilevel
models
used
for
within
precinct
disparities
using
officers
rather
than
precincts
as
the
relevant
unit
of
analysis
and
lagged
crime
rates
measured
at
the
smallest
available
geographic
unit
as
a
control
n
a
parallel
analysis
can
be
run
for
outcomes
such
as
the
seizure
of
contraband
or
firearms
n
again
included
variable
bias
would
result
if
controls
other
than
legitimate
policing
justification
such
as
the
lagged
crime
rate
measure
were
included
alternatively
a
more
promising
approach
involves
the
use
of
the
stop
level
hit
rate
shr
or
the
ex
ante
probability
of
discovering
contraband
or
a
weapon
based
on
what
an
officer
knows
before
a
stop
n
focusing
on
weapons
related
stops
sharad
goel
and
his
colleagues
first
use
two
years
worth
of
historical
stop
forms
to
calculate
the
actual
probability
of
finding
a
weapon
for
various
combinations
of
factors
listed
on
stop
forms
as
the
basis
of
reasonable
articulable
suspicion
along
with
location
timing
and
local
hit
rate
data
n
this
enables
them
to
calculate
the
distribution
of
ex
ante
probabilities
of
finding
weapons
for
minorities
and
non
minorities
both
in
general
and
holding
location
constant
n
in
effect
by
comparing
the
distribution
of
shrs
for
blacks
and
whites
they
show
that
the
effective
quantum
of
reasonable
articulable
suspicion
for
minorities
is
lower
than
that
for
non
minorities
n
the
same
analysis
might
be
executed
by
precinct
or
by
officer
to
determine
if
racial
disparities
are
either
geographically
concentrated
or
the
work
of
a
small
fraction
of
officers
rather
than
following
goel
s
lead
the
economics
literature

dominated
by
a
model
by
john
knowles
nicola
persico

as
the
kpt

kpt
is
a

of

in
which
police
seek
to
maximize

and
both
black

motorists
maximize
contraband

race
both
they
and
motorists
strategically
anticipate
the
other
s
actions
kpt
predicts
a
nash
equilibrium
in
which
blacks

whites
are
stopped
at
different
rates
while
the
probability
of
finding
contraband
i
e
the
hit
rate
across
groups
is
equal
n
the
force
of
the
kpt
model
is
to
show
how
what
at
first
seems
a
racial
disparity
unequal
stop
rates
is
in
fact
explained
by
dynamic
strategic
action
by
both
police
and
motorists
n
as
a
correlative
differences
in
hit
rates
provide
evidence
of
taste
based
discrimination
for
a
number
of
reasons
though
the
kpt
model
is
not
well
suited
to
identify
the
core
wrong
of
racially
disparate
policing
to
begin
with
kpt
is
informative
only
about
bias
in
searches
not
in
stops
n
it
is
also
a
model
for
detecting
taste
based
discrimination
or
animus
rather
than
the
use
of
race
as
an
accurate
generalization
or
the
disparate
racial
impact
of
another
factor
e
g
socioeconomic
status
n
stated
otherwise
it
ignores
all
negative
externalities
from
race
based
policing
n
even
in
this
more
limited
compass
its
core
equilibrium
concept
rests
on
the
questionable
assumption
that

and
motorists
know
of
and
dynamically
adapt
to
each
other

n
extensions
of
their
work
that

the

show
that

might
also
be
consistent
with

because
the

view

provide

of
whether
there
is
animus
based
searches
in
the
first

conclusion
aggressive
deployment
of
terry
stops
has
been
a
point
of
friction
between
urban
police
and
impoverished
minority
communities
for
more
than
fifty
years
there
has
been
a
moment
of
late
in
which
a
measure
of
reform
appeared
politically
feasible
or
so
the
recent
spate
of
settlements
and
consent
decrees
might
suggest
n
it
may
well
be
that
this
window
is
closing
due
to
national
level
political
changes
but
the
underlying
problems
of
discriminatory
policing
popular
dissatisfaction
with
excessive
and
onerous
street
hassle
and
the
frequency
of
police
violence
will
not
go
away
even
if
the
federal
government
fails
to
act
there
are
local
state
and
private
actors
with
strong
incentives
to
press
for
reform
nevertheless
without
a
clear
account
of
why
and
when
aggressive
deployment
of
terry
stops
can
be
a
moral
wrong
we
will
not
have
a
clear
sense
of
when
or
how
we
might
deploy
law
to
remedy
it
to
this
end
this
article
has
aimed
to
specify
the
distinctive
moral
wrong
of
sqf
and
to
demonstrate
that
the
law
does
have
resources
to
identify
it
my
central
claim
has
been
that
a
disparate
impact
lens
applicable
to
police
pursuant
to
title
vi
and
state
law
provides
a
better
vantage
point
than
black
letter
constitutional
law
by
demonstrating
that
a
disparate
impact
lens
is
constitutional
potent
and
practicable
in
terms
of
its
implementation
i
hope
to
prompt
a
deeper
conversation
about
the
positive
role
that
law
and
courts
can
play
in
resolving
the
aching
sore
that
is
minority
police
relations
in
america
s
cities
today
what
i
have
offered
here
though
is
emphatically
only
the
beginning
of
that
story
the
law
i
have
shown
can
be
used
to
identify
instances
in
which
street
policing
plays
a
role
in
perpetuating
and
deepening
racial
and
social
stratification
once
identified
dysfunctional
policing
must
be
remedied
through
political
pressure
and
legal
injunctions
that
will
vary
from
jurisdiction
to
jurisdiction
n
there
is
no
universal
panacea
police
reform
moreover
is
only
one
element
of
a
larger
necessary
program
of
social
reform
necessary
to
dislodge
the
persistence
of
racialized
concentrated
poverty
police
do
not
create
ghettos
nor
will
getting
policing
right
dissolve
ghettos
overnight
nevertheless
doing
the
hard
work
of
police
reform
is
a
necessary
step
in
rectifying
the
historical
blight
of
entrenched
racial
stratification

techno
pessimists
have
argued
that
artificial
intelligence
ai
technologies
will
eventually
displace
many
jobs
martin
ford
author
of
rise
of
the
robots
technology
and
the
threat
of
a
jobless
future
opined
that
jobs
that
entail
computer
manipulation
of
data
in
routine
and
predictable
ways
are
vulnerable
to
automation
for
example
the
predictive
policing
system
predpol
deployed
by
the
los
angeles
police
department
lapd
reportedly
outperformed
experienced
lapd
analysts
in
forecasting
crime
such
zero
sum
fears
are
not
entirely
unfounded
as
advances
in
machine
learning
suggest
that
ai
can
emulate
and
might
even
surpass
human
abilities
to
manage
the
expected
loss
of
jobs
a
guiding
framework
for
ai
adoption
was
proposed
at
the
world
economic
forum
annual
meeting
in
january
recommending
approaches
to
ensure
that
ai
augments
rather
than
replace
human
workers
in
the
same
vein
the
plausible
impact
of
ai
on
law
enforcement
jobs
should
be
anticipated
the
mission
of
law
enforcement
is
set
to
be
more
challenging
given
the
confluence
of
burgeoning
centrality
of
cities
evolving
transnational
crime
and
security
threats
with
the
use
of
ubiquitous
police
closed
circuit
television
camera
surveillance
to
counter
urban
terrorism
for
example
police
and
homeland
security
functions
are
increasingly
interwoven
and
data
driven
hence
law
enforcement
intelligence
analysts
would
certainly
benefit
from
employing
both
human
and
ai
insights
in
the
analyses
of
a
multitude
of
strategic
and
tactical
threats
ai
technologies
have
been
trailed
in
predictive
policing
and
video
surveillance
and
have
shown
promise
their
strength
is
the
ability
to
expeditiously
process
massive
volumes
of
data
detect
patterns
even
if
complex
and
obscure
and
emulate
the
human
brain
in
learning
from
human
inputs
and
from
trial
and
error
however
ai
s
ability
to
self
learn
raises
the
concern
that
human
analysts
would
eventually
become
obsolete
predpol
for
example
tried
to
assuage
this
concern
by
emphasising
that
its
algorithms
do
not
replace
but
require
analysts
inputs
to
perform
effectively
and
adapt
to
changing
needs
the
current
state
of
ai
is
that
its
learning
capacity
still
needs
to
be
honed
hence
its
reliability
may
not
be
unlimited
it
can
for
example
decipher
many
but
not
all
aspects
of
criminal
human
behaviour
the
misbehaving
chat
bot
tay
that
learned
to
spew
racist
rants
demonstrated
the
potential
risks
of
ai
s
limitations
in
terms
of
possible
unintended
consequences
similarly
an
underperforming
ai
could
potentially
impair
intelligence
analysis
and
drive
miscalculations
in
operational
strategy
and
deployment
with
grave
implications
on
public
security
given
the
fallibility
of
ai
and
that
intelligence
analysis
is
too
critical
a
security
function
to
be
entrusted
totally
to
it
there
should
be
calculated
human
oversight
of
its
use
this
requires
law
enforcement
agencies
to
retain
the
tacit
knowledge
and
experience
of
analysts
according
to
research
cited
in
the
book
critical
knowledge
transfer
by
harvard
business
school
high
level
corporate
executives
remain
doubtful
that
the
deep
knowledge
and
experience
of
human
experts
could
ever
be
fully
codified
into
algorithms
furthermore
society
may
be
ambivalent
about
delegating
machines
with
the
responsibility
to
solve
human
crime
and
security
issues
as
exemplified
by
concerns
over
racial
discrimination
and
false
positives
arising
from
the
reported
use
of
an
ai
technology
beware
by
chicago
police
to
generate
a
hit
list
of
suspects
subject
to
the
nature
of
threat
ai
s
assessments
might
not
be
comprehensive
if
consumed
in
isolation
ai
might
not
provide
all
the
answers
and
analysts
would
find
it
necessary
to
question
its
assessments
in
certain
situations
for
the
purposes
of
corroboration
and
plugging
of
information
gaps
analysts
would
have
to
fuse
ai
s
assessments
with
information
collected
from
other
sources
such
as
human
intelligence
such
information
might
reside
outside
databases
yet
appreciable
as
it
could
relate
to
criminal
motivation
unreported
incidents
and
first
time
offenders
clean
skins
therefore
could
shape
operational
strategies
adversaries
may
seek
to
outsmart
law
enforcement
ai
technologies
to
evade
detection
and
arrest
by
manipulating
the
data
inputs
of
big
data
and
open
source
information
hence
the
analysts
judgement
and
intuition
could
complement
ai
as
bulwarks
against
intelligent
adversaries
analysts
could
be
drivers
rather
than
passengers
of
change
by
being
co
developers
of
ai
technologies
a
study
on
exploring
the
potential
for
using
ai
techniques
in
police
report
analysis
by
the
university
of
gothenburg
sweden
highlighted
the
importance
of
incorporating
analysts
insights
into
the
iterative
process
of
machine
learning
to
improve
ai
s
ability
to
discern
complex
patterns
the
prospects
of
ai
learning
everything
and
replacing
analysts
could
be
managed
with
a
framework
to
redesign
analysts
business
processes
to
focus
on
two
higher
value
work
streams
first
given
the
need
for
human
oversight
analysts
could
double
hat
as
algorithmists
who
are
internal
auditors
tasked
with
promoting
best
practices
in
the
application
of
ai
and
review
its
assessments
to
ensure
standards
and
accuracy
and
second
analysts
could
support
strategy
formulation
through
qualitative
research
into
the
underlying
and
interrelated
factors
of
threats
such
as
cross
border
demographic
economic
and
terrain
issues
which
may
influence
criminal
human
behaviour
the
insights
could
enrich
ai
s
data
driven
assessment
or
develop
directions
for
further
analyses
by
ai
given
finite
resources
analysts
could
support
frontline
policing
by
helping
to
prioritise
threats
flagged
by
ai
these
tasks
would
require
analysts
to
foster
deeper
collaboration
with
field
officers
and
various
stakeholders
within
security
and
non
security
agencies
ultimately
ai
would
inevitably
transform
the
intelligence
analyst
s
profession
in
law
enforcement
just
as
how
the
patrol
car
and
two

radio
revolutionised
policing
in

making

even

they

we
need
to
know
more
because
it

clear
that
such

face
a
fundamental
problem
the
data
they
rely
on
are
collected

system
in
which
race
makes
a
big
difference
in
the

who
behave
identically
inputs
derived
from

will
inevitably
make
black

defendants
look
riskier
than
white
defendants
to
a
computer
as
a
result
data
driven
decision
making
risks
exacerbating
rather
than
eliminating
racial
bias
in
criminal
justice
consider
a
judge
tasked
with
making
a
decision
about
bail
for
two
defendants
one
black
and
one
white
our
two
defendants
have
behaved
in
exactly
the
same
way
prior
to
their
arrest
they
used
drugs
in
the
same
amount
have
committed
the
same
traffic
offenses
owned
similar
homes
and
took
their
two
children
to
the
same
school
every
morning
but
the
criminal
justice
algorithms
do
not
rely
on
all
of
a
defendant
s
prior
actions
to
reach
a
bail
assessment
just
those
actions
for
which
he
or
she
has
been
previously
arrested
and
convicted
because
of
racial
biases
in
arrest
and
conviction
rates
the
black
defendant
is
more
likely
to
have
a
prior
conviction
than
the
white
one
despite
identical
conduct
a
risk
assessment
relying
on
racially
compromised
criminal
history
data
will
unfairly
rate
the
black
defendant
as
riskier
than
the
white
defendant
to
make
matters
worse
risk
assessment
tools
typically
evaluate
their
success
in
predicting
a
defendant
s
dangerousness
on
rearrests
not
on
defendants
overall
behavior
after
release
if
our
two
defendants
return
to
the
same
neighborhood
and
continue
their
identical
lives
the
black
defendant
is
more
likely
to
be
arrested
thus
the
tool
will
falsely
appear
to
predict
dangerousness
effectively
because
the
entire
process
is
circular
racial
disparities
in
arrests
bias
both
the
predictions
and
the
justification
for
those
predictions
we
know
that
a
black
person
and
a
white
person
are
not
equally
likely
to
be
stopped
by
police
evidence
on
new
york
s
stop

frisk
policy
investigatory
stops
vehicle
searches
and
drug
arrests
show
that
black

latino
civilians
are
more
likely
to
be
stopped
searched
and
arrested
than
whites

the
following

making
process
jurisdictions
should
demand
that
any

being
implemented

a
thorough

independent
peer

we
need
more
transparency
and
better
data
to
learn
whether
these
risk
assessments
have
disparate
impacts
on
defendants
of
different
races
foundations
and
organizations
developing
risk

tools
should
be
willing
to
release
the
data
used
to
build

to
evaluate
their
techniques
for
internal
racial
bias
and
problems
of
statistical
interpretation
even
better

could

generated
by

before
the

standard
in

paul
comfort
we
are
proud
to
have
the
fewest
serious

the
numbers
show
that
the

continues
to
be
a
very
safe
transit
system

ride
according
to
colonel
john
e
gavrilis
mta
chief
of
police
the
low
crime
rate
on
the
mta

is
the
result
of
the
hard
work
and
dedication
of
the
men

our
message
is
clear
and
it
is
that
we
will
not
tolerate
criminal
activity

introduction
during
the
presidential
campaign
then
candidate
donald
j
trump
announced
his
intention
to
impose
a
muslim
ban
which
would
prohibit
muslim
entry
into
the
united
states
n
as
part
of
his
counterterrorism
strategy
shortly
before
his
election
trump
also
announced
a
proposal
for
the
extreme
vetting
of
immigrants
and
refugees
n
trump
clarified
that
the
muslim
ban
is
something
that
in
some
form
has
morphed
into
an
extreme
vetting
protocol
from
certain
areas
of
the
world
n
on
january
during
his
first
week
as
president
trump
signed
executive
order
titled
protecting
the
nation
from
foreign
terrorist
entry
into
the
united
states
the
january
order
n
litigation
concerning
the
constitutionality
of
this
executive
order
n
focused
on
sections
and
c
provisions
that
relate
to
barring
the
entry
of
travelers
and
refugees
from
specific
muslim
majority
countries
into
the
united
states
n
these
controversial
provisions
were
challenged
as
violating
equal
protection
due
process
and
the
establishment
clause
of
the
first
amendment
among
other
constitutional
and
statutory
claims
n
on
march
president
trump
issued
a
revised
executive
order
the
march
order
executive
order
issued
under
the
same
title
as
the
january
order
protecting
the
nation
from
foreign
terrorist
entry
into
the
united
states
the
march
order
superseded
the
january
order
n
however
it
left
the
extreme
vetting
provisions
of
the
january
order
in
place
n
and
in
fact
expanded
the
vetting
requirements
in
several
respects
n
the
extreme
vetting
requirements
of
the
march
order
are
now
most
fully
articulated
in
section
titled
implementing
uniform
screening
and
vetting
standards
for
all
immigration
programs
n
the
travel
restrictions
and
the
vetting
requirements
were
expanded
yet
again
in
a
third
iteration
of
the
muslim
ban
also
referred
to
as
the
travel
ban
or
the
entry
ban
on
september
shortly
before
oral
argument
was
scheduled
for
the
u
s
supreme
court
on
october
in
the
consolidated
travel
ban
cases
of
trump
v
hawaii
and
trump
v
international
refugee
assistance
project
n
president
trump
signed
a
new
proclamation
the
september
order
n
the
september
order
is
titled
enhancing
vetting
capabilities
and
processes
for
detecting
attempted
entry
into
the
united
states
by
terrorists
or
other
public
safety
threats
n
thus
the
most
recent
order
as
implied
by
the
title
focuses
more
squarely
on
the
extreme
vetting
provisions
set
forth
by
the
prior
orders
more
specifically
sections
a
through
h
of
the
september
order
focus
on
identity
management
and
information
sharing
capabilities
protocols
and
practices
related
to
immigration
screening
and
vetting
n
the
next
day
the
court
ordered
briefing
as
to
whether
the
travel
ban
cases
that
had
been
scheduled
for
oral
argument
on
october
were
moot
n
at
the
time
of
publication
the
litigation
remains
ongoing
including
challenges
to
the
september
order
n
regardless
of
the
final
disposition
of
these
litigation
matters
it
is
significant
to
note
that
the
extreme
vetting
provisions
of
the
original
and
revised
executive
orders
have
received
less
judicial
attention
than
the
travel
restrictions
n
the
extreme
vetting
provisions
do
not
appear
to
be
dependent
upon
the
authority
of
the
orders
and
are
presented
in
the
orders
as
an
evolving
and
prospective
administrative
matter
n
thus
the
vetting
provisions
of
the
march
order
and
the
september
order
may
not
be
fully
challenged
n
this
article
focuses
on
the
long
term
impact
of
modern
vetting
requirements
such
as
those
prescribed
in
the
executive
orders
referenced
above
n
and
other
immigration
related
screening
protocols
that
are
increasingly
algorithmically
anchored
it
contends
that
the
implementation
of
expanded
vetting
protocols
n
risks
implications
that
may
be
undertheorized
due
to
an
underappreciation
of
the
mass
cybersurveillance
and
disparate
impact
consequences
that
surround
current
screening
measures
broadly
promulgated
by
the
u
s
department
of
homeland
security
dhs
specifically
this
article
advances
the
claim
that
dhs
vetting
and
screening
protocols
risk
introducing
an
algorithmically
driven
and
technologically
enhanced
form
of
jim
crow
n
unlike
the
separate
but
equal
n
de
jure
discrimination
n
of
a
historic
jim
crow
regime
algorithmic
jim
crow
risks
imposing
both
de
jure
and
de
facto
discrimination
n
through
an
equal
but
separate
n
regime
this
article
explains
how
algorithmic
jim
crow
is
an
outgrowth
of
a
digital
era
that
exploits
cybersurveillance
n
and
dataveillance
n
systems
that
are
rapidly
proliferating
in
both
the
public
n
and
private
sectors
n
this
article
demonstrates
how
immigration
related
vetting
and
database
screening
protocols
utilize
newly
developed
big
data
n
screening
tracking
and
profiling
tools
that
attempt
to
verify
identity
and
assess
future
risk
n
these
tools
are
now
actively
deployed
by
dhs
n
and
utilize
databases
operated
by
the
military
n
and
intelligence
communities
n
currently
vetting
and
screening
protocols
often
begin
with
biometric
identification
n
for
example
the
digital
collection
and
screening
of
scanned
fingerprints
through
federal
and
state
biometric
databases
in
the
united
states
and
international
biometric
databases
such
as
those
operated
by
icpo
interpol
interpol
n
biometric
data
currently
collected
by
dhs
include
scanned
fingerprints
n
and
irises
n
digital
photos
for
facial
recognition
technology
n
and
dna
n
consequently
implementation
of
extreme
vetting
protocols
will
likely
include
proposals
for
a
tamper
resistant
and
fraud
proof
biometric
electronic
identity
card
n
such
as
a
biometric
epassport
n
the
trump
administration
s
executive
orders
for
example
specifically
mandate
expedited
completion
of
the
biometric
entry
exit
tracking
system
by
dhs
n
as
part
of
new
vetting
protocols
dhs
also
seeks
social
media
identification
data
n
and
plans
to
seek
social
media
user
credentials
n
such
as
passwords
to
facebook
accounts
of
refugees
and
visa
applicants
n
newly
developed
big
data
cybersurveillance
tools
fuse
biometric
data
with
biographic
data
and
internet
and
social
media
profiling
to
assess
risk
n
this
article
aims
to
explain
how
big
data
vetting
is
mistakenly
presented
as
a
procedure
that
is
restricted
to
noncitizens
immigrants
refugee
and
asylum
applicants
and
visitors
seeking
a
travel
visa
to
the
united
states
instead
such
vetting
is
part
of
a
web
of
technologies
that
dhs
has
termed
identity
management
n
the
application
of
these
technologies
may
eventually
extend
to
the
entire
citizenry
through
a
variety
of
policy
proposals
including
a
biometric
national
identification
system
and
various
mandatory
vetting
and
database
screening
programs
identity
management
programs
attempt
to
authenticate
identity
and
assess
the
risk
factors
across
entire
populations
including
the
u
s
citizenry
big
data
vetting
thus
is
misunderstood
as
a
protocol
that
is
likely
to
be
limited
to
immigration
related
screening
more
accurately
such
vetting
includes
an
evolving
form
of
big
data
surveillance
that
attempts
to
assess
criminal
and
terroristic
risk
across
entire
populations
and
subpopulations
through
mass
data
collection
database
screening
and
data
fusion
artificial
intelligence
and
algorithm
driven
predictive
analytics
n
the
long
term
consequences
of
modern
big
data
surveillance
can
be
better
envisioned
by
anticipating
how
and
why
big
data
vetting
protocols
may
be
extended
to
the
entire
population
eventually
all
residents
of
the
united
states
both
citizens
and
noncitizens
may
face
various
stages
of
technological
vetting
and
algorithmic
screening
as
a
part
of
a
post
september
national
security
policy
trajectory
that
embraces
big
data
surveillance
for
its
presumed
efficacy
importantly
in
parallel
with
the
extreme
vetting
protocols
mandated
by
the
executive
orders
almost
every
immigration
reform
effort
since
has
called
for
biometric
data
collection
from
the
entire
citizenry
in
the
united
states
to
enhance
border
security
efforts
n
at
the
same
time
increasing
concern
regarding
homegrown
terrorism
has
resulted
in
a
call
to
extend
domestic
surveillance
and
counterterrorism
efforts
to
both
citizens
and
noncitizens
n
the
snowden
disclosures
for
example
have
further
revealed
how
foreign
intelligence
gathering
tools
such
as
bulk
metadata
collection
can
be
indiscriminate
in
scope
and
impact
both
citizens
and
noncitizens
n
identifying
the
vetting
procedures
embedded
within
executive
order
and
the
constitutional
challenges
which
followed
its
promulgation
is
particularly
appropriate
as
marks
the
seventy
fifth
anniversary
of
the
signing
of
executive
order
by
president
franklin
delano
roosevelt
n
that
order
issued
on
february
and
titled
authorizing
the
secretary
of
war
to
prescribe
military
areas
allowed
for
japanese
internment
by
delegating
to
the
secretary
of
war
the
authority
to
take
such
other
steps
as
he
may
deem
advisable
to
enforce
compliance
with
the
exclusion
of
japanese
americans
and
those
of
japanese
ancestry
n
the
legal
challenges
mounted
against
executive
order
culminated
in
several
u
s
supreme
court
cases
most
notably
korematsu
v
united
states
n
in
this
case
decided
in
the
court
upheld
the
constitutionality
of
executive
order
reasoning
in
part
we
are
dealing
specifically
with
nothing
but
an
exclusion
order
to
cast
this
case
into
outlines
of
racial
prejudice
without
reference
to
the
real
military
dangers
which
were
presented
merely
confuses
the
issue
n
drawing
comparisons
between
executive
order
and
executive
order
and
reviewing
the
original
justification
for
japanese
internment
is
critical
here
as
president
trump
and
others
have
cited
both
fdr
s
actions
n
and
korematsu
as
precedent
for
the
muslim
ban
and
the
development
of
a
muslim
registry
database
n
this
article
proceeds
in
four
parts
part
i
describes
how
modern
vetting
procedures
are
intertwined
with
burgeoning
identity
management
systems
based
on
a
review
of
publicly
available
information
these
vetting
protocols
are
increasingly
dependent
upon
the
following
mass
biometric
data
collection
automated
or
semiautomated
biometric
identification
and
algorithm
dependent
database
screening
programs
in
a
big
data
world
threat
risk
assessments
and
data
profiling
tools
do
not
necessarily
begin
with
the
identification
of
individuals
on
the
basis
of
traditionally
protected
classifications
such
as
race
ethnicity
or
national
origin
instead
because
contemporary
big
data
systems
are
data
classification
oriented
vetting
and
screening
protocols
begin
with
the
identification
of
individuals
on
the
basis
of
numerical
identification
such
as
passport
numbers
and
on
the
basis
of
biometric
identification
such
as
the
cataloguing
of
scanned
fingerprints
and
irises
part
ii
describes
how
national
security
programs
risk
creating
forms
of
discrimination
similar
to
jim
crow
in
that
they
are
also
based
upon
classification
and
screening
protocols
historic
jim
crow
regimes
started
with
a
legal
premise
that
certain
individuals
could
and
should
be
classified
on
the
basis
of
race
next
jim
crow
laws
utilized
screening
systems
to
enforce
segregation
based
upon
designated
racial
classification
this
discussion
explores
why
security
threat
assessments
produced
through
algorithms
and
database
screening
may
similar
to
historic
jim
crow
also
separate
populations
based
upon
particular
classifications
new
algorithmic
jim
crow
systems
like
historic
jim
crow
regimes
systems
may
present
themselves
as
facially
neutral
part
iii
explains
how
identity
management
systems
do
not
necessarily
discriminate
based
on

these

purport

it

those
seeking
the

of

in

law
have
increasingly
enacted
biometric

and
identity

laws
that
mimic
federal

these

mandate
the
utilization
of

devices
purportedly
to
further
crime
and
immigration

simultaneously
support

just

contemporary

iv
further
explains
how
technological

may
be
insulated

nonracial

risk
based
classifications
and

fall
outside

the

recognized
by

this
type
of
disparate

driven
by
database

and
technologically
enhanced

may
face
limited
or
lenient
review
by
a
federal
judiciary
that
generally
grants
broad
deference
to
the

in

of

and
national

n
thus
the
advent
of
algorithmic
jim

will
require
an
evolution
of

this
article
concludes
that
current
algorithm
driven
vetting
and
biometric
biographic
identification
screening
especially
once
deployed
across
the
entire
citizenry
will
likely
lead
to
discriminatory
profiling
and
surveillance
on
the
basis
of
suspicious
data
as
well
as
classification
based
discrimination
these
vetting
and
screening
systems
are
likely
to
result
in
both
direct
and
disparate
discrimination
particularly
based
on
race
color
ethnicity
national
origin
and
religion
in
addition
recent
immigration
control
policy
and
programs
demonstrate
the
government
s
interest
in
delegating
immigration
vetting
duties
to
private
actors
such
as
employers
and
nonfederal
actors
such
as
state
and
local
law

which
can
exacerbate

i
birth
of
algorithmic
jim
crow
when
president
trump
signed
executive
order
on
january
then
acting
attorney
general
sally
yates
was
taken
by
surprise
n
yates
reviewed
the
order
as
well
as
a
number
of
briefs
by
individuals
who
sought
to
enjoin
the
order
in
federal
court
and
believed
that
it
raised
constitutional
problems
namely
establishment
clause
and
due
process
concerns
n
yates
later
explained
to
the
new
yorker
that
after
reviewing
arguments
for
and
against
the
first
order
she
thought
that
her
two
choices
were
either
to
resign
or
to
refuse
to
defend
the
order
n
after
reviewing
the
evidence
yates
believed
that
the
order
was
ultimately
based
on
religion
and
said
i
thought
back
to
jim
crow
laws
or
literacy
tests
those
didn
t
say
that
the
purpose
was
to
prevent
african
americans
from
voting
but
that
s
what
the
purpose
was
n
yates
drafted
a
letter
to
her
colleagues
at
the
u
s
department
of
justice
in
which
she
stated
at
present
i
am
not
convinced
that
the
defense
of
the
executive
order
is
consistent
with
these
responsibilities
nor
am
i
convinced
that
the
executive
order
is
lawful
n
yates
directed
department
of
justice
attorneys
not
to
defend
the
order
until
she
determined
that
it
was
appropriate
to
act
n
a
few
hours
later
yates
received
a
letter
from
the
white
house
that
informed
her
that
she
had
been
fired
n
yates
s
invocation
of
jim
crow
deserves
notice
the
former
acting
attorney
general
concluded
that
the
executive
order
might
lead
to
a
disparate
impact
on
the
basis
of
protected
classifications
such
as
national
origin
and
religion
at
the
same
time
she
also
recognized
that
the
executive
order
presented
itself
as
facially
neutral
much
like
the
facially
neutral
literacy
tests
promulgated
under
jim
crow
laws
that
disproportionately
burdened
the
voting
rights
of
minority
communities
under
historic
jim
crow
literacy
tests
poll
taxes
and
other
obstacles
to
voting
rights
were
equally
applied
to
all
voters
n
although
these
obstacles
did
not
explicitly
inquire
into
voters
race
they
nonetheless
significantly
disenfranchised
minority
communities
therefore
they
served
discriminatory
ends
even
though
the
race
of
the
voter
was
never
technically
a
basis
for
denying
access
to
the
ballot
n
much
like
literacy
tests
and
poll
taxes
post
security
initiatives
may
disproportionately
impact
minority
communities
even
though
they
do
not
explicitly
effectuate
decisions
based
on
protected
attributes
an
inquiry
into
modern
day
screening
and
vetting
systems
depends
upon
in
an
understanding
of
myriad
post
national
security
programs
and
policy
initiatives
contemporary
screening
and
vetting
systems
utilize
algorithms
to
determine
a
wide
range
of
questions
including
identity
and
associational
assessments
to
gauge
risk
for
example
extreme
vetting
systems
like
the
one
promulgated
by
the
executive
orders
may
bring
about
disproportionate
burdens
on
minority
communities
potential
discrimination
facilitated
or
exacerbated
by
technological
means
appearing
to
be
facially
neutral
may
evade
legal
challenge
requiring
careful
inquiry
because
big
data
screening
and
tracking
systems
unfold
in
ways
that
are
difficult
to
see
for
example
through
algorithm
driven
determinations
internet
based
database
screening
programs
and
social
media
monitoring
it
is
critical
to
explore
how
modern
vetting
protocols
may
be
linked
to
preexisting
post
identity
management
systems
that
are
dependent
upon
cybersurveillance
and
dataveillance
tools
to
grasp
how
extreme
vetting
can
be
extended
to
the
entire
citizenry
it
is
helpful
to
compare
no
fly
database
screening
systems
with
potential
extreme
vetting
database
screening
systems
for
example
based
on
what
is
known
of
both
programs
it
appears
that
many
of
the
database
screening
protocols
overlap
n
part
i
therefore
explains
how
vetting
systems
will
increasingly
rely
upon
database
screening
including
universal
biometric
databases
to
sweep
entire
populations
and
subsets
within
populations
to
assess
terroristic
and
criminal
risk
to
better
understand
the
trump
administration
s
policy
on
extreme
vetting
it
is
important
to
reconstruct
the
justification
for
such
a
policy
based
upon
historical
background
and
prior
policy
developments
implemented
during
the
obama
administration
many
of
the
policies
advanced
by
the

are
not
only
an
outgrowth
of

they
are
specifically
reactive
to
the
paris

the
san

called
for
what
has
been
referred
to
as
a

travel
ban
an
executive
action
that
would
prohibit

trump
did
not
provide
specifics
on
how
he
would
prohibit
muslims
from
entering
the

however
he
later
clarified
that
the
ban
would
be
temporary
to
allow
the

to
assess
its
current
immigration
procedures
and
suspend
immigration
from
regions
linked

n
trump

call
for

six

explained

explained
in

classification
and
screening
systems
artificial
intelligence
and

are
not
usually
perceived
as
resulting
in
discrimination
in
fact
they
may
appear
to
be
equality
compliant
or
even
equality
enhancing
in
that
algorithmic
screening
and

can
be
applied
equally
across
entire
populations
and
subpopulations
screening
and
classification
systems
however
even
when
facially
neutral
and
algorithmically
based
can
lead
to
profound
constitutional
challenges
the
historical
framing
in
this
section
is
necessary
to
assist
in
the
interrogation
of
new
classification
and
screening
systems
that
are
flourishing
under
security
rationales
and
presented
as
technologically
objective
and
colorblind
therefore
to
better
grasp
why
the
framing
of
algorithmic
jim
crow
is
now
needed
part
ii
lays
a
factual
predicate
to
explain
the
foundational
legal
premises
for
historic
jim
crow
regimes
traditional
jim
crow
laws
first
required
the
government
often
state
and
county
governments
to
engage
in
formal
and
standardized
protocols
to
assign
racial
classification
to
citizens
of
that
state
or
county
once
a
racial
classification
system
was
determined
under
the
law
screening
protocols
also
established
under
jim
crow
laws
enabled
the
separation
of
populations
on
the
basis
of
that
racial
classification
consequently
understanding
the
basic
mechanics
of
how
separation
was
enforced
under
the
law
begins
with
an
understanding
of
historic
jim
crow
classification
and
screening
systems
a
historical
framing
of
jim
crow
this

is
not
intended

of
the
legal
issues
and
the
nature
of
jim
crow
other
scholarship
has
addressed
that
subject
in
thoughtful
detail
n
instead
this
background
intends
to
sketch
out
an
understanding
of
the
scope
and
context
of
the
jim
crow
era
and
to
further
clarify
that
its
laws
and
policies
were
not
confined
merely
to
segregating
locational
sites
and
imposing
restrictions
on
movement
rather
jim
crow
was
a
structure
of
exclusion
and
discrimination
devised
by
white
americans
to
be
employed
principally
against
black
americans
its
central
purpose
was
to
maintain
a
second
class
social
and
economic
status
for
blacks
while
upholding
a
first
class
social
and
economic
status
for
whites
in
the
south
jim
crow
discrimination
at
its
height
existed
not
only
by
statute
but
by
custom
and
racial
etiquette
and
it
was
rigidly
enforced
by
both
the
law
enforcement
agencies
and
courts
as
well
as
by
ordinary
white
citizens
who
were
neither
policemen
nor
judges
but
who
often
took
the
law
into
their
own
hands
as
though
they
were
n
one
scholar
explains
that
jim
crow
is
a
term
for
a
series
of
laws
and
ordinances
passed
by
southern
states
and
municipalities
between
and
legalizing
segregation
the
physical
separation
of
individuals
based
on
race
gender
religion
or
class
within
their
boundaries
n
although
racial
discrimination
was
not
a
solely
southern
practice
african
americans
in
northern
states
experienced
discrimination
in
housing
education
employment
and
economic
settings
n
in
the
south
racial
restrictions
were
omnipresent
and
ingrained
in
southern
life
n
one
historian
argues
that
jim
crow
was
a
southern
phenomenon
the
infrastructure
white
southerners
built
to
preserve
insofar
as
humanly
possible
the
old
master
slave
system
n
jim
crow
penetrated
every
facet
of
life
for
southern
african
americans
it
was
an
integral
part
of
the
social
political
and
legal
fabric
of
southern
society
n
jim
crow
established
restrictions
on
marriage
n
voting
n
education
n
employment
n
housing
n
travel
n
and
enforced
segregation
in
public
spaces
n
some
of
these
restrictions
were
codified
in
law
and
others
were
ingrained
as
a
matter
of
social
behavior
and
custom
n
jim
crow
stood
for
an
entire
culture
based
on
violence
racism
and
fear
that
affected
the
life
of
every
african
american
living
in
the
south
n
despite
the
passage
of
the
thirteenth
fourteenth
and
fifteenth
amendments
supreme
court
precedent
in
the
wake
of
those
amendments
upheld
laws
that
enforced
racial
inequality
through
segregation
laws
or
laws
that
created
a
disproportionately
discriminatory
impact
on
african
americans
n
racial
classification
was
an
integral
part
of
jim
crow
n
the
majority
of
the
southern
states
legalized
racial
classification
by
codifying
the
one
drop
rule
or
enshrining
it
as
part
of
their
state
constitutions
any
modicum
of
black
ancestry
meant
that
the
individual
in
question
was
not
white
and
thus
subject
to
jim
crow
laws
n
definitions
of
race
were
also
included
in
antimiscegenation
laws
which
prohibited
interracial
marriage
n
virginia
for
example
adopted
a
law
that
required
racial
descriptions
to
be
recorded
at
a
child
s
birth
to
further
classify
individuals
as
white
or
colored
n
virginia
s
racial
integrity
act
of
n
required
all
citizens
within
the
state
born
after
june
to
register
their
racial
composition
with
the
bureau
of
vital
statistics
n
prohibited
interracial
marriages
and
defined
who
exactly
qualified
as
white
n
a
copy
of
an
old
birth
record
form
provided
by
the
library
of
virginia
describes
the
definition
of
white
under
virginia
law
a
white
person
is
one
with
no
trace
whatever
of
blood
of
another
race
except
that
one
with
one
sixteenth
of
the
blood
of
american
indian
unmixed
with
other
race
may
be
classed
as
white
n
thus
the
jim
crow
system
depended
on
initial
classification
and
markers
of
racial
identity
to
determine
who
would
be
subjected
to
laws
that
designated
individual
treatment
rights
and
privileges
based
on
those
classifications
n
b
classification
and
screening
classification
of
identity
such
as
the
race
based
types
that
occurred
during
the
jim
crow
era
is
an
essential
step
in
establishing
exclusionary
systems
n
exclusion
involves
separating
out
individuals
from
a
group
or
one
group
from
another
category
it
is
not
possible
to
exclude
a
group
from
a
system
of
rights
and
privileges
without
first
determining
criteria
for
exclusion
n
therefore
classification
is
necessary
for
these
systems
operation
n
during
the
jim
crow
era
these
classifications
took
the
form
of
one
drop
laws
or
legal
decisions
that
identified
who
was
colored
and
who
was
not
n
other
exclusionary
systems
have
engaged
in
similar
forms
of
classification
for
example
apartheid
in
south
africa
relied
on
national
identity
cards
that
identified
individuals
by
racial
groups
n
during
the
belgian
colonial
period
in
rwanda
officials
mandated
hutu
and
tutsi
markers
on
identity
cards
in
a
system
that
privileged
tutsi
individuals
and
ultimately
laid
the
groundwork
for
the
genocide
n
in
nazi
germany
the
nuremburg
laws
determined
who
was
jewish
and
thus
subject
to
exclusion
discrimination
and
persecution
n
classification
alone
however
is
not
sufficient
to
operate
an
exclusionary
system
implementing
such
a
system
requires
screening
determining
whether
individuals
who
have
been
classified
are
complying
with
the
rules
that
accompany
such
classification
or
whether
the
individuals
are
somehow
suspect
under
jim
crow
for
example
screening
was
both
official
such
as
official
segregation
policy
enforcement
and
unofficial
as
a
part
of
social
and
behavioral
norms
n
jim
crow
era
screening
was
a
small
data
world
screening
system
relying
first
on
classification
on
paper
documents
such
as
birth
certificates
or
identity
cards
or
an
examination
of
physical
appearance
n
followed
by
screening
to
ensure
that
the
excluded
individuals
complied
with
the
systems
of
classification
n
in
a
big
data
world
systems
of
screening
such
as
the
extreme
vetting
requirements
of
trump
s
executive
orders
are
capable
of
surveilling
vast
numbers
of
individuals
based
on
data
or
other
broad
categories
and
then
subsequently
classifying
them
based
on
status
n
essentially
screening
is
now
theoretically
equal
and
the
classification
system
is
separate
failing
to
examine
the
underlying
bases
of
classification
and
screening
systems
indicates
an
inherent
level
of
trust
in
government
systems
that
ultimately
may
lead
to
harmful
consequences
n
screening
in
a
big
data
world
serves
as
a
form
of
technological
interrogation
and
entrenches
surveillance
as
a
norm
n
mass
screenings
of
citizens
in
collect
it
all
systems
embed
the
structure
of
policing
into
the
state
in
much
the
same
way
that
jim
crow
embedded
racial
classifications
and
screenings
of
individuals
based
on
race
or
perceived
race
n
big
data
systems
seek
suspicious
data
as
a
means
of
identifying
and
classifying
suspicious
persons
n
broad
population
based
screening
and
mass
surveillance
promote
fundamentally
undemocratic
surveillance
norms
n
as
justice
sotomayor
explained
in
her
dissenting
opinion
in
utah
v
strieff
n
random
suspicionless
identity
verifications
by
law
enforcement
on
the
street
are
inherently
undemocratic
this
case
tells
everyone
white
and
black
guilty
and
innocent
that
an
officer
can
verify
your
legal
status
at
any
time
it
says
that
your
body
is
subject
to
invasion
while
courts
excuse
the
violation
of
your
rights
it
implies
that
you
are
not
a
citizen
of
a
democracy
but
the
subject
of
a
carceral
state
just
waiting
to
be
cataloged
n
further
some
screening
protocols
may
rely
on
rationales
that
are
facially
neutral
but
ultimately
based
on
impermissible
classifications
in
his
concurring
opinion
in
international
refugee
assistance
project
v
trump
n
judge
james
wynn
pointed
out
that
discrimination
even
when
shrouded
in
layers
of
legality
is
no
less
an
insult
to
our
constitution
than
naked
invidious
discrimination
n
judge
wynn
cited
dred
scott
v
sandford
n
and
korematsu
v
united
states
n
as
examples
of
judicial
failures
in
response
to
exclusionary
and
discriminatory
systems
cloaked
in
legality
n
in
the
majority
opinion
the
fourth
circuit
concluded
that
the
plaintiffs
had
sufficiently
alleged
that
nationality
served
as
a
proxy
for
religious
discrimination
n
and
was
a
crude
and
ineffective
measure
for
determining
whether
a
threat
existed
n
indeed
in
her
decision
to
refuse
to
defend
the
first
executive
order
then
acting
attorney
general
sally
yates
considered
that
it
bore
a
resemblance
to
jim
crow
laws
n
thus
systems
of
subordination
such
as
jim
crow
and
apartheid
depend
on
classifying
who
is
privileged
and
who
is
not
as
discussed
above
once
a
classification
is
emplaced
laws
can
require
separation
subordination
and
screening
on
the
basis
of
that
classification
jim
crow
regimes
used
race
based
classifications
to
engage
in
a
broad
range
of
economic
social
and
political
exclusions
under
the
law
n
the
act
of
excluding
or
disenfranchising
on
the
basis
of
race
often
required
legally
mandated
screening
processes
n
as
well
as
screening
through
social
norms
and
behavior
control
n
these
screening
processes
would
often
require
governments
or
their
private
delegates
to
screen
individuals
on
the
basis
of
race
and
any
failure
to
do
so
would
often
carry
legal
consequences
as
well
as
social
penalties
such
as
ostracization
n
c
cyberarchitecture
of
algorithmic
jim
crow
perhaps
the
easiest
way
to
understand
how
the
jim
crow
regime
is
being
replicated
in
a
big
data
world
through
algorithmic
jim
crow
is
to
consider
the
following
scenario
imagine
substituting
race
based
classifications
with
classifications
of
digitally
derived
suspiciousness
rather
than
relying
upon
a
targeted
class
such
as
race
national
origin
gender
or
religion
as
a
sole
basis
for
exclusion
big
data
allows
for
exclusion
to
be
based
on
an
abstraction
such
as
digitally
inferred
or
algorithmically
anchored
guilt
or
suspicion
n
in
addition
big
data
can
aggregate
protected
classifications
with
other
collected
data
n
for
example
biometric
screening
that
uses
soft
biometric
indicators
such
as
digital
assessments
of
skin
color
and
estimated
age
extracted
from
a
digital
photo
can
combine
race
data
proxies
with
other
proxy
variables
to
predict
criminal
or
terroristic
behavior
e
g
aggregating
passport
number
and
digital
photo
with
data
analysis
of
web
browsing
activity
and
social
media
presence
n
in
addition
there
are
multiple
components
to
extreme
vetting
including
but
not
limited
to
biometric
identification
n
record
linkage
n
information
extraction
n
and
predictive
analytics
n
in
some
circumstances
these
technologies
allow
for
classification
and
then
screening
in
other
circumstances
these
technologies
allow
for
just
the
opposite
screening
then
classification
what
is
difficult
to
understand
is
how
machine
learning
and
artificial
intelligence
can
replace
human
judgment
in
the
classification
and
screening
processes
of
algorithmic
jim
crow
regimes
in
a
small
data
world
jim
crow
required
a
human
to
physically
inspect
the
skin
color
of
an
individual
to
determine
the
race
of
that
individual
e
g
a
physician
attesting
to
the
race
of
an
individual
on
a
birth
certificate
n
in
the
small
data
world
screening
processes
also
required
human
judgment
e
g
a
county
clerk
inspecting
birth
certificates
before
issuing
marriage
licenses
and
marriage
certificates
to
determine
compliance
with
antimiscegenation
laws
n
in
contrast
human
involvement
is
not
required
to
classify
individuals
in
a
big
data
world
an
individual
can
be
classified
as
a
potential
criminal
terrorist
or
threat
risk
based
on
digital
data
alone
and
digitized
analysis
such
as
algorithmic
screening
algorithmic
tools
can
analyze
data
to
establish
identity
e
g
a
record
locator
matching
algorithm
such
as
database
screening
systems
that
match
names
with
passport
numbers
and
other
databases
of
personally
identifiable
information
and
screen
for
suspicious
digital
profiles
e
g
combine
passport
information
with
stored
data
and
real
time
data
n
stored
data
might
include
bulk
telephony
metadata
n
databases
that
collect
time
duration
and
geolocation
of
calls
and
other
government
records
and
private
data
such
as
consumer
activities
n
real
time
analytics
can
include
situational
awareness
systems
that
attempt
to
analyze
real
time
video
surveillance
feeds
that
connect
the
monitored
individual
through
facial
recognition
technology
to
that
individual
s
social
media
n
hence
the
nature
of
classification
and
screening
capacities
are
radically
different
in
a
big
data
world
classification
therefore
can
be
based
in
part
or
in
whole
on
artificial
intelligence
similarly
screening
in
a
big
data
world
does
not
rely
on
human
processes
the
no
fly
list
for
example
can
be
generated
through
database
screening
and
digital
watchlisting
systems
rather
than
human
nomination
n
thus
in
a
big
data
world
classification
and
screening
protocols
can
be
combined
digitized
and
automated
as
a
result
these
big
data
classification
and
screening
systems
may
be
nearly
impossible
for
a
citizen
to
interrogate
or
challenge
n
what
is
similar
between
big
data
and
small
data
exclusionary
regimes
is
that
separation
and
segregation
is
at
the
heart
of
the
processes
what
appears
to
be
at
the
earliest
stages
of
the
big
data
governance
phenomenon
purely
national
security
motivated
protocols
such
as
the
no
fly
list
might
not
appear
to
be
a
part
of
a
larger
segregationist
regime
at
the
earliest
stages
of
jim
crow
separation
of
the
races
was
deemed
necessary
by
the
court
in
plessy
v
ferguson
n
under
security
rationales
to
avoid
race
based
conflict
n
at
the
earliest
stages
of
algorithmic
jim
crow
isolating
individuals
based
on
data
suspicions
is
also
justified
under
security
rationales
to
prevent
terrorism
unlike
historic
jim
crow
established
to
continue
a
racial
hierarchy
first
instituted
through
slavery
big
data
regimes
do
not
overtly
seek
to
create
subordinate
social
classes
but
that
may
well
be
the
result
like
under
historic
jim
crow
regimes
security
needs
are
professed
as
justification
even
if
we
are
not
yet
faced
with
a
mature
algorithmic
jim
crow
regime
it
is
important
to
recognize
that
jim
crow
laws
took
decades
to
develop
into
a
pervasive
legal
system
n
with
the
benefit
of
hindsight
we
now
examine
the
full
arc
of
jim
crow
including
the
opportunity
to
revisit
the
legal
precedent
that
allowed
for
segregation
to
take
root
and
become
normalized
n
jim
crow
did
not
commence
with
the
segregation
of
every
water
fountain
swimming
pool
bus
train
movie
theater
hotel
or
restaurant
n
jim
crow
did
however
eventually
convert
nearly
every
citizen
into
a
race
classification
expert
and
screening
specialist
to
comply
with
the
laws
n
jim
crow
laws
imposed
a
duty
under
law
or
social
norms
upon
many
entities
public
private
and
individual
citizens
to
classify
and
screen
n
how
will
classification
and
screening
under
algorithmic
jim
crow
like
historic
jim
crow
require
classification

requirements

the

how
will

impose

citizens
to
classify

screen
jim
crow
laws
mandated
paper
based
classifications
such
as
attestation
to
racial
classifications
on
birth
certificates
n
big
data
technologies
however
do
not
require
discrete
screening
or
classification
procedures
because
of
the
nature
of
modern
data
tools
instead
of
separate
processes
that
treat
screening
and
classification
as
separate
big
data
tools
have
the
capacity
to
execute
both
simultaneously
in
a
small
data
world
linearity
was
more
common
between
classification
and
screening
the
former
had
to
follow
the
latter
as
a
matter
of
logic
without
racial
classification
racial
screening
would
not
have
been
possible
once
an
individual
had
been
classified
as
white
privileges
under
jim
crow
logically
followed
that
racial
status
with
big
data
assessments
can
be
made
concurrently
and
thus
consecutive
processes
are
not
necessary
but
may
occur
under
big
data
theories
of
identity
management
an
aggregation
of
data
can
for
instance
map
identity
such
as
classification
of
potential
terrorist
status
in
addition
the
same
vetting
and
screening
protocols
facilitate
determinations
as
to
access
e
g
whether
an

can
board
a

or
enter
the

it
is
the
accumulation
and
analysis
of
the
ever
growing
aggregation
of

that
makes
possible
the

algorithmic
decision
making

is
at
the
core
of
the
extreme

enterprise
new
classification
and
screening
technologies
thus
eliminate
or
reduce
the
need
to
conduct
human
based
screening
historic
jim
crow
laws
required
bus
drivers
to
segregate
passengers
on
the
basis
of
race
a
screening
protocol
that
required
human
judgment
and
human
action
n
contemporary
systems
may
use
a
combination
of
automated
screening
and
human
screening
such
as
tsa
screeners
relying
upon
the
predictive
analytic
systems
of
the

algorithmic
jim
crow
may
also
facilitate
fully
automated

digitized

n
under
contemporary
forms
of
big

governance
classification
will
likely
comprise
a
combination
of
traditional
characteristics
such
as

recognized
protected

deemed
suspicious
unstable

anomalous
digital

screening

algorithmically
derived

that
allow
for
inferences
of
guilt
but
instead
of
impermissibly
distributing
or
withholding
privileges
based
on
protected
classifications
big
data
will
simply
incorporate
them
as
part
of
a
risk
assessment
such
threat
risk
assessments
will
attempt
to
predict
criminal
or
terroristic
predisposition
n
unlike
historic
jim
crow
algorithmic
jim
crow
may
not
require
classification
in
order
to
conduct
screening
because
of
the
vast
amounts
of
digital
data
that
can
be
analyzed
for
both
classification
and
screening
purposes
data
will
at
times
be
collected
and
sorted
for
classification
to
screen
n
at
other
times
data

be

explores
how
modern

protocol
is
properly
understood
as
part
of
a
web
of
identity
management
technologies
that
may
extend
to
the
entire
citizenry
for
example
although
extreme

is
presented
as
a
procedure
that
is
restricted
to
refugees
immigrants
and
foreign
visitors
seeking
a
travel
visa
to
the
united

this
characterization
is
misleading
extreme
vetting
is
better
grasped
as
a
function
of
database
screening
and
digital
watchlisting
systems
that
can
be
applied
equally
to

algorithmic
jim

citizens
and
noncitizens
alike
can
now
be
subjected
to
mass
data
collection
and
automated

semiautomated
database
screening
protocols
n
increasingly
in
the
name
of
national
and
homeland
security
post
big
data
programs
implemented
by
the
government
allow
for
core
rights
and
freedoms
to
be
partially
obstructed
in
some
instances
or
altogether
blocked
in
others
n
moreover
because
of
the
virtual
nature
of
mass
data
collection
and
database
screening
and
the
classified
nature
of
certain
programs
the
digital
mediation
and
potential
interference
of
liberty
interests
can
occur
without
our
knowledge
or
consent
n
as
the
national
population
is
increasingly
represented
in
the
growing
databases
and
becomes
subject
to
potential
across
the
board
vetting
and
screening
claims
of
equal
protection
violations
may
collapse
this
likelihood
increases
as
defenders
of
database
screening
argue
such
screening
minimizes
the
role
of
the
human
element
and
thus
minimizes
the
risk
of
racial
profiling
on
a
theoretical
level
because
the
algorithms
of
any
given
big
data
vetting
or
database
screening
system
will
not
be
transparent
to
those
subject
to
screening
the
denial
of
a
benefit
or
privilege
or
consequences
such
as
detainment
and
deportation
will
be
without
apparent
cause
beyond
the
fact
that
the
database
has
determined
that
they
should
be
targeted

thus
algorithmic
jim

demonstrates
how
jim
crow
regimes
can
adapt

evolve
through

in
michelle
alexander
s
seminal
work
the
new
jim

mass

the
story
of

has
transformed
from

disenfranchisement
regimes
in

into

alexander
posits

be
evaluated
as
a
constantly
evolving
process

of
jim

requires
observing
innovations
in

and
policy
that
result
in
the
entrenchment
of
inequities
on
the
basis
of
race
and
other
sites

historic
discrimination
n
as
such
alexander
warns
that
vigilance
is
needed
to
bear
witness
to
an
evolutionary
process
of
law
and
policy
that
can
lead
to
new
caste
systems
n
this
is
especially
true
in
a
modern
era
that
may
present
the
mechanism
for
the
caste
as
colorblind
n
and
involve
data
tracking
and
digital
sorting
methods
that
may
present
a
virtual
cage
problem
n
taking
a
cue
from
alexander
to
refuse
to
limit
jim
crow
to
regimes
designed
to
subordinate
a
single
race
or
class
of
individuals
we
may
see
the
newest
emergence
of
jim
crow
in
mass
surveillance
and
algorithm
driven
decision
making
database
screening
and
digital
watchlisting
systems
in
fact
can
serve
as
complementary
and
facially
colorblind
supplements
to
mass
incarceration
systems
n
the
purported
colorblindness
of
mandatory
sentencing
and
mass
incarceration
systems
for
instance
parallels
the
purported
colorblindness
of
mandatory
database
screening
and
vetting
systems
as
reva
siegel
has
theorized
anticlassification
jurisprudence
cannot
achieve
the
same
aims
as
antisubordination
or
antibalkinization
jurisprudence
n
in
contemporary
equality
cases
considered
before
the
supreme
court
siegel
observes
the
justices
who
vote
against
affirmative
action
and
other
race
conscious
civil
rights
policies
are
said
to
reason
from
a
colorblind
anticlassification
principle
premised
on
the
belief
that
the
constitution
protects
individuals
not
groups
and
so
bars
all
racial
classifications
except
as
a
remedy
for
specific
wrongdoing
n
this
judicial
predisposition
to
overturn
programs
that
redress
wrongs
for
suspect
classifications
even
when
the
clear
purpose
of
such
programs
is
to
assist
those
historically
harmed
by
such
classifications
means
that
vetting
and
screening
protocols
that
do
not
overtly
target
such
suspect
classifications
will
not
present
an
equal
protection
problem
in
other
words
if
the
anticlassification
principle
continues
to
dominate
equal
protection
jurisprudence
race
neutral
and
equally
applied
database
screening
and
digital
watchlisting
systems
will
not
appear
to
be
inconsistent
with
the
anticlassification
premise
of
equality
law
therefore
such
programs
may
pass
equal
protection
muster
even
if
they
impose
disparate
consequences
n
similarly
jack
balkin
provocatively
asserts
that
the
law
of
equality
is
often
in
fact
the
law
of
inequality
n
balkin
argues
that
historically
and
paradoxically
the
law
of
equality
has
been
adaptive
to
enforce
inequality
n
balkin
explains
that
the
supreme
court
in
plessy
v
ferguson
acknowledged
that
a
multitude
of
social
and
economic
inequities
arise
on
the
basis
of
race
n
nonetheless
plessy
ratified
racial
segregation
after
finding
no
equal
protection
defect
with
jim
crow
institutions
n
the
court
concluded
that
the
separate
but
equal
principle
upheld
the
equality
guarantees
required
under
the
equal
protection
clause
so
long
as
the
government
provided
a
form
of
theoretical
equality
on
the
back
end
of
segregation
n
according
to
plessy
the
separation
of
the
races
on
the
front
end
of
state
laws
did
not
create
a
violation
of
the
equal
protection
clause
because
the
discrimination
could
be
redressed
on
the
back
end
n
the
plessy
court
further
concluded
that
racial
separation
on
the
front
end
could
serve
important
law
and
order
goals
such
as
increasing
a
state
s
interest
in
ensuring
safety
and
social
order
among
the
different
races
n
this
legal
reasoning
is
now
widely
discredited
and
as
noted
the
court
now
has
an
antidiscrimination
approach
that
strictly
scrutinizes
laws
that
operate
along
such
suspect
classifications
n
nevertheless
that
approach
too
is
viewed
as
inadequate
by
constitutional
law
experts
and
as
hindering
efforts
to
address
unequal
realities
in
contrast
to
the
theoretical
equality
guarantees
assured
on
the
back
end
of
sorting
methods
instituted
under
historic
jim
crow
regimes
at
the
dawn
of
the
big
data
revolution
we
may
be
witnessing
more
and
more
legal
contexts
in
which
all
are
equally
subject
to
digitalized
vetting
and
database
screening
protocols
but
with
results
on
the
back
end
that
raise
equal
protection
concerns
equality
law
that
demands
that
the
government
provide
equal
treatment
under
the
law
on
a
theoretical
level
on
the
front
end
therefore
prohibits
traditional
jim
crow
institutions
but
siegel
balkin
and
others
caution
that
equality
law
cannot
stop
at
a
judicial
inquiry
that
ensures
colorblindness
on
the
front
end
since
that
risks
turning
a
blind
eye
to
the
disparate
impacts
that
can
result
on
the
back
end
n
as
the
government
continues
to
acquire
more
big
data
tools
to
serve
governance
goals
such
as
database
screening
systems
and
predictive
analytics
that
assess
risk
equality
law
may
find
no
constitutional
problem
with
replication
in
reverse
form
of
the
social
inequality
permitted
under
the
separate
but
equal
principle
under
an
emerging
technologically
enhanced
jim
crow
regime
mass
surveillance
and
semiautomated
or
automated
algorithmic
sorting
methods
will
appear
to
be
equally
applied
across
entire
populations
the
colorblind
and
anticlassification
premises
of
vetting
and
screening
systems
will
comport
with
an
equal
but
separate
principle
these
systems
however
will
potentially
offer
only
theoretical
equality
on
the
front
end
of
newly
emerging
data
surveillance
and
data
sorting
methods
meanwhile
any
disparate
impacts
on
the
back
end
will
be
hard
to
challenge
judicially
because
algorithmic
decision
making
can
occur
in
ways
that
are
difficult
to
document
the
evolution
of
constitutional
protections
is
thus
critically
necessary
in
what
balkin
and
sanford
levinson
term
the
national
surveillance
state

in
the
national
surveillance
state
the
integration
of
bureaucratized
and
normalized
data
collection
and
information
society
surveillance
technologies
into
day
to
day
governance
should
be
understood
as
a
distinctive
concern
of
american
constitutionalism
one
of
the
most
important
developments
in
american
constitutionalism
is
the
gradual
transformation
of
the
united
states
into
a
national
surveillance
state
n
constitutional
protections
that
once
were
taken
for
granted
in
a
small
data
world
have
proven
robust
in
theory
but
lacking
in
practical
application
n
often
it
is
not
so
much
that
our
physical
personhood
is
threatened
in
the
national
surveillance
state
but
as
daniel
solove
describes
it
it
is
our
digital
person
that
has
been
placed
at
risk
n
the
shift
to
the
national
surveillance
state
and
big
data
governance
should
be
understood
as
paradigmatic
big
data
and
algorithmic
intelligence
technologies
are
disruptive
and
transformative
in
nature
n
defined
by
their
predictive
and
correlative
capacities
big
data
technologies
are
capable
of
facilitating
a
new
type
of
knowledge
that
some
argue
is
akin
to
virtual
reality
e
g
probabilistic
or
algorithmic
holograms
n
thus
big
data
surveillance
that
transforms
into
normalized
day
to
day
governance
practices
often
poses
harms
that
are
more
virtual
than
physical
for
instance
digitally
derived
suspicion
harms
rather
than
detention
harms
n
as
a
result
big
data
driven
predictive
policing
methods
are
void
of
reasonable
suspicion
as
once
defined
in
a
small
data
world
n
for
example
while
in
a
small
data
world
reasonable
suspicion
is
based
on
specific
facts
or
inferences
regarding
a
specific
individual
s
involvement
in
criminal
activity
in
a
big
data
world
on
the
other
hand
targeting
of
suspects
can
proceed
based
on
data
that
is
associated
with
them
as
collected
in
a
database
and
that
fit
particular
profiles
targeted
by
database
searches
small
data
discrimination
consequently
can
evolve
into
a
form
of
big
data
discrimination
in
a
myriad
of
ways
for
example
statistical
guilt
or
correlative
evidence
that
support
inferences
of

can
be
assigned
through

part
examines
the

the
birth
of

purportedly

de
facto
discrimination
for

has
been
alleged
in
the
disparate
impact
of
the
no
fly
list
a
system
that
has
been
referred
to
as
a
flying
while
muslim
program
n
although
discrimination
may
not
occur
on
the
front
end
of
the
vetting
and
screening
process
of
the
no
fly
list
plaintiffs
challenging
the
no
fly
list
allege
that
the
program
results
in
disparate
consequences
that
disproportionately
impact
those
populations
associated
with
terrorism
such
as
military
age
muslim
males
n
or
muslims
who
may
be
swept
into
the
no

database
screening
systems
by
virtue
of
intensified
surveillance
of
muslim
communities
by
the
intelligence
community
n
examining
the
no
fly
list
litigation
shows
that
in
the
absence
of
discrimination
in
front
end
enforcement
techniques
back
end
discrimination
can
emerge
from
the
supposedly
neutral
analytics
of
the
digital
watchlisting
and
database
screening
system
itself
the
no
fly
list
as
well
as
other
vetting
and
screening
systems
have
already
faced
multiple
legal
challenges
federal
courts
have
been
asked
to
address
the
new
types
of
harms
presented
by
digital
watchlisting
and
database
screening
in
the
national
surveillance
state
n
of
the
challenges
to
multiple
identity
management
technologies
that
have
reached
the
supreme
court
none
have
allowed
for
an
equal
protection
claim
as
cass
sunstein
explains
the
equal
protection
clause
is
directed
at
the
legality
of
classifications
when
a
classification
is
challenged
the
first
question
is
whether
it
is
drawn
on
the
basis
of
race
or
some
other
characteristic
thought
to
call
for
heightened
scrutiny
n
if
there
is
an
impermissible
classification
that
statute
must
survive
the
appropriate
level
of
scrutiny
if
there
is
no
classification
sunstein
explains
the
inquiry
proceeds
to
a
second
question
was
the
classification
motivated
by
an
intention
to
treat
some
class
differently
on
the
basis
of
race
or
again
any
other
characteristic
said
to
call
for
heightened
scrutiny
if
the
answer
is
affirmative
heightened
scrutiny
must
be
applied
if
negative
the
statute
must
be
upheld
unless
it
is
not
rationally
related
to
a
legitimate
state
interest
n
under
the
vetting
and
screening
protocols
of
the
no
fly
list
there
is
no
classification
or
characteristic
that
warrants
heightened
scrutiny
further
thus
far
there
is
no
evidence
that
the
vetting
and
database
screening
protocol
is
motivated
by
an
intention
to
discriminate
on
the
basis
of
an
impermissible
classification
because
equal
protection
is
not
a
viable
option
to
challenge
the
no
fly
list
as
the
screening
is
applied
in
a
purportedly
equal
manner
the
use
or
misuse
of
data
driven
tools
has
been
central
to
the
inquiry
in
the
federal
courts
specifically
no
fly
list
litigation
has
been
primarily
successful
through
procedural
due
process
claims
though
many
plaintiffs
also
originally
raised
substantive
due
process
claims
n
the
due
process
challenge
to
the
no
fly
list
is
relevant
here
because
that
challenge
attacks
the
workings
of
the
vetting
and
screening
processes
and
importantly
how
identity
management
technology
can
lead
to
stigmatization
and
reputational
harms
allegedly
on
the
basis
of
classification
for
the
purposes
of
this
discussion
therefore
it
is
helpful
to
concurrently
examine
the
due
process
analysis
of
two
similar
no
fly
list
cases
though
acknowledgeable
differences
exist
between
them
in
both
ibrahim
v
department
of
homeland
security
n
and
latif
v
holder
n
federal
courts
analyzed
due
process
claims
that
the
plaintiffs
rights
to
travel
were
infringed
upon
by
their
inclusion
on
the
no
fly
list
in
latif
the
plaintiffs
argued
that
the
no
fly
list
burdens
a
protected
liberty
interest
n
without
due
process
of
law
namely
that
their
placement
on
the
no
fly
list
burdened
their
liberty
interests
in
the
freedom
of
travel
n
and
freedom
from
the
false
stigmatization
and
association
with
terrorists
and
terroristic
activities
implicit
in
inclusion
on
the
no
fly
list
n
similarly
the
plaintiff
in
ibrahim
alleged
deprivations
of
her
liberty
and
property
interests
without
due
process
of
law
n
once
a
protected
liberty
interest
in
either
the
travel
or
reputational
interest
was
established
in
each
case
the
plaintiffs
were
required
to
satisfy
the
three
part
due
process
test
set
forth
in
mathews
v
eldridge
n
under
mathews
the
court
weighs
the
private
interest
that
will
be
affected
by
the
official
action
the
risk
of
an
erroneous
deprivation
of
such
interest
through
the
procedures
used
and
the
probable
value
if
any
of
additional
or
substitute
procedural
safeguards
and
the
government
s
interest
including
the
function
involved
and
the
fiscal
and
administrative
burdens
that
the
additional
or
substitute
procedural
requirement
would
entail
n
for
example
under
the
first
mathews
factor
in
latif
the
plaintiffs
contended
that
protected
liberty
interests
reside
in
freedom
of
travel
and
movement
and
in
reputational
concerns
n
under
the
second
factor
the
plaintiffs
argued
that
the
redress
procedure
inherently
risks
an
unacceptably
high
error
rate
because
it
does
not
allow
plaintiffs
or
other
individuals
placed
on
the
no
fly
list
the
opportunity
to
confront
or
rebut
any
evidence
used
in
determining
the
appropriateness
of
their
placement
on
the
list
n
in
other
words
the
vetting
and
screening
protocol
of
the
no
fly
list
allowed
for
discrimination
on
the
back
end
in
that
those
singled
out
as
potential
threats
had
no
meaningful
redress
finally
regarding
the
third
factor
although
national
security
is
a
significant
government
interest
the
procedural
protections
provided
to
plaintiffs
were
insufficient
given
the
lack
of
notice
and
wholly
ineffective
procedures
of
the
protocol
n
the
no
fly
list
due
process
challenges
are
necessary
to
challenge
back
end
discrimination
because
there
is
no
other
way
to
interrogate
the
classification
mechanism
used
to
assess
threat
risk
or
what
data
might
be
deemed
suspicious
in
other
words
there
may
be
alleged
commonalities
among

examine
the

some
future

of
these

including
the
possibility
of

testing
in

tests
which
was
originally
at
issue
in
the
case
exploring
the
impact
of
such
identity
management
technologies
including
the
possibility
of
morality
testing
is
also
important
given
the
stated
purposes
for
extreme
vetting
procedures
set
forth
in
president
trump
s
executive
orders
on
immigration
the
january
order
specifically
states
that
its
purpose
is
to
include
an
assessment
of
the
ideological
and
constitutional
posture
of
immigrants
through
extreme
vetting
in
order
to
protect
americans
the
united
states
must
ensure
that
those
admitted
to
this
country
do
not
bear
hostile
attitudes
toward
it
and
its
founding
principles
the
united
states
cannot
and
should
not
admit
those
who
do
not
support
the
constitution
or
those
who
would
place
violent
ideologies
over
american
law
n
although
the
march
order
does
not
include
this
language
the
screening
and
vetting
requirements
set
forth
in
section
are
more
expansive
and
ambiguous
for
instance
instead
of
focusing
on
constitutional
ideology
section
casts
a
wide
precrime
net
stating
that
the
screening
and
vetting
standards
will
analyze
for
example
the
risk
of
causing
harm
n
the
september
order
increases
the
ambiguity
of
the
screening
and
vetting
mandate
even
further
in
section
a
of
the
september
order
it
states
that
the
purpose
and
policy
of
the
proclamation
is
to
protect
its
citizens
from
terrorist
attacks
and
other
public
safety
threats
screening
and
vetting
protocols
and
procedures
associated
with
visa
adjudications
and
other
immigration
processes
play
a
critical
role
in
implementing
that
policy
n
the
september
order
does
not
define
how
threat
risks
will
be
assessed
nor
does
it
provide
specific
details
on
the
screening
and
vetting
protocols
and
procedures
that
are
prescribed
however
in
several
sections
including
sections
b
c
i
and
d
the
order
refers
to
the
need
to
implement
identity
management
and
information
sharing
protocols
and
procedures
n
the
opacity
of
these
protocols
and
procedures
reemphasizes
the
ambiguity
of
the
precrime
mandate
suggested
by
the
orders
nelson
therefore
is
particularly
relevant
to
understanding
the
ambition
of
the
orders
as
the
hspd
program
that
was
challenged
in
nelson
was
intended
to
help
implement
identity
management
and
information
sharing
protocols
and
procedures
after
the
terrorist
attacks
of
september
in
nelson
nasa
contractors
argued
that
the
background
check
required
by
the
hspd
program
violated
a
constitutional
right
to
informational
privacy
the
court
ruled
against
the
nasa
contractors
holding
that
the
background
check
process
that
was
challenged
consisted
of
reasonable
employment
related
inquiries
that
further
the
government
s
interests
in
managing
its
internal
operations
n
the
supreme
court
s
decision
in
nelson
was
widely
anticipated
by
privacy
experts
and
scholars
over
three
decades
have
passed
since
the
court
referred
broadly
to
a
constitutional
privacy
interest
in
avoiding
disclosure
of
personal
matters
n
when
the
court
granted
certiorari
therefore
some
were
hopeful
that
nelson
presented
a
ripe
opportunity
to
reaffirm
the
role
of
a
constitutional
right
to
information
privacy
in
safeguarding
private
individuals
here
privately
employed
scientist
contractors
performing
low
security
risk
research
for
nasa
through
a
private
university
from
unnecessarily
overbroad
disclosure
requirements
by
the
government
and
the
risks
of
inadvertent
or
malicious
exposure
of
personal
information
that
could
result
from
the
government
s
digitalized
data
collection
procedures
as
one
amicus
brief
filed
in
the
case
explained
constitutional
privacy
safeguards
are
particularly
important
in
this
case
because
nasa
s
failure
to
meet
its
obligations
under
the
privacy
act
and
the
agency
s
poor
data
security
practices
pose
substantial
risks
to
the
scientists
personal
information
n
given
the
significance
of
the
case
especially
in
light
of
increasing
public
concerns
about
suspicionless
data
mining
by
the
government
and
recent
well
publicized
cases
of
database
compromise
through
hackers
some
were
surprised
when
the
court
issued
its
decision
rather
quickly
and
summarily
fairly
soon
after
oral
argument
in
a
relatively
brief
opinion
the
supreme
court
assumed
without
deciding
that
the
constitution
protects
a
privacy
right
n
the
court
then
concluded
that
nasa
s
background
check
newly
implemented
to
bring
the
federal
agency
into
compliance
with
hspd
did
not
violate
a
right
to
privacy
if
one
were
to
assume
that
such
a
right
might
exist
n
the
court
held
that
the
government
s
interests
as
employer
and
proprietor
in
managing
its
internal
operations
combined
with
the
protections
against
public
dissemination
provided
by
the
privacy
act
of
u
s
c
a
ed
and
supp
iv
satisfy
any
interest
in
avoiding
disclosure
that
may
arguably
have
its
roots
in
the
constitution
n
with
its
decision
the
supreme
court
overturned
a
preliminary
injunction
that
had
ordered
the
suspension
of
nasa
s
background
check
process
after
the
ninth
circuit
found
aspects
of
the
government
s
questions
to
be
in
violation
of
the
scientists
constitutional
right
to
privacy
n
the
supreme
court
explained
that
the
ninth
circuit
was
in
error
because
the
questions
challenged
by
respondents
are
part
of
a
standard
employment
background
check
of
the
sort
used
by
millions
of
private
employers
n
yet
the
significance
of
this
case
is
misstated
and
misunderstood
when
cast
as
a
simplistic
battle
over
background
check
protocol
under
the
government
s
hspd
program
and
whether
that
protocol
may
or
may
not
implicate
constitutional
privacy
interests
both
the
supreme
court
and
the
ninth
circuit
focused
on
a
series
of
drug
related
questions
presumed
to
be
the
most
objectionable
to
the
scientists
and
that
are
listed
on
the
standard
form
questionnaire
for
non
sensitive
positions
sf
n
sf
asks
whether
an
employee
has
used
possessed
supplied
or
manufactured
illegal
drugs
in
the
last
year
n
in
issuing
the
preliminary
injunction
the
ninth
circuit
concluded
that
the
form
s
open
ended
and
highly
private
questions
were
not
narrowly
tailored
to
meet
the
government
s
interests
in
verifying
contractors
identities
and
ensuring
the
security
of
the
jet
propulsion
laboratory
at
nasa
n
in
a
footnote
the
court
noted
a
compelling
question
raised
by
the
scientists
that
had
been
dismissed
by
the
ninth
circuit
as
unripe
and
had
not
been
made
the
subject
of
a
cross
petition
a
question
of
the
so
called
suitability
criteria
that
the
government
used
to
determine
employment
eligibility
at
jet
propulsion
laboratory
n
these
factors
include
consideration
of
a
candidate
s
financial
and
emotional
health
as
well
as
things
like
carnal
knowledge
n
the
suitability
criteria
were
derived
from
a
ninety
four
page
government
vetting
protocol
document
titled
nasa
desk
guide
for
suitability
and
security
clearance
processing
version
n
specifically
understanding
the
scientists
constitutional
informational
privacy
claim
requires
an
understanding
of
the
morality
and
character
testing
criteria
that
were
open
for
questioning
and
evaluation
during
the
background
check
process
required
under
nasa
s
implementation
of
hspd
on
page
sixty
five
of
the
desk
guide
nasa
includes
an
issue
characterization
chart
that
allows
nasa
to
assess
individuals
character
and
suitability
based
on
more
than
itemized
characteristics
n
these
items
appeared
to
assess
good
moral
character
and
trustworthiness
characteristics
on
the
evaluation
include
drunk
bad
check
pattern
of
irresponsibility
as
reflected
in
credit
history
carnal

indecent
proposal
sodomy
voyeurism
or
peeping
tom
mailing

or
displaying
obscene
material
beastiality
pattern
of
excessive
substance
abuse
as
reflected
in
inability
to
function
responsibly
and
medical
treatment
or
poor
health
disorderly
conduct
attitude
and
personality
conflict
trespassing
and
minor
traffic
violation
n
upon
successful
completion
of
the
nasa
suitability
and
security
clearance
processing
protocol
the
desk
guide
authorizes
the
agency
to
issue
the
nasa
employee
or
private
contractor
a
biometric
id
card
in
accordance
with
hspd
n
failure
to
pass
this
newly
implemented
clearance
process
results
in
the
termination
of
employment
n
while
the
suitability
criteria
were
not
before
the
court
the
acting
solicitor
general
nevertheless
felt
compelled
to
assert
at
oral
argument
that
nasa
will
not
and
does
not
use
such
objectionable
criteria
to
make
contractor
credentialing
decisions
n
the
need
for
such
assurance
indicates
the
scientists
did
indeed
have
real
privacy
concerns
even
if
they
did
not
crystallize
into
part
of
a
live
claim
before
the
court
thus
lost
in
this
case
was
a
real
concern
about
what
information
nasa
or
any
other
government
agency
is
allowed
to
seek
under
the
identity
verification
procedures
imposed
by
hspd
and
whether
the
constitution
under
a
privacy
right
imposes
any
fundamental
limiting
principles
on
that
identity
verification
process
the
acting
solicitor
general
s
assurance
that
intimate
personal
details
regarding
credit
card
debt
and
carnal
knowledge
for
example
will
not
be
considered
by
nasa
is
nothing
more
than
that
just
an
assurance
meanwhile
the
suitability
criteria
that
could
be
used
to
determine
the
denial
of
the
issuance
of
a
biometric
id
card
under
hspd
makes
clear
that
fears
that
government
identity
management
programs
may
become
overbroad
and
overintrusive
are
not
paranoid
or
baseless
nelson
by
affirming
hspd
may
now
pave
the
way
for
the
implementation
of
a
biometric
credentialing
program
and
uniform
biometric
based
dataveillance
program
on
a
national
scale
nelson
also
demonstrates
how
suitable
character
testing
or
morality
testing
can
be
built
into
modern
vetting
protocols
in
civilian
background
checks
as
the
facts
of
the
case
demonstrated
that
nasa
employees
and
contractors
were
required
to
demonstrate
trustworthiness
and
good
character
before
receipt
of
the
biometric
identification
card
under
a
universal
biometric
identification
system
however
suitability
testing
or
character
vetting
protocols
could
be
embedded
within
the
database
screening
system
itself
thus
the
morality
testing
would
not
necessarily
arrive
at
the
front
end
of
the
vetting
process
as
was
seen
in
nelson
rather
the
accumulation
of
biometric
and
biographic
data
enables
both
biometric
and
suitability
testing
rather
than
clearing
a
suitability
assessment
in
order
to
qualify
for
a
biometric
id
card
a
biometric
anchored
database
screening
system
could
allow
for
moral
and
suitability
criteria
testing
on
the
back
end
of
the
vetting
process
recent
disclosures
by
edward
snowden
for
example
explain
how
biometric
data
can
be
fused
with
biographic
data
to
assess
risk
n
this
development
in
supreme
court
jurisprudence
is
thus
significant
because
the
original
announcement
of
trump
s
muslim
ban
indicated
that
the
proposal
was
inclusive
of
u
s
citizens
specifically
on
december
shortly
after
then
candidate
trump
announced
plans
for
the
muslim
travel
ban
he
suggested
in
a
nationally
televised
interview
n
that
the
ban
could
possibly
extend
to
muslim
americans
n
trump
invoked
former
president
franklin
d
roosevelt
s
world
war
ii
proclamation
that
u
s
citizens
who
were
potentially
enemy
aliens
could
be
detained
n
on
january
one
day
after
president
trump
signed
the
executive
order
imposing
restrictions
on
the
travel
and
immigration
of
citizens
of
muslim
majority
nations
fox
news
asked
former
new
york
city
mayor
rudy
giuliani
whether
the
executive
order
was
in
fact
a
muslim
ban
n
guiliani
explained
when
trump
first
announced
it
during
the
campaign
he
said
muslim
ban
he
called
me
up
he
said
put
a
commission
together
show
me
the
right
way
to
do
it
legally
n
giuliani
elaborated
further
and
what
we
did
was
we
focused
on
instead
of
religion
danger
perfectly
legal
perfectly
sensible
and
that
s
what
the
ban
is
based
on
it
s
not
based
on
religion
it
s
based
on
places
where
there
are
sic
substantial
evidence
that
people
are
sending
terrorists
into
our
country
n
this
suggests
that
discriminatory
vetting
and
screening
protocols
can
evade
judicial
review
if
a
protected
class
is
targeted
indirectly
through
race
neutral
criteria
such
as
threat
risk
assessments
in
washington
v
trump
n

that
addressed
the
first
executive
order
the
ninth
circuit
disagreed
that
the
government
had
established
sufficient
evidence
of
an
impending
national
security
threat
n
on
february
in
upholding
the
western
district
of
washington
s
grant
of
a
temporary
restraining
order
halting
the
implementation
of
the
executive
order
the
ninth
circuit
concluded
the
government
has
not
offered
any
evidence
or
even
an
explanation
of
how
the
national
security
concerns
that
justified
those
designations
of
travel
and
immigration
restrictions
which
triggered
visa
requirements
can
be
extrapolated
to
justify
an
urgent
need
for
the
executive
order
to
be
immediately
reinstated
n
in
subsequent
litigation
the
fourth
and
ninth
circuits
agreed
that
the
government
had
failed
to
show
a
sufficient
justification
for
the
executive
order
in
hawaii
v
trump
n
the
ninth
circuit
panel
explained
that
the
president
had
not
made
a
sufficient
finding
that
entry
of
the
excluded
classes
would
be
detrimental
to
the
united
states
n
in
international
refugee
assistance
project
the
fourth
circuit
noted
that
while
the
government
argued
that
it
had
a
national
security
purpose
in
issuing
the
order
evidence
supporting
such
a
purpose
was
comparably
weaker
than
then
candidate
trump
s
statements
about
a
muslim
ban
subsequent
statements
on
the
issues

made
by
his
advisors
as
well
as

this

written
the
supreme
court
had
granted
certiorari
in
both
cases
and
consolidated
them
for
argument
n
on
february
the

press
reported
that
a
leaked
memo
drafted
at
the
request
of
the

acting
under

concluded
citizenship
is
an
unlikely
indicator
of
terrorism
threats
to
the

n
the
memo
states
that
the
analysis
undertaken
by

specifically
analyzed
the
threat
of
the
seven
countries
that
were
impacted
by
section
of
executive
order
n
the
dhs
memo
states
that
of
eighty
two
people
the
government
determined
were
inspired
by
a
foreign
terrorist
group
to
carry
out
or
try
to
carry

conflict
commenced
in
march
just
over
half
were
u
s
citizens
born
in
the

n
the
dhs
memo
further
states
that
the
terrorists
were
from
twenty
six
countries
led
by
pakistan
somalia
bangladesh
cuba
ethiopia
iraq
and
uzbekistan
of
these
only
somalia
and
iraq
were
among
the
seven
nations
included
in
the
ban
n
both
the
ninth
and
fourth
circuits
discussed
this
memorandum
and
relied
on
it
in
their
rulings
n
importantly
the
original
january
order
states
that
vetting
policy
should
include
a
test
to
assess
fidelity
to
founding
principles
and
the
constitution
n
statements
by
trump
suggest
that
such
vetting
should
include
a
test
to
assess
loyalty
to
the
united
states
and
whether
an
individual
will
support
our
country
and
love
deeply
our
people
n
he
further
promoted
as
a
candidate
the
implementation
of
profiling
and
preventative
measures
such
as
mass
surveillance
to
assess
terroristic
risk

program
in
the

criteria
developed
by
nasa
a
version
of
extreme
vetting
emerged
the
january
order
discusses
the
need
to
implement
loyalty
tests
that
demonstrate
pro
american
values
thus
extreme
vetting
may
be
expanded
to
encompass
similar
abstract
assessments
of
character
and
morality
as
a
part
of
threat
risk
assessments
by
affirming
the
credentialing
protocol
surrounding

nelson

the
door
to
profound
questions
of
constitutional

electronic

that
have
yet
to
be
resolved
these
questions
include
the
role
of
biometric

and
dataveillance
in
national

policy
and
immigration
control
policy
it
now
remains
to
be
seen
whether

eventually
serve

under
historic
jim

regimes
enforcement
of
segregationist
laws
was
delegated
to
both
public
and
private

n
those
who
participated
in
segregation
gatekeeping
often
did
so
under
the
threat
of
legally
imposed
sanctions
n
resistance
to
the
mandate
to
segregate
train
service
for
instance
led
to
the
initiation
of
a
legal
challenge
to
louisiana
s
jim
crow
laws
in
plessy
which
required
the
cooperation
of
railway
companies
that
were
frustrated
with
their
gatekeeping
duties
under
the
separate
car
act
n
railway
companies
opposed
the
segregation
law
on
the
ground
that
running
two
train
cars
one
for
white
passengers
and
one
for
black
passengers
was
economically
costly
especially
for
train
routes
on
which
ridership
had
proven
to
be
light
n
the
petitioners
also
argued
that
it
was
unlawful
to
delegate
segregationist
gatekeeping
to
the
private
companies
who
would
be
fined
for
allowing
black
passengers
to
ride
white
railcars
n
homer
adolph
plessy
had
been
selected
to
violate
the
jim
crow
law
specifically
because
he
was
a
light
skinned
black
man
who
could
pass
as
a
white
man
n
yet
a
similar
de
jure
discrimination
scheme
may
be
emerging
in
the
modern
era
how
do
private
and
state
immigration
gatekeepers
determine
whether
an
individual
is
lawfully
present
in
the
united
states
under
the
immigration
reform
and
control
act
of
irca
n
the
federal

delegated
immigration

to
all

assist
in

gatekeeping
duties
through
the
examination
of
paper
based

in
the
wall
street
journal
editorial
pages
compared
federal
employer
sanctioning
policies
required
under
federal
immigration
law
to
historic
jim
crow
regimes
the
publication
explained
that
private
entities
were
once
again
asked
to
engage
in
discrimination
n
under
the
law
by
effectually
being
deputized
as
immigration
gatekeepers
specifically
the
wall
street
journal
described
irca
as
the
first
legislation
since
jim
crow
where
the
government
is
so
closely
aligned
with
a
process
that
produces
discrimination
n
from
the
s
to
the
present
immigration
laws
at
the
federal
and
state
level
have
attempted
to
restrict
immigrant
access
to
transportation
and
travel
employment
education
housing
and
benefits
n
in
contrast
to
historic
jim
crow
regimes
however
the
targeting
of
the
undocumented
immigrant
population
does
not
need
to
proceed
under
a
facade
of
equality
because
such
discrimination
is
often
construed
as
legally
permissible
undocumented
immigrants
with
important
exceptions
do
not
enjoy
the
broad
civil
rights
protections
and
constitutional
rights
afforded
to
u
s
citizens
n
even
lawful
immigrants
may
face
more
restricted
rights
than
u
s
citizens
n
those
arguing
in
favor
of
tough
immigration
actions
including
those
defending
the
executive
orders
have
explained
this
position
as
a
legal
defense
of
such
actions
n
yet
for
decades
lawful
immigrants
and
those
perceived
to
be
foreign
have
alleged
that
they
suffer
from
a
form
of
collateral
discrimination
an
assumption
of
undocumented
status
and
accidental
targeting
that
stems
from
restrictive
immigration
laws
n
studies
have
consistently
shown
that
vetting
and
screening
protocols
required
by
immigration
gatekeeping
sometimes
referred
to
as
show
me
your
papers
laws
incentivize
racial
profiling
n
in
other
words
mandatory
document
checks
often
target
those
perceived
to
be
foreign
those
who
may
be
isolated
on
the
basis
of
race
color
ethnicity
national
origin
religion
and
foreignness
characteristics
n
such
as
accent
clothing
and
a
failure
to
present
whiteness
characteristics
n
in
response
to
growing
empirical
evidence
that
immigration
related
screening
and
delegated
gatekeeping
duties
by
the
government
reliably
led
to
discrimination
congress
increasingly
looked
to
technological
screening
methods
as
race
neutral
tools
to
achieve
the
same
means
n
throughout
the
s
until
the
present
immigration
reform
legislation
has
proposed
database
driven
methods
to
implement
screening
and
gatekeeping
functions
n
many
of
these
database
screening
methods
are
experimental
and
still
under
testing
n
nonetheless
the
terror
attacks
accelerated
the
rollout
of
these
experimental
vetting
and
screening
systems
n
the
immigrant
status
of
the
hijackers
led
to
calls
for
policy
initiatives
that
could
facilitate
the
identification
and
more
efficient
tracking
of
immigrants
and
potential
terrorists
through
cybersurveillance
and
dataveillance
technologies
n
many
of
these
technologies
were
dependent
upon
biometric
data
monitoring
and
database
facilitated
algorithmic
sorting
tools
n
the
impetus
was
not
so
much
to
avoid
bias
in
screening
but
to
harness
the
supposed
efficiencies
and
reliability
of
a
database
centered
means
of
screening
since
immigration
policy
and
national
security
policy
have
increasingly
converged
at
the
federal
level
this
convergence
could
be
seen
in
the
increasing
adoption
of
big
data
identity
management
systems
aimed
to
screen
the
population
to
determine
who
could
receive
rights
and
benefits
such
as
the
no
fly
list
n
the
no
work
list
e
verify
n
and
the
no
citizenship
list
managed
by
secure
communities
n
and
the
dhs
s
prioritized
enforcement
program
n
these
database
screening
and
digital
watchlisting
systems
purport
to
further
crime
control
immigration
control
and
counterterrorism
objectives
the
e
verify
database
has
not
only
been
used
to
restrict
employment
opportunities
but
it
is
alleged
that
landlords
have
used
the
database
to
screen
tenants
and
that
school
officials
have
used
the
database
to
screen
students
n
similarly
the
no
vote
list
save
n
and
hava
n
has
been
used
for
voter
purges
and
to
restrict
driver
s
licenses
as
well
as
access
to
welfare
benefits
n
after
the
federal
government
sought
a
sharp
increase
in
personnel
who
could
conduct
vetting
and
implement
screening
protocols
to
increase
the
effectiveness
of
immigration
gatekeeping
n
thus
the
federal
government
also
increasingly
invited
state
and
local
law
enforcement
to
participate
in
the
enforcement
of
federal
immigration
law
under
a
force
multiplier
theory
n
of
delegation
of
immigration
gatekeeping
n
under
the
expanded
immigration
gatekeeping
mandates
of
dhs
state
and
local
governments
were
granted
access
to
dhs
database
screening
systems
and
invited
to
screen
arrestees
through
these
systems
n
after
the
federal
government
also
experimented
with
the
merging
of
database
screening
protocols
to
eliminate
the
separation
between
civil
and
criminal
immigration
database
screening
protocols
n
under
immigration
federalism
and
national
security
federalism
state
laws
have
increasingly
captured
post
identity
management
technologies
introduced
by
dhs
consequently
comparisons
between
historic
jim
crow
regimes
and
contemporary
immigration
enforcement
regimes
have
intensified

recent
years

been
alleged

the

were
delegated

restrictionist
immigration
gatekeeping

de

that
may
be
perceived
to
be

could
be
incurred
by
employers

administrators
who
fail

each
of

requires
a
screening

otherwise
the

has
contended

could
not

its
residents
is

and
who

the
identity
management
technology

relied
upon
by
the
state

involved
an

supplemented
by
a
paper
based
inspection
to
log
personally
identifiable
data
into
a
preexisting
vetting
and
database
screening
system
operated
by
dhs
although
not
all
of
these
measures
passed
the

and

aspects
of
arizona
s
proposed
comprehensive
immigration
reform
strategy
as
well
as
other
state
and
local
laws
passed
or
considered
in
recent
years
has
resulted
in
an
unprecedented
expansion
of
document
inspection
and
database
driven
screening
protocols
n
arizona
s
aggressive
stance
on
restrictive
immigration
gatekeeping
is
enabled
by
the
introduction
of
big
data
vetting
analytics
and
database
screening
potentialities
often
conducted
through
internet
based
screening
of
dhs
and
other
federal
agency
databases
it
shows
the
multifold
opportunities
for
electronic
vetting
in
daily
life
and
while
it
is
a
system
to
screen
out
immigrants
at
the
national
level
and
in
the
national
security
context
newly
emerging
digital
watchlisting
and
database
screening
programs
such
as
the
no
fly
list
make
clear
that
database
screening
is
easily
adaptable
to
other
kinds
of
vetting
for
various
purposes
those
screened
or
vetted
will
individually
encounter
a
purportedly
neutral
and
colorblind
process
but
with
the
result
that
they
fall
into
groups
that
can
start
to
look
much
like
the
kinds
of
classifications
that
would
normally
offend
the
constitution
s
equal
protection
guarantees
consequently
the
extreme
vetting
protocols
and
the
implementation
of
a
muslim
registry
should
be
understood
within
the
context
of
delegated
database
screening
protocols
such
as
those
proposed
and
passed
by
arizona
as
can
be
seen
in
the
discussion
above
the
efforts
by
the
federal
and
state
government
to
collect
and
screen
data
under
the
auspices
of
immigration

policy
now
extend
to
a
wide
range
of
contexts
including
employment
screening
and
day
to
day
policing
this
appears
to
be
consistent
with
data
collection
and
screening
policies
under
the
trump
administration
asked
where
muslims
would
be

trump
specifically
referred
to
the
need
to
deploy

technologies
trump
tied
his
reasoning
for
the
database
to
the
need
to
identify
who
is
in
the
country
legally
it
would
stop
people
from
coming

the
number
of
individuals

affected

programs
is
growing
as
rapidly
as
the
programs
themselves
and
future
attempts
to
seek
judicially
imposed
limits
on
such
programs
appear
inevitable
the
broader
question
thus
is
not
whether
the
scientists
in
nelson

denied
a
constitutional
right
to

but
whether
any
limiting
principle
can
be
articulated
to

whether

allege
those

largely
fall

race

depending
on
what

criteria
n
recent
immigration
control
policy
and

demonstrate
the
government
s
interest
in
delegating
immigration
vetting
duties
to
private
actors
n
such
as
employers
and
nonfederal
actors
such
as
state
and
local
law
enforcement
n
or
their
privatized
subdelegates
n
which
can
exacerbate
issues
of
racial
profiling
and
discrimination
for
instance
lawa
and
arizona
s
sb
are
examples
of
immigration
federalism
and
national
security
federalism
immigration
federalism
traditionally
has
denoted
state
and
local
efforts
to
control
or
mitigate
the
impact
of
unwanted
migration
or
to
regulate
the
admission
of
noncitizens
across
state
borders
n
in
the
past
few
years
several
thousand
state
and
local
immigration
related
laws
have
been
considered
in
almost
every
state
n
this
level
of
immigration
federalism
activity
is
unprecedented
in
u
s
history
n
also
unprecedented
however
is
the
manner
in
which
immigration
federalism
is
intersecting
with
two
other
critical
movements
in
u
s
history
an
increasing
reliance
on
database
sorting
technology
and
dataveillance
in
federal
immigration
policy
to
facilitate
state
federal
partnerships
in
the
control
of
unwanted
migration
and
a
post
national
security
policy
of
national
security
federalism
that
encourages
a
state
federal
partnership
in
the
furtherance
of
intelligence
gathering
and
homeland
security
objectives
under
a
force
multiplier
theory
in
the
dhs
memos
released
by
then
dhs
secretary
john
kelly
on
february
which
implemented
the
executive
orders
on
immigration
signed
by
president
trump
on
january
dhs
stated
that
the
executive
branch
would
apply
a
force
multiplier
approach
to
the
immigration
control
and
national
security
effort
n
identity
management
technologies
that
rely
upon
the
internet
and
digital
databases
to
verify
identity
have
been
developed
to
help
execute
these
goals
as
a
presidential
candidate
trump
explained
that
immigration
control
and
counterterrorism
efforts
required
a
lot
of
systems
beyond
databases
n
because
these
statutes
are
perceived
as
targeting
primarily
those
born
in
foreign
countries
but
residing
here
the
questions
of
government
intrusion
and
disparate
impact
are
obscured
however
while
the
state
and
federal
laws
at
issue
may
be
immigration
laws
first
they
are
still
identity
screening
laws
and
the
entire
population
citizens
and
noncitizens
is
subject
to
their
vetting
and
screening
protocols
consequently
immigration
federalism
when
combined
with
national
security
federalism
is
driving
the
exponential
expansion
of
identity
management
programs
and
biometric
database
screening
given
the
historical
connection
between
mass
data
collection
and
mass
discrimination
n
federal
courts
may
require
an
inquiry
into
the
discriminatory
animus
in
the
design
of
the
vetting
protocols
and
the
database
screening
systems
that
inquiry
will
likely
start
from
an
assessment
of
the
disparate
impact
of
identity
management
technologies
relatedly
challengers
and
the
courts
must
contemplate
the
disparate
impact
of
the
algorithms
themselves
the
screening
inputs
that
produce
the
results
and
the
discriminatory
result
of
other
data
driven
decision
making
tools
rather
than
in
the
personal
animus
of
the
screener
judicial
review
should
evolve
to
question
analytical
assumptions
and
to
develop
evaluative
methods
to
interrogate
the
underlying
algorithms
informing
the
screening
and
vetting
systems
challengers
and
federal
courts
must
also
become
more
aware
of
other
types
of
discrimination
that
can
be
facilitated
by
digitalized
vetting
and
screening
protocols
although
data
driven
discrimination
is
not
currently
recognized
we
can
begin
challenging
the
collection
of
data
under
privacy
theories
and
attempt
to
limit
the
ways
in
which
judgments
can
be
made
based
on
the
analysis
of
such
data
nelson
for
example
challenged
data
driven
decisions
that
imposed
arbitrary
definitions
of
suitability
on
moral
proclivities
rather
than
decision
making
founded
on
a
secure
rational
basis
n
further
identity
management
technologies
and
algorithmic
jim
crow
may
force
innovations
in
constitutional
data
privacy
theories
these
may
include
for
example
asserting
a
reasonable
expectation
of
privacy
under
the
fourth
amendment
s
prohibition
of
the
search
and
seizure
of
data
the
original
complaints
filed
to
enjoin
lawa
s
mandatory
e
verify
database
screening
alleged
a
fourth
amendment
violation
n
among
other
challenges
the
chamber
of
commerce
argued
that
e
verify
required
an
unconstitutional
search
and
seizure
of
an
employee
s
personally
identifiable
information
by
arizona
employers
n
the
fourth
amendment
challenge
however
was
not
the
driving
force
behind
the
litigation
was
withdrawn
by
stipulation
before
the
district
court
n
and
was
not
before
the
supreme
court
in
whiting
which
focused
on
the
question
of
preemption
n
although
the
united
states
only
challenged
section
b
of
arizona
s
sb
on
preemption
grounds
the
american
civil
liberties
union
aclu
had
originally
raised
other
constitutional
claims
including
a
fourth
amendment
claim
to
the
implementation
of
section
b
which
required
mandatory
biometric
database
screening
of
those
suspected
of
unlawful
presence
n
once
again
the
fourth
amendment
claim
was
not
before
the
supreme
court
in
arizona
which
also
focused
on
preemption
n
it
is
important
to
note
as
well
that
similar
to
korematsu
the
no
fly
list
challengers
have
relied
on
due
process
rather
than
equal
protection
as
in
korematsu
the
government
has
defended
the
no
fly
list
as
a
national
security
program
that
does
not
target
classifications
of
individuals
but
rather
targets
risk
in
his
dissent
in
korematsu
justice
frank
murphy
stated
that
the
order
deprives
all
those
within
its
scope
of
the
equal
protection
of
the
laws
as
guaranteed
by
the
fifth
amendment
n
of
the
relationship
between
due
process
and
equal
protection
william
eskridge
has
observed
that
the
due
process
clause
announces
a
procedural
norm
n
to
the
extent
that
the
due
process
clause
is
recognized
to
carry
a
substantive
element
eskridge
explains
the
courts
demand
a
fit
between
the
reasonableness
of
the
deprivation
whatever
the
process
and
the
law
of
the
land
the
equal
protection
clause
requires
the
state
to
justify
any
difference
in
procedural
or
substantive
treatment
of
one
person
vis
a
vis
another
n
consequently
the
equal
protection
clause
may
be
less
useful
than
other
constitutional
options
that
can
force
political
change
such
as
the
due
process
clause
and
the
first
amendment
n
eskridge
suggests
however
that
the
due
process
clause
can
secure
important
rights
at
the
individual
level
n
he
notes
that
our
conception
of
due
process
is
more
elastic
and
can
track
changing
standards
of
social
progress
n
further
perhaps
the
most
fundamental
value
found
in
the
due
process
clause
is
the
idea
that
the
state
is
obligated
to
treat
every
person
as
a
presumptively
worthwhile
human
being
who
is
entitled
to
respect
and
humane
treatment
this
principle
is
the
key
reason
buck
v
bell
and
korematsu
were
wrongly
decided
n
eskridge
signals
that
the
time
might
be
right
to
view
equal
protection
and
due
process
as
interchangeable
and
interdependent
in
the
vindication
of
individual
rights
n
there
are
benefits
to
prevailing
under
an
equal
protection
claim
n
namely
the
equal
protection
clause
alone
offers
a
minority
group
a
potential
constitutional
jackpot
at
the
wholesale
level
that
is
in
challenges
to
an
array
of
interconnected
discriminations
in
state
benefits
as
well
as
burdens
n
eskridge
posits
however
that
due
process
can
yield
similar
wholesale
benefits
to
protection
as
the
equal
protection
clause
under
the
constitution
there
is
no
theoretical
or
historical
limit
to
extending
wholesale
rights
to
classes
of
individuals
under
a
due
process
theory
n
in
fact
a
destabilizing
due
process
that
offers
multiple
opportunities
to
challenge
discrimination
can
result
in
an
evolutive
equal
protection
n
thus
the
equal
protection
process
may
need
to
be
pushed
to
evolve
to
realize
new
forms
of
discrimination
once
the
due
process
clause
forces
the
federal
courts
to
confront
the
unreasonableness
of
wholesale
deprivations
and
the
need
to
grant
wholesale
benefits
to
challengers
alleging
the
infringement
in
the
context
of
algorithmic
jim
crow
however
the
interrelationship
between
due
process
and
equal
protection
is
more
pragmatic
challenging
algorithm
driven
vetting
and
screening
protocols
under
due
process
claims
means
demanding
answers
about
the
black
box
processes
that
may
flag
individuals
as
potential
risks
or
threats
n
as
the
algorithms
and
data
analytic
processes
become
more
transparent
equal
protection
violations
can
no
longer
be
as
easily
disguised
this
destabilization
or
disruption
of
government
deprivations
made
possible
by
due
process
challenges
can
give
new
evaluative
impetus
to
the
evolution
of
the
types
of
protections
offered
under
the
equal
protection
clause
arguably
this
process
of
destabilizing
algorithmic
due
process
is
already
occurring
under
due
process
and
equal
protection
challenges
among
others
the
no
work
list
has
been
implicated
in
an
equal
protection
challenge
n
the
no
vote
list
has
been
challenged
n
under
section
of
the
voting
rights
act
n
and
the
day
provision
of
the
national
voter
registration
act
n
the
no
citizenship
list
has
been
challenged
under
both
procedural
due
process
and
equal
protection
claims
under
the
fifth
and
fourteenth
amendments
n
as
well
as
under
the
fourth
amendment
n
in
addition
the
subsequent
litigation
of
the
no
citizenship
list
was
found
to
implicate
the
tenth
amendment
under
the
anticommandeering
doctrine
n
the
no
fly
list
and
terrorist
watchlist
have
been
challenged
under
multiple
legal
claims
and
constitutional
theories
n
including
procedural
due
process
and
substantive
due
process
under
the
fifth
amendment
n
algorithmic
jim
crow
may
not
be
challenged
successfully
on
equal
protection
grounds
but
rather
on
other
legal
grounds
such
as
informational
privacy
grounds
the
legal
claim
in
nelson
nelson
is
especially
useful
to
the
analysis
here
as
it
involves
a
challenge
to
both
a
mandatory
biometric
id
program
and
the
vetting
protocols
associated
with
the
program
n
like
the
loyalty
requirements
imposed
by
the
january
order
n
the
vetting
protocols
challenged
in
nelson
also
involved
screening
criteria
to
determine
trustworthiness
morality
and
suitability
criteria
subsequently
criticized
by
the
court
as
subjective
and
objectionable
n
consequently
legal
responses
to
algorithmic
jim
crow
may
require
preconceiving
identity
management
harms
to
encompass
a
broad
range
of
legal
theories
as
in
the
no
fly
list
litigation
the
government
will
likely
defend
disparate
impact
consequences
as
justified
based
upon
risk
assessments
terroristic
classifications
data
screening
results
deemed
suspect
and
characteristics
establishing
unsuitability
n
these
are
classifications
and
characteristics
not
protected
by
equal
protection
jurisprudence
to
acknowledge
the
harms
emerging
from
algorithmic
jim
crow
equality
law
should
be
broadened
to
recognize
data
driven
discrimination
and
recognition
of
algorithm
and
big
data
derived
disparate
impact
rather
than
limiting
protection
to
only
animus
based
classification
driven
discrimination
conclusion
algorithmic
jim
crow
regimes
are
distinguished
from
historic
jim
crow
regimes
in
several
significant
respects
algorithmic
jim
crow
is
cybersurveillance
driven
and
dataveillance
dependent
built
around
the
transparency
of
biometric
identity
and
other
technologies
of
identity
management
monitoring
internet
and
social
media
activity
and
contact
lists
through
telephony
databases
database
screening
and
digital
watchlisting
enforcement
and
other
emerging
big
data
surveillance
techniques
in
contrast
traditional
jim
crow
is
law
driven
built
around
the
transparency
of
racial
identity
monitoring
economic
educational
political
and
social
activity
and
utilizing
traditional
criminal
enforcement
and
detention
tools
as
well
as
small
data
surveillance
techniques
algorithmic
jim
crow
describes
an
equal
but
separate
system
of
de
jure
and
de
facto
discrimination
rather
than
the
separate
but
equal
discrimination
of
historic
jim
crow
the
goal
of
algorithmic
jim
crow
is
not
physical
separation
per
se
rather
all
individuals
subjected
to
an
algorithmic
jim
crow
regime
may
be
equally
vetted
through
database
screening
and
digital
watchlisting
systems
the
separation
however
is
achieved
through
data
discrimination
applied
on
the
back
end
of
screening
and
vetting
protocols
rather
than
overt
social
and
economic
discrimination
and
legal
apartheid
applied
on
the
front
end
of
segregationist
regimes
the
equal
but
separate
impact
of
algorithmic
jim
crow
will
likely
manifest
itself
in
the
big
data
assessment
of
risk
factors
that
purport
to
predict
terroristic
and
criminal
threat
rather
than
segregation
systems
of
racial
or
ethnic
classification
in
other
words
individuals
will
be
at
risk
of
disparate
treatment
on
the
basis
of
suspicious
algorithmic
results
and
anomalous
data
or
foreignness
characteristics
thus
disparate
treatment
stemming
from
cybersurveillance
and
dataveillance
may
not
be
characterized
as
traditional
discrimination
discrimination
on
the
basis
of
a
historically
protected
class
for
instance
race
color
ethnicity
national
origin
and
sex
this
type
of
identity
management
technology
based
discrimination
may
therefore
fall
outside
current
interpretations
of
the
scope
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
s
equal
protection
clause
and
outside
the
reach
of
the
protection
of
civil
rights
statutes
algorithmic
vetting
and
biometric
identification
especially
once
deployed
across
an
entire
citizenry
will
likely
lead
to
discriminatory
profiling
and
surveillance
on
the
basis
of
suspicious
digital
data
and
internet
and
social
media
activity
deemed
suspect
as
well
as
classification
based
discrimination
such
as
the
isolation
of
those
emigrating
from
muslim
majority
nations
these
systems
are
likely
to
result
in
both
direct
and
collateral
discrimination
on
the
basis
of
citizenship
status
national
origin
and
religion
in
particular
in
addition
recent
immigration
control
policies
and
programs
demonstrate
the
government
s
willingness
to
delegate
screening
and
vetting
duties
to
private
actors
such
as
employers
and
local
law
enforcement
which
can
exacerbate
issues
of
racial
profiling
and
discrimination
this
discrimination
may
face
limited
or
lenient
review
by
a
federal
judiciary
that
generally
grants
broad
deference
in
matters
of
immigration
and
national
security
because
algorithmic
jim
crow
may
appear
to
offer
equality
in
theory
it
may
not
be
challenged
successfully
on
equal
protection
grounds
under
the
current
equal
protection
framework
thus
the
jurisprudence
must
evolve
to
encompass
new
harms
and
recognize
the
disparate
impact
harms
of
algorithmic
jim
crow
regimes
at
the
same
time
algorithmic
jim
crow
must
be
challenged
under
other
legal
theories
including
search
and
seizure
of
data
under
the
fourth

procedural
due

and
informational

rights
under
substantive
due

guarantees
of
the
fifth

first

theories
and
other
statutory
and
constitutional
theories
wholesale

gave
at

club
launching

discussing
his
civil
and
human
rights
work
on
behalf
of
not
only
muslim
americans
but
minorities
throughout
the
us
i
was
impressed
he
was
fighting
for
justice
within
the
system
when
i
invited
arjun
to
speak
before
my
world
of
islam
class
at

university
recently
he
made
some
core
points
related
to
the
rise
in
hate
related
incidents
against
muslims
since
noting
they
are
trending
at
least
five
times
higher
than
prior
to
the
attacks
he
said
we
are
living
in
an
open
season
of
prejudice
against
muslims
perpetual
war
in
iraq
and
afghanistan
has
contributed
to
prevailing
negative
attitudes
he
argued
and
the
guantanamo
bay
detention
facility
in
cuba
stands
as
a
testament
to
negative
treatment
of
muslims
suspected
of
terrorist
activities
arjun
also
spoke
of
police
tactics
that
often
serve
to
perpetuate
discrimination
he
shared
how
a
team
of
associated
press
reporters
revealed
that
covert
domestic
surveillance
programs
established
in
new
york
city
following
for
example
were
explicitly
designed
to
monitor
muslim
citizens
representing
an
abandonment
of
rights
to
privacy
that
all
americans
are
entitled
to
enjoy
none
of
the
surveillance
was
based
on
reasonable
suspicion
or
probable
cause
but
instead
solely
based
on
identity
the
surveillance
did
not
result
in
a
single
conviction
these
surveillance
programs
he
noted
have
been
complemented
by
watch
lists
there
are
three
types
of
watch
lists
administered
by
the
transportation
security
administration
a
terrorist
watch
list
of
million
individuals
suspected
of
terrorist
activities
a
selectee
list
which
requires
listed
individuals
to
undergo
enhanced
screening
measures
before
flying
and
a
no
fly
list
of
some
which
forbids
listed
individuals
from
boarding
an
airplane
the
consequences
of
these
watch
lists
are
serious
those
listed
may
be
unable
to
see
their
families
or
even
apply
for
loans
and
employment
listed
individuals
are
generally
considered
too
dangerous
to
fly
but
not
dangerous
enough
to
be
arrested
which
keeps
them
in
an
uneasy
limbo
with
broad
consequences
arjun
also
discussed
the
efficacy
of
countering
violent
extremism
cve
programs
which
are
designed
to
target
individuals
who
may
become
terrorists
these
programs
are
a
form
of
predictive
policing
he
explained
as
they
use
an
individual
s
prior
history
to
determine
threat
scores
and
geographic
analysis
of
criminal
activity
to
assess
potential
hot
spots
arjun
believes
these
programs
are
based
on
abstract
methods
and
junk
science
that
ultimately
serve
as
another
mechanism
for
surveillance
of
muslim
citizens
arjun
argued
that
the
us
government
needs
to
begin
addressing
the
structural
racism
discrimination
and
criminalisation
that
foster
hate
and
violence
against
muslims
who
remain
disproportionately
targeted
by
american
national
security
policy
arjun
also
pointed
to
media
representations
that
encourage
islamophobia
he
cited
a
media
matters
study
conducted
on
three
days
of
media
reporting
after
the
recent
muslim
ban
their
findings
revealed
that
of
guests
on
fox
news
cnn
and
msnbc
the
three
major
broadcast
news
networks
only
guests
were
actual
muslims
viewing
the
compassion
he
brings
to
his
work
i
could
not
but
think
of
the
wisdom
of
the
founder
of
his
faith
guru
nanak
who
famously
said
those
that
have
loved
are
those
that
have
found
god
while
pakistan
has
somewhat
of
a
reputation
as
encouraging
religious
intolerance
in
fact
the
birthplace
of
guru
nanak
which
i
visited
not
long
ago
is
in
nankana
sahib
pakistan
and
i
can
report
that
it
is
spotlessly
clean

a
stunning

claimed
that
a

used
by
a

for

was
biased
against
black

the

according
to
the

similar
to
it
were
in
use
in
hundreds
of

across
the

potentially
informing
the

of
judges
and
other

the
message
seemed
clear
the
us
justice
system
reviled
for
its
racial
bias
had
turned
to
technology
for
help
only
to
find
that
the
algorithms
had
a
racial

too
how
could
this
have
happened
the
private

that

northpointe
disputed
the
conclusions
of
the
report
but
declined
to
reveal
the
inner
workings
of
the
program
which
it
considers
commercially
sensitive
the
accusation
gave
frightening
substance
to
a
worry
that
has
been
brewing
among
activists
and
computer
scientists
for
years
and
which
the
tech
giants
google
and
microsoft
have
recently
taken
steps
to
investigate
that
as

find

that
will

led
to
a

i
do

but
while
some
of
the
most
prominent
voices
in
the
industry
are
concerned
with
the
far
off
future
apocalyptic
potential
of
ai
there
is
less
attention
paid
to
the
more
immediate
problem
of
how
we
prevent
these
programs
from
amplifying
the
inequalities
of
our
past
and
affecting
the
most
vulnerable
members
of
our
society
when
the
data
we
feed
the
machines
reflects
the
history
of
our
own
unequal
society
we
are
in
effect
asking
the
program
to
learn
our
own
biases
if
you
re
not
careful
you
risk
automating
the
exact
same
biases
these
programs
are
supposed
to
eliminate
says
kristian
lum
the
lead
statistician
at
the
san
francisco
based
non
profit
human
rights
data
analysis
group
hrdag
last
year
lum
and
a
co
author
showed
that
predpol
a
program
for
police
departments
that
predicts
hotspots
where
future
crime
might
occur
could
potentially
get
stuck
in
a
feedback
loop
of
over
policing
majority
black
and
brown
neighbourhoods
the
program
was
learning
from
previous
crime
reports
for
samuel
sinyangwe
a
justice
activist
and
policy
researcher
this
kind
of
approach
is
especially
nefarious
because
police
can
say
we
re
not
being
biased
we
re
just
doing
what
the
math
tells
us
and
the
public
perception
might
be
that
the
algorithms
are
impartial
we
have
already
seen
glimpses
of
what
might
be
on
the
horizon
programs
developed
by
companies
at
the
forefront
of
ai
research
have
resulted
in
a
string
of
errors
that
look
uncannily
like
the
darker
biases
of
humanity
a
google
image
recognition
program
labelled
the
faces
of
several
black
people
as
gorillas
a
linkedin
advertising
program
showed
a
preference
for
male
names
in
searches
and
a
microsoft
chatbot
called
tay
spent
a
day
learning
from
twitter
and
began
spouting
antisemitic
messages
these
small
scale
incidents
were
all
quickly
fixed
by
the
companies
involved
and
have
generally
been
written
off
as
gaffes
but
the
compas
revelation
and
lum
s
study
hint
at
a
much
bigger
problem
demonstrating
how
programs
could
replicate
the
sort
of
large
scale
systemic
biases
that
people
have
spent
decades
campaigning
to
educate
or
legislate
away
computers
don
t
become
biased
on
their
own
they
need
to
learn
that
from
us
for
years
the
vanguard
of
computer
science
has
been
working
on
machine
learning
often
having
programs
learn
in
a
similar
way
to
humans
observing
the
world
or
at
least
the
world
we
show
them
and
identifying
patterns
in
google
researchers
fed
their
computer
brain
millions
of
images
from
youtube
videos
to
see
what
it
could
recognise
it
responded
with
blurry
black
and
white
outlines
of
human
and
cat
faces
the
program
was
never
given
a
definition
of
a
human
face
or
a
cat
it
had
observed
and
learned
two
of
our
favourite
subjects
this
sort
of
approach
has
allowed
computers
to
perform
tasks
such
as
language
translation
recognising
faces
or
recommending
films
in
your
netflix
queue
that
just
a
decade
ago
would
have
been
considered
too
complex
to
automate
but
as
the
algorithms
learn
and
adapt
from
their
original
coding
they
become
more
opaque
and
less
predictable
it
can
soon
become
difficult
to
understand
exactly
how
the
complex
interaction
of
algorithms
generated
a
problematic
result
and
even
if
we
could
private
companies
are
disinclined
to
reveal
the
commercially
sensitive
inner
workings
of
their
algorithms
as
was
the
case
with
northpointe
less
difficult
is
predicting
where
problems
can
arise
take
google
s
face

program
cats
are
uncontroversial
but
what
if
it
was
to
learn
what
british
and
american
people
think
a
ceo
looks
like
the
results
would
likely
resemble
the
near
identical
portraits
of
older
white
men
that
line
any
bank
or
corporate
lobby
and
the
program
wouldn
t
be
inaccurate
only
of
ftse
ceos
are
women
even
fewer
just
have
a
bme
background
when
computers
learn
from
us
they
can
learn
our
less
appealing
attributes
joanna
bryson
a
researcher
at
the
university
of

studied
a

designed
to
learn

between

it
trained
on
millions
of

of

from

and
began
clustering
female

with

such
as

by
how

the

gender
breakdown
of

a
nearly

people
expected

to

that
s
just
wrong
if
the

or
if
you
train

you
will
find
these

says
it
s
generally
the
most
vulnerable
in

who

a

the

map
of
likely
crime
hotspots
that
police
could
deploy
to
based
on
information
about
where
police
had
previously
made
arrests
the
program
was
suggesting
majority
black
neighbourhoods
at
about
twice
the
rate
of
white
ones
despite
the
fact
that
when
the
statisticians
modelled
the
city
s
likely
overall
drug
use
based
on
national
statistics
it
was
much
more
evenly
distributed
as
if
that
wasn

bad
enough
the
researchers
also
simulated
what
would
happen
if
police
had
acted
directly
on
predpol

hotspots
every
day
and
increased
their
arrests
accordingly
the
program
entered
a
feedback
loop
predicting
more
and
more
crime
in
the
neighbourhoods
that
police
visited
most
that
caused
still
more
police
to

a
virtual
mirror
of

criticisms
of

such
as

controversial
stop

frisk
policy
by
over

police
arrested
them
at
an
inflated

which
then
justified
further

acknowledged
the
concerns

he
claimed
that
to
combat

drug
arrests
and
other
offences
that
rely
on
the
discretion
of

were
not
used
with

because
they
are
often
more
heavily
enforced
in

minority
communities
and
while
most
of

don

hamid

an

a

group
addressing

in

says
that
people
do
recognise
predictive
policing
as
another
top
down
approach
where
policing
remains
the
same
pathologising
whole
communities
there
is
a
saying
in
computer

something
close
to
an
informal

garbage
in

out
it
means
that

are
not
magic
if
you
give
them
flawed

they
won

they
just
process
the

khan
has
his
own
truism
it
s
racism
in

out
it
s
unclear
how
existing
laws
to
protect
against

and
to
regulate
algorithmic
decision
making
apply
in
this
new
landscape
often
the
technology
moves
faster
than
governments
can
address
its
effects
in
the
cornell
university
professor
and
former
microsoft
researcher
solon
barocas
claimed
that
current
laws
largely
fail
to
address
discrimination
when
it
comes
to
big
data
and
machine
learning
barocas
says
that
many
traditional
players
in
civil
rights
including
the
american
civil
liberties
union
aclu
are
taking
the
issue
on
in
areas
such
as
housing
or
hiring
practices
sinyangwe
recently
worked
with
the
aclu
to
try
to
pass
city
level
policies
requiring
police
to
disclose
any
technology
they
adopt
including
ai
but
the
process
is
complicated
by
the
fact
that
public
institutions
adopt
technology
sold
by
private
companies
whose
inner
workings
may
not
be
transparent
we
don
t
want
to
deputise
these
companies
to
regulate
themselves
says
barocas
in
the
uk
there
are
some
existing
protections
government
services
and
companies
must
disclose
if
a
decision
has
been
entirely
outsourced
to
a
computer
and
if
so
that
decision
can
be
challenged
but
sandra
wachter
a
law
scholar
at
the
alan
turing
institute
at
oxford
university
says
that
the
existing
laws
don
t
map
perfectly
to
the
way
technology
has
advanced
there
are
a
variety
of
loopholes
that
could
allow
the
undisclosed
use
of
algorithms
she
has
called
for
a
right
to
explanation
which
would
require
a
full
disclosure
as
well
as
a
higher
degree
of
transparency
for
any
use
of
these
programs
the
scientific
literature
on
the
topic
now
reflects
a
debate
on
the
nature
of
fairness
itself
and
researchers
are
working
on
everything
from
ways
to
strip
unfair
classifiers
from
decades
of
historical
data
to
modifying
algorithms
to
skirt
round
any
groups
protected
by
existing
anti
discrimination
laws
one
researcher
at
the
turing
institute
told
me
the
problem
was
so
difficult
because
changing
the
variables
can
introduce
new
bias
and
sometimes
we
re
not
even
sure
how
bias
affects
the
data
or
even
where
it
is
the
institute
has
developed
a
program
that
tests
a
series
of
counterfactual
propositions
to
track
what
affects
algorithmic
decisions
would
the
result
be
the
same
if
the
person
was
white
or
older
or
lived
elsewhere
but
there
are
some
who
consider
it
an
impossible
task
to
integrate
the
various
definitions
of
fairness
adopted
by
society
and
computer
scientists
and
still
retain
a
functional
program
in
many
ways
we
re
seeing
a
response
to
the
naive
optimism
of
the
earlier
days
barocas

just
two

articles
credulously
claiming
isn

this
great
these
things
are
going
to
eliminate
bias
from
hiring
decisions

everything
else

computer

face
an
unfamiliar
challenge

work
necessarily
looks

text
introduction
every
year
federal
state
and
local
governments
invest
more
than
billion
to
provide
housing
for
people
who
cannot
otherwise
afford
shelter
n
in
addition
to
this
housing
assistance
policymakers
also
make
a
variety
of
choices
that
impact
the
landscape
of
affordable
housing
including
in
zoning
infrastructure
housing
finance
more
broadly
and
in
a
myriad
of
other
policy
domains
n
these
policies
can
make
a
profound
difference
for
the
millions
of
individuals
and
families
helped
but
are
too
often
undertaken
with
only
the
vaguest
visceral
sense
of
their
consequences
beyond
the
bare
facts
of
putting
roofs
over
people
s
heads
however
affordable
housing
policy
is
beginning
to
experience
a
shift
in
perspective
to
the
extent
that
policymakers
have
collected
data
on
impact
the
focus
traditionally
has
been
primarily
on
outputs
these
measures
included
the
number
of
units
built
through
a
given
investment
the
number
of
people
served
under
a
given
program
the
number
of
construction
or
property
management
jobs
created
and
the
like
but
outputs
are
not
always
indeed
not
often
the
same
as
outcomes
the
actual
short
and
long
term
consequences
of
policy
interventions
for
those
served
by
affordable
housing
programs
and
the
communities
at
issue
n
in
recent
years
researchers
and
policymakers
have
begun
to
evaluate
the
results
of
policy
interventions
for
people
in
subsidized
housing
on
measures
such
as
income
educational
achievement
physical
and
mental
health
and
even
subjective
wellbeing
n
rather
than
merely
track
whether
people
have
housing
at
a
given
level
of
affordability
this
new
focus
understands
that
housing
is
a
platform
for
a
variety
of
life
outcomes
and
that
housing
policy
choices
can
meaningfully
impact
the
arc
of
those
outcomes
this
emphasis
on
outcome
measures
reflects
a
broader
embrace
of
the
use
of
data
for
decision
making
by
managers
and
policymakers
across
the
private
and
public
sectors
n
the
ability
to
collect
data
in
a
more
rigorous
and
systematic
way
and
the
development
of
tools
to
make
that
information
actionable
particularly
to
make
transparent
patterns
that
would
otherwise
be
opaque
is
beginning
to
change
a
range
of
decisional
processes
this
shift
can
been
seen
in
everything
from
how
professional
baseball
teams
select
players
to
how
facebook
google
and
other
companies
target
their
advertising
to
how
investors
seek
value
n
and
data
increasingly
means
big
data
an
admittedly
fuzzy
and
arguably
hackneyed
concept
that
roughly
refers
to
the
use
of
relatively
large
data
sets
often
aggregated
across
previously
disconnected
areas
mined
for
the
predictive
value
of
underlying
patterns
and
trends
n
although
much
has
been
written
about
data
driven
policymaking
the
specific
role
of
the
legal
system
in
improving
program
design
and
implementation
deserves
deeper
exploration
n
across
a
range
of
affordable
housing
examples
explored
below
n
new
data
tools
are
starting
to
sharpen
policy
but
also
creating
a
positive
feedback
loop
in
which
agencies
provide
data
to
grantees
to
shape
how
they
implement
policy
gather
more
information
about
outcomes
and
then
share
all
of
that
information
with
other
regulators
or
advocates
to
help
advance
other
legal
mandates
notably
around
enforcement
and
private
rights
of
action
the
confluence
then
between
emerging
analytic
tools
and
a
deepening
understanding
of
the
connection
between
inputs
and
outcomes
makes
affordable
housing
a
particularly
fruitful
policy
arena
in
which
to
explore
law
s
potential
to
generate
as
well
as
facilitate
the
deployment
of
data
to
improve
policy
n
new
data
analytic
tools
are
by
no
means
a
panacea
incorporating
big
data
into
affordable
housing
law
and
policy
raises
serious
concerns
that
are
well
rehearsed
in
the
literature
but
worth
reiterating
in
this
context
on
a
structural
level
data
quality
and
integrity
poses
a
basic
challenge
as
does
the
perennial
risk
that
policies
driven
by
what
can
be
measured
such
as
bricks
and
mortar
metrics
will
inherently
misdirect
resources
away
from
goals
that
are
less
quantifiable
such
as
policies
that
reflect
the
felt
experience
of
people
living
in
communities
of
concentrated
poverty
legal
scholars
have
also
raised
important
concerns
about
privacy
and
data
security
and
perhaps
most
importantly
there
is
a
genuine
risk
that
the
very
people
whose
lives
should
be
at
the
center
of
affordable
housing
policy
will
be
even
more
marginalized
than
they
currently
are
when
measurability
is
privileged
over
meaning
there
are
potential
answers
to
each
of
these
concerns
data
must
be
taken
in
context
and
with
appropriate
skepticism
data
should
be
anonymized
and
aggregated
to
the
extent
possible
and
policymakers
must
find
ways
to
be
sensitive
to
the
dignitary
harms
that
attend
quantification
but
an
alternative
that
fails
to
measure
impact
is
hardly
palatable
and
the
potential
benefits
of
enhancing
the
ability
of
policymakers
to
understand
the
consequences
of
their
actions
can
actually
advance
the
dignitary
interests
of
those
served
by
affordable
housing
policy
this
all
may
seem
somewhat
technical
and
dry
rarely
has
the
heart
fluttered
for
the
ephemeral
value
of
well
analytics
those
motivated
to
engage
in
affordable
housing
or
other
areas
of
poverty
law
and
policy
by
compassion
may
recoil
at
discussions
of
number
crunching
that
is
entirely
understandable
but
data
and
compassion
need
not
stand
in
opposition
for
policy
to
be
effective
we
need
both
the
article
is
organized
as
follows
part
i
describes
big
data
s
potential
for
policy
making
and
the
emerging
shift
in
affordable
housing
policy
from
outputs
to
understanding
broader
measures
of
outcomes
part
ii
then
looks
at
several
areas
where
data
analytics
are
either
currently
changing
approaches
to
affordable
housing
policy
or
where
there
is
particularly
strong
potential
for
such
a
shift
by
no
means
an
exhaustive
list
but
illustrative
from
these
examples
the
part
then
synthesizes
what
this
reveals
about
the
role
of
law
in
generating
data
and
deploying
data
finally
part
iii
highlights
reasons
for
caution
and
some
responses
before
turning
to
the
substance
of
this
article
i
want
to
break
the
authorial
fourth
wall
for
a
moment
to
address
a
question
about
our
current
context
this
article
grew
in
part
out
of
my
experience
working
in
the
u
s
department
of
housing
and
urban
development
hud
general
counsel
s
office
early
in
the
first
obama
administration
n
there
i
worked
with
the
team
that
developed
the
agency
s
affirmatively
furthering
fair
housing
affh
rules
i
was
also
exposed
to
the
agency
s
work
discussed
below
to
embrace
data
driven
decision
making
more
generally
n
since
beginning
this
article
however
the
election
of
donald
trump
has
injected
uncertainty
into
affordable
and
fair
housing
policy
especially
with
dr
ben
carson
s
appointment
as
secretary
of
housing
and
urban
development
n
to
the
extent
that
dr
carson
has
a
record
with
respect
to
hud
s
mission
it
consists
primarily
of
voicing
skepticism
about
the
ability
of
the
government
to
address
segregation
n
although
dr
carson
in
his
confirmation
hearing
seemed
more
open
to
the
work
of
the
agency
n
this
together
with
the
trump
administration
s
general
skepticism
about
regulation
might
cast
some
of
what
this
article
argues
in
doubt
although
it
is
certainly
too
early
to
know
but
it
is
not
clear
that
data
will
be
less
important
even
if
hud
moves
away
from
promoting
integration
economic
opportunity
deconcentration
of
poverty
and
other
goals
broader
than
simply
subsidizing
housing
moreover
the
longer
term
trend
will
still
favor
data
driven
decision
making
state
and
local
efforts
will
continue
and
seeds
planted
in
recent
years
may
flower
in
other
domains
i
why
might
big
data
matter
to
affordable
housing
policy
this
section
provides
a
brief
primer
on
big
data
s
potential
for
policy
improvement
it
then
turns
to
the
start
of
the
embrace
of
outcome
driven
policymaking
in
affordable
housing
big
data
and
outcome
driven
policymaking
of
course
are
not
synonymous
the
former
has
many
applications
and
the
latter
does
not
require
novel
data
tools
but
their
intersection
raises
intriguing
possibilities
a
big
data
and
policy
to
state
the
obvious
policymakers
have
long
relied
on
data
to
make
decisions
indeed
categorization
record
keeping
sorting
and
similar
bureaucratic
informational
management
tools
have
so
long
been
inherent
to
the
administrative
state
that
we
rarely
pause
to
note
the
ubiquity
of
the
phenomenon
n
in
this
sense
modern
policy
has
always
been
data
driven
n
and
a
broad
array
of
policymakers
have
embraced
the
idea
of
evidence
based
interventions
n
what
is
changing
today
is
the
availability
of
significantly
more
data
and
more
powerful
computing
capabilities
n
big
data
is
one
of
those
clich
d
terms
that
is
hard
to
pin
down
precisely
and
it
is
not
necessary
to
do
so
here
generally
though
the
term
encompasses
a
set
of
related
phenomena
n
first
big
data
refers
to
the
capacity
to
collect
and
aggregate
massive
datasets
and
similar
information
this
is
what
is
big
about
the
phenomenon
as
opposed
to
well
just
data
n
before
i
started
research
for
this
article
i
had
no
idea
what
an
exabyte
was
turns
out
to
be
one
billion
gigabytes
and
a
gigabyte
is
about
the
amount
of
data
it
takes
to
digitally
store
a
feature
length
movie
n
but
the
world
is
apparently
currently
generating
two
and
a
half
times
that
much
data
every
day
n
second
big
data
also
often
involves
the
aggregation
of
information
across
heterogeneous
sources
billions
of
twitter
posts
can
reveal
certain
information
but
twitter
posts
correlated
to
other
social
media
inputs
adds
new
insights
social
media
posts
correlated
to
seemingly
disconnected
data
about
say
where
people
live
and
their
spending
habits
may
reveal
even
deeper
patterns
third
big
data
generally
refers
to
a
set
of
analytic
tools
that
can
mine
and
activate
that
data
these
new
capabilities
are
facilitated
not
only
by
the
digital
footprints
people
increasingly
leave
as
they
navigate
the
online
world
but
also
by
the
spread
of
new
sensing
technologies
n
these
analytics
can
be
used
for
actionable
prediction
not
just
to
understand
past
trends
but
to
offer
insights
into
how
to
act
moving
forward
the
most
important
caveats
to
this
somewhat
idealized
version
of
the
promise
of
big
data
are
discussed
below
n
but
for
policymakers
it
is
this
last
function
impact
evaluation
and
prediction
that
has
the
greatest
relevance
examples
of
the
use
of
big
data
are
becoming
increasingly
common
for
example
google
famously
began
real
time
tracking
of
flu
outbreaks
in
by
linking
common
search
terms
with
flu
data
from
the
centers
for
disease
control
n
google
also
transformed
spell
checking
from
an
educated
guess
by
engineers
at
the
most
common
errors
and
their
corrections
to
a
much
more
accurate
approach
that
harnessed
a
massive
database
of
actual
errors
and
the
way
people
corrected
them
n
similar
examples
of
information
aggregation
and
new
analytic
capabilities
abound
in
the
private
sector
and
are
becoming
increasingly
central
to
managerial
planning
and
decision
making
n
policymakers
are
also
recognizing
the
value
of
these
emerging
tools
perhaps
most
controversially
defense
and
national
security
agencies
such
as
the
cia
nsa
and
department
of
defense
have
embraced
big
data
raising
significant
civil
liberties
and
privacy
concerns
n
more
prosaically
big
data
is
becoming
increasingly
important
in
fields
such
as
public
safety
n
traffic
management
n
public
health
n
fraud
prevention
n
and
many
other
areas
n
to
see
the
potential
for
affordable
housing
we
need
to
delve
into
another
emerging
trend
the
shift
from
outputs
to
outcomes
in
that
policy
arena
b
from
outputs
to
outcomes
in
affordable
housing
traditionally
affordable
housing
policymakers
have
focused
on
outputs
but
are
beginning
to
focus
on
outcomes
this
shift
has
the
potential
to
open
much
broader
horizons
to
improve
how
affordable
housing
is
developed
and
delivered
to
the
extent
that
policymakers
have
tracked
the
results
of
inputs
such
as
subsidies
or
less
direct
interventions
in
housing
they
have
long
focused
on
the
immediate
results
of
a
given
program
or
policy
for
instance
hud
has
long
monitored
and
reported
on
basic
measures
relating
to
housing
such
as
the
number
of
units
built
or
supported
construction
and
management
jobs
created
as
well
some
indicia
of
the
quality
of
the
resulting
housing
such
as
levels
of
overcrowding
n
even
as
hud
has
moved
in
recent
years
to
broaden
its
planning
and
evaluation
horizon
the
department
still
focuses
to
a
large
extent
on
metrics
that
concretely
measure
immediate
outputs
for
example
in
its
five
year
strategic
plan
for
the
period
from
to
the
department
listed
a
comprehensive
series
of
goals
related
to
housing
notable
examples
included
the
number
of
households
experiencing
worst
case
housing
needs
which
hud
defines
as
having
an
income
below
fifty
percent
of
area
median
income
ami
not
receiving
public
assistance
and
paying
more
than
half
of
income
on
rent
living
in
severely
inadequate
conditions
or
both
n
the
proportion
of
very
low
income
renters
facing
severe
rent
burdens
n
the
percentage
of
rental
units
built
in
the
preceding
four
years
that
are
affordable
to
very
low
income
renters
n
and
the
production
of
rental
units
n
these
are
very
important
core
metrics
and
the
fact
that
the
department
has
set
clear
quantifiable
goals
around
its
central
mission
is
commendable
nevertheless
these
output
measures
say
relatively
little
about
the
lives
of
the
people
in
the
housing
or
the
larger
community
impacts
of
the
housing
investments
and
other
policy
interventions
other
performance
indicators
in
the
hud
strategic
plan
do
attempt
to
measure
the
difference
federal
investments
are
making
for
recipients
beyond
these
immediate
output
indicators
for
example
under
the
heading
of
economic
prosperity
hud
now
tracks
the
p
ercentage
of
participants
enrolled
in
the
fss
family
self
sufficiency
program
who
have
increased
wages
n
that
begins
to
get
at
the
connection
between
housing
and
consequences
for
residents
linking
a
housing
facilitated
policy
intervention
to
employment
outcomes
yet
in
other
places
the
department
decries
the
lack
of
performance
measures
around
topics
such
as
health
outcomes
n
as
noted
at
the
outset
however
researchers
and
policymakers
are
starting
to
link
housing
to
longer
term
life
outcomes
more
thoroughly
for
example
raj
chetty
nathanial
hendren
and
lawrence
katz
recently
published
the
results
of
a
study
of
hud
s
moving
to
opportunity
experimental
voucher
program
under
the
experiment
hud
offered
randomly
selected
families
subsidies
to
move
from
high
to
low
poverty
neighborhoods
allowing
researchers
to
compare
relatively
similar
families
who
did
not
have
the
same
opportunity
the
researchers
found
that
children
who
moved
before
age
thirteen
had
a
thirty
one
percent
higher
average
income
were
sixteen
percent
more
likely
to

a

of
questions
among

one
how
can

realistically
operationalize
this

n
among

things
doing

requires
gathering
and
understanding
significant
amounts
of
information
which
is
most
likely
why

have
often
focused
on
much
simpler
metrics
such
as
the

of

in

of

we

turn
to
the

where
the

is
beginning
to
emerge
in
affordable

as
well
as

of

to
have

these

are
of
necessity
addressed
below
at
a
fairly
high
level
of
generality
but
should
give
a
sense
of
some
primary
areas
of
affordable

policy
and
practice
where
new
data
tools
have
particular
potential
the
part
thus
concludes
with
some
reflections
on
what
these
examples
suggest
for
the
role
of

effects
the
first
step
beyond
simple
outcomes
metrics
in
affordable
housing
involves
the
impact
of
neighborhood
and
regional
context
which
means
that
locational
choice
is
particularly
amenable
to
emerging
analytics
hud
s
new
policy
framework
around
affh
provides
a
modest
but
promising
attempt
to
use
data
to
address
among
other
goals
the
locational
consequences
of
housing
siting
decisions
the
policy
grows
out
of
the
federal
fair
housing
act
s
mandate
that
recipients
of
federal
housing
funding
affirmatively
further
the
purposes
of
the
act
n
in
a
recently
adopted
rule
n
hud
has
created
a
national
planning
framework
under
which
the
department
will
supply
data
to
state
and
local
governments
and
public
housing
agencies
phas
across
the
country
almost
all
local
governments
get
hud
funding
and
there
are
thousands
of
phas
with
a
range
of
uniform
data
on
integration
and
segregation
housing
needs
and
indicia
of
economic
opportunity
n
the
rule
then
requires
that
these
program
participants
engage
in
their
own
analysis
of
fair
housing
based
on
that
data
and
their
own
additional
insights
to
identify
integration
and
segregation
patterns
and
trends
based
on
race
color
religion
sex
familial
status
national
origin
and
disability
within
the
jurisdiction
and

racially
or
ethnically
concentrated

and

significant
disparities
in
access
to

for
any
protected
class
within
the
jurisdiction
and
region
and
disproportionate
housing
needs
for
any
protected
class
within
the
jurisdiction
and
region
n
this
data
driven
exercise
is
a
significant
advance
and
has
the
potential
to
shed
light
on
a
wide
range
of
decisions
that
local
governments
and
phas
make
that
are
currently
without
a
great
deal
of
context
for
example
understanding
longitudinal
patterns
of
the
demographics
of
housing
need
can
help
inform
siting
decisions
and
shape
affirmative
marketing
plans
it
can
also
help
policymakers
understand
questions
such
as
concentration
and
agglomeration
effects
n
each
jurisdiction
will
use
the
data
differently
but
the
underlying
theory
is
that
grantees
will
not
only
address
obvious
barriers
to
fair
housing
choice
but
will
also
deploy
the
planning
tool
data
to
guide
housing
siting
will
also
target
enforcement
resources
and
make
other
policy
decisions
in
light
of
the
patterns
that
the
data
reveals
one
challenge
in
this
emerging
framework
is
that
the
data
tools
that
the
agency
and
its
grantees
rely
on
are
relatively
broad
scale
in
that
they
by
necessity
must
be
available
for
every
jurisdiction
in
the
country
metrics
such
as
neighborhood
demographics
racial
and
ethnic
concentration
of
poverty
school
quality
job
proximity
transit
costs
and
environmental
health
reveal
a
great
deal
about
broad
patterns
and
context
for
housing
policy
choices
but
require
a
significant
amount
of
interpretation
to
shape
decision
making
n
here
big
data
can
produce
a
richer
understanding
of
the
link
between
inputs
and
outcomes
in
terms
of
the
consequences
of
locational
choice
new
tools
can
do
so
by
introducing
much
greater
detail
in
terms
of
specific
communities
but
also
by
helping
to
tackle
one
of
the
greatest
challenges
in
understanding
impact
the
longitudinal
effects
of
policy
interventions
the
affh
framework
can
give
an
accurate
point
in
time
picture
of
where
the
categories
protected
by
the
fair
housing
act
intersect
with
opportunity
and
housing
investments
but
it
will
take
additional
data
and
more
sophisticated
analytical
tools
to
ferret
out
how
that
context
changes
in
light
of
specific
policy
choices
ultimately
these
tools
could
not
only
target
community
level
outcomes
but
potentially
even
city
wide
and
metro
level
shifts
if
aggregated
across
localities
they
could
also
help
policymakers
focus
on
broader
outcomes
such
as
neighborhood
change
tracking
for
example
the
pace
of
gentrification
and
displacement
from
various
public
investments
this
will
not
make
the
decision
to
put
a
given
housing
development
in
site
a
versus
site
b
necessarily
easier
given
the
significant
market
and
political
constraints
on
all
affordable
housing
nor
will
it
resolve
the
debate
about
place
versus
mobility
n
nevertheless
it
can
at
least
make
the
consequences
of
individual
subsidy
decisions
and
the
larger
structure
of
subsidies
more
transparent
housing
portfolio
management
a
second
general
arena
of
affordable
housing
policy
in
which
new
data
tools
have
particular
promise
involves
market
conditions
as
well
as
the
oversight
and
management
of
housing
assets
in
these
examples
the
emphasis
is
less
on
data
sharpening
our
understanding
of
where
to
deploy
resources
in
terms
of
outcomes
and
more
on
using
technology
to
aggregate
information
to
improve
affordable
housing
practice
and
pragmatic
policy
implementation
a
subsidy
targeting
and
market
conditions
big
data
tools
can
be
useful
in
understanding
how
rent
subsidy
levels
align
with
market
conditions
as
matthew
desmond
recently
argued
better
targeting
of
subsidies
could
free
up
substantial
housing
resources
n
the
challenge
as
desmond
points
out
is
that
the
broader
the
area
for
which
rent
subsidy
levels
are
set
the
more
over
and
under
inclusive
they
are
likely
to
be
compensating
landlords
in
some
neighborhoods
above
market
while
simultaneously
preventing
mobility
to
higher
income
areas
hud
has
begun
to
shift
from
metropolitan
level
housing
choice
voucher
fair
market
rents
to
much
more
targeted
zip
code
level
measures
in
those
metropolitan
areas
that
are
facing
problems
with
voucher
holders
being
concentrated
in
high
poverty
neighborhoods
n
but
this
is
a
pilot
program
and
it
only
targets
a
subset
of
markets
in
a
single
program
by
aggregating
information
about
much
more
narrowly
targeted
market
rents
as
well
a
host
of
related
transactional
data
policymakers
could
get
a
much
more
fine
grained
window
into
market
conditions
and
thus
appropriate
subsidy
levels
across
a
range
of
programs
n
b
enforcement
and
housing
quality
new
capacities
to
aggregate
and
analyze
large
data
streams
likewise
hold
promise
to
help
policymakers
more
efficiently
and
effectively
ensure
the
quality
of
housing
and
target
interventions
to
remedy
housing
quality
issues
currently
local
governments
collect
a
great
deal
of
property
level
data
from
code
enforcement
nuisance
complaints
fire
and
police
dispatches
and
other
sources
while
states
and
the
federal
government
collect
information
about
housing
quality
through
subsidy
programs
but
rarely
is
this
information
brought
together
let
alone
used
in
a
way
to
improve
oversight
n
this
kind
of
aggregation
could
be
particularly
important
in
the
context
of
the
link
between
housing
quality
and
health
outcomes
for
example
the
evidence
linking
indoor
lead
paint
and
problems
with
childhood
development
is
overwhelmingly
clear
n
no
comprehensive
database
of
lead
in
housing
exists
although
some
state
and
local
governments
do
track
lead
paint
inspections
and
violations
n
a
big
data
approach
could
consolidate
multiple
sources
of
information
home
inspections
transactional
data
lead
law
citations
complaints
and
provide
a
much
more
comprehensive
picture
not
only
of
the
landscape
of
risk
but
also
of
more
or
less
effective
mitigation
n
there
are
many
other
examples
where
data
can
improve
policy
around
the
nexus
of
housing
and
health
outcomes
including
indoor
air
quality
vectors
of
chronic
illness
related
to
damp
cold
and
mold
and
even
injuries
n
big
data
could
also
be
used
to
track
better
and
worse
landlords
both
to
target
enforcement
resources
and
ultimately
to
influence
choices
about
which
housing
developers
or
managers
should
receive
assistance
hud
currently
manages
a
process
known
colloquially
as
the
process
to
spot
providers
who
pose
particular
financial
or
operational
risks
n
hud
recently
revamped
this
process
n
which
until
relatively
recently
involved
paper
submissions
and
individual
review
but
both
hud
and
other
housing
providers
often
have
challenges
assessing
the
risk
of
potential
grantees
let
alone
using
past
performance
to
influence
subsidy
decisions
in
conditions
of
scarcity
bringing
information
about
providers
their
management
structures
and
their
past
experience
not
only
with
specific
subsidy
programs
but
with
other
housing
ventures
could
not
only
streamline
this
kind
of
past
participation
review
but
could
also
help
policymakers
understand
the
operational
and
managerial
factors
that
distinguish
lower
risk
partners
from
higher
risk
partners
c
unifying
the
subsidized
and
unsubsidized
housing
portfolio
in
this
vein
new
data
tools
may
have
particular
promise
in
finding
practical
ways
to
bridge
the
subsidized
and
unsubsidized
portfolios
of
affordable
housing
for
understandable
reasons
affordable
housing
policy
tends
to
focus
on
the
portion
of
the
housing
stock
available
to
low
income
residents
that
is
publicly
subsidized
as
harvard
s
joint
center
for
housing
studies
has
noted
however
about
three
quarters
of
the
stock
of
affordable
housing
is
unsubsidized
n
the
portion
of
the
portfolio
that
is
not
part
of
any
direct
subsidy
program
is
often
relatively
invisible
to
policymakers
tends
not
to
be
supervised
in
any
meaningful
way
except
to
the
extent
the
portfolio
intersects
with
nuisance
claims
and
individual
code
enforcement
and
is
not
integrated
into
holistic
programs
n
with
improved
data
collection
and
analytics
it
would
be
possible
to
start
to
unify
this
shadow
n
inventory
with
the
much
more
transparent
subsidized
portfolio
in
a
variety
of
ways
from
gathering
cost
data
related
to
development
and
operations
to
including
outcomes
related
to
the
unsubsidized
portfolio
in
locational
analyses
to
offering
tools
to
assist
with
property
management
and
tenant
relations
new
aggregation
tools
could
also
be
used
to
better
connect
residents
in
the
shadow
portfolio
to
the
kinds
of
services
often
more
readily
available
to
residents
of
the
subsidized
portfolio
resident
relations
and
services
moving
finally
from
subsidy
market
conditions
and
portfolio
management
to
individual
residents
there
is
much
that
a
big
data
approach
to
affordable
housing
could
facilitate
in
terms
of
individual
residents
to
begin
data
aggregation
tools
can
be
used
to
track
demand
and
even
help
with
wait
lists
to
foster
more
functional
even
potentially
regional
markets
in
many
cities
wait
lists
for
available
subsidized
housing
can
be
months
and
in
some
high
demand
jurisdictions
even
years
long
n
given
the
mix
of
subsidies
as
well
as
the
reality
that
much
of
the
housing
that
might
serve
low
income
communities
is
not
subsidized
low
income
housing
markets
are
often
fragmented
and
challenging
to
navigate
n
jurisdictions
could
benefit
from
clearinghouses
or
unified
waiting
lists
with
new
data
tools
greatly
enhancing
the
ability
of
providers
to
match
demand
an
even
more
significant
way
to
use
new
data
aggregation
and
analytical
tools
would
be
to
build
on
the
idea
of
housing
as
a
platform
to
make
that
platform
work
better
across
social
services
housing
is
a
particularly
appropriate
locus
for
a
wide
range
of
interventions
from
educational
support
for
children
living
in
affordable
housing
to
job
training
for
adults
to
a
range
of
wrap
around
services
for
the
formerly
homeless
in
a
housing
first
approach
n
big
data
could
be
used
here
both
to
target
services
and
to
understand
the
consequences
of
those
interventions
in
terms
of
targeting
given
that
many
residents
of
affordable
housing
encounter
services
across
a
range
of
areas
providers
could
access
multiple
sources
of
information
to
understand
the
needs
of
their
clients
without
residents
having
to
aggregate
that
information
themselves
in
terms
of
impacts
understanding
the
outcomes
of
various
services
could
help
providers
over
time
focus
on
the
relative
efficacy
of
individual
supports
and
the
appropriate
mix
of
support
over
large
populations
being
served
this
kind
of
an
approach
is
not
distinctive
to
affordable
housing
and
social
service
agencies
could
use
any
other
point
of
entry
if
however
policymakers
could
match
education
records
employment
records
family
disruption
data
and
myriad
other
sources
they
could
potentially
target
assistance
with
much
greater
efficacy
b
synthesis
and
reflections
on
the
role
of
law
to
take
a
step
back
and
synthesize
the
examples
above
they
generally
point
to
several
functions
for
big
data
to
improve
affordable
housing
policy
first
new
data
tools
can
improve
policymakers
ability
to
target
resources
whether
in
terms
of
direct
subsidies
enforcement
activities
or
the
larger
policy
context
in
which
affordable
housing
exists
second
and
perhaps
most
promising
in
the
short
run
new
data
tools
can
help
policymakers
providers
and
advocates
coordinate
across
silos
vertically
technology
can
better
integrate
federal
state
and
local
operations
horizontally
data
tools
can
help
bridge
gaps
across
agencies
at
each
level
of
government
as
well
as
across
states
and
localities
at
the
sub
federal
level
where
appropriate
if
big
data
did
nothing
else
but
facilitate
this
kind
of
information
sharing
it
would
still
have
great
potential
to
improve
the
provision
of
services
respond
to
regional
housing
needs
and
link
housing
data
to
other
inputs
such
as
environmental
quality
public
safety
employment
opportunities
and
education
just
as
the
affh
approach
has
begun
to
do
finally
new
data
tools
could
add
private
information
to
the
decisional
matrix
and
to
understanding
outcomes
this
is
perhaps
most
challenging
legally
but
also
where
law
has
the
clearest
role
to
play
to
be
clear
in
the
immediate
term
policymakers
may
find
the
best
value
in
what
might
be
called
medium
data
n
rather
than
attempting
to
connect
the
dots
from
billions
of
data
points
akin
to
searches
on
google
policymakers
in
affordable
housing
may
be
able
to
utilize
new
analytic
capabilities
to
make
predictions
about
subsidies
and
related
policy
choices
by
aggregating
relatively
accessible
information
about
market
conditions
demographics
specific
properties
and
subsidies
the
longer
term
potential
to
increase
this
to
a
much
more
sophisticated
look
at
for
example
dynamics
of
neighborhood
change
and
the
relative
impacts
of
various
policy
levers
is
intriguing
but
should
not
deter
from
shorter
term
more
manageable
deployment
this
is
not
to
be
na

ve
about
the
genuine
costs
and
other
practical
barriers
to
implementing
any
data
effort
that
would
truly
yield
new
insights
at
scale
n
the
most
obvious
reason
why
affordable
housing
policymakers
have
defaulted
to
simple
output
measures
to
the
extent
that
they
have
tracked
outcomes
is
that
it
is
just
simply
hard
to
do
anything
more
perhaps
if
the
value
of
tracking
and
making
predictions
about
impact
through
new
data
tools
were
clearer
the
cost
benefit
might
shift
but
given
the
choice
between
investing
in
sophisticated
analytics
or
investing
in
another
unit
of
housing
most
rational
subsidy
or
housing
providers
will
tend
to
prefer
the
immediate
impact
of
a
roof
over
the
head
of
someone
in
need
one
answer
may
come
by
looking
to
hud
s
approach
to

which
shows
the
potential
role
for
federal
investment
in
data
tools
if
local
governments
public
housing
authorities
and
non
profit
housing
providers
do
not
have
the
resources
to
invest
in
analytics
and
most
do
not
then
the
federal
government
can
step
in
and
do
so
at
scale
indeed
hud
has
recently
launched
a
broad
scale
initiative
as
part
of
an
interagency
agreement
with
the
census
department
to
provide
qualified
researchers
with
access
to
certain
hud
sponsored
evaluation
datasets
n
this
agency
data
democratization
effort
is
slated
to
expand
to
a
broad
range
of
hud
administrative
and
other
information
sources
n
ideally
information
could
flow
not
only
to
researchers
but
from
researchers
to
providers
and
policymakers
n
if
affordable
housing
provides
numerous
examples
of
where
new
data
tools
can
help
shape
policy
it
is
possible
at
this
juncture
to
focus
on
how
law
can
improve
the
flow
of
that
information
currently
statutory
and
administrative
mandates
play
a
relatively
modest
role
in
either
generating
or
utilizing
the
potential
of
big
data
law
is
essentially
mostly
parasitic
to
data
efforts
if
not
directly
a
hindrance
but
there
can
be
a
dialectic
relationship
between
law
and
data
for
policy
making
legal
mandates
can
help
bring
information
to
the
surface
and
can
create
structures
to
capture
and
facilitate
the
analysis
of
that
information
that
information
can
then
be
used
to
sharpen
policy
the
new
affh
framework
for
example
reflects
an
agency
implementing
a
statutory
mandate
through
planning
tools
that
aggregate
information
across
a
variety
of
sources
that
mix
government
generated
data
with
information
collected
on
a
mandatory
basis
from
grantees
grantees
then
deploy
this
data
to
analyze
plan
and
act
the
results
of
this
nexus
can
then
be
collected
and
fed
back
to
grantees
to
identify
more
or
less
effective
policies
thus
the
legal
system
is
facilitating
the
generation
of
data
data
are
aggregated
and
deployed
to
guide
policy
decisions
and
the
process
is
then
iterated
equally
important
patterns
revealed
through
this
cycle
which
might
otherwise
be
hard
to
see
can
help
inform
how
regulators
and
advocates
advance
other
legal
mandates
including
enforcement
and
private
rights
of
action
data
and
deeper
structural
analysis
can
thus
be
used
in
tandem
with
substantive
liability
standards
to
target
issues
like
discrimination
this
could
be
the
basis
for
litigation
whether
individual
or
structural
the
home
mortgage
disclosure
act
hmda
particularly
after
amendments
in
that
made
much
more
detailed
information
about
the
demographics
of
applicants
and
borrowers
required
n
is
a
model
for
this
dynamic
under
hmda
lenders
are
required
to
provide
detailed
information
about
lending
practices
which
advocates
and
regulators
can
then
use
to
challenge
patterns
of
discrimination
n
thus
the
law
requires
private
actors
to
disclose
activity
and
that
disclosure
can
reveal
patterns
that
yield
liability
and
most
importantly
change
behavior
n
iii
big
data
s
dark
side
caveats
and
some
responses
to
this
point
it
would
be
fair
to
read
this
article
as
something
of
an
unalloyed
paean
to
big
data
s
potential
value
for
affordable
housing
but
there
are
a
number
of
reasons
to
be
cautious
in
any
exploration
of
the
phenomenon
s
potential
several
caveats
emerge
from
the
literature
on
big
data
worth
attending
to
both
from
a
structural
perspective
and
in
terms
of
the
individuals
that
are
the
inevitable
subjects
to
use
that
term
advisedly
of
any
big
data
project
to
begin
with
structural
concerns
many
commentators
have
noted
that
big
data
as
much
as
traditional
data
and
perhaps
more
so
has
the
potential
to
suffer
from
basic
challenges
with
informational
quality
n
moreover
it
is
not
just
that
the
quality
of
any
analysis
is
inherently
limited
by
the
quality
of
the
sources
and
maintaining
data
governance
can
be
a
costly
exercise
measurability
itself
can
be
a
misleading
proxy
for
policy
outcomes
that
might
be
harder
to
quantify
but
are
no
less
or
even
more
important
n
these
alternatives
might
be
concrete
but
harder
to
measure
just
as
units
produced
are
easier
to
measure
than
long
term
subjective
well
being
but
there
is
also
the
risk
that
values
that
are
not
measurable
fairness
dignity
will
be
lost
there
are
no
definitive
answers
to
these
structural
concerns
and
the
best
response
is
not
so
much
legal
but
practical
policymakers
to
the
extent
they
are
going
to
rely
on
data
especially
the
potentially
unwieldy
reams
of
information
in
a
big
data
approach
must
focus
on
continuous
improvement
and
a
feedback
loop
that
can
come
from
actually
deploying
the
data
in
practice
data
quality
and
data
management
challenges
also
auger
strongly
for
a
measure
of
skepticism
in
not
allowing
the
data
to
be
overly
determinative
in
decision
making
as
hard
as
it
is
to
resist
the
allure
of
the
concrete
shifting
to
the
people
whose
lives
and
experiences
generate
the
data
on
which
big
data
lives
and
whose
lives
will
be
influenced
by
decisions
made
based
on
that
data
the
rise
of
new
analytic
tools
raises
genuine
concerns
not
just
about
privacy
but
also
about
the
loss
of
control
of
one
s
identity
n
closely
related
to
this
is
a
concern
with
the
risk
that
datafication
will
undermine
the
dignity
and
individual
humanity
of
the
people
being
quantified
numbers
can
speak
louder
than
individual
voices
and
seemingly
implacable
data
can
obscure
the
very
real
life
experiences
this
affects
policy
as
a
structural
matter
but
it
also
affects
people
because
it
reduces
who
they
are
to
a
series
of
numbers
and
quantifiable
outcomes
graduation
rates
health
assessments
and
the
like
and
this
can
all
exacerbate
existing
power
dynamics
that
risk
minimizing
the
agency
of
people
served
by
affordable
housing
programs
these
are
important
issues
and
clearly
policymakers
must
be
sensitive
to
the
perspectives
of
those
served
and
power
dynamics
but
they
are
ultimately
manageable
in
the
affordable
housing
context
much
of
the
data
that
would
be
a
part
of
any
effort
to
sharpen
our
understanding
of
outcomes
is
amenable
to
anonymization
and
must
be
treated
on
an
aggregated
basis
and
privacy
for
residents
as
well
as
providers
must
be
central
to
how
data
is
collected
stored
and
analyzed
but
privacy
and
the
importance
of
preserving
individual
voice
should
not
be
an
insuperable
barrier
to
gaining
practical
value
from
new
data
tools
consumers
currently
make
choices
on
a
daily
basis
to
share
information
with
technology
companies
in
order
to
improve
the
collective
information
base
available
to
all
users
when
someone
accesses
google
maps
on
a
mobile
device
they
are
both
receiving
and
sending
information
about
location
and
traffic
conditions
and
the
like
n
and
it
is
reasonable
to
trade
privacy
for
the
value
of
that
information
exchange
a
similar
dynamic
can
pertain
with
affordable
housing
and
related
areas
of
policy
more
fundamentally
it
is
worth
asking
as
compared
to
what
for
those
appropriately
concerned
about
individual
voice
and
the
dignity
of
residents
it
is
not
so
clear
that
our
current
affordable
housing
system
is
serving
the
most
vulnerable
right
now
as
well
as
it
could
indeed
it
is
fair
to
argue
that
we
do
not
pay
enough
attention
to
residents
and
clients
in
the
current
structure
of
housing
policy
n
fundamental
values
can
be
advanced
by
better
tools
and
these
are
not
ultimately
incommensurate
goals
we
can
focus
on
humanity
and
dignity
in
practice
and
use
data
to
advance
that
there
is
at
least
the
potential
that
for
all
the
problems
with
quantifiability
data
can
center
housing
policy
choices
on
outcomes
that
put
residents
rather
than
buildings
or
providers
more
clearly
at
the
center
of
policy
focus
in
many
critical
areas
of
public
policy
including
providing
affordable
housing
for
the
most
vulnerable
limited
public
resources
could
be
used
much
more
effectively
data
as
an
engine
of
decision
making
and
the
individual
dignity
of
those
served
by
public
programs
can
and
no
doubt
often
do
clash
but
they
can
just
as
well
interact
data
of
course
cannot
solve
fundamental
policy
disputes
that
implicate
not
just
comparative
outcomes
but
also
relative
and
at
times
incommensurate
priorities
as
well
as
differing
political
economies
n
thus
no
amount
of
impact
assessment
will
necessarily
conclusively
resolve
the
perennial
debate
in
housing
policy
about
mobility
versus
community
investment
n
this
debate
will
always
reflect
marginal
trade
offs
in
an
environment
of
scarcity
and
also
interaction
effects
with
other
policy
interventions
and
market
forces
but
beginning
to
understand
the
trajectory
of
the
investments
we
make
in
the
name
of
affordable
housing
can
sharpen
the
focus
of
those
investments
that
might
not
be
sufficiently
ambitious
but
would
still
be
an
improvement
conclusion
this
article
has
sought
to
illuminate
the
potential
benefits
and
significant
challenges
of
deploying
new
data
aggregation
and
analytic
tools
to
advance
affordable
housing
policy
whether
informing
siting
decisions
understanding
the
regional
housing
market
consequences
of
local
zoning
policy
transforming
management
and
resident
services
or
other
areas
of
affordable
housing
and
recognizing
the
practical
barriers
to
implementation
there
is
undeniable
promise
at
a
minimum
to
make
better
decisions
in
this
arena
we
are
beginning
to
see
a
cycle
in
which
law
facilitates
the
generation
of
data
that
can
be
grouped
across
disparate
areas
to
provide
a
clearer
picture
of
the
consequences
of
public
investments
and
other
policy
choices
that
data
can
also
be
used
to
drive
other
legal
mandates
particularly
around
enforcement
as
noted
we
must
proceed
cautiously
in
embracing
these
new
tools
they
will
remain
inherently
limited
in
their
ability
to
accurately
capture
ground
level
reality
and
they
must
be
used
with
a
keen
appreciation
for
the
people
whose
lives
are
being
measured
and
whose
voice
is
too
often
ignored
but
the
alternative
of
continuing
to
muddle
through
is
even
less
palatable

anila
daulatzai
a
pakistani
american
became
a
victim
when
on
september
she
boarded
a
flight
in
baltimore
expecting
to
land
in
los
angeles
a
few
hours
later
to
take
care
of
her
elderly
father
after
informing
flight
attendants
of
her
non
life
threatening
allergy
to
dogs
she
seated
herself
in
the
back
of
the
aircraft
away
from
two
dogs
on
the
plane
and
prepared
to
grade
her
students
papers
she
was
suddenly
requested
by
the
flight
crew
to
provide
medical
documentation
of
her
allergy
which
she
had
already
mentioned
was
not
serious
and
upon
not
being
able
to
produce
it
was
told
to
exit
the
aircraft
when
she
refused
the
police
came
and
violently
dragged
her
off
the
plane
as
seen
in
a
video
of
the
incident
that
went
viral
following
the
incident
multiple
charges
were
issued
against

including
disorderly

daulatzai
s
lawyer
arjun
sethi
classified
the
arrest
as
the
confluence
of
sexism
racial
profiling
and
discrimination
formerly
national
legislative
counsel
for
human
rights
and
national
security
related
affairs
for
the
american
civil
liberties
union
and
presently
co
chair
of
the
american
bar
association
s
national
committee
on
homeland
security
counterterrorism
and
treatment
of
enemy
combatants
arjun
has
spent
most
of
his
career
focused
on
countering
racial
and
religious
profiling
advancing
counterterrorism
reform
and
combating
hate
motivated
violence
i
first
met
arjun
who
has
a
sikh
background
a
few
years
back
following
a
talk
i
gave
at
the
national
press
club
launching
my
book
the
thistle
and
the
drone
after
the
programme
he
came
up
to
me
and
began
discussing
his
civil
and
human
rights
work
on
behalf
of
not
only
muslim
americans
but
minorities
throughout
the
us
i
was
impressed
he
was
fighting
for
justice
within
the
system
when
i
invited
arjun
to
speak
before
my
world
of
islam
class
at
american
university
recently
he
made
some
core
points
related
to
the
rise
in
hate
related
incidents
against
muslims
since
noting
they
are
trending
at
least
five
times
higher
than
prior
to
the
attacks
he
said
we
are
living
in
an
open
season
of
prejudice
against
muslims
perpetual
war
in
iraq
and
afghanistan
has
contributed
to
prevailing
negative
attitudes
he
argued
and
the
guantanamo
bay
detention
facility
in
cuba
stands
as
a
testament
to
negative
treatment
of
muslims
suspected
of
terrorist
activities
arjun
also
spoke
of
police
tactics
that
often
serve
to
perpetuate
discrimination
he
d
how
a
team
of
associated
press
reporters
revealed
that
covert
domestic
surveillance
programs
established
in
new
york
city
following
for
example
were
explicitly
designed
to
monitor
muslim
citizens
representing
an
abandonment
of
rights
to
privacy
that
all
americans
are
entitled
to
enjoy
none
of
the
surveillance
was
based
on
reasonable
suspicion
or
probable
cause
but
instead
solely
based
on
identity
the
surveillance
did
not
result
in
a
single
conviction
arjun
pointed
to
media
representations
that
encourage
islamophobia
he
cited
a
media
matters
study
conducted
on
three
days
of
media
reporting
after
the
recent
muslim
ban
their
findings
revealed
that
of
guests
on
fox
news
cnn
and
msnbc
the
three
major
broadcast
news
networks
only
guests
were
actual
muslims
these
surveillance
programs
he
noted
have
been
complemented
by
watch
lists
there
are
three
types
of
watch
lists
administered
by
the
transportation
security
administration
a
terrorist
watch
list
of
million
individuals
suspected
of
terrorist
activities
a
selectee
list
which
requires
listed
individuals
to
undergo
enhanced
screening
measures
before
flying
and
a
no
fly
list
of
some
which
forbids
listed
individuals
from
boarding
an
airplane
the
consequences
of
these
watch
lists
are
serious
those
listed
may
be
unable
to
see
their
families
or
even
apply
for
loans
and
employment
listed
individuals
are
generally
considered
too
dangerous
to
fly
but
not
dangerous
enough
to
be
arrested
which
keeps
them
in
an
uneasy
limbo
with
broad
consequences
arjun
also
discussed
the
efficacy
of
countering
violent
extremism
cve
programs
which
are
designed
to
target
individuals
who
may
become
terrorists
these
programs
are
a
form
of
predictive
policing
he
explained
as
they
use
an
individual
s
prior
history
to
determine
threat
scores
and
geographic
analysis
of
criminal
activity
to
assess
potential
hot
spots
arjun
believes
these
programs
are
based
on
abstract
methods
and
junk
science
that
ultimately
serve
as
another
mechanism
for
surveillance
of
muslim
citizens
arjun
argued
that
the
us
government
needs
to
begin
addressing
the
structural
racism
discrimination
and
criminalisation
that
foster
hate
and
violence
against
muslims
who
remain
disproportionately
targeted
by
american
national
security
policy
arjun
also
pointed
to
media
representations
that
encourage
islamophobia
he
cited
a
media
matters
study
conducted
on
three
days
of

their
findings
revealed
that
of
guests
on
fox

cnn
and
msnbc
the
three
major
broadcast
news
networks
only
guests
were
actual
muslims
viewing
the
compassion
he
brings
to
his
work
i
could
not
but
think
of
the
wisdom
of
the
founder
of
his
faith
guru
nanak
who
famously
said
those
that
have
loved
are
those
that
have
found
god
while
pakistan
has
somewhat
of
a
reputation
as
encouraging
religious
intolerance
in
fact
the
birthplace
of
guru
nanak
which
i
visited
not
long
ago
is
in
nankana
sahib
pakistan
and
i
can
report
that
it
is
spotlessly
clean
and
tended
with
special
reverence
and
affection
by
the
local
administration
here
in
america
arjun
sethi
is
championing
the
great
guru
s
message
of
humanity
by
fighting
for
the
civil
rights
of
muslims
and
of
all
americans
