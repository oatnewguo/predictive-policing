in
the
s
or
s
according
to
a
review
of
lapd
data
a
decade
ago
there
were
homicides
during
the
summer
last
year
there
were
beck
told
reporters
that
homicides
are
far
too
many
but
he
added
that
s
a
pretty
significant
accomplishment
for
this
city
to
have
a
summer
that
was
that
safe
the
drop
in
killings
was
welcome
news
for
the
lapd
which
has
been
nagged
by
crime
numbers
that
began
creeping
upward
in
though
the
department
worked
steadily
to
reverse
the
trend
most
notably
by
adding
more
officers
to
the
elite
metropolitan
division
and
creating
a
command
center
to
more
quickly
respond
to
violence
in
south
l
a
the
numbers
were
slow
to
move
this
year
overall
serious
crime
is
up
about
compared
with
the
same
period
last
year
but
the
city
has
seen
a
marked
improvement
in
deadly
violence
beck
said
the
chief
pointed
to
two
areas
he
said
were
the
lapd
s
primary
focus
the
number
of
homicides
and
the
number
of
people
shot
homicides
dropped
by
so
far
this
year
compared
with
this
time
in
he
said
shooting
victims
fell
by
about
the
summer
bloodshed
in
was
largely
fueled
by
gang
violence
in
south
l
a
where
people
were
shot
fatally
in
the
last
two
weeks
of
august
alone
lapd
officials
met
with
gang
intervention
workers
elected
officials
clergy
and
community
members
asking
for
help
those
relationships
stuck
and
have
contributed
to
the
decrease
in
violence
seen
there
today
said
deputy
chief
phil
tingirides
who
heads
the
lapd
s
south
bureau
he
credited
the
community
s
work
especially
by
those
who
have
intervened
when
gang
activity
threatens
to
flare
that
he
said
along
with
the
influx
of
metro
officers
and
the
use
of
the
lapd
s
command
center
have
helped
drive
down
the
violence
from
two
summers
ago
i
ve
gotten
more
sleep
at
night
than
i
have
in
a
lot
of
years
tingirides
said
many
of
the
recent
homicides
have
been
connected
to
domestic
disputes
or
people
who
knew
one
another
not
the
typical
gang
related
homicides
that
we
saw
during
that
day
period
of
he
said
the
change
is
evident
in
the
lapd
s
th
street
division
which
typically
sees
some
of
the
department
s
highest
numbers
of
killings
and
shootings
homicides
so
far
this
year
are
flat
but
the
number
of
people
shot
has
dropped
significantly
compared
with
the
same
period
in
as
of
sept
people
had
been
shot
fewer
than
in
and
about
fewer
than
the
year
before
beck
was
quick
to
include
gang
intervention
work
and
an
increased
number
of
domestic
violence
response
teams
with
helping
drive
down
violence
but
he
acknowledged
policing
has
a
lot
do
to
with
it
the
chief
however
cautioned
the
city
s
police
commission
after
sharing
the
numbers
tuesday
saying
the
summer
will
be
difficult
to
replicate
a
reminder
of
that
came
later
in
the
day
when
a
shooting
in
the
block
of

san

left

forcefully
denied
that
his

has
falsified
violent
crime
statistics
dismissing
allegations
that
the
lapd
is
misleading
the
public
as
not
only
untrue
but
outrageous
they
are
not
only
lies
but
they
are
damn
lies
beck
said
tuesday
of
the
allegations
if
i
m
cooking
the

i
m
not
doing
a
good
job
he
said
pointing
to
a
increase
in
violent
crime
this
year
in
violent
crime
increased
in
los

for
the
third
straight
year
according
to
department
statistics
i
am
confident
that
there
is
no
purposeful
misclassification
beck
said
believe
me
the
consequences
are
way
too
high
the
fiery
rhetoric
by
beck
came
in
response
to
a
claim
filed
a
week
ago
by
capt
lillian
carranza
who
alleged
that
aggravated
assaults
were
intentionally
underreported
in
multiple
police
divisions
across
the
city
carranza
who
oversees
the
van
nuys
station
held
a
news
conference
monday
and
accused
lapd
leaders
of
operating
a
highly
complex
and
elaborate
coverup
to
support
a
false
portrait
of
public
safety
in
l
a
greg
smith
the
attorney
representing
carranza
said
tuesday
that
beck
s
comments
about
his
client
were
defamatory
and
showed
desperation
we
have
absolute
proof
that
the
department
has
and
continues
to
present
false
crime
statistics
to
the
department
of
justice
the
lapd
s
data
integrity
unit
has
failed
to
stop
the
false
reports
smith
said
in
a
statement
chief
beck
s
comments
about
capt
carranza
are
false
malicious
and
slanderous
the
police

union
also
rebuked
beck
chief
beck
doth

too
much
the
los

police
protective

said
in
a
statement
it
s
time
for
transparency
and
honesty
to
be
the
foundation
of
our
department
not
cooking
the
books
to
fool
our
elected
officials
and
the
public
carranza
said
in
her
claim
that
she
began
notifying
superiors
in
about
the
underreporting
of
crime
and
once
installed
at
the
van
nuys
station
in
she
conducted
her
own
analysis
of
violent
crime
reports
stored
in
an
lapd
database
aggravated
assaults
in
were
underreported
by
about
in
the
pacific
and
central
divisions
according
to
the
claim
which
alleges
that
those
cases
were
misclassified
as
less
serious
offenses
the
allegations
followed
a
los

times
investigation
that
found
that
the
lapd
misclassified
nearly
violent
crimes
during
a
one
year
span
ending
in
september
if
recorded
correctly
the
figures
for
aggravated
assaults
in
the
period
would
have
been
nearly
higher
the
times
found
the
newspaper
also
found
that
from
to
fall
the
los

police
department
misclassified
an
estimated
aggravated
assaults
as
minor
offenses
artificially
lowering
the
city
s
violent
crime
rate
a
audit
by
the
lapd
s
inspector
general
estimated
that
more
than
aggravated
assaults
were
misclassified
from
to
on
tuesday
beck
pointed
to
several
reforms
in
recent
years
including
a
series
of
internal
audits
of
the
lapd
s
crime
statistics
the
training
of
more
than
detectives
to
accurately
categorize
crimes
and
the
creation
of
the
data
integrity
unit
a
small
team
of
detectives
and
data
analysts
responsible
for
scrutinizing
the
statistics
other
police
agencies
beck
said
view
the
lapd
as
zealots
because
of
the
multiple
checks
to
ensure
accuracy
still
carranza
lodged
multiple
complaints
about
data
errors
and
this
year
was
told
by
a
supervisor
that
she
would
not
receive
a
promotion
to
commander
because
she
was
meddling
into
others
business
according
to
the
claim
which
was
filed
against
the
city
of
los
angeles
and
seeks
damages
for
lost
wages
as
well
as
for
emotional
distress
and
unspecified
physical
injuries
beck
accused
carranza
of
being
very
litigious
and
said
she
had
made
previous
complaints
that
were
investigated
and
presented
to
the
police
commission
the
department
s
civilian
oversight
panel
he
said
he
had
promoted
carranza
and
insisted
that
he
had
not
retaliated
against
her
this

climbed
from

of

the

think

he

there

already
this

it
appears
that
bigots
have
become
emboldened
in

not

to

to
publicly
promote

nationalism
levin
said
in

hate
crimes
in
are
up
in
every
major
california
city
while
in
los

in
particular
the
most
violent
type
of
hate
crimes
are
up
continuing
a
trend
from
the
prior

a
recent
report
from

atty
gen
xavier
becerra
found
hate
incidents
statewide
in
an
increase
over
more
than
half
of

the
guns
were
seized
during
roughly
narcotic
investigations
throughout
los

county
over
the
last
two
years
but
authorities
still
had
an
important
question
about
them
how
many
other
crimes
were
the
weapons
connected
to
on
friday
federal
agents
took
a
key
step
toward
an
answer
agents
test
fired
the
firearms
at
the
glendale
police
department
s
gun
range
to
catch
the
shell
casings
the
agents
plan
to
analyze
and
upload
information
about
them
to
a
national
database
of
ballistic
evidence
managed
by
the
bureau
of
alcohol
tobacco
firearms
and
explosives
the
weapons
numbered
more
than
and
included
semiautomatic
pistols
long
rifles
and
shotguns
a
match
to
evidence
detailed
in
the
database
could
give
investigators
a
key
clue
in
an
unsolved
shooting
each
firearm
leaves
a
very
distinct
marking
on
the

of

casing
it

said
chris
bombardiere
who
supervises
the

crime
gun
intelligence
center
in
los

once
they
start
going
in
we
have
a
to
hour
turnaround
to
where
we
start
linking
these
firearms
to
other
crimes
that
occurred
where
shell
casings
were
picked
up
bombardiere
said
nationwide
in
fiscal
year
federal
authorities
entered
into
the
database
casings
that
were
recovered
from
crime
scenes
and
casings
that
came
from
test
fires
of
retrieved
weapons
that
led
investigators
to
matches
according

the

and
the

seized
the

that
were

fired

so
there

federal
agents

officers
spent
the
better
part
of
friday
morning
shooting
roughly
guns
collecting
and
cataloging
every
spent
shell
casing
in
the
hopes
that
one
of
them
will
lead
to
a
break
in
an
unsolved

held
at
the

s

the
day
was
a
joint
effort
between
the

known
as

glendale
police
and
the
los

each

was
confiscated
in

by

which
goes
by

l
a

either
at

scenes
or
from

the
seized
weapons
ranged
from
simple
handguns
to
rifles
and
shotguns
during
the
course
of
many
of
our
investigations
we
come
across

brian

said
when
we
compile
a
certain
amount
of
guns
we
like
to
bring
them
out
and
test
them
rose
said
not
all
guns
are
stockpiled
if
a
weapon
is
already
suspected
of
being
used
in
a
specific
crime
it
s
tested
immediately
he
said
testing
involves
firing
off
a
gun
several
times
and
collecting
the
shell
casings
rose
said
each
shell
has
a
distinctive
marking
from
the
gun
it
was
fired
from
much
like
a
fingerprint
if
a
gun
is
fired
in
one
place
during
a
crime
and
then
used
again
elsewhere
police
are
able
to
link
that
specific
weapon
to
the
two
crimes
based
on
the
markings
found
on
the
shell
casings
left
behind
the
shells
collected
on
friday
will
be
sent
to
the
verdugo
regional
crime
laboratory
at
the
glendale
police
department
s
headquarters
where
a
d
image
of
each
one
will
be
scanned
markings
and
all
the
images
will
then
be
uploaded
to
the
national
integrated
ballistic
information
network
known
as
nibin
which
is
a
database
maintained
by
the
atf
that
collects
similar
images
of
casings
recovered
from
crime
scenes
across
the
united
states
when
a
shell
is
entered
into
the
system
it
s
crosschecked
with
other
casings
that
have
similar
markings
chris
bombardiere
a
group
supervisor
with
the
atf
s
los
angeles
field
division
said
the
database
is
a
way
for
police
departments
to
better
share
information
with
one
another
and
help
establish
links
to
unrelated
crimes
you
might
have
a
suspect
in
your
homicide
case
or
shooting
while
i
don
t
have
anything
in
mine
he
said
with
nibin
i
now
have
a
lead
i
didn
t
before
with
guns
recovered
across
the
county
one
weapon
could
theoretically
have
links
connected
with
crimes
committed
in
several
cities
from
torrance
to
burbank
finding
these
links
is
important
for
the
good
of
the
whole
county
not
just
any
one
city
according
to
glendale
police
sgt
robert
william
this
testing
definitely
has
an
impact
on
unsolved

in
our

william
said
that

what
we
re
doing
here
trying

find
leads

something

on

in

an

last

confirmed
it
los

investigators
from

found
marijuana
plants
growing
in
neat
rows
under
dim

inside
the

as
well
as

twelve

such

have
increased
and
those
who
oversee
the
local
program
say
they
hope
the
numbers
continue
to
rise
it
s
especially
important
now
when
witnesses
to
nonemergency
crimes
don
t
seem
to
be
calling
their
local
law

agencies
as
much
said
natalie
salazar
executive
director
for
the
los

chapter
of
crime
stoppers
we
re
in
a
situation
when
people
are
very
distrustful
of
law
enforcement
salazar
said
we
d
like
them
to
call
law
enforcement
but
they
don
t
the
distrust
grew
after
what
happened
in
ferguson
missouri
in
august
salazar
said
that

an

of

that
was
patrolled
by
an
overwhelmingly
white

distrust
of
law

has
continued
since
and
now
within
the
latino

police
say
they
believe
latinos
are
afraid
the
trump
administration
is
pressing
state

local

officials
to

u
s
immigration
agents
to

them
in

lapd

charlie

said
at
an

in
east
los

that
latinos
were
reporting
fewer
crimes
committed
against
them
according
to
reporters
there
he
said
reports
of
sexual
assault
have
dropped
percent
among
them
since
the
beginning
of
compared
with
the
same
period
last
year
while
there
is
no
direct
evidence
that
the
decline
is
related
to
concerns
within
the
hispanic
community
regarding
immigration
the

believes
deportation
fears
may
be
preventing
hispanic
members
of

from
reporting
when
they
are
victimized
the
lapd
said
in

added
los

police
department
chief
charlie
beck
said
thursday
his
officers
are
making
progress
on
beating
back
a
recent
uptick
in
crime
citing
the
latest
midyear
statistics
beck
told
the
los
angeles
police
commission
that
through
june
overall
crime
is
up
less
than
percent
compared
with
the
same
time
last
year
he
noted
this
is
an
improvement
over
recent
crime
trends
that
s
a
positive
after
two
years
of
incremental
increases
so
we
think
we
ve
been
making
progress
on
crime
in
the
city
of
los
angeles
beck
said
according
to
the
police
chief
s
verbal
report
violent
crime
is
up
by
about
percent
with
homicides
inching
up
percent
compared
with
the
same
six
months
last
year
rapes
are
down
nearly
percent
robberies
are
up
percent
and
aggravated
assaults
are
about
even
he
said
beck
said
gang
crime
saw
a
percent
drop
but
there
was
a
percent
rise
in
gang
related
homicides
leading
to
the
minor
increase
in
overall
homicides
in
the
city
he
also
said
there
was
an
percent
drop
in
shots
fired
while
the
number
of
victims
shot
in
creased
percent
property
crimes
were
up
about
percent
as
of
the
midyear
point
the
largest
category
for
these
types
of
crimes
is
theft
and
that
s
down
percent
beck
said
meanwhile
increases
in
other
categories
canceled
out
this
gain
burglaries
are
up
percent
auto
thefts
rose
percent
and
burglary
theft
of
vehicles
is
up
percent
beck
said
some
lapd
officials
are
viewing
these
figures
as
signaling
a
possible
turnaround
from
recent
years
violent
crime
has
been
going
up
annually
for
the
past
three
years
while
overall
crime
was
up
for
the
past
two
years
but
others
warned
the
latest
numbers
are
not
quite
cause
for
celebration
especially
coming
off
a
steep
rise
in
violent
crime
after
the
slower
crime
rise
after
a
percent
increase
in
violent
crime
since
is
nothing
to
get
too
excited
about
craig
lally
president
of
the
police
officers
union
said
in
a
statement
he
said
that
crime
is
still
on
the
rise
there
are
still
not
enough
police
officers
and
with
the
hot
summer
months
upon
us
a
season
that
typically
brings
more
crime
with
it
now
is
not
the
time
for
anyone
to
pat
themselves
on
the
back
beck
should
instead
sharpen
his
pencil
and
create
a
plan
to
restore
safety
in
our
neighborhoods
lally
said
beck
also
reported
that
the
department
is
recovering
more
guns
than
before
with
the
number
of
guns
recovered
up
percent
over
last
year
and
up
by
percent
over
a
five
year
average
as
of
the
end
of
may
a
total
of
guns
were
taken
off
the
streets
of
los

as

the
end
of
may
and
those
guns
were
not
brought
in
as
part
of
the
city
s

buy

program
beck
said
updated
numbers
through

show
an
even

our
question
of
the
week
asked
readers
what
is
causing
the
upticks
in
crime
to
stop
crime
hire
more
law
enforcement
officers
it
is
no
coincidence
that
the
increase
in
crime
occurred
after
the
passage
of
proposition
which
made
multiple
property
crimes
inconsequential
misdemeanors
one
has
to
look
no
farther
than
fbi
statistics
showing
that
after
prop
property
crime
rose
two
years
in
a
row
across
california
while
falling
in
all
other
large
states
when
criminal
behavior
is
not
punished
is
there
any
wonder
that
it
increases
the
public
policy
institute
of
california
said
the
most
recent
credible
research
finds
that
an
additional
police
officer
reduces
crime
by
violent
crimes
and
property
crimes
per
year
other
recent
evidence
estimates
that
the
crime
reducing
benefits
of
hiring
an
additional
police
officer
exceed
per
year
much
more
than
the
annual
cost
of
an
additional
officer
the
rise
in
crime
is
costly
for
los
angeles
county
residents
however
as
several
independent
studies
have
shown
one
proven
solution
to
combat
the
crime
increases
is
to
fully
staff
law
enforcement
agencies
ron
hernandez
the
letter
writer
is
president
of
association
for
los

deputy
sheriffs
leaders
decisions
are
a
big
part
of
the
problem
take
your
pick
poverty
drugs
expensive
justice
system
overcrowded
jails
resulting
in
early
releases
failed
leadership
gangs
some
illegal
immigrants
and
anyone
else
who
opts
to
be
a
criminal
proposition
and
and
ab
all
contribute
to
the
rise
in
crime
under
failed
leadership
one
can
look
at
los
angeles
police
department
chief
charlie
beck
under
his
leadership
crime
statistics
were
falsified
to
make
him
look
good
he
signed
documents
allowing
the
purchase
of
his
daughter
s
horse
for
the
equestrian
unit
and
then
denied
involvement
in
the
matter
and
sgt
jim
parker
was
ridden
into
retirement
because
he
released
evidence
vindicating
claims
of
racism
beck
now
stands
by
while
the
city
s
ethics
commission
pursues
charges
against
sgt
parker
want
more
under
his
leadership
a
scheme
using
ghost
cars
falsely
inflated
staffing
requirements
all
of
this
while
our
politicians
glad
hand
each

and
tout
their

and

said
in

suffered
a

homicides
they
attributed
the
recent
growth
in

to
a

mandating

a

that
turned
some

and
discouraged

from

and
a

in

they
also
point
to
the

of
the

where
the

covers
an

the

they
point

to

we
ve
seen
a

to

said
councilman
mitch
englander
who
chairs
a
public

and
whose
district
stretches
across
the
northwest
valley
the
misdemeanor
charges
from
drug
and
alcohol
induced
crimes
from
theft
to
burglary
are
a
joke
and
we
don
t
have
the
ability
now
to

because
they
re
not
felonies
assembly
bill

gov
jerry

at

a

we
released
a

don

have
the

which

both

said
the

needs
to

they
also

some
blame
a

improving

beck

we

he

frayed

san

this

during

the

now
poses
a
distinct
threat
to
the
maintenance
of
free

on
some
california
campuses
like
uc
berkeley
owing
to
their
swarming
of
campuses
featuring
bigoted
or
controversial
speakers
levin
said
in
the
report
politics
and
a
heated
election
year
also
led
to
more
hate
crimes
and
civil
conflicts
in
some
of
california
s
largest
cities
last
year
compared
with
he
added
last
june
people
were
injured
and
people
faced
charges
as
a
result
of
a
clash
in
sacramento
between
groups
who
describe
themselves
as
alt

skinheads
and
the
self

anti

group
antifa
assaults
vandalism
and
derogatory
remarks
based
on
politics
are
not

but
those

should
be
watched
closely
levin
warned
armed
anti

black

antifa
and
other
hard

partisans
like
the
bay

group
by
any
means
necessary
bamn
not

racist
skinheads

partisans
but
police
journalists
campus
venues
and
trump
supporters
as
well
a
small
number
of
whom
sometimes
also
instigated
violence
levin
said
in
his
report
they
increasingly
saw
demonstrations
less
as
an
opportunity
for
expression
and
more
as
the
culmination
of
a
pre
choreographed
violent
street
or
campus
battle
that
began
as
vitriolic
disputes
on
social
media
he
added
those
demonstrations
threaten
free
speech
inclusion
and
the
right
of
all
views
to
be
expressed
said
casey
mattox
senior
counsel
and
the
director
of
the
center
for

freedom
with

defending

the
group
filed
a
federal
lawsuit
against
cal
state
los

and
several
csula
professors
last

for
allegedly
allowing
a
mob
to
block
access
to
a
speech
to
be
given
by
conservative
author
and
political
commentator
ben
shapiro
the
lawsuit
was
eventually
dismissed
after
the
university
agreed
to
changing
some
of
its
policies
when
universities
allow
mobs
to
shut
down
such
events
it
sends
a
message
that
some
people
and
some
views
are
completely
ostracized
from
society
and
that

not
lead

mattox
said
it

misclassifying

public
about
the
true
state
of
lawbreaking

capt
lillian

who

alleged
in

claim
filed
against
the

last

that
she
began
notifying
superiors
in
about
the
underreporting
of
crime
in
the
foothill
area
which
includes
pacoima
sunland
and
tujunga
but
no
action
was
taken
after
assuming
command
of
the
van
nuys
station
in
she
conducted
her
own
analysis
of
violent
crime
reports
in
an
lapd
database
according
to
the
claim
the
eight
page
claim
which
typically
precedes
a
civil
court
lawsuit
did
not
include
the
raw

carranza
used
in
her
analysis
aggravated
assaults
in
were
underreported
by
about
in
the
pacific
and
central
divisions
according
to
the
claim
which
alleges
those
cases
were
misclassified
as
less
serious
offenses
the
lapd
according
to
carranza
s
complaint
engaged
in
a
highly
complex
and
elaborate
coverup
in
an
attempt
to
hide
the
fact
that
command
officers
had
been
providing
false
crime
figures
to
the
public
attempting
to
convince
the
public
that
crime
was
not
significantly
increasing
more
recent
analysis
of
the
hollenbeck
and
mission
divisions
by
carranza
also
showed
a
undercounting
of

in
according
to
her
claim
the
lapd
did
not
comment
on
carranza
s
allegations
citing
the
pending
litigation
but
in
a
statement
issued
by
lapd
spokesman
josh
rubenstein
the
department
touted
the
accuracy
of
its
crime
statistics
and
the
development
of
a
special
unit
that
scrutinizes
its
data
when
errors
are
found
records
are
corrected
and
additional
training
and
other
corrective
action
is
taken
the
statement
said
integrity
in
all
we
say
and
do
is
a
core
value
for
the
department
and
any
accusation
related
to
the
accuracy
of
our
reports
will
be
taken
very
seriously
and
investigated
as
a
potential
disciplinary
matter
carranza
lodged
multiple
complaints
about
the
data
discrepancies
and
in
september
was
told
by
a
supervisor
that
she
would
not
receive
a
promotion
to
commander
because
she
was
meddling
into
others
business
according
to
the
claim
she
is
seeking
damages
for
lost
wages
and
pension
money
from
missing
the
promotion
as
well
as
for
emotional
distress
and
unspecified
physical
injuries
the
allegations
come
after
a
los

investigation
found
that
the
lapd
misclassified
nearly

crimes
during
a
one

san

this

levin
said
in

politics
and
a

year
also
led
to

and
civil

in
some
of
california

last

compared
with
he
added
last

people
were

faced

as

the
self

antifa
assaults
vandalism

levin
warned

antifa

the

by

bamn

police
journalists
campus

and
trump
supporters
as
well
a
small
number
of
whom
sometimes
also
instigated
violence
levin
said
in
his
report
they
increasingly
saw
demonstrations
less
as
an
opportunity
for
expression
and
more
as
the
culmination
of
a
pre
choreographed
violent
street
or
campus
battle
that
began
as
vitriolic
disputes
on
social
media
he
added
those
demonstrations
threaten
free
speech
inclusion
and
the
right
of
all
views
to
be
expressed
said
casey
mattox
senior
counsel
and
the
director
of
the
center
for

freedom
with

defending

the
group
filed
a
federal
lawsuit
against
cal
state
los

and
several
csula
professors
last

for
allegedly
allowing
a
mob
to
block
access
to
a
speech
to
be
given
by
conservative
author
and
political
commentator
ben
shapiro
the
lawsuit
was
eventually
dismissed
after
the
university
agreed
to
changing
some
of
its
policies
when
universities
allow
mobs
to
shut
down
such
events
it
sends
a
message
that
some
people
and
some
views
are
completely
ostracized
from
society
and
that
does
not
lead
to
good
things
mattox
said
it
also
means
that
the
ideas
in
power
are
not
criticized

checked
he
added
even
if

re

there
s
always
something
you
can
learn
from

robin

human

said
that
while

vandalism

aren

considered

that
doesn

mean
the

the

more
than

contacted

whether

will
face
any
legal

however
is
unclear
the

has
not

about

it

dmitry
gorin
a

who
used

prosecutor
said
that
potential
charges
against
toback
include
indecent
exposure
and
sexual
battery
but
that
there
is
a
limited
period
to
prosecute
such
crimes
often
one
to
three
years
without
third
party
witnesses
he
said
prosecutors
may
have
a
tough
case
defense
attorneys
could
argue
that
with
late
reporting
and
no
other
witnesses
there
is
insufficient
evidence
to
prove
beyond

gorin

the

declined

tuesday
on
whether
it
had
opened

the
times
investigation
detailed
a
pattern
of
behavior
over
four
decades
in
which
his
accusers
said
toback
approached
women
in
new
york
and
l
a
boasting
of
his
movie
credits
and
relationships
with
stars
such
as
robert
downey
jr
then
the
women
said
under
the
pretext
of
meetings
framed
as
interviews
or
auditions
he
asked
explicit
questions
about
their
sexual
histories
and
often
proposed
that
they
remove
their
clothes
the
encounters
often
ended
according
to
many
of
the

interviewed
with
toback
dry
humping
them
or
masturbating
in

of
them
ejaculating
into
his
pants
or
onto

toback
has
denied
the
allegations
to
the
times
saying
he
had
never
met
the
women
or
if
he
had
the
meeting
was
brief
and
he
didn

remember
them
he
also
repeatedly
said
that
for
the

it
had
been
biologically
impossible

him

any
of

did

it

reports
in

beck
said
in
an

we
encourage
all
victims
of
sexual
assault
to
come
forward
to
report
these
crimes
the
lapd
has
open
investigations
related
to
hollywood
and
media
figures
including
mogul
harvey
weinstein
and
agent
tyler
grasham
the
department
also
has
taken
other
sex
crimes
reports
that
it
has
sent
to
other
law
enforcement
agencies
believing
the
alleged
crimes
occurred
in
those
jurisdictions
all
of
the
accused
have
denied
wrongdoing
the
lapd
has
established
five
teams
of
two
detectives
each
to
exclusively
investigate
allegations
of
sexual
misconduct
in
hollywood
the
teams
include
members
of
the
cold
case
unit
because
those
detectives
are
experts
in
dealing
with
old
criminal
allegations
that
lack
physical
evidence
beck
said
his
department
is
committed
to
looking
into
all
allegations
made
by
those
who
believe
they
were
victimized
we
recognize
the
significant
trauma
these
victims
suffer

such

have
increased
and
those
who
oversee
the

say
they
hope
the
numbers
continue
to
rise
it
s
especially
important
now
when
witnesses
to
non

crimes
don
t
seem
to
be
calling
their
local

agencies
as
much
said
natalie

executive
director
for

we
re
in
a
situation
when
people
are
very
distrustful
of

salazar
said
we
d
like
them
to
call
law
enforcement
but
they
don
t
after

the
distrust
grew
after
what
happened
in

mo
in

said
that

when

the

in

st

suburb
of

that
was
patrolled
by
an
overwhelmingly

force
distrust
of
law

has
continued
since
and
now
within
the
latino
community
police
say
they
believe
latinos
are
afraid
the
trump
administration
is
pressing
state
and
local

officials
to
assist
u
s
immigration
agents
to
deport
them
in
march
lapd
chief
charlie
beck
said
at
an
event
in

los

that
latinos
were
reporting
less
crimes
committed
against
them
according
to
reporters
there
he
said
reports
of
sexual
assault
have
dropped
percent
among
them
since
the
beginning
of
compared
with
the
same
period
last
year
while
there
is
no
direct
evidence
that
the
decline
is
related
to
concerns
within
the
hispanic
community
regarding
immigration
the
department
believes
deportation
fears
may
be
preventing
hispanic
members
of
the
community
from
reporting
when
they
are
victimized
the
lapd
said
in
a
statement
to
news
organizations
in

but
the

seen
an

the

los

police
have
identified

suspect
who
investigators
say
wrote
a
pair
of
hateful
screeds
on
the
outside
of
a
sikh
temple
in
los
feliz
and
threatened
to
slit
the
throat
of
a

who
caught
the
incident
on

artyom
manukyan
is
suspected
of
using
a
black
marker
to
write
rambling
messages
on
the
walls
of
the
hollywood
sikh
temple
on

avenue
about

said
capt
robert
long
of
the
los

police
department
s
major
crimes
division
on
monday
manukyan
was
confronted
by
several
people
including
a
man
who
filmed
the
incident
and
posted
it
on
facebook
long
said
the
man
followed
manukyan
for
several
blocks
before
he
brandished
a
straight
razor
police
said
in
a
portion
of
the
video
a
man
police
identified
as
manukyan
can
be
seen
calmly
walking
away
from
the
wall
and
ignoring
someone
who
repeatedly
shouts
why
did
you
write
on
it
manukyan
who
lives
in
the
glendale
or
los
angeles
area
has
been
arrested
before
on
suspicion
of
burglary
grand
theft
auto
and
making
criminal
threats
long
said
at
a
news
conference
monday
police
asked
for
the
public
s
help
in
locating
manukyan
after
a
weeks
long
search
failed
to
result
in
an
arrest
the
messages
which
are
still
visible
on
the
vermont
avenue
side
of
the
temple
make
little
sense
one
reads
nuke
death
sikhs
with
an
obscenity
in
between
while
the
other
refers
to
a
group
of
sikhs
stabbing
the
author
when
he
was
a
child
long
said
manukyan
s
family
has
been
cooperative
but
the
suspect
s
motives
remain
unclear
he
was
not
known
to
the
temple
s
community
said
nirinjan
singh
khalsa
executive
director
of
the
california
sikh
council
i
am
fully
confident
he
designed
this
as
a
threat
to
the
sikh
community
and
we
need
to
take
him
into
custody
to
make
sure
that
the
community
not
just
the
sikh
community
but
the
community
as
a
whole
is
safer
long
said
manukyan
could
face
vandalism
charges
with
a
hate
crime
enhancement
long
said
he
would
also
face
criminal
threats
charges
for
brandishing
a
blade
at
the
man
who
filmed
him
long
said
the
case
has
been
presented
to
the
los
angeles
county
district
attorney
s
office
long
said
manukyan
may
be
mentally
ill
but
it
is
not
clear
if
he
has
been
formally
diagnosed
the
incident
comes
after
los
angeles
saw
a
slight
jump
in
reported
hate
crimes
in
an
increase
driven
by
crimes
committed
against
the
lgbtq
community
according
to
an
analysis
released
this
year
by
the
center
for
the
study
of
hate
and
extremism
at
cal
state
san
bernardino
the
incidents
reported
to
the
lapd
last
year
marked
the
highest
number
of
hate
crimes
reported
in
the
city
since
the
analysis
showed
khalsa
said
he
believes
that
attacks
on
the
sikh
community
have
increased
recently
as
well
in
the
past
sikhs
have
often
been
targeted
for
harassment
by
individuals
who
mistake
them
for
muslims
i
can
tell
you
on
behalf
of
the
sikh
community
that
these
incidents
are
up
especially
in
the
political
climate
we
re
in
now
in
the
past
hate
crimes
against
sikhs
were
mistaken
identity
hate
crimes
he
said
unfortunately
now
what
we
re
seeing
is
sikhs
are
part
of
the
other
group
in
the
mind
of
some
people
that
think
hatred
is
patriotic
there
was
an
surge
in
hate
crimes
across
california
in
according
to
the
california
department
of
justice
some
civil
liberties
groups
assert
that
anti
muslim
bigots
and
other
racists
have
been
emboldened
by
president
trump
s
blistering
rhetoric
on
immigration
and
islamic
terrorism
contributing
to
a
rise
in
hate
crimes
last
year
a
number
of
faith
centers
in
california
received
an
ominous
letter
that
referred
to
trump
while
calling
for
genocide
against

it
is
not
exactly
like
the
futuristic
science
fiction
film
minority
report
in
which
police
officers
arrest
potential
criminals
before
they
commit
crimes
yet
some
crime
fighting
innovations
like
predpol
appear
to
give
police
the
upper
hand
in
deterring
crime
said
commander
jorge
r
rodriguez
from
the
los
angeles
police
department
lapd
comdr
rodriguez
was
a
guest
speaker
yesterday
at
the
interpol
world
congress
he
shared
the
lapd
s
experience
by
presenting
a
case
study
highlighting
the
use
of
predpol
a
predictive
policing
software
that
pinpoints
crime
hot
spots
based
on
historical
data
like
crime
type
location
and
date
comdr
rodriguez
who
heads
eight
police
stations
in
los
angeles
california
had
told
the
straits
times
a
day
earlier
that
predictive
policing
helps
narrow
the
likelihood
of
a
crime
occurring
in
areas
depicted
by
a
feet
by
feet
box
which
works
out
to
ha
he
said
so
what
we
tell
our
officers
as
they
re
driving
from
point
a
to
point
b
through
the
city
is
know
where
these
boxes
are
and
drive
through
them
so
you
can
provide
a
police
presence
first
introduced
to
the
lapd
in
predpol
was
used
to
track
property
crimes
like
burglaries
theft
from
vehicles
and
motor
vehicle
thefts
during
his
time
as
captain
at
three
los
angeles
police
divisions
property
crimes
decreased
he
said
but
he
emphasised
that
predpol
should
be
used
only
to
augment
police
operations
comdr
rodriguez
who
became
a
police
officer
in
said
no
matter
what
technology
you
have
or
how
advanced
you
get
you
ll
still
need
the
human
element
and
cooperation
from
the
community
human
intel
cannot
be
replaced
by
anything
else
while
there
are
fears
that
predictive
policing
might
infringe
on
civil
liberties
the
greater
concern
now
facing
the
lapd
is
perhaps
the
increase
in
violent
crimes
a
los
angeles
times
report
last
december
stated
that
violent
crime
figures
had
risen
for
a
third
straight
year
in
the
wake
of
homicides
and
gang
related
shootings
which
resulted
in
people
being
killed
in
the
city
though
the
number
is
lower
when
compared
with
the
killed
a
decade
ago
unfortunately
property
crime
figures
have
gone
up
too
comdr
rodriguez
attributed
the
rise
to
the
decriminalisation
of
some
offences
he
added
a
lot
of
crime
penalties
have
been
lowered
from
felonies
to
misdemeanours
for
property
crimes
these
individuals
know
the
time
they
re
going
to
get
is
minimal
when
it
comes
to
sentencing
right
now
the
biggest
problem
we
have
is
the
drug
problem
with
the
legalisation
of
marijuana
in
states
like
colorado
oregon
and
california
crime
figures
are
expected
to
rise
more
he
said
you
ve
got
to
support
your
drug
habit
by
committing
crime
said
comdr
rodriguez
who
thinks
that
marijuana
is
a
gateway
drug
over
the
years
he
has
met
doctors
professional
basketball
players
and
well
to
do
individuals
who
had
all
started
their
drug
abuse
with
marijuana
he
said
next
thing
you
know
they
re
chasing
a
high
and
looking
for
a
bigger
euphoric
feeling
they
then
progress
to
harder
drugs
like
cocaine
and
methamphetamines
he
said
abstract
the
city
of
los

experienced

community
full

the
city
of
los
angeles
experienced
a
percent
increase
in
hate
crimes
in
along
with
a
significant
spike
in
attacks
against
the
gay
lesbian
bisexual
and
transgender
communities
according
to
data
analyzed
by
the
center
for
the
study
of
hate
and
extremism
at
cal
state
san
bernardino
the
number
of
hate
crimes
rose
from
in
to
in
the
highest
number
of
hate
crimes
seen
in
los
angeles
since
said
brian
levin
the
center
s
director
but
it
s
well
below
the
hate
crimes
the
city
saw
in
the
year
of
the
sept
terror
attacks
which
was
the
highest
number
this
century
levin
said
the
surge
in
hate
crimes
is
largely
due
to
a
spike
in
violent
aggravated
assaults
racially
and
ethnically
motivated
crimes
and
crimes
against
lgbt
communities
perhaps
most
disturbing
is
the
surge
in
the
most
violent
type
of
attacks
which
are
aggravated
assaults
levin
said
whether
it
s
the
increase
in
aggravated
assaults
or
criminal
threats
it
appears
that
assailants
are
emboldened
there
was
a
nearly
percent
increase
in
violent
aggravated
assaults
from
to
according
to
los
angeles
police
department
data
criminal
threats
rose
percent
from
in
to
last
year
there
have
been
no
homicides
or
rapes
deemed
to
be
hate
crimes
that
were
reported
in
the
city
in
the
last
two
years
the
data
also
showed
a
percent
increase
in
hate
crimes
against
the
lgbt
community
from
to
hate
crimes
against
transgender
persons
jumped
from
in
to
in
according
to
the
lapd
data
this
is
unfortunate
because
our
study
last
year
showed
a
significant
increase
nationwide
in
anti
transgender
attacks
that
would
appear
to
be
continuing
into
the
following
year
levin
said
such
incidents
and
particularly
the
killing
of
four
transgender
black
women
in
the
u
s
in
the
span
of
about
a
week
in
march
of
this
year
are
worrisome
he
said
there
was
also
a
percent
rise
in
racially
and
ethnically
motivated
crimes
last
year
over
the
previous
year
african
americans
were
targeted
the
most
with
victims
reported
last
year
up
from
the
year
before
according
to
the
data
capt
william
hayes
commanding
officer
of
lapd
s
robbery
homicide
division
that
monitors
hate
crime
incidents
noted
that
the
most
prevalent
hate
crime
last
year
was
vandalism
which
made
up
nearly
a
third

the
city
of
los

experienced
a
percent
increase
in
hate
crimes
in
along
with
a
significant
spike
in
attacks
against
the
gay
lesbian
bisexual
and
transgender
communities
according
to
data
analyzed
by
the
center
for
the
study
of
hate
and
extremism
at
cal
state
san
bernardino
the
number
of
hate
crimes
rose
from
in
to
in
the
highest
number
of
hate
crimes
seen
in
los
angeles
since
said
brian
levin
the
center
s
director
but
it
s
well
below
the
hate
crimes
the
city
saw
in
the
year
of
the
sept
terror
attacks
which
was
the
highest
number
this
century
levin
said
the
surge
in
hate
crimes
is
largely
due
to
a
spike
in
violent
aggravated
assaults
racially
and
ethnically
motivated
crimes
and
crimes
against
lgbt
communities
perhaps
most
disturbing
is
the
surge
in
the
most
violent
type
of
attacks
which
are
aggravated
assaults
levin
said
whether
it
s
the
increase
in
aggravated
assaults
or
criminal
threats
it
appears
that
assailants
are
emboldened
there
was
a
nearly
percent
increase
in
violent
aggravated
assaults
from
to
according
to
los

police
department
data
criminal
threats
rose
percent
from
in
to
last
year
there
have
been
no
homicides
or
rapes
deemed
to
be
hate
crimes
that
were
reported
in
the
city
in
the
last
two
years
the
data
also
showed
a
percent
increase
in
hate
crimes
against
the
lgbt
community
from
to
hate
crimes
against
transgender
persons
jumped
from
in
to
in
according
to
the
lapd
data
this
is
unfortunate
because
our
study
last
year
showed
a
significant
increase
nationwide
in
anti
transgender
attacks
that
would
appear
to
be
continuing
into
the
following
year
levin
said
such
incidents
and
particularly
the
killing
of
four
transgender
black
women
in
the
u
s
in
the
span
of
about
a

in

of
this

are

he

there
was
also

racially

over
the
previous

capt

noted
that

which

up

like

they

while
there

fears
may

preventing

los

the
police
chief
of
los
angeles
a
city
that
is
half
latino
found
himself
in
the
middle
of
the
national
immigration
debate
on
wednesday
after
saying
there
s
a
correlation
between
the
trump
administration
s
call
for
stiffer
immigration
policies
and
a
drop
in
the
number
of
hispanics
reporting
sexual
abuse
and
domestic
violence
imagine
your
sister
your
mother
not
reporting
a
sexual
assault
for
fear
that
their
family
will
be
torn
apart
lapd
chief
charlie
beck
said
tuesday
since
the
beginning
of
this
year
sexual
assaults
reported
by
latinos
in
los
angeles
have
dropped
percent
and
domestic
violence
reports
by
latinos
have
decreased
by
percent
compared
to
the
same
period
last
year
crime
statistics
show
there
were
sexual
assaults
reported
by
latinos
in
the
first
two
months
of
compared
to
in
the
first
two
months
of
there
was
also
a
decrease
of
reports
of
domestic
violence
during
the
same
periods
among
latinos
beck
said
there
was
a
strong
correlation
between
the
timing
of
the
decreased
reporting
and
fears
about
president
donald
trump
s
efforts
to
crack
down
on
the
estimated
million
immigrants
living
illegally
in
the
u
s
however
jessica
vaughan
of
the
washington
based
center
for
immigration
studies
which
lobbies
for
less
immigration
to
the
u
s
said
it
is
extremely
speculative
to
draw
a
connection
between
the
drop
in
crime
reporting
and
fears
regarding
accelerated
efforts
to
round
up
and
deport
immigrants
she
questioned
beck
s
reasoning
for
announcing
the
figures
this
seems
to
be
somehow
politically
motivated
to
try
to
get
people
to
think
increased
enforcement
is
causing
problems
in
the
community
vaughan
said
i
think
it
is
really
a
stretch
to
connect
this
decline
with
perceptions
of
increased
immigration
enforcement
los
angeles
breaks
down
its
crime
statistics
by
the
ethnicity
of
victims
but
some
other
large
city
police
departments
do
not
keep
the
same
types
of
reports
abstract
crime
stoppers
can
be

it
s
especially
important
now
when

salazar
said
we
d
like
them
to
call

but
they
don
t
the
distrust
grew
after
what
happened
in

that
was
patrolled
by

distrust
of

enforcement
has
continued
since
and
now
within
the
latino

police
say
they
believe
latinos
are
afraid
the
trump
administration
is
pressing
state

local
law

officials
to
assist
u
s
immigration
agents
to
deport
them
in
march
lapd
chief
charlie
beck
said
at
an

in

that
latinos
were

fewer

committed
against

according
to

he
said

have
dropped
percent
among
them
since
the
beginning
of
compared
with
the
same
period
last
year
while
there
is
no
direct
evidence
that
the
decline
is
related
to
concerns
within
the
hispanic
community
regarding
immigration
the
department
believes
deportation
fears
may
be
preventing
hispanic
members
of
the
community
from
reporting
when
they
are
victimized
the
lapd
said
in

to

papers
in

court
asking
the
judge
hearing
a
lawsuit
brought
this
month
by
san
francisco
city
officials
to
let
los

quickly
into
that
fray
in
its

san

announced
last
month
for
justice
department
funds
that
have
long
been
disbursed
to
local
law
enforcement
agencies
to
bolster
efforts
to
fight
violent
and
gang
crime
at
the
time
sessions
said
police
agencies
that
want
a
piece
of
future
funding
would
have
to
first
demonstrate
that
they
are
willing
to
help
immigration
officials
identify
and
detain
people
in
local
jails
who
are
suspected
of
being
in
the
country
illegally
specifically
sessions
said
police
would
be
required
to
allow
immigration
and
customs
enforcement
officers
access
to
local
jails
and
to
notify
ice
hours
before
releasing
from
their
jails
anyone
tagged
by
federal
authorities
as
possibly
being
in
the
country
illegally
the
conditions
imposed
by
sessions
feuer
argued
violate
the
separation
of
powers
laid
out
in
the
u
s
constitution
which
give
congress
not
the
executive
branch
control
of
government
purse
strings
feuer
said
the
money
has
been
used
in
los
angeles
largely
to
fund
a
long
running
city
program
in
which
police
city
attorneys
the
district
attorney
s
office
and
probation
officials
collaborate
to
target
the
city
s
worst
gang
neighborhoods
the
trump
administration
is
overreaching
and
we
re
going
to
fight
it
feuer
said
at
a
city
hall
news
conference
we
re
going
to
fight
because
the
administration
would
put
los
angeles
to
the
untenable
choice
of
risking
a
key
public
safety
grant
or
making
the
lapd
an
arm
of
federal
immigration
policy
the
justice
department
awards
the
grant
money
to
states
and
cities
annually
in
the
past
the
amount
cities
receive
has
been
calculated
based
on
population
and
crime
statistics
in
each
of
the
last
years
los
angeles
has
received
more
than
million
including
million
for
the
fiscal
year
feuer
said
this
year
l
a
would
be
eligible
to
receive
million
to
be
shared
by
the
city
and
the
county
according
to
city
figures
feuer
wrote
in
court
papers
that
it
was
important
for
los
angeles
to
join
the
san
francisco
case
to
permit
the
court
to
consider
doj
s
conditions
in
light
of
differing
local
policies
he
wrote
that
san
francisco
for
example
has
a
policy
generally
prohibiting
city
officials
from
even
responding
to
an
ice
request
for
notification
of
an
inmate
s
release
but
no
such
policy
exists
in
los
angeles
instead
feuer
said
his
objection
to
the
notification
requirement
was
rooted
in
concerns
that
it
would
force
the
lapd
to
prolong
the
time
inmates
would
otherwise
remain
behind
bars
which
several
courts
have
ruled
unconstitutional
regarding
access
to
jails
lapd
s
policy
does
not
allow
ice
unfettered
access
although
immigration
officers
can
interview
an
inmate
who
consents
to
it
in
his
comments
tuesday
feuer
presented
the
new
funding
conditions
as
a
threat
to
public
safety
in
los
angeles
the
lapd
restricts
its
cooperation
with
ice
he
said
as
part
of
a
broader
effort
to
build
trust
with
the
city
s
immigrant
communities
and
assure
people
living
here
illegally
that
they
will
not
be
at
risk
of
being
deported
if
they
come
forward
to
report
a
crime
as
a
victim
or
witness
justice
department
officials
fired
back
criticizing
the
move
by
los
angeles
and
arguing
that
the
funding
requirements
would
in
fact
increase
safety
in
the
city
citing
an
increase
in
crime
rates
in
los
angeles
in
recent
years
department
spokesman
devin
o
malley
said
in
a
statement
it
is
so
baffling
that
the
city
would
challenge

designed
to
keep

reversing

city
policies
is
about
more
than
just
enforcing
federal
immigration
law
by
detaining
criminals
here
illegally
it
s
about
reestablishing
a
culture
of
law
and
order
where
crimes
are
punished
and
people
are
deterred
from
committing
them
the
legal
challenge
is
the
latest
response
to
threats
by
the

to
cut

called

the

statute

for
the
crime
that

aggressive
and
demanding
and
kept
asking

me
naked
she
said
weinstein

bragged
about
his
power
and
influence

show
him
pictures
of

children
and
her

undergoing
chemotherapy
at
the
time
as

cried
and

by
the
hair
and
forced
me
to
do
something
i
did
not
want
to
do
she
said
he
then
dragged
me
to
the
bathroom
and

this
man
it
was
the
most
demeaning
thing

sickens
me
still
he
made
me
feel
like
an
object
like
nothing

all
his
power

invited
her
to
parties
at
his
house

because
of
them

right
now
you
all
have

that
have
touched

and
there
s
a

of
expression
that
s
going

in

things
are
moving
in
directions
at

speed
that
we
re

a
hard
time
hanging
on
to
that
basic
humanity
i
think
a
majority
of
it
is
escapism
but
also
it
reminds
us
of
at

on

goodness

kindness
and
a
want

connect

king
i
totally

our

offer
a
space
to
feel

there
are
other
people
that
are
going
through
what
i
m
going
through
and
it

some
of
the

are
now
gravitating
toward

where
you
can
communicate
on

human
level
and
not
have
to
think
about
the
politics
and
get
more
into
the
emotional
interactions
because
that
s
the
real
storytelling
as
opposed
to
picking
sides
dern
we
all
have
this
great
opportunity
to
bring
humor
or
irreverence
to
these
broken
places
too
which
i
think
for
each
show
speaks
to
why
people
are
so
connected
to
them
because
they
are
also
laughing
at
the
heartbreak
when
you
re
doing
intense
scenes
and
you
ve
all
done
really
raw
scenes
of
arguing
of
fighting
of
emotional
violence
how
do
you
know
when
it
s
working
dern
with
a
great
director
when
we
feel
we
re
in
the
hands
of
someone
great
i
don
t
think
there
s
ever
been
a
moment
i
would
assume
for
any
of
us
that
we
look
up
knowing
it
s
not
feeling
honest
or
something
s
not
right
and
the
director
is
not
going
yep
going
again
you
all
feel
it
together
it
is
an
incredible
thing
when
it
s

king
you
go

there
s
the
reality
of
i
need
to
say
these
horrible
things
to
someone
that
i
care
deeply
about

our

are
right
next
to
each
other
she
s
my
friend
and
we
sit
there
and

the
day
s
going
to
go
laughter
ventimiglia
we
were
in
it
all
day
long
and
it
hurt
and
it
was
painful
and
the
one
thing
that
i
kept
waiting
for
was
the
moment
that
it
was
over
i
can
look
at
my
partner
give
her
a
hug
and
be
like
i
m
so
blown
away
by
your
work
and
then
turn
to
the
crew
and
shake
everyone
s
hand
laura
you
had
a
huge
fight
scene
with
reese
witherspoon
in
big
little
lies
and
she
s
one
of
your
best
friends
dern
it
had
to
be
said
laughter
dern
but
only
a
friend
can
say
it
i
loved
hearing
how
milo
just
described
that
experience
because
i
feel
like
it
is
such
an
amazing
privilege
when
you
are
doing
any
kind
of
deeply
emotional
scene
ventimiglia
it
s
a
moving
headed
hydra
we
ve
got
billy
with
the
brick
light
and
the
cameras
are
moving
around
theroux
we
talk
a
lot
about
the
scene
partner
and
who
you
re
acting
against
and
blah
blah
blah
but
you
know
the
way
we
re
shooting
things
now
there
are
sometimes
cameras
right
up
on
you
so
our
guy
chris
cuevas
on
leftovers
was
just
as
much
of
a
dance
partner
as
costar
carrie
coon
because
you
re
having
to
be
emotionally
vulnerable
so
they
have
to
be
invested
in
it
hopefully
they
like
the
show
and
all
our
crew
i
know
loved
our
show
as
much
as
we
did
so
when
it
had
to
get
quiet
it
would
get
quiet
everything
has
to
work
in
tandem
one
of
the
amazing
things
about
all
your
performances
is
that
so
much
of
drama
seems
to
involve
close
ups
there
s
absolutely
no
place
to
hide
you
can
t
fake
it
king
so
the
vanity
comes
in
here
you
know
when
they
made
the
switch
over
to
hd
theroux
yeah
thanks
whoever
invented
hd
king
the
first
time
i
saw
myself
in
hd
i
was
like
that
s
not
me
i
don
t
have
that
well
surely
there
was
a
bad
light
or
something
but
the
beauty
of
it
is
i
think
it
made
me
an
even
better
actor
because
it
made
me
really
say
i
shouldn
t
even
be
worrying
about
a
line
or
a
wrinkle
or
that
something
looks
harder
because
i
m
part
of
the
storytelling
and
that
character
is
i
m
not
playing
a
woman
that
s
worried
about
that
so
regina
get
out
of
your
way
dern
my
favorite
memory
of
the
experience
of
a
close
up
theroux
i
know
what
you
re
going
to
say
dern
justin
and
i
did
a
movie
together
and
our
director
david
lynch
was
holding
the
camera
handheld
theroux
twas
a
love
scene
dern
it
had
to
be
so
romantic
and
we
re
there
and
our
faces
are
coming
together
and
he
s
coming
in
and
suddenly
as
our
eyes
closed
we
feel
something
weird
and
we
don
t
know
what
it
is
theroux
and
then
we
start
feeling
like
a
dunk
dunk
touches
his
forehead
and
david
s
operating
the
camera
and
he
s
banging
into
our
heads
we
re
like
hey
man
you
might
want
to
just
back
the
camera
up
and
he
s
like
shh
stop
it
just
go
ahead
this
is
amazing
dern
so
there
are
limits
to
the
close
up
laughter
laura
people
just
went
nuts
over
big
little
lies
what
do
you
think
people
gravitated
toward
dern
speaking
to
what
made
me
get
into
it
was
five
actresses
together
we
were
filming
it
during
our
last
election
and
examining
women
and
honoring
them
on
a
deep
level
at
a
time
that
we
felt
we
weren
t
being
seen
in
the
way
we
wanted
to
be
seen
politically
culturally
and
playing
a
character
that
was
i
think
perceived
because
of
her
intellect
power
and
ability
to
be
scathing
in
a
world
of
men
that
she
must
be
cold
the
b
word
a
bad
mother
that
was
an
amazing
part
to
be
playing
and
see
what
labels
we
put
on
women
when
they
re
powerful
and
when
they
re
coming
up
against
the
men
for
certain
jobs
and
you
know
whether
it
s
the
corporate
world
or
the
banking
world
or
politics
when
i
watch
it
i
loved
as
an
audience
thinking
i
knew
someone
and
judging
them
and
then
being
ashamed
at
my
own
judgments
and
any
time
television
or
film
can
do
that
it
s
the
great
reckoning
in
watching
the
leftovers
justin
sometimes
i
feel
such
angst
for
your
character
because
for
two
seasons
kevin
has
been
so
tortured
and
gone
through
so
much
this
season
you
re
saying
goodbye
to
this
character
theroux
it
s
a
very
kind
of
what
is
the
meaning
of
life
type
show
and
obviously
that
s
impossible
to
answer
no
artist
has
been
able
to
answer
it
no
painter
no
you
know
composer
i
wouldn
t
say
there
s
any
character
that
gets
off
easy
in
our
show
you
know
they
re
all
put
through
the
crucible
at
some
point
or
another
so
i
feel
like
i
love
playing
the
character
but
i
would
never
want
it
to
go
on
and
on
and
on
i
would
never
want
to
put
showrunners
damon
lindelof
and
tom
perrotta
in
the
position
of
going
oh
boy
we
ve
got
to
come
up
with
another
season
because
we
ve
been
picked
up
and
i
guess
we
ll
just
put
you
through
some
more
hell
i
think
they
really
did
craft
a
beautiful
sort
of
triptych
of
television
that
has
a
beginning
a
middle
and
an
astounding
ending
they
ve
really
created
this
beautiful
arc
for
everybody
not
just
my
character
regina
this
season
you
had
a
really
heartbreaking
scene
your
character
kimara
is
a
social
worker
who
is
trying
to
get
pregnant
and
she
s
also
trying
to
help
a
very
troubled
teenage
girl
and
there
was
a
scene
where
the
teenager
is
getting
a
sonogram
and
you
convey
so
much
in
your
face
king
in
that
scene
we
re
talking
about
a
woman
who
really
wants
children
and
a
young
girl
who
the
last
thing
she
feels
she
needs
to
deal
with
is
a
child
being
a
mom
and
kimara
s
desire
to
be
in
her
position
obviously
a
lot
of
women
can
relate
to
that
moment
but
i
think
people
can
relate
to
that
moment
because
it
s
a
heartbreaking
thing
to
look
at
something
you
want
can
t
have
but
you
still
have
to
be
there
kimara
represents
a
lot
of
our
heroes
our
heroines
that
don
t
get
the
light
shined
on
them
because
they
re
constantly
giving
giving
giving
of
themselves
milo
so
many
fans
of
the
show
are
interested
in
knowing
how
jack
dies
and
that
seems
to
be
kind
of
a
sticking
point
with
you
ventimiglia
people
want
everything
now
there
s
not
that
reverence
of
waiting
i
always
tell
them
don
t
worry
about
how
he
died
focus
on
how
he
lived
that
s
the
more
interesting
journey
i
just
try
to
turn
the
dial
a
little
bit
you
know
the
most
important
thing
about
the
man
is
how
he
impacts
his
kids
which
you
see
in
the
present
day
and
then
beyond
that
how
he
impacts
his
wife
who
you
see
in
the
present
day
i
think
it
s
a
more
lasting
memory
to
understand
how
a
human
being
has
lived
and
inspired
the
people
around
them
than
that
one
singular
moment
of
how
they
passed
away
i
wanted
to
talk
about
social
media
does
it
help
does
it
annoy
ventimiglia
i
think
there
s
a
value
in
the
marketing
of
a
show
and
the
understanding
of
you
can
call
it
ancillary
content
to
what
the
main
story
is
but
if
i
personally
am
in
the
spotlight
more
than
what
my
characters
are
are
people
going
to
believe
the
characters
that
i
m
playing
so
i
try
to
pull
that
back
and
minimize
that
dern
now
that
i
m
raising
kids
i
m
watching
how
social
media
is
defining
that
someone
is
watching
at
all
times
if
you
care
enough
you
ll
have
more
followers
if
you
wear
the
awesome
thing
or
hang
out
with
the
right
people
and
so
what
is
the
sense
of
loss
to
truly
be
one
s
self
and
let
all
of
that
go
away
i
hope
there
s
a
generation
of
kids
that
as
filmmakers
and
actors
and
writers
and
musicians
are
wanting
to
escape
the
false
story
theroux
social
media
is
great
for
fans
to
discuss
things
among
themselves
if
people
are
tweeting
or
instagramming
about
a
show
they
re
essentially
having
the
lobby
discussion
you
would
have
after
you
ve
seen
a
good
play
or
a
movie
on
the
walk
home
i
mean
i
learned
long
ago
i
don
t
check
myself
on
social
media
you
re
going
like
i
need
someone
to
bully
me
right
now
king
they

los

county
saw
a
surge
in
reported
hate
crimes
last
year
linked
to
white
supremacists
with
a
wave
of
incidents
targeting
jews
muslims
and
african
americans
according
to
a
study
released
thursday
immigrants
have
also
been
targeted
prompting
officials
to
call
in
sheriff
s
deputies
to
maintain
calm
at
public
meetings
for
the
last
several
months
we
ve
had
to
alert
the
sheriff
s
department
because
white
supremacists
and
anti
immigrants
groups
have
been
disruptive
in
communities
like
cudahy
county
supervisor
hilda
solis
said
residents
are
fearful
to
attend
these
meetings
because
these
groups
have
shown
up
yelling
fearful
rhetoric
and
even
brandishing
weapons
at
times
reported
hate
crimes
linked
to
white
supremacists
jumped
from
in
to
last
year
a
increase
according
to
the
annual
study
conducted
by
the
l
a
county
commission
on
human
relations
overall
incidents
were
reported
roughly
the
same
as
in
but
that
followed
a
jump
from
to
a
surge
that
the
study
said
was
fueled
in
part
by
anti
muslim
reaction
to
the
dec
terror
attack
in
san
bernardino
the
study
found
that
a
majority
of
the
reported
hate
crimes
linked
to
white
supremacists
were
motivated
by
religion
and
targeted
mostly
jews
last
year
swastikas
were
found
on
vehicles
synagogues
schools
and
jewish
owned
businesses
race
was
the
motivation
for
of
the
white
supremacist
hate
crimes
the
study
found
the
most
frequently
targeted
group
in
these
crimes
were
african
americans
the
study
also
found
that
l
a
county
saw
an
increase
in
gender
based
crimes
particularly
against
transgender
people
there
were
reported
gender
based
crimes
compared
with
the
year
before
a
increase
the
most
targeted
within
that
group
in
was
latina
transgender
women
mariana
marroquin

we
can
do
better
we

we
came
so
far
that

a

study
co

irvine
business
professor
has
found
no
correlation
between
the
closure
of
marijuana
dispensaries
and
reduced
crime
rates
near
them
rather
it
discovered

opposite
the

crime
near

dispensaries
forced

relative
to
the

measure
jacobson
and
chang
also
studied
the
forced
temporary
closure
of
restaurants
due
to
health
code
violations
they
found
similar
crime
increases

was

the

included

from

closures
in

and
chang
attribute
the
crime
upticks
to
fewer
eyes
upon
the
street
noting
that
when
the
dispensaries
and
restaurants
closed
it
caused
fewer
people
to
go
to
those
areas
which
in
turn
likely
became
more
attractive
to
criminals
who
could
commit
crimes
there
without
being
seen
by
bystanders
in
an
interview
jacobson
said
the
study
could
help
disprove
the
popular
belief
that
marijuana
dispensaries
contribute
to
crime
in
neighborhoods
she
noted
that
her
work
s
suggestions
are
particularly
timely
considering
recreational
marijuana
will
be
legal
in

in
i
think

are
just
going

have
to
get
over

a
spokesman
for
the

said
it
was
baffling
that
the
city
would
challenge
policies
designed
to
keep
residents
safer
given
that
violent
crime
has
risen
in
los

since

has
gone
up
in

three

it
is
still

that
generally
offer
illegal

safe
harbor
by
declining
to
use

to

a

judge
however
drastically
limited
the
scope
of
that
policy
in
a

filed
by
the
city
of
san
francisco
the
justice
department
then
sought
to
impose
conditions
on

enforcement
that
mandates
access
to
local

for
federal

officials
as

the

has
also
filed
a
lawsuit

drew
the

back
as
the
s
boyer
was
the
most
recent
officer
killed
to
be
honored
at
the
ceremony
the
veteran
whittier
police
officer
was
slain
in
a
shootout
in
february
whittier
police
chief
jeff
piper
spoke
about
boyer
at
the
ceremony
keith
was
an
intelligent
inspiring
compassionate
person
who
provided
exceptional
public
service
for
nearly
years
and
like
those
heroes
on
the
wall
behind
me
he
will
never
be
forgotten
piper
said
the
whittier

department
honored
boyer
last
week
by
memori
alizing
him
on
the
whittier
police
memorial
statue
in
front
of
the
police
station
piper
criticized
state
legislation
most
notably
ab
and
proposition
that
he
said
allowed
boyer
s
alleged
killer
michael
christopher
mejia
of
los

to
be
on
the
street
adopted
in
ab
allows

for

community
supervision
and
prop
reduces
several
drug
related
crimes
from
felonies
to
misdemeanors
boyer
s
alleged
killer
piper
said
was
free
on
post
release
community
supervision
and
had
been
jailed
six
times
since
june
for
drug
related
crimes
and
held
in
county
jail
for
days
each
time
the
maximum
time
allowed
it
s
a
fallacy
to
believe
our
criminal
justice
reforms
are
serving
the
best
interests
of
anyone
but
the
recycled
criminal
piper
said
this
isn
t
about
locking
people
up
this
is
about
policymakers
addressing
shortcomings
and
failures
of
our
current
system
and
having
the
fortitude
to
do
what
s
right
researchers
of
ab
and
california
s
other
prison
reform
bills
have
said
there
is
no
evidence
of
increases
in
violent
crime
across
the
state
as
a
result
of
their
passage
don
clark
boyer
s
stepfather
said
he
appreciated
the
ceremony
and
the
effort
to
honor
all
fallen
officers
but
no
efforts
to
honor
boyer
would
bring
him
back
these
guys
deserve
so
much
more
clark
said
it
s
still
quite
an
open
wound
for

owen
and

alfonso
lopez
both
of
whom
were

were
honored

killed
in

had
gone

also

for
their
dedication
to
their
duties
he
said
the
sacrifices
of
all
the
honorees
should
cause
people
to
give
thanks
for
what
police
officers
risk
on
a
daily
basis
collectively
across
our
county
during
this
contentious
political
time
we
can
take
the
time
to
pause
and
reflect
on
the
positive
role
that

the

where
andrews
and
lisa

the
defendants
could
not

reached
according
to
the
complaint
the
property
is
a
hospitable
place
for
gang
members
and
their
associates
in
particular
one
group
that
embraces
white
supremacist
ideology
and
has
ties
to
the
aryan
brotherhood
prison
gang
one
gang
member
was
arrested
last
october
with
a
quantity
of
methamphetamine
while
sitting
in
his
car
while
another
was
taken
into
custody
in
december
outside
the
home
with
a
rifle
and
live
ammunition
that
he
used
in
a
burglary
the
suit
alleges
these
and
other
gang
members
are
able
to
further
their
gang
activity
by
using
the
property
as
a
safe
haven
to
buy
sell
and
use
narcotics
store
stolen
property
and
exert
control
over
the
neighborhood
the
suit
alleges
both
lisa
bellinaso
and
andrews
have
been
arrested
several
times
for
drug
related
crimes
at
the
home
the
suit
states
lisa
bellinaso
owned
the
property
from
until
late
or
early
when
she
transferred
it
to
a
trust
controlled
by
her
mother
the
suit
states
lisa
bellinaso
also
has
been
arrested
for
diverting
electrical
power
to
the
property
through
a
bypass
of
a

of

meter
the

alleges
andrews
is
a
longtime
drug
user
and
seller
and
has
been
convicted
of
at
least
seven
narcotics
related
offenses
since
the

the

is
less
than

los

reports
of
sexual
assaults
and
domestic
violence
among
los
angeles
latino
population
have
plummeted
since
the
beginning
of
the
year
amid
fears
that
immigrants
in
the
country
illegally
could
face
deportation
if
they
interact
with
police
or
appear
in
court
the
city
s
police
chief
said
tuesday
since
the
beginning
of
sexual
assault
reports
have
dropped
percent
and
domestic
violence
reports
have
decreased
by
percent
among
latinos
los
angeles
police
department
chief
charlie
beck
said
tuesday
similar
decreases
weren
t
seen
in
other
ethnic
groups
he
said
imagine
your
sister
your
mother
not
reporting
a
sexual
assault
for
fear
that
their
family
will
be
torn
apart
beck
said
tuesday
around
the
nation
president
donald
trump
s
efforts
to
crack
down
on
the
estimated
million
immigrants
living
illegally
in
the
u
s
have
sparked
fear
and
anxiety
leading
many
people
to
try
to
avoid
any
contact
with
law
enforcement
beck
said
there
was
a
strong
correlation
between
the
timing
of
the
decreased
reporting
and
fears
of
accelerated
efforts
to
round
up
and
deport
immigrants
josh
rubenstein
a
los
angeles
police
spokesman
said
the
numbers
were
concerning
and
that
the
department
is
continuing
to
look
at
every
element
contributing
to
the
drop
in
reporting
advocates
say
the
unease
among
immigrants
is
forcing
the
victims
of
violent
crimes
to
stay
silent
we
are
seeing
immigrant
families
potentially
being
so
afraid
of
the
ultimate
punishment
which
deportation
represents
that
they
may
forego
their
chances
of
justice
said
jorge
mario
cabrera
of
the
immigrant
advocacy
group
chirla
we
do
not
want
to
be
in
a
situation
where
victims
of
crimes
remain
silent
because
they
fear
deportation
that
s
just
horrible
and
unthinkable
in
an
interview
with
the
associated
press
earlier
this
month
los
angeles
county
sheriff
jim
mcdonnell
said
gang
members
have
also
been
preying
on
undocumented
immigrants
and
telling
them
they
would
be
deported
if
they
report
crimes
to
the
police
certainly
the
felons
in
our
community
are
using
that
as
a
weapon
against
the
hardworking
people
letting
them
believe
that
if
you
come
forward
as
a
witness
or
a
victim
to
the
police
that
you
open
yourself
up
to
deportation
mcdonnell
said
that
is
certainly
not

a
hate
crime
expert
s
report
to
los

county
officials
on
the
reasons
for
a
rise
in
political
violence
is
something
people
should
hear
even
if
they
d
rather
not
nobody
wants
to
be
told
that
their
side
of
the
political
divide
is
partly
to
blame
for
the
dark
turn
in
the
climate
of
debate
we
d
all
like
to
think
it
s
the
other
side
that
takes
things
too
far
so
it
s
informative
to
read
the
report
by
professor
brian
levin
of
cal
state
san
bernardino
s
department
of
criminal
justice
and
see
that
the
political
left
and
right
are
both
responsible
levin
presented
his
report
based
on
los
angeles
police
department
data
last
week
to
l
a
county
s
network
against
hate
crime
it
showed
that
the
city
of
los
angeles
had
hate
crimes
in
up
percent
from
l
a
s
first
consecutive
annual
increases
in
two
decades
crimes
motivated
by
the
victim
s
identity
were
led
last
year
by
against
blacks
against
gay
men
against
jewish
people
and
against
hispanics
but
next
on
the
list
were
hate
crimes
listed
as
anti
white
up
from
seven
the
year
before
that
s
more
than
the
number
of
hate
crimes
against
muslims
or
against
asians
or
pacific
islanders
official
statistics
on
hate
crimes
don
t
include
crimes
targeting
members
of
political
groups
but
violence
at
political
demonstrations
also
rose
in
in
the
heat
of
the
presidential
race
levin
said
the
rising
threat
to
civil
discourse
he
said
now
comes
from
the
extreme
left
the
hard
left
now
poses
a
distinct
threat
to
the
maintenance
of
free
speech
on
some
california
university
campuses
like
uc
berkeley
owing
to
their
swarming
of
campuses
featuring
bigoted
or
controversial
speakers
levin
said
in
his
report
levin
said
armed
anti
racist
black
bloc
antifa
and
other
hard
left
partisans
not
only
targeted
hate
groups
racist
skinheads
and
alt
right
partisans
but
police
journalists
campus
venues
and
donald
trump
supporters
as
well
a
small
number
of
whom
sometimes
instigated
violence
neither
political
extreme
can
escape
responsibility
that
s
a
hard
lesson
for
many
to
learn
which
is
why
it
s
the
message
that
must
be
heard

he

in

it

led

to
reflect
on
fame
race
and
equality
during

at

in

no

how
much
money
you
have
no
matter
how
famous
you
are
no
matter
how
many
people
admire
you
being
black
in

is
tough
james
said
wednesday
we
have
a
long
way
to
go
for
us
as
a
society
and
for
us
as
african
americans
until
we
feel
equal
in
america
but
my
family
is
safe
and
that
s
what
s
important
cops
said
there
have
not

any

recent
incidents
like
it

james
thanked
his
wife
savannah

was
in

the
time
for
handling
the
hard
questions
raised
by
the
couple
s
two
sons
in
the
wake
of
the
hateful
graffiti
but
it
just
goes
to
show
that
racism
will
always
be
a
part
of
the
world
a
part
of
america
he
added
you
know
hate
in
america
especially
for

am
appalled

wulf
who
lives
three
doors
down
said
as
she
walked
by
james
house
with
her

this
is
a
man
who
should
be
celebrated
and
emulated
for
everything
he
s
done
to
help
young
people
be
educated
and
succeed
in
life
and
to
deface
his
house
it
s
really
appalling
it
s
a
horrible
event

said
she

suburb

the
number
of
arrests
by
police
in
california
has
plunged
in
recent
years
but
that
doesn
t
necessarily
represent
good
news
on
crime
according
to
an
analysis
published
saturday
the
state
saw
million
arrests
for
misdemeanors
and
felonies
in
the
most
recent
year
with
figures
available
according
to
the
los
angeles
times
in
los
angeles
arrests
dropped
by
percent
from
to
even
as
the
city
saw
a
spike
in
crime
there
s
no
clear
reason
behind
the
decline
law
enforcement
officials
said
fewer
officers
and
changes
in
strategy
could
be
behind
some
of
it
others
said
increased
scrutiny
of
officers
after
a
series
of
high
profile
shootings
and
beatings
most
involving
black
suspects
have
led
to
less
motivation
in
a
national
survey
of
law
enforcement
officers
in
percent
said
they
and
their
fellow
officers
were
less
likely
to
stop
and
question
people
because
of
such
incidents
not
to
make
fun
of
it
but
a
lot
of
guys
are
like
look
i
m
just
going

going

going

making

who
may
be
up
to
something
nefarious
i
m
not

anymore
los

police
chief
charlie
beck
did
not
agree
saying
he
hasn

seen
significant
hesitance
i
d
be
denying
human
nature
if
i
didn

say
police
are
very
cautious
about
what
they
do
now
because
of
the
scrutiny
beck
said
but
do
i
see
it
i
don
t
really
see
things
that
make
me
think
that
the
workforce
as
a
body
is
retreating
i
don
t
see
that
at
all
proposition
a
ballot
measure
passed
by
state
voters
in
november
downgraded
some
felonies
to
misdemeanors
and
many
police
officers
told
the
times
that
means
those
arrests
are
often
not
worth
the
time
and
effort
they
take
beck
said
in
his
city
the
increase
has
come
in
the
most
serious
crimes
while
the
decrease
has
come
from
drug
arrests
but
he
said
a
positive
change
in
policing
is
partly
behind
the
drop
in
arrests
with
less
emphasis
in
his
department
on
just
making
countless
busts
as
was
the
case
decades
ago
the
only
thing
we
cared
about
was
how
many
arrests
we
made
beck
said
i
don

want

to

a
black
market
for
diesel

has
rapidly
spread
around

with

gangs
using
fraudulent
credit
cards
to
siphon
millions
of
dollars
in
fuel
from
gas
stations
into
large
tanks
hidden
inside
pickups
and
vans
stealing
fuel
can
be
less
risky
than
selling
drugs
or
other
illegal
endeavors
and
criminals
can
make
or
more
a
day
reselling
the
stolen
fuel
at
construction
sites
and
unscrupulous
gas
stations
or
to
truckers
looking

pretty
rampant

whose

solely
on

prevent

he
said
the

the

worst

black

diesel
started
becoming

when

became

dewitt
said

install
these

at

record

information

fuel
up
the
information
is
later
transferred
to

on

counterfeit
card
the
problem
has
only
grown
as
the
devices
become
more
sophisticated
the
black
market
has
grown
quickly
in
part
because
the
thefts
total
a
few
hundred
dollars
at
a
time
and
prosecutors
were
slow
to
prioritize
them
but
as
fuel
thefts
become
more
organized
they
have
caught

he

they
used
to
be
considered
a
victimless
crime
and
yet
they
were
making
more
money
doing
this
than
a

that

angeles
so
it
couldn
t
account
for
violent
crimes
such
as
murder
or
arson
according
to
jacobson
since
they
aren
t
common
enough
to
show
up
in
the
window
of
time
she
and
chang
analyzed
the
study
also
didn
t
attempt
to
factor
in
how
marijuana
dispensaries
might
impact
local
quality
of
life
either
for
the
better
by
offering
alternatives
to
addictive
drugs
such
as
opiates
or
for
the
negative
by
increasing
problems
such
as
loitering
and
traffic
future
research
on
those
areas
is
crucial
before
broad
conclusions
on
how
cannabis
shops
impact
crime
can
be
locked
down
the
report
states
but
jacobson
hopes
her
study
might
lead
to
more
fact
based
policy
discussions
as
california
gets
ready
to
launch
recreational
marijuana
sales
on
jan
the
study
inspiration
for
the
study
goes
back
to
jacobson
was
living
in
venice
and
noticed
that
dispensaries
all
over
town
were
being
shut
down
as
los
angeles
attempted
to
rein
in
its
massive
medical
marijuana
market
the
talk
at
the
time
was
largely
about
how
these
stores
made
neighborhoods
less
safe
with
reports
by
the
los
angeles
police
department
that
blamed
crime
rate
increases
in
the
mid
s
on
the
city
s
explosion
of
pot
shops
even
today
while
percent
of
americans
support
people
s
right
to
use
medical
marijuana
the
same
polls
show
percent
said
they
would
be
somewhat
or
very
concerned
if
a
dispensary
opened
near
them
only
one
city
in
orange
county
allows
medical
marijuana
dispensaries
while
just
a
handful
of
cities
permit
such
shops
in
riverside
and
san
bernardino
counties
and
many
law
enforcement
agencies
and
policymakers
cite
public
safety
concerns
when
explaining
their
opposition
to
allowing
marijuana
activities
in
their
boundaries
this
town
has
been
a
town
of
safety
and
we
re
trying
with
this
initiative
to
make
sure
that
we
keep
our
residents
safe
said
fontana
mayor
acquanetta
warren
just
before
she
helped
vote
in
one
of
the
most
restrictive
cannabis
policies
in
the
state
jacobson
had
never
studied
the
marijuana
industry
before
but
given
how
tough
it
is
both
to
pinpoint
definite
causes
for
changes
in
crime
rates
and
to
study
then
unregulated
dispensaries
she
saw
the
scenario
that
was
unfolding
in
los
angeles
as
the
perfect
test
for
a
simple
premise
if
these
dispensaries
truly
were
crime
magnets
we
d
expect
to
see
a
sharp
decrease
in
crime
when
they
shut
down
jacobson
said
on
june
roughly
percent
of
the
nearly
shops
operating
in
los
angeles
were
ordered
to
close
jacobson
and
chang
used
data
collected
by
the
los
angeles
times
to
analyze
crime
rates
before
and
after
shops
shut
down
comparing
those
numbers
to
neighborhoods
where
shops
were
allowed
to
stay
open
though
they
looked
at
days
of
data
jacobson
said
they
limited
their
main
focus
to
a
day
window
because
many
of
the
closures
were
temporary
once
it
became
clear
that
the
city
wasn
t
going
to
enforce
its
ban
dispensaries
started
to
randomly
reopen
the
professors
found
a
percent
to
percent
increase
in
property
crimes
within
a
third
of
a
mile
surrounding
the
shuttered
pot
shops
at
a
fourth
of
a
mile
out
they
study
found
a
percent
to
percent
increase
in
crime
and
at
an
eighth
of
a
mile
the
study
found
a
percent
to
percent
increase
in
low
level
crimes
once
dispensaries
were
shut
down
based
on
those
numbers
the
study
says
one
open
dispensary
might
save
the
neighborhood
more
than
each
year
by
preventing
petty
thefts
the
los
angeles
police
department
said
it
hadn
t
had
a
chance
to
review
the
uc
irvine
study
and
so
couldn
t
comment
on
its
findings
and
a
spokesman
for
the
department
s
union
the
los
angeles
police
protective
league
declined
to
weigh
in
on
how
these
results
jive
with
what
their
officers
see
in
the
field
the
explanation
jacobson
and
chang
wanted
to
better
understand
what
caused
the
spike
in
crime
after
dispensaries
shut
down
so
they
analyzed
the
same
data
on
another
type
of
business
that
faces
similar
circumstances
when
restaurants
are
temporarily
shut
down
due
to
health
code
violations
the
study
found
nearly
identical
increases
in
low
level
crimes
as
what
they
saw
in
connection
with
dispensaries
the
pattern
suggests
that
it
s
not
pot
shops
in
particular
that
help
deter
crime
but
just
about
any
type
of
business
that
brings
more
people
to
a
neighborhood
it
s
known
as
the
eyes
upon
the
street
theory
framed
in
a
book
by
urban
activist
jane
jacobs
the
idea
is
that
streets
are
safer
when
more
people
are
around
to
keep
an
eye
on
what
s
happening
dispensaries
may
have
some
added
cushions
against
increased
crime
the
study
says
they
tend
to
have
security
cameras
and
security
guards
on
their
property
they
may
draw
more
regular
police
patrols
and
there
s
data
to
show
that
marijuana
use
might
reduce
aggressive
behavior
though
dispensaries
sell
a
unique
product
jacobson
said
mounting
evidence
suggests
policymakers
can
safely
regulate
them
much
as
they
do
other
small
businesses
it
seems
to
me
that
we
don
t
report
on
the
crime
at
starbucks
or
eleven
or
other
businesses
in
the
same
way
that
we
report
on
crime
around
dispensaries
because
people
are
interested
in
that
she
said
it
s
fine
to
talk
about
how
you
need
to
regulate
dispensaries
but
you
don
t
need
to
throw
these
scare
tactics

there

a

an

but
what
was
also
notable
were
the

intolerance
at

levin

have
emerged
as
the

behind
those

a
black
market
for
diesel
and
gasoline
has
rapidly
spread
around
the
nation
with
organized
crime
gangs
using
fraudulent
credit
cards
to
siphon
millions
of
dollars
in
fuel
from
gas
stations
into
large
tanks
hidden
inside
pickup
trucks
and
vans
stealing
fuel
can
be
less
risky
than
selling
drugs
or
other
illegal
endeavors
and
criminals
can
make
or
more
a
day
re
selling
the
stolen
fuel
at
construction
sites
and
unscrupulous
gas
stations
or
to
truckers
looking
to
cut
costs
investigators
and
industry
experts
said
it
s
pretty
rampant
said
owen
dewitt
whose
texas
based
company
know
control
focuses
solely
on
helping
gas
stations
prevent
fuel
theft
he
said
the
crime
is
worst
along
interstate
from
jacksonville
fla
to
the
los

area
california
and
florida
are
the
two
worst
texas
is
no
black
market
diesel
started
becoming
a
big
business
when
credit
card
skimmers
became
more
prevalent
around
dewitt
said
thieves
install
these
devices
at
gas
station
pumps
where
they
record
card
information
as
unsuspecting
customers
fuel
up
the
information
is
later
transferred
to
a
magnetic
strip
on
a
counterfeit
card
the
problem
has
only
grown
as
the
devices
become
more
sophisticated
the
black
market
has
grown
quickly
in
part
because
the
thefts
total
a
few
hundred
dollars
at
a
time
and
prosecutors
were
slow
to
prioritize
them
but
as
fuel
thefts
become
more
organized
they
have
caught
the
attention
of
state
and
federal
authorities
around
the
country
agriculture
and
consumer
services
commissioner
adam
putnam
s
department
takes
the
lead
on
prosecuting
these
crimes
in
florida
he
said
they
used
to
be
considered
a
victimless
or
slap
on
the
wrist
type
crime
and
yet
they
were
making
more
money
doing
this
than
a
lot
of
other
criminal
activities
that
had
a
lot
higher
sentences
the
u
s
secret
service
which
investigates
financial
crimes
is
involved
because
the
gangs
use
credit

skimmers
agent
steve
scarince
said
miami
los

and
las

are
hot
spots
together
accounting
for
about
million
gallons
a
year
in
stolen
diesel
the
crews
that
we
ve
investigated
over
the
past
couple
of
years
the
least
profitable
group
is
million
a
year
and
then
there
are
groups
that
will
gross
million
plus
scarince
said
the
gang
bangers
in
los
angeles
have
been
migrating
to
financial
crimes
instead
of
street
crimes
because
it
s
much
more
profitable
and
if
you
get
caught
you
get
probation

records
from
a

in

how
much
money
even

can

a

with
seven
pickup

and
suvs
with

each
for
months
they
observed
drivers
using
credit
card
information
stolen
from
about
people
to
fill
up
three
times
a
day
they
transferred
the
diesel
into
a
gallon
industrial
fuel
tanker
that
made
daily
runs
to
sell
the
fuel
to
gas
stations
agents
estimated
they
stole
close
to
in
fuel
every
day
with
the
potential
to
steal
million
a
year
records
indicated
it
was
in

for
about
five
years
before

has
been

today

a

last

there
are
ways
of
foiling
these

including

tampers

it

was
the
most

killed
to
be
honored
at

ceremony
the
veteran

officer
was
slain
in

shootout
in
february
whittier
police
chief
jeff

spoke
about
boyer
at
the
ceremony
keith
was
an
intelligent
inspiring
compassionate
person
who
provided
exceptional
public
service
for
nearly
years
and
like
those
heroes
on
the

behind

he
will
never
be
forgotten
piper
said
the
whittier

honored
boyer
last
week
by
memorializing
him
on
the
whittier
police
memorial
statue
in
front
of
the
police
station
piper
criticized
state
legislation
most
notably
ab
and
proposition
that
he
said
allowed
boyer
s
alleged
killer
michael
christopher
mejia
of
los

to
be
on
the
street
adopted
in
ab

prisoners
up

for

release
community
supervision
and
prop
reduces
several
drug
related
crimes
from

to

boyer
s
alleged
killer
piper
said
was
free
on
post
release
community
supervision
and
had
been
jailed
six
times
since
june
for
drug
related
crimes
and
held
in
county
jail
for
days
each
time
the
maximum
time
allowed
it
s
a
fallacy
to
believe
our
criminal
justice
reforms
are
serving
the
best
interests
of
anyone
but
the
recycled
criminal
piper
said
this
isn
t
about
locking
people
up
this
is
about
policymakers
addressing
shortcomings
and
failures
of
our
current
system
and
having
the
fortitude
to
do
what
s
right
researchers
of
ab
and
california
s
other
prison
reform
bills
have
said
there
is
no
evidence
of
increases
in
violent
crime
across
the
state
as
a
result
of
their
passage
don
clark
boyer
s
stepfather
said
he
appreciated
the
ceremony
and
the
effort
to
honor
all
fallen
officers
but
no
efforts
to
honor
boyer
would
bring
him
back
these
guys
deserve
so
much
more
clark
said
it
s
still
quite
an
open
wound
for
us

steven
owen
and

alfonso
lopez
both
of
whom
were
also
killed
in

ceremony
were
honored
alongside
boyer
three
others
killed
in

past

who
had
gone
unrecognized
were
also
recognized

praised
owen

for
their
dedication
to
their

he
said
the
sacrifices
of
all
the
honorees
should
cause
people
to
give
thanks
for
what
police
officers
risk
on
a
daily
basis
collectively
across
our
county
during
this
contentious
political
time
we

take

referring

and

covina
which
saw
violent
crime
increases
of
about
percent

attributed
the
rise
in

to
a
combination
of
social
factors
like
the
economy
and
housing
as

as
ab
and

any
impact

kubrin
said
her
research

the

no

and
a
small
impact
on

crime
she
said
an
uptick
in
gang
violence
in
los

county
and
the
city
of
los

in
particular
have
been
major
drivers
behind
increased
violent
crime
it
s
hard
to
parse
out
exactly
what
the
causes
are
but
things
like
homelessness
housing
the
economy
drugs
gangs
mental
health
all
of
these
things
tend
to
be
the
driving
forces
kubrin
said
although
homelessness
has
become
more
prevalent
across
los

county
sanchez
said
pasadena
s
homeless
population
which
according
to
a
city
survey
decreased
from
to
only
accounts
for
a
small
fraction
of
violent
crimes
he
added
that
an
increase
in
gang
activity
in
the
second
half
of

lead
to
more
incidents
of
violent

he

in

you

are
made
by

ignorance

you
can
never

in

the

saw
some
crimes
last
year
up
from
about
crimes
in
following
years
of
declines
according
to
police

part
of
sherman
s
challenge
is
getting
the
public
to
lock
car
doors
not
leave
keys
or
other
valuables
inside
their
vehicles
and
encouraging
residents
to
talk
to

he

our

are
property
crimes
he

violent

is
down
in
the

about
percent
so
far
this

sherman
said
but
property
crimes
are
up
about
percent
today
there
are
more
ways
for
the
public
to
become
involved
to
safeguard
their
neighborhoods
including
facebook
groups
as
well
as
social
networks
like
nextdoor
where
neighbors
can
exchange
information
and
tips
he
said
the
seven
los

police
stations
in
the
valley
also
are
using
predictive
policing
to
help
put
officers
in
areas
where
there
is
a
high
probability
that
property
crimes
will
occur
next

it
may

be
that
lapd
capt
lillian
carranza
s
claims
that
the
department
intentionally
underreports
violent
crime
are
nothing
but
damn
lies
as
chief
charlie
beck
said
earlier
this
week
los
angeles
is
nationally
recognized
for
the
integrity
of
its
gathering
and
reporting
of
crime
numbers
it
has
a
data
integrity
unit
that
scours
the
reports
to
ensure
that
the
books
are
not
cooked
and
carranza
has
a
personal
ax
to
grind
her
allegations
come
as
part
of
a
claim
in
which
she
says
she
was
denied
a
promotion
still
it
would
be
easier
to
dismiss
her
assertions
out
of
hand
were
it
not
for
the
fact
that
a
times
investigation
found
widespread
misclassification
of
violent
crimes
as
minor
offenses
and
if
the
lapd
s
inspector
general
had
not
made
similar
findings
the
following
year
the
department
was
indeed
underreporting
violent
crime
in
l
a
those
errors
apparently
were
unintentional
the
inspector
general
reported
but
the
lapd
now
has
a
record
of
releasing
bad
numbers
so
it
s
hard
to
have
unqualified
confidence
in
the
face
of
new
allegations
it
goes
without
saying
that
accurate
crime
numbers
are
essential
not
just
for
effective
and
efficient
policing
but
to
properly
inform
the
public
about
their
risks
and
their
safety
and
to
ensure
sensible
criminal
justice
laws
and
policies
if
the
inspector
general
and
the
civilian
police
commission
must
triple
check
the
integrity
of
the
crime
numbers
over
and
over
so
be
it
beck
s
strong
denial
is
welcome
but
let
s
not
wait
until
carranza
s
claims
are
tested
in
court
the
commission
ought
to
do
what
it
must
to
reassure
itself
and
the
public
that
the
lapd
s
crime
numbers
are
accurate
and
if
they
are
not
whether
the
fudging
is
intentional

garcetti
portrays

but
indifference
might
be
better
word
true
he
was
re
elected
last
year
with
percent
of
the
vote
but
just
one
in
five
angelenos
turned
out
for
that
election
one
reason
for
the
lack
of
enthusiasm
the
city
s
rising
crime
rate
data
from
the
city

police
department
show
that
violent
crime
increased
percent

an
astonishing
percent
over
this
year
the
city
s
homeless
services
authority
reported
the
homelessness
had
increased
percent
over
the
previous

the
mayor
s
response
at
a
press
conference
was
oddly
passive
i
was
particularly
disappointed
to
see
veteran
numbers
go
up
he
said
the
mayor
said
the
city
s
homelessness
crisis
has
been
around
through
administrations
through
recessions
so
much
for
the
buck
stopping
at

hall
the
problems
extend
beyond
the
rule
of

if
you
wanted
to
buy

home
in
los

you
better
be
prepared
to
spend
north
of
a
half
million
dollars
the
los

reported
this
spring
that
median
home
prices
in
the
city
were
up
six
percent
over

to
a
staggering
these
residents
are
paying
more

the
city
s
flagging
quality
of

has
been
exacerbated
in
recent

the
garcetti
years
have
been
golden
if
you
re
a
flashy
technology
company
that
hires
highly
skilled
highly
paid
employees
the

will
roll
out
the

other

haven

been

lucky

was
once
a
national
and
international
hub
of
apparel
manufacturing
today
experts
warn
that
the
exodus
has
begun
thanks
in

to
a
dramatic
minimum

hike
that
our

championed

the

was
busy
hobnobbing

in

hardly
the
only
los

be
hit
with
such
a
complaint
i
m
personally
aware
of
over
such
businesses
more
than
complaints
are
filed
each

what
we
all
have
in
common
is
that
the

has
provided
little
to
no
help
to
manufacturers
being
crushed
by
the
hostile
regulatory
and
legal
environment
in

not

rather
than

i
d
encourage

to
focus
on
the
here
and
now
i
d
be
happy
to
describe
a
handful
of
pressing
problems
faced
by
businesses
in

concrete
steps
that
he
can
take

i
founded

earlier
this

the

to
do
just
that
and
i
m
sure

of

can
give

an
earful
on

improvements
that
they
need
if

made

investigate

heavyweights
as
producer
harvey
weinstein
director
james
toback
and
actor

westwick
among

the

attorney
said
she
has
assigned
a
group
of
veteran
sex
crimes
prosecutors
to
work
together
to
examine
the
cases
and
ensure
a
uniformed
approach
to
the
legal
review
and
possible
prosecution
of
any
case
that
meets
both
the
legal
and
factual
standards
for
criminal
prosecution
legal
experts
said
the
task
force
makes
sense
but
continued
to
caution
that
such
cases
can
be
difficult
to
prove
many
of
the
alleged
incidents
occurred
years
ago
and
detectives
need
to
determine
whether
physical
evidence
or
witness
statements
exist
that
can
help
build
cases
it
does
speak
to
the
culture
of
the
city
that
this

a
major
criminal
justice
issue
worthy

said

a

it
is
a

idea
to

on

get
their
expectations
up

reports
are
coming
from
other
police
overseas
los
angeles
police
officials
thursday
said
some
of
the
allegations
are
too
old
to
pursue
because
of
the
statute
of
limitations
for
various
sex
crimes
this
week
actor
corey
feldman
reported
to
the
lapd
that
he
was
sexually
abused
by
two
adults
as
a
child
in
the
industry
unfortunately
according
to
california
law
the
alleged
occurrence
is
out
of
statute
and
robbery
homicide
detectives
have
no
other
avenues
to
pursue
this
case
said
lapd
spokesman
officer
sal
ramirez
however
the
lapd
applauds
mr
feldman
for
coming
forward
as
an
out
of
statute
assault
report
could
potentially
bolster
any
current
and
forthcoming
case
as
it
creates

the
city
of
los
angeles
announced
tuesday
that
it
is
suing
president
donald
trump
s
department
of
justice
claiming
that
new
conditions
requiring
police
to
cooperate
with
immigration
enforcement
officials
to
qualify
for
anti
crime
funding
are
unconstitutional
and
should
be
blocked
city
attorney
mike
feuer
said
he
is
asking
a
federal
judge
to
strike
down
rules
u

announced
last

for

department
funds
that
have
long
been
dispersed
to
local
law
enforcement
agencies
to
bolster
efforts
to
fight
violent
and
gang
crime
going
forward
sessions
said
police
agencies
that
want
a
piece
of
the
funding
would
have
to
first
demonstrate
that
they
are
willing
to
help
immigration
officials
identify
and
detain
people
in
local
jails
who
are
suspected
of
being
in
the
country
illegally
we
re
suing
to
block
the
trump
administration
from
unconstitutionally
imposing
its
will
on
our
city
the
administration
would
put
l
a
to
the
untenable
choice
of
risking
a
key
public
safety
grant
or
making
lapd
an
arm
of
federal
civil
immigration
policy
feuer
said
in
a
statement
the
justice
department
awards
the
grant
money
to
states
and
cities
annually
in
the
past
the
amount
cities
receive
has
been
calculated
based
on
population
and
crime
statistics
in
each
of
the
last
years
los
angeles
has
received
over
million
including
million
for
the
fiscal
year
this
year
l
a
would
be
eligible
to
receive
million
to
be
shared
between
the
city
and

the
legal
challenge
is
the
latest

stealing

can
be
less

than

a

re

the

diesel

becoming

when

became
more
prevalent
around
dewitt
said
thieves
install
these

at
gas

pumps
where
they
record

information
as
unsuspecting

fuel
up
the
information
is
later
transferred
to

on

counterfeit
card
the
problem
has
only
grown
as
the
devices
become
more
sophisticated
the
black
market
has
grown
quickly
in
part
because
the
thefts
total
a
few
hundred
dollars
at
a
time
and
prosecutors
were
slow
to
prioritize
them
but
as
fuel
thefts
become

they

los

the
number
of
arrests
by
police
in
california
has
plunged
in
recent
years
but
that
doesn
t
necessarily
represent
good
news
on
crime
according
to
an
analysis
published
saturday
the
state
saw
million
arrests
for
misdemeanors
and
felonies
in
the
most
recent
year
with
figures
available
according
to
the
los
angeles
times
in
los
angeles
arrests
dropped
by
percent
from
to
even
as
the
city
saw
a
spike
in
crime
there
s
no
clear
reason
behind
the
decline
law
enforcement
officials
said
fewer
officers
and
changes
in
strategy
could
be
behind
some
of
it
others
said
increased
scrutiny
of
officers
after
a
series
of
high
profile
shootings
and
beatings
most
involving
black
suspects
have
led
to
less
motivation
in
a
national
survey
of
law
enforcement
officers
in
percent
said
they
and
their
fellow
officers
were
less
likely
to
stop
and
question
people
because
of
such
incidents
not
to
make
fun
of
it
but
a
lot
of
guys
are
like
look
i
m
just
going
to
act

m
going

but
going
out
there
and
making

stops
and
contacting
persons
who
may
be
up
to
something
nefarious
i
m
not
going
to
do
that
anymore
los

police
chief
charlie
beck
did
not
agree
saying
he
hasn
t
seen
significant
hesitance
i
d
be
denying
human
nature
if
i
didn
t
say
police
are
very
cautious
about
what
they
do
now
because
of
the
scrutiny
beck
said
but
do
i
see
it
i
don
t
really
see
things
that
make
me
think
that
the
workforce
as
a
body
is
retreating
i
don
t
see
that
at
all
proposition
a
ballot
measure
passed
by
state
voters
in
november
downgraded
some
felonies
to
misdemeanors
and
many
police
officers
told
the
times
that
means
those
arrests
are
often
not
worth
the
time
and
effort
they
take
beck
said
in
his
city
the
increase
has
come
in
the
most
serious
crimes
while
the
decrease
has
come
from
drug
arrests
but
he
said
a
positive
change
in
policing
is
partly
behind
the
drop
in
arrests
with
less
emphasis
in
his
department
on
just
making
countless
busts
as
was
the
case
decades
ago
the
only
thing
we
cared
about
was
how
many
arrests
we
made
beck
said
i
don
t
want
them
to
care
about
that
i
want
them
to
care
about
how
safe
their

is

a

police
identified

manukyan
can
be

calmly
walking
away
from

and
ignoring
someone
who
repeatedly
shouts
why
did
you

long
said
at

yesterday

asked
for
the
public
help
in
locating
manukyan
after
a
weeks
long
search
failed
to
result
in

the

the

manukyan

has
been
cooperative
but
the
suspect
s
motives
remain
unclear
manukyan
was
not
known
to
the
gurdwara
s
community
said
nirinjan
singh
khalsa
executive
director
of
the
california
sikh
council
i
am
fully
confident
he
designed
this
as
a
threat
to
the
sikh
community
and
we
need
to
take
him
into
custody
to
make
sure
that
the
community
not
just
the
sikh
community
but
the
community
as
a
whole
is
safer
long
said
if
arrested
manukyan
could
face
vandalism
charges
with
a
hate
crime
enhancement
long
said
he
would
also
face
criminal
threats
charges
for
brandishing
a
blade
at
the
man
who
filmed
him
according
to
long
who
said
the
case
has
been
presented
to
the
los
angeles
county
district
attorney
s
office
long
said
the
suspect
may
be
mentally
ill
but
it
is
not
clear
if
he
has
been
formally
diagnosed
the
paper
reported
khalsa
said
he
believes
that
attacks
on
the
sikh
community
have
increased
recently
as
well
i
can
tell
you
on
behalf
of
the
sikh
community
that
these
incidents
are
up
especially
in
the
political
climate
we
re
in
now
in
the
past
hate
crimes
against
sikhs
were
mistaken
identity
hate
crimes
he
said
unfortunately
now
what
we
re
seeing
is
sikhs
are
part
of
the
other
group
in
the
mind
of
some
people
that
think
hatred
is
patriotic
he
added
the
woman
on
the
other
end
of
the
line
said
her
husband
had

of

declined
among

in
some
of

a
retreat

professionals
say
is
driven
by

some
police

advocates
now

become
targets
for
other

though

about

they

the
reason
they

is
because

they
don

on

gonzalez
pulled
his

to
a
stop
near
a
row
of
apartments
in
cudahy
ahead
of
a
community
meeting
in
a
predominantly
spanish
speaking
neighborhood
the
mood
in
the
city
was
tense
the
night
before
a
pro
trump
demonstrator
protesting
the
city
s
sanctuary
status
had
been
arrested
on

of
brandishing
a

gonzalez

went
door

flashing
smiles
and
speaking
spanish
to
residents
urging
them
to
attend

gonzalez
spoke
calmly
to
the

of
several
dozen
people
sipping
from
styrofoam

we

not

you
where
you

gonzalez

he

ice
issued
a
statement
dismissing
links
between
immigration
enforcement
and
a
decline
in
crime
reporting
among
immigrants
as
speculative
and
irresponsible
the
drop
in
reporting
could
result
from
an
overall
decrease
in
domestic
violence
crimes
the
agency
said
but
police
statistics
reviewed
by
the
times
suggest
that
statement
is
inaccurate
the
decline
in
domestic

reports
among
latinos
in
several
cities
is
far
steeper
than
overall
declines
in
reporting
of
those

in

arnold
said
some

have

inaccurate

about

either
didn

were
in

with

but
professionals
who
deal
with
domestic

victims
say
the
perception
of
hardcore

under

has
led
to
widespread
panic
adam
dodge
legal
director
at

domestic

shelter
laura

house
said
that
before
february
nearly
half
the
center
s
client
base
were
immigrants
in
the

illegally
that
month
ice
agents
in
texas
entered
a

to
arrest
a
woman
without

who
was
seeking
a

against
an

we
went

he

they

they

but
they
are
not
trusting
very
many

even
when

defense
attorneys
sometimes
use
the
specter
of
ice
as
a
weapon
against
them
to
the
frustration
of
prosecutors
in
the
bay
area
a
daly
city
man
was
facing
battery
charges
this
year
after
flashing
a
knife
and
striking
the
mother
of
his
girlfriend
according
to
court
records
the
man
s
defense
attorney
raised
the
fact
that
the
victim
was
in
the
country
illegally
during
pretrial
hearings
although
a
judge
eventually
ruled
that
evidence
was
irrelevant
and
inadmissible
at
trial
records
show
the
case
ended
in
a
hung
jury
when
prosecutors
sought
a
retrial
the
victim
said
she
would
not
cooperate
in
part
because
her
immigration
status
was
raised
during
the
trial

george
gascon
said
the
case
was
one
of
several
where
his
prosecutors
felt
defense
attorneys
sought
to
leverage
heightened
fears
of
deportation
against
victims
he
believes
that
tactic
combined
with
ice
s
expanded
priorities
and
presence
in
courthouses
is
driving
down
domestic
violence
reporting
among
immigrants
in
the
city
s
sprawling
latino
and
asian
communities
gascon
described
the
situation
as
a
replay
of
the
fear
he
saw
in
the
immigrant
community
while
he
was
the
police
chief
in
mesa
ariz
during
maricopa
county
sheriff
joe
arpaio
s
crusade
against
people
without

which
led
to
accusations
of
racial
profiling
stephanie
penrod
managing

center
in
oakland
also
said
the
number
of
immigrants
without
legal

willing
to
seek
aid
from
law
enforcement
has
dwindled
abusers
frequently
will
threaten
to
call
immigration
enforcement
agents
on
their
victims
a
threat
penrod
believes
has
more
teeth
now
given
ice
s
increased
presence
in
courthouses
the
biggest
difference
for
us
now
is
those
threats
are
legitimate
she
said
previously
we
used
to
advise
them
we
couldn
t
prevent
an
abuser
from
calling
ice
but
that
it
was
unlikely
ice
would
do
anything
if
the
problem
persists
gascon
fears
the
consequences
could
be
deadly
the
level
of
violence
increases
he
said
it
could
in
some
cases
lead
to
severe
injury

discovered

resulted

on

said
she

from
the

foothill

carranza
found
that

was

about
percent
she

carranza
argued
that
certain

may
have
falsified

engaging
in
cooking
of

to
get

said
carranza
who
noted
she
has
been
raising
the
issue
with
her
superiors

when
officers
make
errors
on

the
mistakes
are
supposed
to
be
corrected
once
they
reach

commander
a

clerk

a

carranza
explained
however
in
some
cases
such
errors
were
not
recognized
or
fixed
she
said
someone
for
example
could
be
attacked
with
a
firearm
and
the
incident
would
be
incorrectly
coded
as
a
simple
assault
which
would
not
get
counted
in

serious
violent

statistics
rather
than
an
aggravated

of
the
errors
to

no

was
taken
in

she
was
ordered
to

the

roughly
a
quarter

which
is
unusual
previously
the
area
had
no
parking
signs
posted
for

trimming
and

and
someone
took
advantage
of
it
sweeney
explained
they
used
the
wrong
type

he
said
we

homelessness
is
a

with

federal

governing

we
are
allowed
to

he
wrote
on
tuesday
englander
said
he
is
working
vigorously
everyday
on
the
homelessness
issue
which
includes
having
a
staff
member
for
homelessness
as
well
as
opening
a
shelter
without
taxpayer
funds
and
a
mobile
shower
besides
the
possibility
of
being
prosecuted
as
a
felony
which
would
likely
send
the
culprit
to
jail
longer
than
a
year
there
is
also
a
cost
to
taxpayers
englander
said
to
repair
this
and
restore
it
back
to
its
original
state
it
could
be
tens
of
thousands
of
dollars
englander
concluded
the
initial
timeline
was
to
have
the

fixed
by
friday
but
it

nemeroff

nemeroff
declined

the

had
no

on
when
the

occurred
the

is
not

los

police
chief
charlie
beck
has
rebutted
a
captain
s
allegations
that
command

intentionally
underreported
violent
crimes
arguing
they
were
outrageous
and
damn
lies
capt
lillian
carranza
of
the
lapd
s
van
nuys
division
has
filed
a
claim
against
the
city
arguing
that
department
command
staffers
have
been
intentionally
underreporting
crime
statistics
since
at
least
and
that
some
offenders
have
been
promoted
to
higher
ranks
in
the
department
these
claims
are
a
slap
in
the
face
to
the
many
detectives
and
command
officers
who
work
so
hard
with
a
very
difficult
system
to
get
crime
statistics
as
close
to
accurate
as
we
possibly
can
beck
said
at
a
news
conference
in
front
of
lapd
s
operations
valley
bureau
on
tuesday
the
city
he
said
is
nationally
recognized
for
its
efforts
to
comply
with
the
outdated
uniform
crime
reporting
standards
developed
by
the
fbi
decades
ago
he
noted
he
has
detectives
assigned
to
do
audits
of
the
statistics
to
make
sure
we
do
the
right
thing
beck
said
both
the
department
and
the
office
of
inspector
general
which
works
for
the
civilian
police
commission
that
oversees
the
department
have
looked
into
similar
claims
as
this
over
the
last
several
years
and
found
no
wrongdoing
beck
said
he
is
not
retaliating
against
carranza
and
would
not
allow
anyone
else
to
do
so
carranza
recently
filed
a
government
claim
against
the
city
which
includes
the
allegation
that
she
has
been
denied
a
promotion
to
commander
following
her
complaints
her
attorney
said
he
expects
to
file
a
lawsuit
on
her
behalf
in
the
coming
days
while
carranza
said
she
has
supporting
documentation
to
back
up
her
claims
she
and
her
attorney
have
declined
to
release
it
so
far
saying
these
documents
could
be
considered
confidential
by
the
department
in
response
to
beck
s
comments
the
los
angeles
police
protective
league
the
union
that
represents
some
officers
through
the
rank
of
lieutenant
noted
that
prior
offenses
in
the
state
s
criminal
justice
system
are
considered
strikes
and
said
beck
has
accumulated
strikes
of
his
own
chief
beck
has
accumulated
two
strikes
by
overseeing
the
manipulation
of
violent
crime
statistics
and
this
latest
allegation
if
proven
true
would
make
the
chief
a
three
striker
union
officials
said
in
a
statement
it
s
time
for
transparency
and
honesty
to
be
the
foundation
of
our
department
not
cooking
the
books
to
fool
our
elected
officials
and
the
public
they
added
meanwhile
the
head
of
the
civilian
panel
that
oversees
the
police
department
has
requested
an
update
from
its
independent
watchdog
after
the
captain
s
allegations
steve
soboroff
president
of
the
los
angeles
police
commission
said
he
has
asked
the
inspector
general
to
update
him
regarding
the
perception
of
carranza
concerning
the
alleged
underreporting
of
violent
crimes
our
goal
is
not
to
underreport
or
overreport
anything
soboroff
one
of
five
civilian
commissioners
said
tuesday
in
a
phone
interview
we
want
to
do
everything
exactly
right
and
we
make
adjustments
and
we
have
processes
like
the
inspector
general
like
the
department
when
individuals
might
think
that
something
is
wrong
carranza
wrote
a
letter
to
the
office
of
the
inspector
general
in
september
saying
she
was
contacting
him
as
a
last
resort
the
manipulation
of
statistics
has
always
been
a
concern
but
blatantly
ignoring
the
underreporting
of
violent
crime
has
reached
epidemic
proportions
she
wrote
in
the
email
provided
by
her
attorney
carranza
who
said
she
conducted
her
own
audits
of
statistics
reported
at
several
stations
noted
that
she
repeatedly
brought
the
issue
to
the
attention
of
the
director
of
operations
and
most
recently
the
department
s
data
integrity
unit
without
result
soboroff
noted
that
he
was
not
cc
d
on
that
email
and
did
not
know
whether
the
office
of
the
inspector
general
responded
in
carranza
s
claim
she
argued
that
the
lapd
was
underreporting
violent
crime
at
certain
stations
by
about
percent
but
has
so
far
declined
to
release
her
analysis
following
a
los

oig
found
that
a

nemeroff
said
the

involved
a

at

block
of
hill

in
los

but
nemeroff
declined
to
give
information
on
which
specific
business
was
targeted
the
detective
had
no
immediate
information
on
when
the
incident
occurred
the
case
is
not
considered
a
hate
crime
because
in

the
action
would
have
to
involve

criminal
threat
nemeroff
said
it

still
investigated
thoroughly
the

said
a

is
following
possible

nemeroff
added
christian
identity
is
known
as
an
anti
semitic
and
racist
theology
that
rose
to
a
position
of
commanding
influence
on
the
racist
right
in
the
s
according
to
the
southern
poverty
law
center
an
advocacy
group
that
fights
and
tracks
hate
crime
it
is
disturbing
that
jewish
owned
businesses
in
los

and
new

city
were
apparently
intentionally
targeted
with
the

piece

we

these

or
if
they
are
appearing
in

places
around
the

according
to
the
adl
officials
have
been
in
contact
with
the

and
the

about
the
incidents
and
several
of

targeted
included
the

and

in

the
flood
of
sexual
assault
allegations
coming
out
of
the
hollywood
entertainment
industry
has
the
los
angeles
police
department
negotiating
uncharted
territory
never
before
has
the
department
received
so
many
sexual
assault
allegations
involving
high
profile
figures
at
one
time
including
many
complex
cases
that
are
years
old
with
multiple
alleged
victims
officials
say
the
department
has
re
engineered
its
detective
staff
to
deal
with
the
influx
the
lapd
has
established
five
teams
of
two
detectives
to
exclusively
investigate
allegations
of
sexual
misconduct
in
hollywood
the
teams
include
members
of
the
cold
case
unit
because
those
detectives
are
experts
in
dealing
with
old
criminal
allegations
that
lack
physical
evidence
they
know
where
to
go
they
know
how
to
jog
people
s
memories
said
lapd
capt
billy
hayes
who
oversees
the
robbery
homicide
division
and
is
managing
the
task
force
we
ve
gotten
an
unprecedented
number
of
calls
the
lapd
now
has
open
investigations
related
to
hollywood
and
media
figures
including
mogul
harvey
weinstein
actor
ed
westwick
writer
murray
miller
and
agent
tyler
grasham
the
department
has
also
taken
other
sex
crimes
reports
that
it
has
sent
to
other
law
enforcement
agencies
believing
the
alleged
crimes
occurred
in
those
jurisdictions
two
main
types
of
crimes
have
been
alleged
criminal
sexual
assault
such
as
rape
and
the
lesser
crime
of
lewd
acts
such
as
unwanted
touching
or
masturbation
lewd
act
allegations
have
proved
more
challenging
because
the
statute
of
limitations
the
time
period
during
which
a
crime
can
be
prosecuted
in
california
is
as
little
as
one
year
other
sex
crimes
have
much
longer
statutes
of
limitation
for
most
cases
of
rape
it
s
years
the
lapd
has
already
established
a
triage
strategy
lapd
chief
charlie
beck
is
requiring
that
the
department
perform
interviews
and
take
detailed
reports
from
anyone
who
makes
allegations
however
old
then
detectives
work
with
the
los
angeles
county
district
attorney
s
newly
established
hollywood
sex
crimes
task
force
to
determine
whether
the
alleged
crime
occurred
within
the
statute
of
limitations
after
that
detectives
begin
more
in
depth
investigations
hayes
estimated
that
in
of
the
cases
there
is
no
physical
evidence
that
leaves
detectives
focusing
heavily
on
witness
accounts
which
given
the
circumstances
of
many
intimate
claims
are
limited
so
that
leaves
detectives
looking
for
corroborating
witnesses
including
people
whom
the
alleged
victims
told
of
the
incidents
when
they
happened
some
of
the
alleged
crimes
occurred
at
hotels
so
police
have
been
going
though
reservation
logs
employee
schedules
and
video
surveillance
looking
for
clues
and
corroborating
evidence
hayes
said
weinstein
has
been
accused
of
rape
and
forcible
oral
copulation
by
an
italian
actress
in
as
well
as
lewd
acts
by
a
second
woman
in
the
allegation
occurred
within
the
statute
of
limitations
for
rape
but
the
alleged
incident
is
believed
to
be
out
of
statute
detectives
interviewed
weinstein
s
rape
accuser
for
hours
and
are
now
seeking
to
verify
the
actress
account
by
interviewing
those
whom
she
told
about
the
alleged
attack
at
the
time
the
woman
according
to
sources
familiar
with
the
case
told
at
least
three
people
contemporaneously
about
the
alleged
encounter
the
sources
spoke
on
the
condition
of
anonymity
because
they
are
not
authorized
to
reveal
details
of
the
case
legal
experts
said
even
incidents
that
occurred
beyond
the
statute
of
limitations
have
potential
value
under
california
law
a
prosecutor
can
put
on
witnesses
who
can
testify
to
a
defendant
s
propensity
to
commit
the
crime
here
we
have
many
prominent
actresses
alleging
similar
acts
i
believe
a
judge
would
let
them
testify
if
weinstein
is
charged
with
a
sexual
assault
said
dmitry
gorin
a
former
l
a
county
sex
crimes
prosecutor
in
the
case
of
weinstein
the

is
working
closely
with
police
in
beverly
hills
new
york
and
london
which
all
have
open
criminal
cases
involving
the
mogul
the
victims
in
each
investigation
could
testify
in
each
others
cases
depending
on
the
law
in
the
jurisdiction
gorin
said
there
could
be
an
alleged
victim
in
england
who
comes
to
l
a
to
testify
so
far
no
criminal
charges
have
been
brought
against
weinstein
besides
weinstein
the
lapd
is
also
investigating
other
high

allegations
including
actress

sent

to

that
unambiguously

at

before
it
plans

feuer
wrote
in
his
letter
dated
monday
and
addressed
to
tracey
trautman
acting
director
of
the
bureau
of
justice
assistance
that
unlike
state
prisons
or
los
angeles
county
jails
the
city
s
detention
facilities
are
not
used
to
house
inmates
serving
post
conviction
sentences
as
such
because
los
angeles
rarely
if
ever
holds
detainees
for
hours
time
it
is
not
possible
for
the
city
or
other
similarly
situated
cities
to
comply
with
the
hour
advance
notice
provision
posted
in
the
jag
solicitation
without
detaining
individuals
beyond
the
point
at
which
they
are
entitled
to
release
he
said
feuer
explained
that
any
person
detained
by
the
los

police
department
on
an
open
nonwarrant
criminal
charge
must
be
subjected
to
a
probable
cause
determination
by
a
magistrate
within
hours
of
his
her
arrest
absent
a
magistrate
s
determination
of
probable
cause
the
detained
arrestee
must
be
released
from
custody
without
unnecessary
delay
he
wrote
feuer
notes
that
the
justice
department
typically
makes
an
exception
when
such
requirements
do
not
apply
to
the
circumstances
of
a
particular
municipal
government
by
qualifying
the
requirement
with
the
words
if
possible
feuer
noted
the
city
is
on
a
time
crunch
with
applications
for
the
grant
due
sept
and
he
demanded
that
the
justice
department
respond
with
clarification
by
this
friday
if
the
department
chooses
not
to
give
us
that
clarification
or
says
the
if
possible
language
was
intentionally
left
out
then
it
s
very
likely
that
we
ll
have
to
sue
to
protect
our
program
feuer
said
in
an
interview
the
mayor
s
office
is
usually
in
charge
of
applying
for
the

the

also
went

investigators
had
identified

as
a

in
thomass
killing

early
as
when

reports
of
sexual

among

amid

in

could
face

if
they
interact

the

police

said
tuesday
since

dropped

charlie

said
tuesday
similar
decreases
weren

seen
in
other
ethnic

he
said
imagine
your
sister
your

not
reporting
a
sexual
assault
for
fear
that
their

president
donald
trump
s
efforts
to
crack
down
on
the
estimated
million
immigrants
living
illegally
in

have
sparked
fear
and
anxiety
leading
many
people
to
try
to
avoid
any
contact
with
law
enforcement
beck
said
there
was
a
strong
correlation
between
the
timing
of
the
decreased
reporting
and
fears
of
accelerated
efforts
to
round
up
and
deport
immigrants
josh
rubenstein
a
los

spokesman
said
the
numbers
were
concerning
and
that
the
department
is
continuing
to
look
at
every
element
contributing
to
the
drop
in
reporting
advocates
say
the
unease
among
immigrants
is
forcing
the
victims
of
violent
crimes
to
stay
silent
we
are
seeing
immigrant
families
potentially
being
so
afraid
of
the
ultimate
punishment
which
deportation
represents
that
they
may
forego
their
chances
of
justice
said
jorge
mario
cabrera
of

advocacy
group
chirla
we
do
not
want

activists
say
this
means
that
despite
the
city
s
efforts
many
vendors
who
are
in
the
country
illegally
could
still
be
slapped
with
a
criminal
offense
that
could
be
used
as
a
reason
for
federal
immigration
officials
to
deport
them
citing
those
concerns
three
los
angeles
city
council
members
began
the
process
this
week
toward
reducing
penalties
for
vending
in
public
parks
beaches
and
recreation
areas
from
a
misdemeanor
to
an
administrative
violation
in
a
motion
introduced
tuesday
city
council
members
mitch
o
farrell
and
jose
huizar
cited
the
polarizing
crackdown
on
undocumented
immigrants
by
the
current
white
house
administration
the
motion
was
seconded
by
councilman
bob
blumenfield
who
represents
the
west
san
fernando
valley
in
recent
days
the
immigration
and
customs
enforcement
agency
threatened
to
expanded
its
arrests
including
of
undocumented
bystanders
who
were
not
initially
targeted
after
gov
jerry
brown
s
signing
of
a
bill
to
make
california
a
sanctuary
state
president
donald
trump
has
also
said
he
is
ending
a
program
known
as
daca
in
which
federal
officials
refrain
from
enforcing
immigration
laws
against
people
who
were
brought
to
the
country
illegally
as
children
that
program
has
allowed
many
mostly
younger
immigrants
to
stay
in
the
country
without
being
deported
and
to
be
issued
permits
to
work
the
council
members
motion
tuesday
aims
to
remove
misdemeanor
penalties
from
section
of
the
los
angeles
municipal
code
which
still
treats
vending
at
public
parks
beaches
and
other
recreation
areas
as
a
crime
crimes
tied
to
street
vending
is
considered
an
offense
that
could
trigger
deportation
proceedings
the
prohibition
on
park
vending
was
reinstated
in
after
it
was
suspended
for
several
years
and
not
only
disallows
vendors
but
also
people
services
such
as
yoga
or
dog
training
classes
at
parks
street
vending
is
still
illegal
everywhere
in
los
angeles
but
the
punishment
for
those
selling
food
and
wares
on
sidewalks
has
been
limited
to
financial
penalties
while
the
city
council
continues
to
try
to
develop
a
permitting
program
that
would
legalize
street
vending
city
leaders
have
moved
more
quickly
to
decriminalize
the
activity
removing
misdemeanor
penalties
from
the
sidewalk
vending
ban
in
february
that
was
done
in
order
to
keep
our
mostly
immigrant
vendors
out
of
the
overreaching
aggressive
arms
of
our
federal
government
looking
to
target
otherwise
law
abiding
immigrants
for
deportation
huizar
said
in
a
statement
now
the
council
members
are
calling
for
a
similar
step
to
be
taken
with
the
park
vending
as
the
city
continues
to
enforce
its
prohibition
on
the
activity
huizar
said
that
the
federal
government
s
increased
crackdown
on
immigrants
does
underscore
the
need
for
a
street
vending
ordinance
one
that
he
and
fellow
councilman
curren
price
initially
called
for
in
while
he
did
not
say
when
the
city
would
be
ready
with
its
promised
citywide
vendor
permitting
program
huizar
acknowledged
that
the
time
is
well
past
due
to
bring
these
vendors
out
of
the
shadows
and
allow
them
to
make
an
honest
living
in
a
safe
and
regulated
city
program
and
join
other
big
cities
throughout
the
nation
who
already
have
a
legal
street
vending
program
in
place

nearly
a
quarter
of
all
hate
crimes
reported
in
los
angeles
county
last
year
were
based
on
sexual
orientation
making
gay
men
lesbians
and
lgbt
organizations
the
group
most
frequently
targeted
for
the
first
time
in
many
years
according
to
a
new
report
the
last
time
the
number
of
homophobic
hate
crimes
exceeded
the
number
of
anti
black
crimes
was
in
according
to
the
los

county
commission
on
human
relations
there
were
reported
hate
crimes
based
on
sexual
orientation
in
which
is
two
less
than
the
prior
year
according
to
the
commission
s
hate
crime
report
released
thursday
eighty
one
percent
of
these
hate
crimes
were
violent
they
included
one
hate
murder
in
which
prosecutors
alleged
that
shehadeh
khalil
issa
of
north
hills
killed
his
openly
gay
adult
son
amir
in
april
of
last
year
partly
because
of
an
extreme
hatred
of
his
son
s
sexuality
issa
was
found
guilty
of
premeditated
murder
in
the
death
of
his
wife
and
son
as
well
as
for
the
hate
crime
allegation
the
total
number
of
hate
crimes
reported
in
the
county
last
year
was
one
less
than
when
there
was
a
percent
increase
over
and
the
highest
total
since
according
to
the
report
meanwhile
gender
based
crimes
jumped
by
percent
last
year
most
of
which
were
anti
transgender
crimes
in
fact
anti
transgender
crimes
jumped
percent
from
to
reported
incidents
with
a
staggering
percent
of
a
violent
nature
more
than
any
major
victim
group
the
commission
found
it
s
alarming
and
at
the
same
time
i
always
know
that
the
numbers
that
law
enforcement
report
compared
to
the
number
of
clients
i
see
coming
through
my
office
is
always
different
because
there
is
this
fear
of
going
to
law
enforcement
and
reporting
because
there
is
a
fear
of
revictimization
said
mariana
marroquin
a
transgender
woman
who
is
program
manager
for
the
anti
violence
project
at
the
los
angeles
lgbt
center
latina
transgender
women
like
marroquin
were
targeted
the
most
the
report
found
marroquin
said
she
fled
her
native
guatemala
after
she
was
attacked
for
her
gender
identity
stripped
naked
and
heard
her
attackers
plot
her
death
in
then
one
day
after
she
had
moved
to
the
u
s
in
she
was
called
a
homophobic
slur
by
a
random
man
and
punched
in
the
face
while
walking
home
in
the
hollywood
area
however
the
work
being
done
with
the
transgender
community
about
knowing
their
rights
is
paying
off
she
said
because
people
are
more
willing
to
come
forward
and
report
such
incidents
than
they
have
been
in
the
past
another
alarming
trend
is
that
hate
crimes
in
which
there
was
evidence
of
white
supremacist
ideology
including
acts
of
vandalism
in
which
swastikas
or
other
hate
symbols
were
used
surged
by
percent
from

in
this
made
up
more
than
one
fifth
of

los

l

said
she
has
witnessed
this
in
the
southeastern
part
of
her
district
in
recent
months
they
ve
had
to
alert
the
l
a
county
sheriff
s
department
because
white
supremacists
and
anti
immigrant
groups
have
disrupted
city
council
meetings
in
communities
like
cudahy
yelling
hateful
rhetoric
and
brandishing
weapons
at
times
most
hate
crimes
appear
to
be
motivated
by
race
ethnicity
or
national
origin
she
said
the
commission
also
found
that
between
the
nov
presidential
election
and
dec
hate
crimes
were
reported
in
the
county
representing
an
increase
of
seven
hate
crimes
or
percent
from
the
same
period
the
previous
year
while
seven
additional
crimes
may
not
seem
like
a
lot
we
have
to
remember
that
in
the
previous
year
there
was
an
exceptionally
large
jump
percent
in
the
number
of
hate
crimes
in

referring
to

middle

president
donald
trump
s
name
was
touted
in
several
reported
hate
crimes
during
this
period
among
them
an
asian
woman
in

hills
was
yelled
at
by
two
white
men
in
a
car
while
walking
her
dogs
on

racial
slurs
the
perpetrators
told
her
to
go
back
to
where
she
came
from
yelled
trump
town
and
struck
her
with
eggs
according
to
the
report
blacks
were
the
second

targeted
group
with

reported
though
anti
black
hate

declined
percent
over
jews
were
the
third
most
targeted
group
composing
percent
of
the
religious
hate
crimes
despite
making
up
a
small
percentage
of
the
population
mexicans
were
the
fourth
most
targeted
group
while
transgender
individuals
were
the
fifth
meanwhile
whites
were
the
only
racial

group
to
experience
a
sharp
increase
in

anti

jumped
from
incidents
to

but
still
occurred
at
a
lower
rate
than
other
ethnic
groups
the
report
found
the
largest
number

place
in
the
sprawling
san

followed
by
the

which
stretches
from

when

state

federal
officials
refrain
from
enforcing
immigration
laws
against
people
who
were
brought
to
the
country
illegally
as
children
that
program
has
allowed
many
mostly
younger
immigrants
to
stay
in
the
country
without
being
deported
and
to
be
issued
permits
to
work
the
council
members
motion
tuesday
aims
to
remove
misdemeanor
penalties
from
section
of
the
los

municipal
code
which
still
treats
vending
at
public
parks
beaches
and
other
recreation
areas
as
a
crime
crimes
tied
to
street
vending
is
considered
an
offense
that
could
trigger
deportation
proceedings
the
prohibition
on
park

was

in
after
it
was
suspended
for
several
years
and
not
only
disallows
vendors
but
also
people
services
such
as
yoga
or
dog
training
classes
at

street
vending
is
still
illegal
everywhere
in
los
angeles
but
the
punishment
for
those
selling
food
and
wares
on
sidewalks
has
been
limited
to
financial
penalties
while
the
city
council
continues
to
try
to
develop
a
permitting
program
that
would
legalize
street
vending
city
leaders
have
moved
more
quickly
to
decriminalize
the
activity
removing
misdemeanor
penalties
from
the
sidewalk
vending
ban
in
february
that
was
done
in
order
to
keep
our
mostly
immigrant
vendors
out
of
the
overreaching
aggressive
arms
of
our
federal
government
looking
to
target
otherwise
law
abiding
immigrants
for
deportation
huizar
said
in
a
statement
now
the
council
members
are
calling
for
a
similar
step
to
be
taken
with
the
park
vending
as
the
city
continues
to
enforce
its
prohibition
on
the
activity
huizar
said
that
the
federal
government
s
increased
crackdown
on
immigrants
does
underscore
the
need
for
a
street
vending
ordinance
one
that
he
and
fellow
councilman
curren
price
initially
called
for
in
while
he
did
not
say
when
the
city
would
be
ready
with
its
promised
citywide
vendor
permitting
program
huizar
acknowledged
that
the
time
is
well
past
due
to
bring
these
vendors
out
of
the
shadows
and
allow
them
to
make
an
honest
living
in
a
safe
and
regulated
city

pro

kevin
de
leon
d
los

in

in
response
to
the

orders
it

los

county
sheriff
jim
mcdonnell
who
heads
the
largest
jail
system
in

has
said
that
the

would
hinder

enforcement
s
ability
to
transfer
inmates
from
county
jails
to
immigration
officials
in
a
march
letter
to
de
leon
mcdonnell
said
the
bill
could
hurt
immigrant
communities
by
forcing
immigration
agents
to
go
into
communities
to
arrest
people
instead
of
going
through
the
jail
system
while
doing
this
they
will
most
surely
cast
a
wide
net
over
our
communities
apprehending
and
detaining
those
not
originally
the
target
of
the
enforcement
actions
he
wrote
an
order
adopted
in
prohibits
los

police
department
officials
from
approaching
people
to
ask
about
their
immigration
status
while
sheriff
s
deputies
follow
a
similar
protocol
the
sheriff
s
department
can
still
share
with
immigration
officials
the
names
of
inmates
in
custody
as
well
as
people
who
are
due
to
be
released
soon
this
allows
immigration
officials
to
decide
whom
to
pick
up
from
jails
in
los

county
jail
officials
turned
over
about
inmates
to
immigration
agents
a
small
percentage
of
the
more
than
inmates
released
from
county
jails
that
year
sb
also
would
bar
hold
requests
through
which
immigration
officials
can
ask
that
inmates
be
detained
for
hours
beyond
their
release
dates
it
has
gone
through
various
amendments
in
recent
months
including
a
provision
that
would
require
the
state
parole
board
or
corrections
department
to
supply
ice
with
days
notice
of
the
release
of
inmates
in
the
u
s
illegally
who
were
convicted
of
violent
crimes
the
bill
has
been
opposed
by
the
california
state
sheriff
s
assn
as
well
as
lawmakers
who
say
it
could
protect
violent
criminals
bill
brown
president
of
the
sheriff
s
association
said
sb
would
hinder
cooperation
between
immigration
officials
and

the
bill
provides
sanctuary
for
criminals
and
it
endangers
the
public
he
said
it
would
extremely
limit
or
in
many

prohibit
our
ability
to
communicate
with
the

in

part
of

could

to

any

there
s
an
increase
in

crime
it
s
a
cause
for
concern
morrison
said
but
he
noted
that
gangs
go
through
cycles
that
are
driven
by
various
factors
it
could
be
motivated
by
money
narcotics
sales
other
criminal
enterprise
he
said
it
could
be
a
prolific
member
of
a
gang
who
has
been
locked
up
and
is
released
starts
recruiting
again
there
are
some
active
street
gangs
that
claim
territory
west

in

s
jurisdiction
of
the
valley
including
one
currently
under
gang
injunction
in
the
canoga
park
area
according
to
the
report
but
just
because
an
incident
is
classified
as
a
gang
related
homicide
doesn
t
mean
a
gang
member
committed
the
crime
or
that
it
was
committed
because
of
someone
s
gang
affiliation
for
example
these
homicides
include
those
in
which
only
the
victim
is
a
gang
member
they
also
include
homicides
committed
by
gang
members
for
reasons
that
have
nothing
to
do
with
their
gang
morrison
said
we
code
it
that
way
because
there
s
a
higher
likelihood
that
they
have
a
propensity
for
violence
morrison
said
among
the
gang
related
homicides
in
the
west

last

was
a

love

since

and
that
some

these

to
the

who
work
so
hard
with
a
very
difficult

to
get

beck
said
at

in

on

the

he
said
is
nationally
recognized
for
its

to
comply
with
the
outdated
uniform
crime
reporting
standards
developed
by
the

decades

he
noted
he
has
detectives
assigned
to
do
audits
of

to
make
sure
we
do
the

beck
said
both
the
department
and
the
office
of
inspector

which
works
for
the
civilian
police
commission
that
oversees
the
department
have
looked
into
similar
claims
as
this
over
the
last
several
years
and
found
no
wrongdoing
beck
said
he
is
not
retaliating
against
carranza
and
would
not
allow
anyone
else
to
do
so
carranza
recently
filed
a
government
claim
against
the
city
which
includes
the
allegation
that
she
has
been
denied
a
promotion
to
commander
following
her
complaints
her
attorney
said
he
expects
to
file
a
lawsuit
on
her
behalf
in
the
coming
days
while
carranza
said
she
has

system
are
considered
strikes
and

beck
has
accumulated
strikes
of
his

beck
has
accumulated
two
strikes
by
overseeing
the
manipulation

and
this

if

would
make
the
chief

three

union
officials
said
in

it
s
time
for

honesty
to
be
the

of
our

not
cooking
the
books
to
fool
our
elected
officials
and
the

they
added
meanwhile
the
head
of

from

independent
watchdog
after
the
captain
s
allegations
steve

president
of

he
has
asked
the

to
update
him
regarding
the
perception
of
carranza
concerning
the
alleged
underreporting
of
violent
crimes
our
goal
is
not
to
underreport
or
overreport
anything
soboroff
one
of
five
civilian
commissioners
said
tuesday
in
a
phone
interview
we
want
to
do
everything
exactly
right
and
we
make
adjustments
and
we
have
processes
like
the
inspector
general
like
the
department
when
individuals
might
think
that
something
is
wrong
carranza
wrote
a
letter
to
the
office
of
the
inspector
general
in
september
saying
she
was
contacting
him
as
a
last
resort
the
manipulation
of
statistics
has
always
been
a
concern
but
blatantly
ignoring
the
underreporting
of
violent
crime
has
reached
epidemic
proportions
she
wrote
in
the
email
provided
by
her
attorney
carranza
who
said
she
conducted
her
own
audits
of
statistics
reported
at
several
stations
noted
that
she
repeatedly
brought
the
issue
to
the
attention
of
the
director
of
operations
and
most
recently
the
department
s
data
integrity
unit
without
result
soboroff
noted
that
he
was
not
cc
d
on
that
email
and
did
not
know
whether
the
office
of
the
inspector
general
responded
in
carranza
s
claim
she
argued
that
the
lapd
was
underreporting
violent
crime
at
certain
stations
by
about
percent
but
has
so
far
declined
to
release
her
analysis
following
a
los

times
investigation
a
audit
by
the
oig
found
that
a
significant
number
of
crimes
that
were
categorized
as
simple
assaults
from

actually
aggravated
assaults
and
should
have
been
included
as
part
of
the
violent
crime
statistics
that
are
submitted
to
the
fbi
and
disclosed
to
the
public
the
inspector
general
found
that
if
the
crimes
had
been
classified
correctly
during
those
seven
years
the
rate
of
aggravated
assaults
reported
to
the
fbi
and
the
public
would
have
been
an
average
of
percent
higher
each

the

that
the

were
due

less

the

meanwhile
gender

most

anti

jumped
percent
from

with
a
staggering
percent
of

nature
more
than
any

group
the

found
it

alarming
and
at
the

i
always
know
that
the
numbers
that
law
enforcement
report
compared
to
the
number
of
clients
i
see
coming
through
my
office
is
always
different
because
there
is
this
fear
of
going
to
law
enforcement
and
reporting
because
there
is
a
fear
of
revictimization

marroquin

after
she
was

stripped

heard
her

in

one

was
called
a

slur
by
a
random
man
and
punched
in
the
face
while
walking
home
in
the
hollywood
area
however
the
work
being
done
with
the
transgender
community
about
knowing
their
rights
is
paying
off
she
said
because
people
are
more
willing

come
forward
and
report
such

than
they
have
been
in

a
budgetary
sleight
of
hand
proposed
by
mayor
eric
garcetti
would
result
in
fewer
officers
out
patrolling
los
angeles
streets
even
as
crime
is
on
the
rise
the
union
that
represents
los
angeles
police
officers
alleged
thursday
the
shenanigans
that
occurred
in
the
mayor
s
budget
will
put
neighborhood
safety
at
risk
los
angeles
police
protective
league
vice
president
jeretta
sandoz
told
the
city
council
s
budget
and
finance
committee
which
is
reviewing
the
mayor
s
billion
budget
proposal
officials
for
lappl
which
represents
more
than
rank
and
file
police
officers
said
garcetti
s
proposed
million
allocation
for
police
overtime
is
an
inflated
amount
with
million
of
that
funding
actually
going
toward
providing
security
on
buses
and
rail
under
a
recently
approved
contract
with
the
metropolitan
transportation
authority
lappl
officials
said
the
mayor
s
budget
chooses
to
keep
transit
lines
safe
but
not
the
neighborhoods
sandoz
said
union
officials
argue
the
mayor
s
sworn
overtime
proposal
represents
a
percent
reduction
in
the
number
of
hours
that
could
be
put
toward
officers
patrolling
neighborhoods
in
a
letter
to
the
committee
urging
the
city
council
to
reject
this
proposal
by
garcetti
union
leaders
called
the
move
a
well
orchestrated
bait
and
switch
noting
that
the
police
union
s
contract
requires
the
city
to
allot
at
least
million
for
overtime
but
the
city
is
technically
putting
in
million
to
patrol
neighborhood
streets
they
say
this
translates
to
at
least
fewer
hours
that
could
have
gone
to
neighborhood
patrols
going
toward
the
metro
contracted
services
lappl
officials
said
lappl
board
director
robert
harris
said
union
leaders
were
extremely
dismayed
when
we
discovered
this
budgetary
sleight
of
hand
but
chief
charlie
beck
told
the
committee
thursday
that
officer
hours
may
not
actually
be
reduced
he
explained
that
once
the
overtime
funding
runs
out
officers
will
still
be
working
but
their
hours
will
be
banked
and
they
will
not
see
payment
until
later
under
a
compensatory
time
off
program
the
deferred
payment
program
doesn
t
take
them
off
the
street
he
said
it
defers
the
city
s
liability
but
it
doesn
t
remove
their
boots
from
the
ground
beck
predicted
that
under
the
current
proposal
the
city
may
need
to
put
officers
on
the
overtime
banking
plan
beginning
in
may
the
city
council
may
need
to
weigh
the
financial
costs
of
deferring
payment
he
said
beck
also
said
officers
do
not
like
this
arrangement
telling
the
daily
news
after
his
budget
presentation
that
it
defers
their
the
officers
payment
for
overtime
but
as
you
well
know
a
dollar
of
overtime
banked
now
is
often
when
it
s
paid
he
said
the
addition
of
the
million
for
metro
security
which
will
be
covered
by
the
transportation
agency
and
not
the
city
raises
the
total
sworn
overtime
allocation
to
million
but
some
including
councilman
mitch
englander
questioned
whether
this
meets
the
spirit
of
the
provision
in
the
union
contract
both
beck
and
union
leaders
on
thursday
pointed
out
that
the
proposed
overtime
budget
for
the
upcoming
year
is
smaller
than
this
year
s
the
city
budgeted
million
for
sworn
overtime
this
fiscal
year
while
out
of
the
proposed
million
for
next
year
only
million
is
actually
being
allotted
from
the
city
s
own
coffers
for
officer
overtime
hours
beck
said
mayoral
spokesman
george
kivork
said
in
a
statement
their
office
is
confident
we
ll
be
able
to
meet
the
same
safety
requirements
and
neighborhood
patrols
as
we
ve
had
in
the
past
there
will
not
be
a
reduction
the
mayor
s
deputy
chief
of
staff
matt
szabo
acknowledged
during
the
committee
meeting
that
the
likelihood
that
million
will
not
be
enough
to
truly
cover
overtime
costs
in
the
upcoming
fiscal
year
is
a
problem
but
he
said
the
mayor
s
office
had
to
make
some
significant
and
difficult
choices
we
fully
understand
that
is
not
the
most
ideal
situation
but
the
entire
budget
presented
a
less
than
ideal
situation

a
black
market
for
diesel
and
gasoline
has
rapidly
spread
around
the
nation
with
organized
crime
gangs
using
fraudulent
credit
cards
to
siphon
millions
of
dollars
in
fuel
from
gas
stations
into
large
tanks
hidden
inside
pickup
trucks
and
vans
stealing
fuel
can
be
less
risky
than
selling
drugs
or
other
illegal
endeavors
and
criminals
can
make
or
more
a
day
reselling
the
stolen
fuel
at
construction
sites
and
unscrupulous
gas
stations
or
to
truckers
looking
to
cut
costs
investigators
and
industry
experts
say
it
s
pretty
rampant
said
owen
dewitt
whose
texas
based
company
know
control
focuses
solely
on
helping
gas
stations
prevent
fuel
theft
he
said
the
crime
is
worst
along
interstate
from
jacksonville
fla
to
the
los

area
california
and
florida
are
the
two
worst
texas
is
no
black
market
diesel
started
becoming
a
big
business
when
credit
card
skimmers
became
more
prevalent
around
dewitt
said
thieves
install
these
devices
at
gas
station
pumps
where
they
record
card
information
as
unsuspecting
customers
fuel
up
the
information
is
later
transferred
to
a
magnetic
strip
on
a
counterfeit
card
the
problem
has
only
grown
as
the
devices
become
more
sophisticated
the
black
market
has
grown
quickly
in
part
because
the
thefts
total
a
few
hundred
dollars
at
a
time
and
prosecutors
were
slow
to
prioritize
them
but
as
fuel
thefts
become
more
organized
they
have
caught
the
attention
of
state
and
federal
authorities
around
the
country
agriculture
and
consumer
services
commissioner
adam
putnam
s
department
takes
the
lead
on
prosecuting
these
crimes
in
florida
he
said
they
used
to
be
considered
a
victimless
or
slap
on
the
wrist
type
crime
and
yet
they
were
making
more
money
doing
this
than
a
lot
of
other
criminal
activities
that
had
a
lot
higher
sentences
the
u

secret
service
which
investigates
financial
crimes
is
involved

the

says
miami
los

las

are
hot
spots
together
accounting
for
about
million
gallons
a
year
in
stolen
diesel
the

that
we
ve
investigated
over
the
past
couple
of

the
least
profitable
group
is
million
a

then
there
are
groups
that
will
gross
million
plus
scarince
said
the
gang
bangers
in
los

have
been
migrating
to
financial
crimes
instead
of
street
crimes
because
it
s
much
more
profitable
and
if
you
get
caught
you
get
probation

records
from
a

how
much
money

they
observed

information
stolen

three
times
a

they
transferred
the
diesel
into
a
gallon
industrial
fuel
tanker
that
made
daily
runs
to
sell
the
fuel
to
gas

agents
estimated
they
stole
close
to

every

with
the
potential
to
steal
million
a

records
indicated
it

said
friday
a
budgetary
sleight

proposed
by

would
result
in
fewer

out
patrolling
los

streets
even
as
crime
is
on
the
rise
the

that
represents
los

police
officers
alleged
thursday
the
shenanigans
that
occurred
in
the
mayor
s
budget
will
put
neighborhood
safety
at
risk
los

police
protective
league
vice
president
jeretta
sandoz
told
the
city
council
s
budget
and
finance
committee
which
is
reviewing
the
mayor
s
billion
budget
proposal
officials
for
lappl
which
represents
more
than
rank
and
file
police
officers
said
garcetti
s
proposed
million
allocation
for
police
overtime
is
an
inflated
amount
with
million
of
that
funding
actually
going
toward
providing
security
on
buses
and
rail
under
a
recently
approved
contract
with
the
metropolitan
transportation
authority
lappl
officials
said
the
mayor
s
budget
chooses
to
keep
transit
lines
safe
but
not
the
neighborhoods
sandoz
said
union
officials
argue
the
mayor
s
sworn
overtime
proposal
represents
a
percent
reduction
in
the
number
of
hours
that
could
be
put
toward
officers
patrolling
neighborhoods
in
a
letter
to
the
committee
urging
the
city
council
to
reject
this
proposal
by
garcetti
union
leaders
called
the
move
a
well
orchestrated
bait
and
switch
noting
that
the
police
union
s
contract
requires
the
city
to
allot
at
least
million
for
overtime
but
the
city
is
technically
putting
in
million
to
patrol
neighborhood
streets
they
say
this
translates
to
at
least
fewer
hours
that
could
have
gone
to
neighborhood
patrols
going
toward
the
metro
contracted
services
lappl
officials
said
lappl
board
director
robert
harris
said
union
leaders
were
extremely
dismayed
when
we
discovered
this
budgetary
sleight
of
hand
but
chief
charlie
beck
told
the
committee
thursday
that
officer
hours
may
not
actually
be
reduced
he
explained
that
once
the
overtime
funding
runs
out
officers
will
still
be
working
but
their
hours
will
be
banked
and
they
will
not
see
payment
until
later
under
a
compensatory
time
off
program
the
deferred
payment
program
doesn
t
take
them
off
the
street
he
said
it
defers
the
city
s
liability
but
it
doesn
t
remove
their
boots
from
the
ground
beck
predicted
that
under
the
current
proposal
the
city
may
need
to
put
officers
on
the
overtime
banking
plan
beginning
in
may
the
city
council
may
need
to
weigh
the
financial
costs
of
deferring
payment
he
said
beck
also
said
officers
do
not
like
this
arrangement
telling
the
daily
news
after
his
budget
presentation
that
it
defers
their
the
officers
payment
for
overtime
but
as
you
well
know
a
dollar
of
overtime
banked
now
is
often
when
it
s
paid
he
said
the
addition
of
the
million
for
metro
security
which
will
be
covered
by
the
transportation
agency
and
not
the
city
raises
the
total
sworn
overtime
allocation
to
million
but
some
including
councilman
mitch
englander
questioned
whether
this
meets
the
spirit
of
the
provision
in
the
union
contract
both
beck
and
union
leaders
on
thursday
pointed
out
that
the
proposed
overtime
budget
for
the
upcoming
year
is
smaller
than
this
year
s
the
city
budgeted
million
for
sworn
overtime
this
fiscal
year
while
out
of
the
proposed
million
for
next
year
only
million
is
actually
being
allotted
from
the
city
s
own
coffers
for
officer
overtime
hours
beck
said
mayoral
spokesman
george
kivork
said
in
a
statement
their
office
is
confident
we
ll
be
able
to
meet
the
same
safety
requirements
and
neighborhood
patrols
as
we
ve
had
in
the
past
there
will
not
be
a
reduction
the
mayor
s
deputy
chief
of
staff
matt
szabo
acknowledged
during
the
committee
meeting
that
the
likelihood
that
million
will
not
be
enough
to
truly
cover
overtime
costs
in
the
upcoming
fiscal
year
is
a
problem
but
he
said
the
mayor
s
office
had
to
make
some
significant
and
difficult
choices
we
fully
understand
that
is
not
the
most
ideal
situation
but
the
entire
budget
presented
a
less
than
ideal
situation

the
technique
has
raised

exactly
what
is
a
sanctuary
city
that
s
what
l
a
mayor
eric
garcetti
and
los
angeles
police
department
chief
charlie
beck
want
to
know
we
re
looking
for
clarification
chief
beck
said
the
mayor
and

went
to

last
week
to
knock
on
the
door
of
president
trump
s
director
of
homeland
security
john
f
kelly
after
the
closed

meeting
dave
lapan
a
spokesman
for
homeland
security
said
the
department
is
working
on
a
definition
but
doesn
t
have
a
timeline
this
is
wrong
the
mayor
and
chief
are
busy
men
they
can
t
hang
around
washington
waiting
for
the
feds
to
get
their
act
together
so
to
speed
things
along
i
d
like
to
offer
the
following
definition
of
a
sanctuary
city
sanctuary
city
noun
see
los
angeles
the
trump
administration
has
shoved
the
ultimate
back
burner
issue
onto
the
front
burner
at
long
last
we
re
having
an
honest
debate
about
our
broken
borders
rather
than
the
one
sided
demagoguing
that
has
maligned
anyone
opposed
to
open
borders
as
a
racist
and
xenophobe
ironically
had
we
been
allowed
to
have
this
conver
sation
before
the
issue
reached
critical
mass
donald
trump
would
still
be
a
reality
tv
goofball
rather
than
a
presidential
goofball
in
broad
terms
a
sanctuary
city
is
a
city
that
does
not
care
if
a
resident
is
in
the
country
illegally
but
los
angeles
went
considerably
past
simple
indifference
our
elected
officials
including
the
mayor
the
city
council
the
city
attorney
our
representatives
in
sacramento
and
washington
have
all
actively
conspired
to
subvert
any
attempt
by
the
federal
government
to
enforce
our
immigration
laws
they
have
passed
laws
created
policies
and
filed
lawsuits
in
an
effort
to
further
embed
our
illegal
immigrant
population
into
society
special
order
the
infamous
internal
lapd
directive
from
then
chief
daryl
gates
is
the
granddaddy
of
sanctuary
city
laws
in
america
i
put
laws
in
quotes
because
special
order
is
not
actually
a
law
it
s
a
department
policy
instructing
officers
not
to
initiate
a
stop
based
on
suspicion
of
an
immigration
violation
order
was
created
with
the
best
of
intentions
the
hope
was
if
we
took
deportation
off
the
table
victims
of
crime
and
witnesses
to
crimes
would
not
fear
going
to
the
police
that
s
not
what
happened
word
spread
quickly
los
angeles
became
the
destination
for
illegal
immigrants
why
not
the
welcome
mat
was
out
l
a
s
illegal
community
mushroomed
and
so
did
crime
in
the
decade
before
special
order
from
to
los
angeles
experienced
homicides
in
alone
years
after
special
order
was
supposed
to
make
l
a
safer
were
murdered
chief
beck
still
claims
special
order
makes
l
a
safer
donald
trump
is
not
the
only
one
spewing
alternative
facts
as
illegal
immigrants
spread
across
the
land
local
officials
in
other
cities
looked
to
see
how
los
angeles
handled
the
problem
sadly
they
doubled
down
on
our
bad
bet
they
created
their
own
versions
of
special
order
further
entrenching
a
vulnerable
exploitable
and
needy
population
into
their
communities
while
importing
poverty
lowering
the
wages
of
working
people
and
sending
crime
rates
through
the
roof
but
los
angeles
wasn
t
happy
with
just
special
order
over
the
years
our
various
mayors
and
city
council
members
have
labored
to
eliminate
any
distinction
between
legal
immigrants
and
illegal
immigrants
with
a
big
assist
from
our
local
news
media
who
similarly
make
no
distinctions
here
s
a
brief
sampling
of
how
local
politicians
poured
gas
on
the
fire
march
mayor
eric
garcetti
reactivated
the
office
of
immigrant
affairs
ostensibly
to
make
the
transition
to
a
new
life
in
america
easier
for
immigrants
the
office
not
only
makes
no
distinction
between
legal
and
illegal
immigrants
it
openly
advocates
for
legislative
action
at
the
state
and
national
level
to
erase
as
many
distinctions
as
possible
for
example
sb
councilman
gil
cedillo

struck
and
killed
allegedly
by

deportee
and
convicted
felon
estuardo
alvarado
simply
the
latest
documented
case
of
a
horrible
crime
committed
by
an
undocumented
immigrant
los
angeles
led
the
charge
to
ok
major
banks
accepting
matricula
consular
cards
to
open
accounts
and
receive
home
mortgages
you
can
t
get
any
more
embedded

than
that
on

mayor
garcetti
announced

would
not
honor
federal
immigration
requests
to
detain
inmates
who
might
be
deportable
unless
a
federal
judge
vetted
the
request
i
wonder
how
sandra
duran
s
family
feels
about
that
sb
granted
licenses
to
ply
a
trade
in
california
regardless
of
immigration
status
further
embedding
our
enormous
illegal
population
and
encouraging
more
to
come
while
forcing
hairdressers

other
licensed
professionals
into
stiffer
competition

a

los

police
captain
monday
publicly
detailed
what
she
alleges
is
the
department
s
systematic
pattern
of
underreporting
crime
statistics
los
angeles
police
department
capt
lillian
carranza
assigned
to
the
van
nuys
station
said
she
discovered
errors
in
categorizing
violent
crimes
that
were
never
fixed
ignoring
the
errors
resulted
in
serious
cases
being
underreported
which
can
have
a
significant
effect
on
how
police
plan
and
pay
for
their
strategies
to
fight
crime
as
a
citizen
it
gives
you
a
false
sense
of
security
that
you
are
safe
when
in
fact
that
might
not
be
the
case
carranza
a
year
lapd
veteran
said
at
an
afternoon
news
conference
monday
at
her
attorney
s
office
in
beverly
hills
it
also
affects
the
way
we
deploy
resources
the
support
we
get
from
federal
grants
and
in
my
case
and
in
my
officers
case
who
gets
the
support
of
discretionary
resources
and
who
doesn
t
in
her
government
claim
against
the
city
a
precursor
to
a
lawsuit
carranza
said
she
found
underreporting
in
a
number
of
stations
she
audited
ranging
from
the
lapd
s
foothill
and
mission
divisions
to
its
central
and
pacific
divisions
for
the
divisions
she
audited
carranza
found
that
lapd
was
underreporting
violent
crime
for
by
about
percent
she
said
carranza
argued
that
certain
staff
members
may
have
falsified
information
engaging
in
cooking
of
the
books
in
order
to
get
promotions
accolades
and
increased
responsibility
you
make
it
look
like
you
re
doing
a
great
job
and
the
next
thing
you
know
you
are
being
promoted
said
carranza
who
noted
she
has
been
raising
the
issue
with
her
superiors
since
when
officers
make
errors
on
crime
reports
the
mistakes
are
supposed
to
be
corrected
once
they
reach
a
watch
commander
a
records
clerk
or
a
detective
carranza
explained
however
in
some
cases
such
errors
were
not
recognized
or
fixed
she
said
someone
for
example
could
be
attacked
with
a
firearm
and
the
incident
would
be
incorrectly
coded
as
a
simple
assault
which
would
not
get
counted
in
the
city
s
serious
violent
crime
statistics
rather
than
an
aggravated
assault
she
said
after
complaining
of
the
errors
to
command
staff
no
action
was
taken
in
fact
she
was
ordered
to
stand
down
according
to
the
claim
carranza
argued
that
she
was
retaliated
against
for
bringing
up
the
issue
by
not
being
promoted
to
the
rank
of
commander
and
by
not
receiving
adequate
resources
for
her
division
the
captain
said
she
has
evidence
to
back
up
her
claims
but
she
and
her
attorney
declined
to
release
it
her
attorney
gregory
smith
said
the
information
might
be
considered
confidential
by
the
department
the
department
said
it
could
not
comment
on
pending
litigation
but
in
a
statement
department
officials
appeared
to
stand
by
the
numbers
saying
the
agency
is
a
model
of
accuracy
across
the
country
and
has
a
robust
unit
devoted
to
vetting
its
statistics
the
civilian
police
commission
also
reviews
the
numbers
the
statement
said
the
lapd
has
a
robust
system
of
training
inspection
accountability
and
auditing
of
crime
classifications
to
ensure
that
crime
reports
are
accurately
reported
to
the
fbi
under
the
national
uniform
crime
reporting
system
the
statement
said
the
statement
said
the

established
its

integrity
unit
which
is
charged
with
ongoing
inspections
training
officers
and
securing

ensure

when

and
additional

the
statement
said
in

claim
carranza
said
she
was
consistently
rebuffed
by
her
supervisors
until
despite
her
decision
to
file
a
report
with
the

of
the

alleging
that

question

we

why

goes
up
the
combination
of
releasing

this

becoming
so
expensive
just

mayor
eric

said
he
can
understand
the
anger
and
grief
but
that
s
it
as
a
typical
politician
he
knows
how
to
say
it
but
doesn
t
know
how
to
do
it
maybe
the
people
of
california
should
put
their
attention
to
sacramento
rather
than
blaming
everything
on
washington
d

maybe
something
will
happen
good

aren

of

who

then
why
all
the
fuss
over
deporting
illegal
aliens
illegal
aliens
don
t
vote
or
at
least
aren
t
supposed
to
the
bill
that
would
protect
these
people
also
protects
criminals
elected
representatives
risk
losing
federal
benefits
if
this
bill
is
passed
which
would
hurt
the
people
who
elected
them
so
why
don
t
they
just
let
the
federal
government
enforce
the
law
and
they
do
the
job
they
were
elected
to
do
which
doesn

include
protecting

los

police

said
his

leaving

as
entering

in

said
the

signed

that
calls
for

beck
said
the

i
have
quite
a

beck
said
and
i
believe
in
the
way
that
we
police
los

i
believe
that
when
you
build
trust
you
build
witnesses
you
build
people
that
cooperate
with
local
law
enforcement
and
you
keep
the

safer

the
los

bars

action
to
inquire
about

s
immigration
status
or
arresting
someone
for

of

the

does
require

to
notify
immigration
officials
about
any
arrests
of
people
accused
of
several
misdemeanors
a
high
grade
misdemeanor
or
felony
crime
or
who
have
made
repeat
offenses

are
civil
crimes

are
only
interested

offenses
los

county

released

declaring
there

not
be
a
change
in
the
department
s
policies
saying
our
priority
continues
to
be
protecting
our
public
the
department
s
policy
clearly
states
that
our
deputies
do
not
ask
for
one
s
immigration
status
and
that
immigration
enforcement
remains
a
federal
responsibility
mcdonnell
said
the
sheriff
s
department
also
must
follow
the
california
trust
act
signed
in
that
limits
a
local
agency
s
ability
to
cooperate
with
federal
officials
under
secure
communities
this
federal
program
allows
the
department
of
homeland
security
to
monitor
the
immigration
status
of
detainees
and
to
request
that
those
arrested
be
kept
in
detention
longer
mcdonnell
said
they
will
also
follow
the
federal
truth
act
that
went
into

local
crimes
leaving
federal
violations
such
as
entering
the
country
illegally
in
the
hands
of
immigration
officials
beck
said
the
city
policy
known
as
special
order
will
remain
in
place
despite
an
executive
order
signed
wednesday
by
trump
that
calls
for
federal
funding
to
be
taken
away
from
municipalities
operating
as
sanctuary
cities
beck
said
the
department
s
policy
has
helped
to
keep
the
city
safe
by
allowing
officers
to
win
trust
with
residents
some
of
whom
are
undocumented
i
ve
been
policing
this
city
for
years
and
i
don
t
know
how
much
policing
experience
the
president
has
but
i
have
quite
a
bit
beck
said
and
i
believe
in
the
way
that
we
police
los
angeles
i
believe
that
when
you
build
trust
you
build
witnesses
you
build
people
that
cooperate
with
local
law
enforcement
and
you
keep
the
city
safer
issued
in
by
then
chief
daryl
gates
the
los
angeles
police
department
s
policy
bars
officers
from
initiating
police
action
to
inquire
about
a
person
s
immigration
status
or
arresting
someone
for
violation
of
immigration
laws
the
policy
does
require
officers
to
notify
immigration
officials
about
any
arrests
of
people
accused
of
several
misdemeanors
a
high
grade
misdemeanor
or
felony
crime
or
who
have
made
repeat
offenses
beck
also
said
immigration
violations
are
civil
crimes
and
police
officers
are
only
interested
in
criminal
offenses
los
angeles
county
sheriff
jim
mcdonnell
released
a
statement
declaring
there
will
not
be
a
change
in
the
department
s
policies
saying
our
priority
continues
to
be
protecting
our
public
the
department
s
policy
clearly
states
that
our
deputies
do
not
ask
for
one
s
immigration
status
and
that
immigration
enforcement
remains
a
federal
responsibility
mcdonnell
said
the
sheriff
s
department
also
must
follow
the
california
trust
act
signed
in
that
limits
a
local
agency
s
ability
to
cooperate
with
federal
officials
under
secure
communities
this
federal
program
allows
the
department
of
homeland
security
to
monitor
the
immigration
status
of
detainees
and
to
request
that
those
arrested
be
kept
in
detention
longer
mcdonnell
said
they
will
also
follow
the
federal
truth
act
that
went
into
effect
this
year
which
requires
authorities
to
inform
detainees
in
writing
of
their

s
not

hate
crimes
were
up
last
year
across
the
nation
state
and
closer
to
home
in
hate
crimes
were
committed
in
los
angeles
according
to
the
fbi
up
percent
over
the
year
before
in
orange
county
there
were
hate
crimes
up

the

hate

were

up

from

before
police
data
assembled
by
thecenter
for
the
study
of
hate
and
extremism
at
cal
state
san
bernardinolooks
at
a
sample
of
large
cities
and
counties
across
the
united
states
including
nine
of
the
most
populous
cities
in
major
cities
and
counties
throughout
the
united
states
for
we
found
a
percent
increase
said
brian
levin
director
of
the
center
for
the
study
of
hate
and
extremism
however
in
california
it
went
up
percent
the
cities
of
san
bernardino
and
riverside
don
t
have
the
population
to
be
included
in
the
report
but
the
center
s
data
show
that
riverside
county
had
hate
incidents
last
year
up
from
eight
the
year
before
a
percent
increase
san
bernardino
had
eight
hate
crimes
in
a
percent
leap
from
the
four
incidents
in
and
the
trend
is
even
more
worrying
for
california
we
can
confidently
state
that
when
the
full
data
is
released
by
the
attorney
general
that
we
ll
have
the
first
back
to
back
increases
since
levin
said
nationally
and
in
california
we
re
at
multi
year
highs
but
well
off
the
record
high
of
after
years
of
declines
we
re
seeing
back
to
back
increases
so
that
s
a
concern
last
yearalso
looks
to
be
the
second
consecutive
year
that
hate
crimes
went
up
faster
in
california
than
the
rest
of
the
country
levin
presented
the
data
thursday
in
washington
d
c
at
a
summit
of
the
hate
crimes
subcommittee
a
subcommittee
of
the
presidentialtask
force
on
crime
reduction
and
public
safety
there
was
a
definite
election
time
spike
in
places
like
san
jose
los
angeles
but
also
new
york
boston
philadelphia
washington
montgomery
county
maryland
he
said
and
the
increase
in
many
of
these
places
was
dramatic
specifically
hate
crimes
against
gays
and
muslims
went
up
right
around
the
november
election
levin
repeatedly
noted
that
these
spikes
aren
t
necessarily
all
time
highs
in
hate
crimes
during
the
s
in
those
places
that
did
gather
data
we
had
higher
hate
crime
rates
he
said
but
we
don
t
have
data
from
many
of
these
places
and
even
now
it
s
hard
to
trust
all
of
the
reported
data
we
re
seeing
a
really
uneven
response
to
data
collection
with
whole
states
like
louisiana
reporting
no
hate
crimes
in
the
center
goes
beyond
police
data
to
survey
communities
across
the
country
and
estimates
less
than
half
of
actual
incidents
are
reported
to
the
police
as
hate
crimes
in
places
where
we
have
data
on
incidents
they
re
rising
faster
than
official
hate
crimes
levin
said
it
s
socially
acceptable
in
many
places
to
be
an
over
the
top
overt
bigot
as
long
as
you
re
not
committing
any
crimes

as

this

anxiety

a

slim

the
year
old
democrat
is
nearing
the
end
of
a
relatively
steady
first
term
blessed
by
an
improved
national
economy
he
helped
secure

for
rail
lines
intended

unclog
freeways
relaxed

taxes

powerful

interests
are
behind
him
and
he
s
successfully
discouraged
competition
the
mayor
faces
a
field
of
little
known
rivals
on

and
none
has
raised
the
millions
of
dollars
needed

that

from

venice
beach
boardwalk
to

like
san
fernando

the
mayor
however
shares
the
ballot
with
a
proposal
intended
to
restrict
large
real
estate
projects
that
challenges
his
vision
for
building
thousands
of
new
apartments
clustered
around
train
stations
growing
pains
are
nothing
new
in
l
a
as
can
be
witnessed
in
the
congested
freeways
but
questions
about
development
and
density
and
what
the
city
of
nearly
million
should
become
in
decades
to
come
are
coloring
campaigns
across
city
government
this
year
the
contagion

for

at
california
state

los

the

sonenshein
says
is
the

who

a
manhattan
west
mann
and
others
backing
the
restrictions
say
the
city
too
often
bends
to
politically
connected
developers
whose
large
projects
with
high
rents
drive
out
lower
income
residents
contributing
to
homelessness
while
increasing
congestion
and
traffic
garcetti
opposes
the
proposal
along
with
a
long
line
of
unions
and
businesses
he
warns
it
would
kill
a
string
of
projects
intended
to
house
the
homeless
and
would
drive
up
rents
i
d
hate
to
see
us
go
backward
he
said
after
an
event
near
city
hall
the
election
comes
at
a
time
of
renewal
and
struggles
for
the
nation
s
second
largest
city
once
dreary
downtown
has
seen
a
rebirth
and
is
home
to

buzzing

but
poverty

remain
alarming

it
s
been
said
traffic
can
t
possibly
get
worse
in

the

proved
otherwise
meanwhile
violent

climbed

schwartz
a
former
clinton

aide
who
steered
then
sen
barack
obama
s
campaign
in
california
said
he
entered
the
race
because
the

s
talk
of

doesn
t
square
with
what
he
sees
across
l
a
you
don
t
see
the
improvements
in

schwartz
says
anyone
who
is
driving
knows
about
the
potholes
everywhere
as
always
one
of
the
biggest
questions
in
los

is
who
will
vote
angelenos
tend
to
greet
local
elections
with
a
collective
shrug
and
turnout
sometimes
struggles
to
get
into
double
digits
it
won
t
help
that
the
november
presidential
contest
left
many
voters
dispirited
incumbents
are
often
discussed
with
a
cringe
and
with
a
relatively
small
number
of
voters
in
play
there
s
a
higher
chance
of
surprises
with
garcetti
dominating
the
race
so
far
leading
challengers
are
hoping
to
hold
him
below
percent
of
the
tally
next
month
which
would
force
the
mayor
into
a
may
runoff
against
the
second
place
finisher
as
the
front
runner
the
mayor
is
facing
political
expectations
widely
seen
as
a
future
candidate
for
governor
congress
or
u
s
senate
garcetti
s
credentials
could
be
dinged
if
he
turns
in
a
shaky
showing
against
a
less
than
intimidating
field
when
a
mayor
is
running
largely
unopposed
by
any
major
candidates
then
they
are
kind
of
running
against
themselves
sonenshein
notes
ending
up
in
a
runoff
would
be
an
embarrassment
but
failing
to
run
up
the
score
could
make
him
look
vulnerable
in
some
ways
it
s
a
no

situation

the
internet
and
social

are
a
core
component
of
our
everyday
lives
because
the
internet
is
such
an
integral
part
of
their
relationships
young
people
must
have
tools
to
understand
the
online
environment
the
responsibilities
they
have
to
themselves
and
others
and
the
perils
of
reckless
behavior
said

said
danny
kennedy
the
acting

s
los

in

but
we
also
expect
them
to
navigate
their
way
through
the
latest
technology
a
byproduct
of
this

has
always
been
that
the
fbi
learns
a
great
deal
from

as
we
endeavor

after

said
the

this
is
wrong
the

are

hang

washington
waiting
for
the
feds
to
get
their

together
so
to
speed
things
along
i
d
like
to
offer
the
following
definition
of
a
sanctuary
city
sanctuary
city
noun
see
los
angeles
the
trump
administration
has
shoved
the
ultimate
back
burner
issue
onto
the
front
burner
at
long
last
we
re
having
an
honest
debate
about
our
broken
borders
rather
than
the
one
sided
demagoguing
that
has
maligned
anyone
opposed
to
open
borders
as
a
racist
and
xenophobe
ironically
had
we
been
allowed
to
have
this
conversation
before
the
issue
reached
critical
mass
donald
trump
would
still
be
a
reality
tv
goofball
rather
than
a
presidential
goofball
in
broad
terms
a
sanctuary
city
is
a
city
that
does
not
care
if
a
resident
is
in
the
country
illegally
but
los
angeles
went
considerably
past
simple
indifference
our
elected
officials
including
the
mayor
the
city
council
the
city
attorney
our
representatives
in
sacramento
and
washington
have
all
actively
conspired
to
subvert
any
attempt
by
the
federal
government
to
enforce
our
immigration
laws
they
have
passed
laws
created
policies
and
filed
lawsuits
in
an
effort
to
further
embed
our
illegal
immigrant
population
into
society
special
order
the
infamous
internal
lapd
directive
from
then
chief
daryl
gates
is
the
granddaddy
of
sanctuary
city
laws
in
america
i
put
laws
in
quotes
because
special
order
is
not
actually
a
law
it
s
a
department
policy
instructing
officers
not
to
initiate
a
stop
based
on
suspicion
of
an
immigration
violation
order
was
created
with
the
best
of
intentions
the
hope
was
if
we
took
deportation
off
the
table
victims
of
crime
and
witnesses
to
crimes
would
not
fear
going
to
the
police
that
s
not
what
happened
word
spread
quickly
los
angeles
became
the
destination
for
illegal
immigrants
why
not
the
welcome
mat
was
out
l
a
s
illegal
community
mushroomed
and
so
did
crime
in
the
decade
before
special
order
from
to
los
angeles
experienced
homicides
in
alone
years
after
special
order
was
supposed
to
make
l
a
safer
were
murdered
chief
beck
still
claims
special
order
makes
l
a
safer
donald
trump
is
not
the
only
one
spewing
alternative
facts
as
illegal
immigrants
spread
across
the
land
local
officials
in
other
cities
looked
to
see
how
los
angeles
handled
the
problem
sadly
they
doubled
down
on
our
bad
bet
they
created
their
own
versions
of
special
order
further
entrenching
a
vulnerable
exploitable
and
needy
population
into
their
communities
while
importing
poverty
lowering
the
wages
of
working
people
and
sending
crime
rates
through
the
roof
but
los
angeles
wasn
t
happy
with
just
special
order
over
the
years
our
various
mayors
and
city
council
members
have
labored
to
eliminate
any
distinction
between
legal
immigrants
and
illegal
immigrants
with
a
big
assist
from
our
local
news
media
who
similarly
make
no
distinctions
here
s
a
brief
sampling
of
how
local
politicians
poured
gas
on
the
fire
march
mayor
eric
garcetti
reactivated
the
office
of
immigrant
affairs
ostensibly
to
make
the
transition
to
a
new
life
in
america
easier
for
immigrants
the
office
not
only
makes
no
distinction
between
legal
and
illegal
immigrants
it
openly
advocates
for
legislative
action
at
the
state
and
national
level
to
erase
as
many
distinctions
as
possible
for
example
sb
councilman
gil
cedillo
s
dream
come
true
granted
driver
s
licenses
to
illegal
immigrants
and
were
issued
yet
l
a
is
still
the
hit
and
run
capital
of
america
sandra
duran
was
struck
and
killed
allegedly
by
a
five
time
deportee
and
convicted
felon
estuardo
alvarado
simply
the
latest
documented
case
of
a
horrible
crime
committed
by
an
undocumented
immigrant
los
angeles
led
the
charge
to
ok
major
banks
accepting
matricula
consular
cards
to
open
accounts
and
receive
home
mortgages
you
can
t
get
any
more
embedded
in
a
community
than
that
on
july
mayor
garcetti
announced
lapd
would
not
honor
federal
immigration
requests
to
detain
inmates
who
might
be
deportable
unless
a
federal
judge
vetted
the
request
i
wonder
how
sandra
duran
s
family
feels
about
that
sb
granted
licenses
to
ply
a
trade
in
california
regardless
of
immigration
status
further
embedding
our
enormous
illegal
population
and
encouraging
more
to
come
while
forcing
hairdressers
and
other
licensed
professionals
into
stiffer
competition
resulting
in
lower
wages
kevin
de
leon
the
president
pro

of

california
state
senate
announced
to
the

half
my
family
is
in

illegally
and
then
confessed
they
had
fake
stolen
social
security
cards

other
fraudulent
forms

id
not
that
identity
theft
is
a
problem
right
de

a

that
would
make
all

an

sanctuary
for

throw

a

regardless
of

status
and
a
cornucopia
of
other
perks
and
benefits
and
it
s
not
hard
to
figure
out
why
so
many
have
chosen
to
come
here
by
any

necessary

tv
goofball
rather
than
a
presidential
goofball
in
broad
terms
a
sanctuary
city
is
a
city
that
does
not
care
if
a
resident
is
in
the
country
illegally
but
los
angeles
went
considerably
past
simple
indifference
our
elected
officials
including
the
mayor
the
city
council
the
city
attorney
our
representatives
in
sacramento
and
washington
have
all
actively
conspired
to
subvert
any
attempt
by
the
federal
government
to
enforce
our
immigration
laws
they
have
passed
laws
created
policies
and
filed
lawsuits
in
an
effort
to
further
embed
our
illegal
immigrant
population
into
society
special
order
the
infamous
internal
lapd
directive
from
then
chief
daryl
gates
is
the
granddaddy
of
sanctuary
city
laws
in
america
i
put
laws
in
quotes
because
special
order
is
not
actually
a
law
it
s
a
department
policy
instructing
officers
not
to
initiate
a
stop
based
on
suspicion
of
an
immigration
violation
order
was
created
with
the
best
of
intentions
the
hope
was
if
we
took
deportation
off
the
table
victims
of
crime
and
witnesses
to
crimes
would
not
fear
going
to
the
police
that
s
not
what
happened
word
spread
quickly
los
angeles
became
the
destination
for
illegal
immigrants
why
not
the
welcome
mat
was
out
l
a
s
illegal
community
mushroomed
and
so
did
crime
in
the
decade
before
special
order
from
to
los
angeles
experienced
homicides
in
alone
years
after
special
order
was
supposed
to
make
l
a
safer
were
murdered
chief
beck
still
claims
special
order
makes
l
a
safer
donald
trump
is
not
the
only
one
spewing
alternative
facts
as
illegal
immigrants
spread
across
the
land
local
officials
in
other
cities
looked
to
see
how
los
angeles
handled
the
problem
sadly
they
doubled
down
on
our
bad
bet
they
created
their
own
versions
of
special
order
further
entrenching
a
vulnerable
exploitable
and
needy
population
into
their
communities
while
importing
poverty
lowering
the
wages
of
working
people
and
sending
crime
rates
through
the
roof
but
los
angeles
wasn
t
happy
with
just
special
order
over
the
years
our
various
mayors
and
city
council
members
have
labored
to
eliminate
any
distinction
between
legal
immigrants
and
illegal
immigrants
with
a
big
assist
from
our
local
news
media
who
similarly
make
no
distinctions
here
s
a
brief
sampling
of
how
local
politicians
poured
gas
on
the
fire
march
mayor
eric
garcetti
reactivated
the
office
of
immigrant
affairs
ostensibly
to
make
the
transition
to
a
new
life
in
america
easier
for
immigrants
the
office
not
only
makes
no
distinction
between
legal
and
illegal
immigrants
it
openly
advocates
for
legislative
action
at
the
state
and
national
level
to
erase
as
many
distinctions
as
possible
for
example
sb
councilman
gil
cedillo
s
dream
come
true
granted
driver
s
licenses
to
illegal
immigrants
and
were
issued
yet
l
a
is
still
the
hit
and
run
capital
of
america
sandra
duran
was
struck
and
killed
allegedly
by
a
five
time
deportee
and
convicted
felon
estuardo
alvarado
simply
the
latest
documented
case
of
a
horrible
crime
committed
by
an
undocumented
immigrant
los
angeles
led
the
charge
to
ok
major
banks
accepting
matricula
consular
cards
to
open
accounts
and
receive
home
mortgages
you
can
t
get
any
more
embedded
in
a
community
than
that
on
july
mayor
garcetti
announced
lapd
would
not
honor
federal
immigration
requests
to
detain
inmates
who
might
be
deportable
unless
a
federal
judge
vetted
the
request
i
wonder
how
sandra
duran
s
family
feels
about
that
sb
granted
licenses
to
ply
a
trade
in
california
regardless
of
immigration
status
further
embedding
our
enormous
illegal
population
and
encouraging
more
to
come
while
forcing
hairdressers
and
other
licensed
professionals
into
stiffer
competition
resulting
in
lower
wages
kevin
de
leon
the
president
pro
tem
of
the
california
state
senate
announced
to
the
world
half
my
family
is
in
the
country
illegally
and
then
confessed
they
had
fake
stolen
social
security
cards
and
other
fraudulent
forms
of
id
not
that
identity
theft
is
a
problem
right
de
leon
is
the
author
of
sb
a
bill
that
would
make
all
of
california
an
official
sanctuary
for
illegal
immigrants
throw
in
section
housing
aid
to
families
with
dependant
children
in

a
push
for
universal
health
insurance
regardless
of
immigration
status
and
a
cornucopia
of
other
perks
and
benefits
and
it
s
not
hard
to
figure
out
why
so
many
have
chosen
to
come
here
by
any
means
necessary
if
the

the

said
thursday
the
ruling
came
in
a
lawsuit
by
the
american
civil

that
sought
a

millions

from

department
to

and
educate
the
public
on
the
risks
to

posed
by

in
the

a
unanimous
supreme
court
ordered
a
lower

to
consider
methods
to
make
the

anonymous
and
determine

any

those

would
require
its

agencies
nationwide

the

the

is
passed
through

to
instantly
check
whether
the

the

say
the

overwhelmingly
capture
innocent

recording
information
about
their

that
could
be
used
to
track
their

the
aclu
and
electronic
frontier
foundation
said
the
agencies
hold
the
data
for
years
allowing
officers
to
use
it
in

investigations
the
state
supreme
court
rejected
a
lower
court
s
decision
that
the
scans
are
part
of
law
enforcement
investigations
and
therefore
exempt
from

the
justices
said
the
scans
were
not
conducted
as
part
of
a
targeted
inquiry
into
any
particular
crime
or
crimes
it
is
hard
to
imagine
that
the
legislature
intended
for
the
records
of
investigations
exemption
to
reach
the
large
volume
of

that
plate

and
other

that

those

fouladi
said
the
number
of

has
also
significantly
increased
because
cair

the

came
knocking
on

door
after
a

camping
trip
during
which
he
and
three
other

were

praying
someone
had
told

that

were
making

talking

a

a

says
he
was
shocked
when
fbi
agents
contacted
him
and
his
friends
our
only
offense
was
we
were
camping
while
muslim
he
said
turshani
and
his
friends
approached
cair
la
and
asked
for
a
meeting
with
the
fbi
with
a
cair
representative
present
the
issue
was
resolved
after
the
minute
meeting
when
fbi
officials
realized
that
the
complaint
was
without
merit
he
said
while
hate
crimes
and
hate
incidents
receive
the
most
public
attention
stories
of
people
like
turshani
who
face
discrimination
are
less

immigration
and

have
been
large
issues
in
the
last
year
nationwide
particularly
with
regard
to
syrian
refugees
and
those
traveling
from
muslim
majority
countries
he
said
and
those
attitudes
play
out
locally
with
regard
to
hate
crimes
and
hate
incidents
muslim
residents
of
los

county
are
being
targeted
with
stereotyping
aggression
hostility
and
violence
said
robin
toma
executive
director
of
the
los

county
commission
on
human
relations
we
know
that
hate
crimes
are
only
a
small
part
of
the
type
of
hostility
and
discrimination
muslim
americans
have
to
deal
with
he
said
toma
says
the
discrimination
the
muslim
american
community
faces
is
real
these
incidents
are
well
documented
and
we
are
looking
at
a
clear
trend
showing
an
increase
in
prejudice
that
you
can
see
across
many
reports
filed
by
community
organizations
and
law
enforcement
he
said
the
issue
is
not
about
whether
these
reports
are
made
up
the
much
greater
problem
is
that
these
incidents
are
underreported
cair
itself
has
been
the
target
of
verbal
and
written
attacks
right
wing
websites
and
blogs
often
refer
to
cair
as
a
terrorist
organization
cair
along
with
the
muslim
american
society
is
listed
as
a
terrorist
organization
by
the
united
arab
emirates
but
that
nation
s
designated
list
of
terrorist
groups
leaves
out
well
established
organizations
such
as
hamas
and
hezbollah
stateside
cair
has
never
been
charged
with
any
criminal
activity
and
operates
with
a
tax
exempt
status
the
u
s
government
does
not
list
cair
as
a
terrorist
organization
fouladi
says
the
criticism
of
cair
is
another
example
of
islamophobia
and
an
attempt
to
undermine
its
credibility
as
an
advocacy
group
it
s
our
job
to
continually
push
back
and
shed
light
on
these

our

especially
under

he

this

is
important

it
is
something
we
can
use

that

s
not
your

hate
crimes
were
up
last
year
across
the
nation
state
and
closer
to
home
in
hate
crimes
were
committed
in
los
angeles
according
to
the
fbi
up
percent
over
the
year
before
in
orange
county
there
were
hate
crimes
up
percent
over
the
year
before
of
the
local
communities
in
the
fbi

hate
crimes
statistics
long
beach

a
decrease
in
hate
crimes
with
eight

down
percent
from
the
year
before
nationally
the
fbi
reports
hate
crimes
were
committed
nationally
in
up
percent
from
the
year
before
police
data
assembled
by
thecenter
for
the
study
of
hate
and
extremism
at
cal
state
san
bernardinolooks
at
a
sample
of
large
cities
and
counties
across
the
united
states
including
nine
of
the
most
populous
cities
in
major
cities
and
counties
throughout
the
united
states
for
we
found
a
percent
increase
said
brian
levin
director
of
the
center
for
the
study
of
hate
and
extremism
however
in
california
it
went
up
percent
the
cities
of
san
bernardino
and
riverside
don
t
have
the
population
to
be
included
in
the
report
but
the
center
s
data
show
that
riverside
county
had
nine
hate
incidents
last
year
up
from
eight
the
year
before
a
percent
increase
san
bernardino
had
eight
hate
crimes
in
a
percent
leap
from
the
four
incidents
in
and
the
trend
is
even
more
worrying
for
california
we
can
confidently
state
that
when
the
full
data
is
released
by
the
attorney
general
that
we
ll
have
the
first
back
to
back
increases
since
levin
said
nationally
and
in
california
we
re
at
multiyear
highs
but
well
off
the
record
high
of
after
years
of
declines
we
re
seeing
back
to
back
increases
so
that
s
a
concern
last
yearalso
looks
to
be
the
second
consecutive
year
that
hate
crimes
went
up
faster
in
california
than
the
rest
of
the
country
levin
presented
the
data
thursday
in
washington
d
c
at
a
summit
of
the
hate
crimes
subcommittee
a
subcommittee
of
the
presidentialtask
force
on
crime
reduction
and
public
safety
there
was
a
definite
election
time
spike
in
places
like
san
jose
los
angeles
but
also
new
york
boston
philadelphia
washington
montgomery
county
maryland
he
said
and
the
increase
in
many
of
these
places
was
dramatic
specifically
hate
crimes
against
gays
and
muslims
went
up
right
around
the
november
election
levin
repeatedly
noted
that
these
spikes
aren
t
necessarily
all
time
highs
in
hate
crimes
during
the
s
in
those
places
that
did
gather
data
we
had
higher
hate
crime
rates
he
said
but
we
don
t
have
data
from
many
of
these
places
and
even
now
it
s
hard
to
trust
all
of
the
reported
data
we
re
seeing
a
really
uneven
response
to
data
collection
with
whole
states
like
louisiana
reporting
no
hate
crimes
in
the
center
goes
beyond
police
data
to
survey
communities
across
the
country
and
estimates
less
than
half
of
actual
incidents
are
reported
to
the
police
as
hate
crimes
in
places
where
we
have
data
on
incidents
they
re
rising
faster
than
official
hate
crimes
levin
said
it
s
socially
acceptable
in
many
places
to
be
an
over
the
top
overt
bigot
as
long
as
you
re
not
committing
any
crimes
levin
said
he
was
pleased
by
thursday
s
summit
at
whichattorney
general
jeff
sessions
vowed
to
zealously
enforce
federal
hate
crime
lawshe
opposed
as
senator
this
summit
represents
a
positive
first
step
in
what
appears
to
be
a
sustained
effort
by
the
justice
department
to
reach
out
to
advocates
and
subject
matter
experts
in
setting
their
policy

said

crimes
were
committed
in

at

including
nine
of
the
most
populous
cities
in
major
cities
and

throughout
the

for
we
found
a
percent
increase
said
brian
levin
director
of
the
center
for
the
study
of
hate
and
extremism
however
in
california
it
went
up
percent
the
cities
of
san
bernardino
and
riverside
don
t
have
the
population
to
be
included
in
the
report
but
the
center
s
data
show
that
riverside
county
had
hate
incidents
last
year
up
from
eight
the
year
before
a
percent
increase
san
bernardino
had
eight
hate
crimes
in
a
percent
leap
from
the
four
incidents
in
and
the
trend
is
even
more
worrying
for
california
we
can
confidently
state
that
when
the
full
data
is
released
by
the
attorney
general
that
we
ll
have
the
first
back
to
back
increases
since
levin
said
nationally
and
in
california
we
re
at
multi
year
highs
but
well
off
the
record
high
of
after
years
of
declines
we
re
seeing
back
to
back
increases
so
that
s
a
concern
last
yearalso
looks
to
be
the
second
consecutive
year
that
hate
crimes
went
up
faster
in
california
than
the
rest
of
the
country
levin
presented
the
data
thursday
in
washington
d
c
at
a
summit
of
the
hate
crimes
subcommittee
a
subcommittee
of
the
presidentialtask
force
on
crime
reduction
and
public
safety
there
was
a
definite
election
time
spike
in
places
like
san
jose
los
angeles
but
also
new
york
boston
philadelphia
washington
montgomery
county
maryland
he
said
and
the
increase
in
many
of
these
places
was
dramatic
specifically
hate
crimes
against
gays
and
muslims
went
up
right
around
the
november
election
levin
repeatedly
noted
that
these
spikes
aren
t
necessarily
all
time
highs
in
hate
crimes
during
the
s
in
those
places
that
did
gather
data
we
had
higher
hate
crime
rates
he
said
but
we
don
t
have
data
from
many
of
these
places
and
even
now
it
s
hard
to
trust
all
of
the
reported
data
we
re
seeing
a
really
uneven
response
to
data
collection
with
whole
states
like
louisiana
reporting
no
hate
crimes
in
the
center
goes
beyond
police
data
to
survey
communities
across
the
country
and
estimates
less
than
half
of
actual
incidents
are
reported
to
the
police
as
hate
crimes
in
places
where
we
have
data
on
incidents
they
re
rising
faster
than
official
hate
crimes
levin
said
it
s
socially
acceptable
in
many
places
to
be
an
over
the
top
overt
bigot
as
long
as
you
re
not
committing
any
crimes
levin
said
he
was
pleased
by
thursday
s
summit
at
whichattorney

jeff
sessions
vowed
to
zealously
enforce

hate
crime
lawshe
opposed

this

out

out
who
was
the
actual
killer
the
defense
pinned
the
crime
on
romain
s
late
brother
who
died
in
and
more
closely
matched
the
description
of
the
shooter
mckesson
said
they
also
disputed
that
a
scar
on
romain
s
arm
was
from
a
bullet
and
an
expert
testified
that
his
dna
could
have
come
from
a
jacket
of
his
often
worn
by
his
brother
romain
an
air
force
veteran
had
been
a
candidate
for
a
job
as
a
los
angeles
police
officer
at
the
time
of
the
shooting
but
was
later
disqualified
about
a
decade
later
he
was
hired
by
the
federal
government
after
undergoing
background
checks
that
revealed
information
about
his
arrest
in
the
fatal
shooting
but
showed
the
charges
had
been
thrown
out
when
he
was
charged
with
the
killing
in
a
spokeswoman
for
the
base
told
the
los
angeles
times
that
air
force
personnel
had
access
to
court
files
but
not
the
lapd
case
file
he
was
fired
after
his
arrest
mckesson
said
romain
faces
a
sentence
of
years
to
life
in
prison
when
sentenced
sept
mckesson
said
he
ll
ask
for
a
new
trial
and
if
that
fails
an
appeal
will
be
filed
exactly
what
is
a
sanctuary
city
that
s
what
l
a
mayor
eric
garcetti
and
los
angeles
police
department
chief
charlie
beck
want
to
know
we
re
looking
for
clarification
chief
beck
said
the
mayor
and
chief
went
to
washington
last
week
to
knock
on
the
door
of
president
trump
s
director
of
homeland
security
john
f
kelly
after
the
closed
door
meeting
dave
lapan
a
spokesman
for
homeland
security
said
the
department
is
working
on
a
definition
but
doesn
t
have
a
timeline
this
is
wrong
the
mayor
and
chief
are
busy
men
they
can
t
hang
around
washington
waiting
for
the
feds
to
get
their
act
together
so
to
speed
things
along
i
d
like
to
offer
the
following
definition
of
a
sanctuary
city
sanctuary
city
noun
see
los
angeles
the
trump
administration
has
shoved
the
ultimate
back
burner
issue
onto
the
front
burner
at
long
last
we
re
having
an
honest
debate
about
our
broken
borders
rather
than
the
one
sided
demagoguing
that
has
maligned
anyone
opposed
to
open
borders
as
a
racist
and
xenophobe
ironically
had
we
been
allowed
to
have
this
conversation
before
the
issue
reached
critical
mass
donald
trump
would
still
be
a
reality
tv
goofball
rather
than
a
presidential
goofball
in
broad
terms
a
sanctuary
city
is
a
city
that
does
not
care
if
a
resident
is
in
the
country
illegally
but
los
angeles
went
considerably
past
simple
indifference
our
elected
officials
including
the
mayor
the
city
council
the
city
attorney
our
representatives
in
sacramento
and
washington
have
all
actively
conspired
to
subvert
any
attempt
by
the
federal
government
to
enforce
our
immigration
laws
they
have
passed
laws
created
policies
and
filed
lawsuits
in
an
effort
to
further
embed
our
illegal
immigrant
population
into
society
special
order
the
infamous
internal
lapd
directive
from
then
chief
daryl
gates
is
the
granddaddy
of
sanctuary
city
laws
in
america
i
put
laws
in
quotes
because
special
order
is
not
actually
a
law
it
s
a
department
policy
instructing
officers
not
to
initiate
a
stop
based
on
suspicion
of
an
immigration
violation
order
was
created
with
the
best
of
intentions
the
hope
was
if
we
took
deportation
off
the
table
victims
of
crime
and
witnesses
to
crimes
would
not
fear
going
to
the
police
that
s
not
what
happened
word
spread
quickly
los
angeles
became
the
destination
for
illegal
immigrants
why
not
the
welcome
mat
was
out
l
a
s
illegal
community
mushroomed
and
so
did
crime
in
the
decade
before
special
order
from
to
los
angeles
experienced
homicides
in
alone
years
after
special
order
was
supposed
to
make
l
a
safer
were
murdered
chief
beck
still
claims
special
order
makes
l
a
safer
donald
trump
is
not
the
only
one
spewing
alternative
facts
as
illegal
immigrants
spread
across
the
land
local
officials
in
other
cities
looked
to
see
how
los
angeles
handled
the
problem
sadly
they
doubled
down
on
our
bad
bet
they
created
their
own
versions
of
special
order
further
entrenching
a
vulnerable
exploitable
and
needy
population
into
their
communities
while
importing
poverty
lowering
the
wages
of
working
people
and
sending
crime
rates
through
the
roof
but
los
angeles
wasn
t
happy
with
just
special
order
over
the
years
our
various
mayors
and
city
council
members
have
labored
to
eliminate
any
distinction
between
legal
immigrants
and
illegal
immigrants
with
a
big
assist
from
our
local
news
media
who
similarly
make
no
distinctions
here
s
a
brief
sampling
of
how
local
politicians
poured
gas
on
the
fire
march
mayor
eric
garcetti
reactivated
the
office
of
immigrant
affairs
ostensibly
to
make
the
transition
to
a
new
life
in
america
easier
for
immigrants
the
office
not
only
makes
no
distinction
between
legal
and
illegal
immigrants
it
openly
advocates
for
legislative
action
at
the
state
and
national
level
to
erase
as
many
distinctions
as
possible
for
example
sb
councilman
gil
cedillo
s

true
granted

licenses
to
illegal

were
issued
yet
l
a
is

of
america
sandra
duran
was
struck
and
killed
allegedly
by
a
five
time
deportee
and
convicted
felon
estuardo
alvarado
simply
the
latest
documented
case
of
a
horrible
crime
committed
by
an
undocumented
immigrant
los
angeles
led
the
charge
to
ok
major
banks
accepting
matricula
consular
cards
to
open
accounts
and
receive
home
mortgages
you
can
t
get
any
more
embedded
in
a
community
than
that
on
july
mayor
garcetti
announced
lapd
would
not
honor
federal
immigration
requests
to
detain
inmates
who
might
be
deportable
unless
a
federal
judge
vetted
the
request
i
wonder
how
sandra
duran
s
family
feels
about
that
sb
granted
licenses
to
ply
a
trade
in
california
regardless
of
immigration
status
further
embedding
our
enormous
illegal
population
and
encouraging
more
to
come
while
forcing
hairdressers
and
other
licensed
professionals
into
stiffer
competition
resulting
in
lower
wages
kevin

social

and
it

to
figure
out
why
so
many
have
chosen
to

such

to

the

what
the

took
away
the

sass

say
they
see
an

sass

releasing
thieves
to
commit
more
crimes
and
allowing
drug
offenders
to
roam
freely
in
the

without
mandating
and
imposing

does
absolutely
nothing

espinoza
said
his

recently
received

proposition
fundingto
reduce
recidivism
among
former

and
fund
rehabilitation
programs
for
those
with

those
programs
are
voluntary
and
mandated
said
espinosa
a
former
los

county
superior
court
judge
leaning
on
his
experience
as
a
judge
he
noted
that
forcing
people
into
treatment
programs
doesn
t
always
work
whatever
got
them
to
the
point
of
treatment
in
the
first
place
doesn
t
always
get
resolved
especially
among
people
with
mental
illness
he
said
linking
former
inmates
to
community
programs
does
work
if
city
and
county
departments
create
strong
relationships
he
added
still
the
potential
for
fixing
flaws
in
the
way
the
law
is
playing
out
in
california
offers
the
prospect
of
positive
reform
this
is
a
fresh
look
at
criminal
justice
and
the
intersection
of
mental
health
and
those
with
drug
addictions

said
it

of

but
after
the
long
wait
the

coming

city
are
still
a
drop
in
the
bucket
he
said
as
a
former
officer
he
was
arresting
the
same
folks
and
these
individuals
who
i
was
arresting
were
not
getting
the
proper
treatment
necessary
to
get
their
lives
back
in
order
more
funds
are
needed
for
outreach
teams

for

so
that

don

go

that

out
of
respect
for

and
any

the

with
the

which
oversees
ice
knowing
that
the
th

would
be
lifted
the
request
was
primarily
based
on
his
pending

application
and
the
changes
to
his
criminal
history
homeland

denied
the

saying
it
had
been

diamante

once

he
ll

diamante
worries
that
if

denies

too
late
in

ice
could
move

said
jennifer

coauthor

community
engagement

it
s
critical
that
true
independent
civilian
oversight
not
beholden

the

is
on
to
a

one
had
been
placed
in
a

were
shot
and
three
had
been
zapped
by
tasers
over
that
period
nearly
of
the
victims
of
arrest
related
force
were
unarmed
the
vast
majority
of
those
killed
in
those
years
were
black
or
latino
surpassing
the
city

population
percentage
of
those
racial
groups
though
blacks
represent
less
than
of
anaheim
s

of

the

homicides
is
not

crime
rate
the
report
points
out
in
fact
the
report
states
fbi
data
in
showed
anaheim
was
the
second
safest
from
violent
crime
of
the
largest
cities
in
the
country
city
officials
said
the
aclu
review
does
not
reflect
anaheim
s
success
in
community
policing
few
public
safety
agencies
have
initiated
as
much
internal
review
and
brought
about
as
much
positive
change
as
the
anaheim
police
department
has
in
recent
years
said
the
city
s
acting
police
chief
julian
harvey
our
major
incident
review
process
is
now
a
model
for
california
we
have
brought
our
officers
closer
to
the
neighborhoods
they
serve
and
created
new
ways
for
the
community
to
share
their
concerns
with
us
harvey
said
the
report
had
inaccuracies
we
welcome
open
and
honest
assessment
of
how
we
are
doing
unfortunately
this
report
falls
short
with
misstatements
designed
for
maximum
impact
rather
than
honestly
portraying
our
city
he
said
among
the
report
s
errors
anaheim
spokesman
mike
lyster
said
was
classifying
one
death
in
as
an
officer
involved
shooting
when
officials
later
determined
that
the
victim
had
died
from
his
own
weapon
harvey
said
he
looks
forward
to
clarifying
the
record
next
month
when
the
anaheim
council
meets
to
talk
about
expanding
the
work
of
the
city
s
public
safety
board
councilman
jose
moreno
said
he
hoped
the
report
s
release
will
provide
more
urgency
to
getting
the
board
up
and
running
he
credited
former
police
chief
raul
quezada
with
creating
a
neighborhood
advisory
council
and
making
online
complaint
forms
available
to
citizens
city
officials
hired
quezada
and
asked
him
to
undertake
numerous
reforms
after
the
fatal
shootings
of
two
latino
young
men
in
sparked
a
riot
and
days
of
unrest
in
downtown
anaheim
more
than
people
confronted
police
and
threw
rocks
and
bottles
leaving
businesses
damaged
that
year
there
were
nine
deaths
from
police
shootings
quezada
pushed
for
officers
to
wear
body
cameras
the
aclu
report
highlights
officers
who
have
been
involved
in
multiple
shooting
incidents
just
over
half
the
anaheim
police
department
s
fatal
shootings
were
by
officers
involved
in
at
least
one
other
shooting
according
to
its
analysis
the
number
of
killings
involving
repeat
shooters
raises
questions
about
anaheim
pd
s
handling
of
shootings
how
effectively
they
identify
officers
that
use
deadly
force
too
easily
and
their
inability
to
keep
officers
involved
in
one
fatal
shooting
from
killing
again
it
states
moreno
urged
city
officials
to
look
at
the
report
with
an
open
mind
let
s
be
proactive

but
harkavy
said
there
is
little
chance
of

does
not

the

were
set
up
opposite
of

some
of

some
are

those

refer
to
the
thin

that

use
to
symbolize
police
work
its
something
thats
been
around
for
quite
awhile
and
is
used
by

a

symbol
was
created
to
allow
the
community
to
show
support
for
law

and
those
attempting
to
hijack
the
symbol
for
their
own
purposes
hate
groups
such
as
the
neo

white

or
the

are
despicable
and
most
certainly
do
not

the

anti

we
repudiate

lallys

added

his

strongly
urges
any

people
planning
to
assemble
with
the
goal
of
re
creating
the

that
occurred
in

to

we

their

is
coming
from
and
seek
professional

no

the

department
wears
tan
and
green
on
their

but
they
still
associate
with
the

symbol
frankly
its
kind
of
horrifying
to
see
the
photos
of
hate
groups
of
neo
nazis
and
white
supremacists
and
the
kkk
draping
themselves
in
these
flags
they
dont
represent
what
we
stand
for
as
police
officers
and
its
just
appalling
theyre
carrying
these
flags
and
using
them
in
that
manner
i
would
hope
they
think
this
isnt

it
just

the

you
sometimes
get
the

wang
said
the
increase
in
hate
crimes
and
hate

in

in

makes
such
a

increasingly
necessary
and

she

the

not
she

donald

s
anti

rhetoric
making
china
the
economic
enemy
during
his

may
have
played
a
part
in
rousing
these

it
s
reminiscent
of

when
japan

portrayed
as

particularly
as
a

it
is
the
individual

that
will
energize
it
wang
said
the

is
open
to
people
of
all
ethnicities
she
said
the
reality
is
people
at
some
point
become
numb
to
numbers
wang
said
but
they
respond
to
the

and
they
respond
to

when
her

posted
a

story
last
month
about
true

christian

being
graffitied
with
swastikas
and
racial
slurs
wang
said
it
was
widely
shared
in
the
asian
american
pacific
islander
community
people
were
able
to
relate
to
it
because
they
went
to

there
or
they
lived
near
the

she
said
aaaj

help
those

being
the

you
sometimes
get
the
feeling

it

for

and
it
s
not
good
for

piper
said
at
a
press
conference
ab
was
the
california
bill
that
realigned
the
state
s
overcrowded
prison
system
shifting
responsibility
over
repeat
nonviolent
offenders
from
state
prisons
to
county
jails
researchers
of
the
law
say
that
while
mejia
may
have
been
a
beneficiary
his
actions
do
not
line
up
with
state
crime
trends
violent
crime
did
not
increase
as
a
result
of
ab
despite
law
enforcement
and
politicians
often
saying
otherwise
they
said
both
proponents
and
opponents
agree
even
less
research
exists
for
prop
a
voter
initiative
passed
in
that
reduced
certain
property
and
drug
charges
to
misdemeanors
as
upsetting
as
this
instance
was
and
as
problematic
as
it
was
if
we
were
to
throw
out
ab
as
a
result
of
this
incident
we
would
not
be
doing
empirically
based
policy
said
charis
kubrin
a
professor
of
criminology
at
uc
irvine
and
one
of
the
few
to
study
the
topic
in
depth
there
is
no
doubt
in
my
mind
that
ab
had
zero
impact
one
way
or
another
on
violent
crime
across
the
state
kubrin
and
uc
irvine
s
carroll
seron
oversaw
the
firstscientific
analysisof
ab
last
year
in
an
issue
of
the
annals
of
the
american
academy
of
political
and
social
science
focused
entirely
on
the
topic
few
other
impartial
reviews
of
the
law
exist
in
part
because
the
state
did
not
set
aside
money
for
studying
ab
and
any
statistics
are
managed
at
the
county
level
uc
irvine
s
findings
showed
that
while
ab
contributed
to
a
small
rise
in
property
crimes
mostly
auto
thefts
there
was
no
evidence
of
increases
in
assaults
rapes
murders
or
other
violent
crimes
as
a
result
of
the
reforms
california
s
crime
trends
matched
up
with
other
similar
states
that
did
not
implement
the
changes
there
s
so
many
other
things
that
cause
crime
rates
to
go
up
and
down
everything
from
drugs
to
guns
to

to

community
relations
to
equality

kubrin
said
the

similarly
found
no
effect
on
violent

as
a
result
of

ina

the

however

that

within
the

two
years
dropped
from

to

t

four

had
parole
violations
drunk
driving
charges
that
would
have
historically
resulted
in
them
going
back
to
state
prison
but
instead
only
resulted
in
flash
incarcerations
under
ab
and
prop
it
s
likely
that
both
of
these
offenders
were
just
as
the
whittier
shooter
was
back
on
the
streets
because
of
these
laws
he
said
flash
incarcerations
are
an
intermediate
sanction
introduced
by
ab
that
punishes
a
probationer
with
up
to
days
in

for

mejia

in

for
according
to

documents
l
a
county
s
office
of
county
counsel
still
is
reviewing
these
new
conditions
to
determine
if
the
sheriff
s
department
would
be
considered
compliant
said
l
a
county
assistant
sheriff
eddie
rivero
who
is
mcdonnell
s
point
person
on
immigration
matters
the
justice
department
declined
to
comment
specifically
on
the
sheriff
s
department
s
policies
one
of
the
new
conditions
requires
jurisdictions
to
allow
federal
immigration
officers
into
detention
facilities
while
the
sheriff
s
department
allows
u
s
immigration
and
customs
enforcement
access
to
interview
certain
inmates
in
jails
and
to
pick
them
up
at
the
time
of
their
release
it
restricts
the
agency
s
access
to
those
with
serious
offenses
specified
under
the
state
s
trust
act
though
it
s
not
required
to
do
so
the
sheriff
s
department
believes
that
limiting
ice
s
access
to
these
serious
offenders
helps
it
continue
to
build
trust
within
the
community
rivero
said
some
immigrant
rights
advocates
argue
the
sheriff
should
not
cooperate
with
ice
at
all
besides
the
byrne
jag
grants
sheriff
s
officials
say
they
re
concerned
that
similar
conditions
could
also
be
placed
on
other
federal
grant
programs
the
department
has
been
benefiting
from
if
so
a
justice
department
program
that
provides
some
reimbursement
to
state
and
local
governments
for
the
costs
of
incarcerating
undocumented
criminal
aliens
could
also
be
at
risk
grant
funds
benefiting
the
los

regional
human
trafficking
task
force
and
the
los

joint
regional
taskforce
which
is
a
regional
anti
terrorism
effort
might
also
be
impacted
officials
said
federal
grant
funding
is
critical
for
the
safety
of
our
communities
rivero
said
in
a
written
statement
the
loss
of
these
funds
would
be
detrimental
to
advancements
in
technology
the
fight
against
terrorism
narcotics
trafficking
human
trafficking
and
many
other
vital
programs
the
department
would
have
to
seek
other
sources
such
as
state
and
county
funding
if
these
funds
were
no
longer
available
rivero
said
complicating
matters
is
state
senate
bill
sometimes
referred
to
as
the
sanctuary
state
bill
which
would
prohibit
the
use
of
state
and
local
public
resources
to
aid
ice
agents
in
deportation
actions
that
bill
has
been
passed
by
the
state
senate
and
is
making
its
way
through
the
assembly

of

the

released
with
the

stated
but
given
los

size
and
its
persistent
race

disparities
the
work
of

and

continues
to
be
much
needed
l

across
seven
factors
crime

the

was
designated
in

for
all
categories
as
struggling
to
prosper
in
the
category
of
crime
and
justice
the
county
is
ranked
the
th
most
racially
disparate
in
the
state
said
john
kim
executive
director
of
the
advancement
project
california
out
of
the
seven
issue
areas
crime
and
justice
shows
us
to
be
the
area
of
greatest
racial
disparity
more
so
than
any
of
the
other
six
areas
kim
said
and
what
s
driving
crime
and
justice
to
the
most
disparate
is
due
to
racial
disparities
is
incarceration
and
fatalities
by

per

blacks
in

died
at
the

of

more

four
times

meanwhile

nearly

black

from

that

occurred
at

the

found

the
more

people
who
died
at
the
hands
of
police
in
eight

white

legal
battle
samantha
geimer
the
victim
in
the
filmmaker
s
statutory
rape
case
appeared
in
a
los
angeles
county
courtroom
in
june
and
asked
the
judge
to
drop
the
case
she
said
she
was
tired
of
the
media
spectacle
the
personal
anguish
and
the
never
ending
court
drama
on
friday
los
angeles
county
superior
court
judge
scott
gordon
denied
that
request
her
statement
is
dramatic
evidence
of
the
long
lasting
and
traumatic
effect
these
crimes
and
polanski
s
refusal
to
obey
court
orders
and
appear
for
sentencing
is
having
on
her
life
the
judge
wrote
in
his
page
decision
but
he
added
that
the
court
isn
t
obligated
to
dismiss
the
case
merely
because
it
would
be
in
the
victim
s
best
interest
in
his
ruling
gordon
sharply
rebuked
polanski
writing
that
his
fugitive
status
continues
to
harm
geimer
and
compounds
the
trauma
of
the
sexual
assault
committed
against
her
that
gave
rise
to
this
case
gordon
also
denied
polanski
s
latest
request
to
unseal
testimony
given
in
early
by
roger
gunson
the
original
prosecutor
in
the
case
the
testimony
was
properly
sealed
under
state
law
so
there
is
no
basis
by
which
this
court
can
revisit
that
question
gordon
wrote
gunson
gave
the
testimony
while
polanski
was
in
custody
in
switzerland
and
facing
extradition
to
the
u
s
the
director
was
ultimately
freed
after
swiss
officials
rejected
the
u
s
s
request
citing
the
mystery
surrounding
the
sealed
gunson
testimony
polanski
s
lawyers
have
long
contended
that
the
gunson
testimony
contains
crucial
details
about
a
plea
agreement
made
in
the
case
that
would
have
limited
the
filmmaker
s
sentence
to
time
he
served
at
a
chino
prison
the
director
pleaded
guilty
to
unlawful
sex
with
a
minor
and
was
sent
to
chino
for
a
day
diagnostic
evaluation
starting
in
late
he
was
released
after
spending
days
in
custody
based
on
the
recommendation
of
the
prison
but
when
it
appeared
that
judge
laurence
rittenband
wanted
to
send
him
back
to
jail
polanski
fled
the
u
s
for
europe
before
an
official
sentence
was
handed
down
harland
braun
polanski
s
u
s
attorney
said
friday
that
the
director
was
forced
to
flee
because
rittenband
was
dishonest
he
also
questioned
why
the
gunson
testimony
has
remained
sealed
it
s
a
public
proceeding
end
of
story
the
public
should
have
access
to
it
braun
said
in
an
interview
in
a
filing
on
friday
braun
reiterated
proposals
to
resolve
the
case
including
having
the
court
sentence
polanski
in
absentia
but
gordon
rejected
that
suggestion
in
april
stating
that
the
defendant
s
fugitive
status
disqualifies
him
from
seeking
relief
in
the
court
polanski
has
also
offered
to
return
to
l
a
and
appear
in
court
if
the
judge
sentences
him
first
although
mr
polanski
accepts
responsibility
for
his
conduct
he
believes
the
court
system
should
accept
some
responsibility
for
its
conduct
in
the
case
braun
wrote
in
the
filing
but
gordon
turned
down
those
suggestions
on
friday
without
issuing
a
written
opinion
braun
said
polanski
intends
to
continue
pursuing
the
case
by
taking
it
to
interpol
officials
in
europe
braun
said
the
filmmaker
is
hoping
to
convince
officials
in
lyon
france
that
they
should
not
honor
any
u
s
warrants
for
his
arrest
two
foreign
decisions
may
work
in
the
director
s
favor
the
swiss
decision
in
and
a
decision
by
polish
officials
last
year
to
reject
a
separate
u
s
extradition
request
perhaps
coincidentally
the
new
ruling
in

polanski

oscar

include
rosemary

he
and
his
team
are
working
to
promote
calm
amid
concerns
in
the
san
fernando
valley
over
the
possibility
of
mass
deportations
of
immigrants
many
don
t
understand
what
the
los
angeles
police
department
can
and
can
t
do
when
it
comes
to
dealing
with
undocumented
immigrants
and
are
concerned
with
hypothetical
future
scenarios
not
grounded
in
fact
said
green
who
is
commanding
officer
of
lapd
s
operations
valley
bureau
we
have
to
deal
with
reality
and
not
feed
into
hysteria
because
hysteria
is
not
good
for
anyone
green
said
in
the
wake
of
president
donald
trump
s
vows
to
deport
millions
of
undocumented
immigrants
and
amid
speculation
about
what
might
actually
happen
lapd
brass
have
been
visiting
houses
of
worship
and
interacting
with
community
members
to
get
the
word
out
about
the
agency
s
protocols
he
said
the
issue
is
also
expected
to
be
discussed
at
two
lapd
community
forums
in
the
san
fernando
valley
on
wednesday
tackling
themes
around
religion
and
immigration
los

police
do
not
conduct
administrative
enforcement
for
the
federal
government
because
it
needs
community
members
to
trust
them
call
them
and
testify
as
witnesses
in
order
to
prevent
crime
green
said
if
someone
is
guilty
of
a
violent
felony
and
there
s
a
warrant
in
the
system
or
a
court
order
then
los
angeles
police
are
mandated
to
hold
that
individual
for
the
federal
government
he
said
however
los
angeles
police
do
not
arrest
someone
for
a
misdemeanor
crime
and
hold
them
because
they
have
an
immigration
detainer
green
said
immigration
and
customs
enforcement
has
got
to
get
that
court
order
or
that
warrant
we
re
not
going
to
violate
someone
s
federal
rights
by
holding
them
longer
than
we
legally
can
so
the
federal
government
can
pick
them
up
he
said
when
asked
what
the
police
department
would
do
if
the
federal
government
tried
to
compel
them
to
hand
over
lower
level
offenders
green
declined
to
entertain
the
thought
let
s
just
deal
with
facts
and
things
that
are
in
front
of
us
he
said
he
also
noted
that
it
was
his
belief
that
mass
deportations
would
not
happen
and
that
this
will
settle
down
at
the
end
of
the
day
he
cautioned
that
actions
are
different
than
rhetoric
and
argued
there
are
enough
checks
and
balances
in
place
we
have
three
branches
of

we
already
see
them
working
effectively
together

said

i

that

the

who
are

from

los

meet
up

that

it

garcetti

during

at

on

we

have
happened
on

a
while
back
and
we
were
able
to
break
up
one
ring
but
we
don
t
think
that
these
ones
are
a
single
ring
or
any
connection

hankel
offered
suggestions
on
how
to
deter
thieves
such
as
using
video
cameras
motion
sensors
alarm
systems
and
the
like
these
criminals
tend
to
be
nonconfrontational
when
they

and
usually
flee

interestingly
knock
knock
rings
can
involve

gangs

territorial
hankel
said
for
this

they
ll
cross
territories
to
group
up
to
have
enough

at

on
an

we

have
happened
on

a
while
back
and
we
were
able
to
break
up
one

we
don

think
that
these

are
a

hankel
offered
suggestions
on
how
to
deter
thieves
such
as
using
video
cameras
motion

alarm
systems
and
the
like
these
criminals
tend
to
be
nonconfrontational
when
they

confronted
by

interestingly
knock

working

gangs
are
usually
territorial
hankel
said
for
this
issue
they
ll
cross
territories
to
group
up
to
have
enough
people
to
go
and
commit
these

they
even
have
a

that
they
use

no

it
was
a

for
days
she
said
on
tuesday
police
and
federal
agents
warned
that
so
called
virtual
kidnappings
are
on
the
rise
and
dozens
of
people
already
have
found
themselves
terrorized
into
giving
money
to
con
artists
los

police
alone
have
received
more
than

of
such
crimes
in

by

actual

ransom
are
rare
los

police
typically
receive
to
cases
a
year
including
kidnappings
performed
by
other
family
members
and
acquaintances
hayes
said
in
the
fake
kidnappings
the
callers
demand
that
the
victims
remain
on
the
phone
so
they
don
t
have
a
chance
to
call
their
loved
ones
officials
said

division
in

many
of

unreported
he
said
it
s
fair
to
say
there
have
been
thousands
of
calls
made
to
u
s
victims
primarily
from
mexico
he
said
last
week
a
texas
woman
became
the
first
person
in
the
nation
to
be
indicted
in
connection
with
a
virtual

scheme
yanette

is
charged
with
wire
fraud
conspiracy
to
commit
wire
fraud
and
conspiracy
to
launder
money
she
is
facing
up
to
years
in
prison
for
each
of
counts
if
convicted
the
indictment
alleges
that
acosta
and
her
partners
used
mexican
telephone
numbers
to
call
people
in
texas
california
and
idaho
they
allegedly
fooled
people
into
giving
them
tens
of
thousands
of
dollars
either
through
money
drops
or
wire
transfers
in
some
cases
the
scammers
choose
area
codes
and
make
cold
calls
hoping
to
catch
an
unsuspecting
victim
officials
said
in
others
the
crooks
may
use
social
media
to
obtain
names
of
children
and
other
facts
that
can
be
used
to
frighten
specific
victims
in
sobel
s
case
she
believes
the
phony
kidnappers
obtained
her
daughter
s
voice
perhaps
from
her
voicemail
and
then
altered
it
i
was
convinced
that
this
was

california

the
right

this
is
something
that
needs
to
be
done
nationwide
as
the
former

of
these
united

i
know
from
experience
immigrants
even
when
they
are
victims
of
crime
or
witnesses
to
criminal
acts
often
fear
interacting
with
local
law
enforcement
officers
when
those
officers
also
engage
in

more

more

it

not
fewer
we

holder

under

constitution
states
have
the
power
over
the
health
and
safety
of
their
residents

the
allocation
of
state
resources
despite
statements
from
the
trump
administration
suggesting
that
laws
similar
to
the
california
values
act
are
somehow
unconstitutional
the
act
is
a
core
exercise
of
california
s
authority
beck
said
it
s
crucial
to
ensure
that
witnesses
to
crimes
aren
t
deterred
from
sharing
information
with
police
because
they
fear
deportation
we
do
not
want
to
lose
trust
because
we
believe
trust
is
the
most
important
thing
in
policing
beck
said
the
ability
to
get
witnesses
to
come
forward
the
ability
to
get
victims
to
come
forward
can
be
severely
detrimented
by
civil
enforcement
of
immigration
by
local
authorities
this
is
not
a
soft
on
crime
bill
he
added
we
depend
on
our
communities
particularly
our
immigrant
communities
to
cooperate
with
us
not

to
keep
them

to
keep

californians
of
pretty
much
all
walks
of
life
agree
the
state
s
criminal
justice
system
has
been
broken
for
decades
for
at
least
years
it
was
commonplace
for
lawmakers
to
churn
out
tough
crime
policy
that
drove
prison
populations
and
budgets
up
and
starved
investments
in
crime
prevention
and
rehabilitation
excessive
imprisonment
and
prison
spending
delivered
high
recidivism
rates
and
destabilized
communities
far
more
than
they
delivered
any
public
safety
benefit
taxpayers
now
spend
billions
on
a
behemoth
set
of
criminal
justice
bureaucracies
that
are
largely
ill
equipped
to
effectively
stop
crime
cycles
or
prevent
crime
in
the
first
place
voters
are
well
aware
of
this
structural
problem
and
overwhelming
majorities
approved
various
recent
justice
reforms
to
begin
changing
course
there
is
still
a
long
way
to
go
despite
strong
data
on
what
works
better
than
incarceration
first
policies
community
outreach
and
law
enforcement
partnerships
risk
based
graduated
sanctions
supervised
probation
combined
with
substance
abuse
treatment
behavioral
health
courts
and
more
most
justice
systems
remain
stuck
in
the
dysfunctional
practices
of
the
past
there
is
perhaps
no
greater
responsibility
of
local
government
than
protecting
public
safety
yet
too
often
public
officials
are
quick
to
respond
to
public
safety
problems
by
questioning
justice
reforms
instead
of
completing
what
those
reforms
started
the
long
overdue
task
of
replacing
the
broken
justice
system
with
evidenced
based
community
safety
solutions
the
recent
proposal
from
los
angeles
county
supervisors
kathryn
barger
and
janice
hahn
is
familiar
in
that
regard
today
the
board
of
supervisors
will
deliberate
on
their
proposal
to
establish
a
commission
tasked
with
examining
the
impacts
of
recent
justice
reforms
on
public
safety
in
los
angeles
county
namely
those
enacted
under
propositions
and
and
assembly
bill
undercutting
recent
reforms
instead
of
addressing
decades
old
dysfunctional
and
imbalanced
approaches
to
safety
is
a
missed
opportunity
public
safety
challenges
in
los
angeles
are
real
and
must
be
addressed
however
the
question
is
not
what
s
wrong
with
reforms
attempting
to
correct
problems
but
what
the
county
can
do
to
effectively
effectuate
recent
reforms
and
go
even
farther
looking
beyond
tradition
officials
will
find
that
community
leaders
and
crime
experts
alike
have
known
for
many
years
what
works
powerful
and
effective
programs
like
the
watts
gang
task
force
where
law
enforcement
and
community
street
intervention
teams
work
together
to
address
violence
at
the
neighborhood
level
or
the
community
collaborative
court
in
compton
that
combines
case
management
with
treatment
and
court
supervision
or
the
long
beach
trauma
recovery
center
that
s
providing
wrap
around
support
for
crime
victims
and
their
families
reducing
crime
and
empowering
communities
in
the
process
scaling
these
types
of
programs
as
well
as
investing
in
the
county
s
substance
abuse
and
mental
health
treatment
infrastructure
and
transitional
housing
and
job
training
for
people
exiting

full
text
on
the
last
day
of
february
in
chaos
erupted
in
the
block
of
laurel
canyon
boulevard
in
north
hollywood
as
two
men
tried
to
shoot
their
way
through
police
after
robbing
a
bank
of
america
branch
myself
and
then
colleague
jaxon
van
derbeken
ended
up
in
the
midst
of
a
story
that
terrorized
the
east
valley
for
hours
and
went
viral
nationally
it
would
become
known
as
the
north
hollywood
shootout
i
was
covering
business
and
van
derbeken
had
the
cops
beat
the
job
dictated
that
i
got
in
earlier
and
as
usual
the
televisions
were
tuned
in
to
local
news
channels
shortly
after
a
m
they
all
began
broadcasting
an
unbelievable
scene
two
heavily
armed
men
in
body
armor
and
firing
assault
rifles
were
in
a
pitch
gunfight
with
los
angeles
police
department
officers
who
were
heavily
outgunned
wilcox
get
over
there
an
editor
yelled
it
seemed
like
i
made
it
from
woodland
hills
to
north
hollywood
in
record
time
police
had
sealed
off
the
streets
near
the
crime
scene
but
i
was
able
to
get
past
the
police
barriers
and
found
a
parking
stop
on
ben
avenue
just
south
of
victory
boulevard
about
two
blocks
south
of
the
bank
and
gunbattle
it
was
a
chaotic
scene
with
streets
blocked
by
police
cars
firetrucks
and
tv
and
radio
station
vans
authorities
had
closed
hollywood
freeway
and
streets
in
the
community
were
jammed
most
of
the
businesses
in
the
area
had
been
evacuated
and
people
milled
about
several
blocks
away
in
places
that
had
been
deemed
safe
the
bank
is
at
the
southeast
corner
of
laurel
canyon
and
archwood
street
and
i
ran
north
on
agnes
avenue
then
west
on
kittridge
street
to
try
get
as
close
to
the
scene
as
possible
i
cobbled
together
some
information
and
went
looking
for
a
pay
phone
to
relay
info
back
to
the
newsroom
since
the
cellular
craze
had
not
yet
arrived
i
knew
there
were
pay
phones
at
the
strip
mall
across
from
the
bank
on
laurel
but
because
of
the
nearly
rounds
fired
and
the
bodies
of
the
dead
robbers
emil
matasareanu
and
larry
phillips
were
still
at
the
scene
police
would
not
let
anyone
go
on
the
mall
the
area
was
swarming
with
what
looked
like
several
hundred
police
officers
it
is
nothing
short
of
full
scale
military
battle
facing
this
kind
of
thing
said
bill
rehder
at
the
time
the
bank
robbery
coordinator
for
the
fbi
s
los
angeles
office
said
during
a
briefing
i
ve
never
seen
anything
like
it
there
hasn
t
been
anything
like
it
i
went
back
up
to
victory
to
find
a
phone
but
they
were
either
broken
or
in
use
so
i
went
into
a
home
improvement
near
where
my
car
was
parked
and
asked
owner
rick
moran
if
i
could
use
his
phone
and
work
out
of
the
store
he
said
yes
and
he
still
remembers
our
visit
years
later
today
the
shop
looks
just
like
it
did
then
packed
with
screens
doors
glass
panes
hardware
and
door
grills
that
was
the
day
everything
closed
down
i
knew
you
didn
t
have
a
cell
phone
and
needed
a
base
i
wasn
t
going
to
have
any
business
so
i
said
come
on
in
moran
recalled
during
a
visit
to
his
shop
last
week
you
did
most
of
your
work
on
the
phone
he
happened
to
listen
to
a
police
scanner
while
he
worked
and
heard
all
the
chatter
about
the
siege
while
watching
the
scene
unfold
on
his
store
s
television
set
there
was
a
wind
blowing
that
day
and
i
could
smell
gun
smoke
he
recalled
i
called
the
city
desk
dictated
my
notes
and
gave
them
the
store
s
address
so
van
derbeken
could
find
me
and
phone
his
stuff
in
the
sound
on
the
office
televisions
was
off
when
the
shooting
started
but
some
news
crews
at
the
scene
had
audio
they
played
it
back
for
us
and
it
was
terrifying
van
derbeken
and
i
thought
the
death
toll
would
be
in
at
least
double
figures
every
time
we
left
the
store
there
was
a
sense
of
unease
because
police
thought
the
two
robbers
who
had
with
five
assault
rifles
might
have
accomplices
people
in
the
area
were
visibly
shaken
and
they
repeatedly
asked
me
what
had
happened
and
how
many
people
had
been
killed
information
traveled
slower
back
then
and
we
would
not
learn
much
until
later
that
night
at
one
point
in
the
afternoon
a
swat
team
assembled
behind
a
white
parking
structure
on
agnes
and
victory
and
began
methodically
moving
toward
a
house
where
someone
thought
they
saw
a
man
hiding
under
a
blue
tarp
myself
and
a
tv
reporter
followed
behind
keeping
an
eye
on
the
officers
and
looking
for
places
to
hide
if
shooting
did
break
out
but
they
didn
t
find
anything
turned
out
that
the
wind
moran
mentioned
earlier
had
been
ruffling
the
tarp
van
derbeken
and
i
got
periodic
updates
from
police
throughout
the
day
but
did
not
see
each
other
until
about
p
m
when
the
lapd
held
their
last
press
conference
of
the
day
the
toll
wounded
police
officers
and
six
civilians
the
bad
guys
were
the
only
ones
killed
moran
said
he
was
closing
the
shop
around
p
m
and
the
last
call
i
made
from
there
was
to
my
wife
she
had
seen
me
following
the
swat
team
on
television
and
she
was
not
happy
what
were
you
thinking
you
could
have
been
shot
don

ever
do

again

the
to

to

the
commission
came
after
some
soul
searching
among
some
supervisors
who
heard
almost
people
speak
at
the
board
meeting
downtown
to
express
views
for
and
against
the
need
for
a
commission
on
public
safety
most
in
favor
included
mayors
police
chiefs
and
businesses
leaders
from
across
the
county
s
cities
who
said
while
such
reforms
such
as
ab
as
well
as
voter
approved
propositions
and
were
forged
with
intention
to
save
money
by
alleviating
overcrowded
prisons
there
were
no
safety
nets
in
place
to
steer
low
level
offenders
into

treatment
anger
management
and
mental
health
services
as
a
result
they
say
drug
use
homelessness
and
related
crimes
all
have
increased
while
developed
with
good
intentions
the
legislation
may
have
created
unintended
consequences
and
places
our
first
responders
at
risk
said
los
angeles
county
sheriff
jim
mcdonnell
we
have
an
obligation
to
be
the
best
we
could
be
it
s
not
about
politics
but
about
public
safety
but
those
opposed
to
it
included
members
of
community
programs
that
help
former
offenders
with
jobs
and
education
such
as
the
well
known
homeboy
industries
members
of
such
groups
cautioned
the
board
that
forming
a
commission
that
favored
law
enforcement
tips
the
balance
away
from
criminal
justice
reform
we
believe
we
should
be
looking
forward
not
backward
said
alex
johnson
the
managing
director
for
californians
for
safety
and
justice
the
group
behind
the
creation
of
proposition
known
as
the
safe
neighborhoods
and
schools
act
proposition
allows
six
nonviolent
felonies
such
as
simple
drug
possession
or
petty
theft
under
to
be
changed
to
misdemeanors
on
old
criminal
records
but
critics
charge
without
the
threat
of
incarceration
too
many
people
are
skipping
drug
treatment
public
safety
challenges
in
l
a
county
are
real
and
must
be
addressed
but
it
is
irresponsible
to
blame
everything
but
the
weather
on
reforms
johnson
acknowledged
but
said
the
blue
ribbon
commission
is
not
the
right
solution
this
commission
will
be
nonproductive
he
said
reforms
like
proposition
are
more
popular
than
ever
the
seed
for
the
formation
of
the
commission
on
public
safety
formed
in
february
when
supervisors
kathryn
barger
and
janice
hahn
called
for
an
investigation
into
the
fatal
shooting
of
whittier
police
officer
keith
boyer
by
suspect
michael
christopher
mejia
mejia
is
a
known
gang
member
who
also
is
suspected
of
shooting
a
relative
before
gunning
down
boyer
in
and
out
of
prison
for
several
crimes
mejia
was
released
and
under
parole
when
he
shot
boyer
his
release
was
seen
by
the
public
as
a
breach
in
the
provisions
of
ab
an
early
release
initiative
signed
by
gov
jerry
brown
in
barger
and
hahn
introduced
the
motion
to
form
the
blue
ribbon
commission
to
explore
solutions
to
restore
the
lives
of
the
individuals
entangled
in
the
justice
system
the
commission
would
be
made
up
of
members
of
law
enforcement
as
well
as
business
leaders
but
after
hearing
public
criticism
about
the
lack
of
involvement
of
community
groups
hahn
and
supervisor
solis
amended
the
motion
to
include
community
leaders
supervisor
mark
ridley
thomas
who
abstained
had
hoped
the
board
would
postpone
the
vote
until
next
week
to
consider
the
testimony
raised
supervisor
sheila
kuehl
was
absent
tuesday
but
barger
said
the
commission
was
needed
not
to
favor
law
enforcement
but
to
start
collecting
data
on
arrests
and
on
those
released
early
the
motion
is
not
intended
to
divide
but
to
unite
those
with
common
goals
barger
said
rehabilitation
works
when
people
are
required
to
access
them
we
have
people
getting
arrested
and
re
arrested
hahn
said
while
criminal
justice
reform
was
needed
because
of
overcrowded
prisons
she
was
disappointed
with
the
lack
of
transparency
from
the
state
into
who
is
being
released
and
if
the
system
is
working
the
investigation
into
mejia
who
was
under
the
supervision
of
the
los
angeles
county
probation
department
remains
classified
and
confidential
and
has
not
been
released
to
the
public
hahn
said
i
think
the
public
has
a
right
to
see
these
findings
and
i
for
one
believe
we
should
release
it
hahn
said
i
know
it
may
be
more
complicated
but
we
should
not
be
afraid
of
the
truth
both
the
classified
report
and
result
of
this
blue
ribbon
commission
should
be
made
public
probation
chief
terri
mcdonald
told
the
board
she
could
not
comment
on
why
the
report
is
confidential
because
it
was
part
of
a
criminal
investigation
two
men
were
charged
with
attempted
murder
tuesday
in
the
stabbing
of
a
man
who
works
as
a
bodyguard
for
a
nationally

popular
among

monday
gionet

gionet
said
law

officials
flatly
dismissed
the
claim
prosecutors
did
not
file
a
hate
crime
enhancement
with
the
charges
ardalani
said
lt
saul
rodriguez
a
santa
monica
police
department
spokesman
said
the
attack
was
spurred
by
an
argument
there
s
nothing
here
that
would
lead
us
to
believe
it
was
targeted
or
a
hate
crime
or
anything
like
that
rodriguez
said
khodzhasaryan
and
bekverdyan
were
leaving
the
parking
structure
and
trying
to
call
for
a
parking
attendant
to
help
them
operate
the
gate
about
p
m
saturday
when
the
victim
made
a
comment
to
the
suspects
which
led
to
an
argument
rodriguez
said
all
three
men
got
out
of
their
vehicles
and
a
fistfight
erupted
rodriguez
said
the
suspects
fled
a
short
time
later
and
the
victim
realized
he
had
been
stabbed
rodriguez
said
the

californians
of
pretty
much
all
walks
of
life
agree
the
state
s
criminal
justice
system
has
been
broken
for
decades
for
at
least
years
it
was
commonplace
for
lawmakers
to
churn
out
tough
crime
policy
that
drove
prison
populations
and
budgets
up
and
starved
investments
in
crime
prevention
and
rehabilitation
excessive
imprisonment
and
prison
spending
delivered
high
recidivism
rates
and
destabilized
communities
far
more
than
they
delivered
any
public
safety
benefit
taxpayers
now
spend
billions
on
a
behemoth
set
of
criminal
justice
bureaucracies
that
are
largely
ill
equipped
to
effectively
stop
crime
cycles
or
prevent
crime
in
the
first
place
voters
are
well
aware
of
this
structural
problem
and
overwhelming
majorities
approved
various
recent
justice
reforms
to
begin
changing
course
there
is
still
a
long
way
to
go
despite
strong
data
on
what
works
better
than
incarceration
first
policies
community
outreach
and
law
enforcement
partnerships
risk
based
graduated
sanctions
supervised
probation
combined
with
substance
abuse

behavioral

and
more
most
justice
systems
remain
stuck

long

city
prosecutor
doug

said
everyone
agrees
that
if
these
services
are
successful
then
this
is
a
program
that
will
reduce
crime
and
improve
public
safety
in
the
communities
affected
the
program
is
funded
by
a
million
state
grant
of
which
long

has
so
far
received
about
proponents
expect
about
people
will
receive
help
over
the
month
pilot
haubert
said
this
represents
a
rare
example
of
different
law
enforcement
agencies
collaborating
closely
to
solve
a
problem
agencies
and
departments
in
los
angeles
county
are
partnering
including
several
police
departments
the
district
attorney
s
office
the
office
of
diversion
and
reentry
and
the
office
of
the
public
defender
a
team
from
cal
state
long
beach
will
also
be
evaluating
the
county
program
over
the
two
years
it
will
be
running
long
beach
was
included
in
the
grant
because
it
already
had
a
similar
diversion
program
for
women
detained
for
prostitution
the
directed
services
program
has
shown
to
be
effective
in
helping
women
break
away
from
the
influence
of
pimps
and
get
out
of
prostitution
officials
said
long
beach
has
a
pretty
deep
understanding
of
what
it
actually
takes
to
support
people
in
this
population
because
of
their
experience
said
shoshanna
scholar
who
will
be
overseeing
the
lead
program
in
los
angeles
county
the
idea
for
the
county
program
originated
in
seattle
in
as
a
result
of
the
city
not
having
enough
money
to
continue
prosecuting
low
level
drug
offenders
during
the
recession
there
was
also
contention
about
the
extreme
racial
disparity
in
low
level
drug
arrests
percent
of
those
arrested
for
low
level
drug
possession
or
sales
were
black
in
a
city
that
only
had
an
percent
black
population
according
to
kris
nyrop
who
was
part
of
the
group
that
started
lead
we
said
what
if
we
could
take
what
is
almost
uniformly
a
bad
experience
getting
arrested
and
going
to
jail
and
change
it
into
something
that
was
potentially
positive
for
the
individual
and
what
if
that
actually
resulted
in
better
outcomes
for
the
community
and
what
if
it
was
cheaper
said
nyrop
who
is
now
the
national
director
of
the
lead
national
support
bureau
the
program
proved
to
be
effective
in
reducing
criminal
recidivism
rates
in
a
study
conducted
by
an
independent
team
of
evaluators
from
the
university
of
washington
the
results
surprised
even
the
creators
of
the
program
people
who
were
diverted
were
percent
less
likely
to
be
arrested
on
a
new
charge
have
fewer
long
term
felony
charges
spend
fewer
days
in
jail
and
are
percent
less
likely
to
be
incarcerated
later
costs
associated
with
arrests
and
prosecution
were
also
reduced
since
other
lead
and
lead
like
programs
have
started
and
continue
to
develop
all
over
the
us
san
francisco
also
received
a
million
grant
from
the
state
to
start
a
pilot
lead
program
the
program
here
will
run
similar
to
the
one
in
seattle
with
some
differences
based
on
state
laws
and
other
factors
before
booking
offenders
who
meet
the
criteria
for
the
program
will
be
referred
by
police
officers
the
eligible
individuals
can
decide
if
they
want
to
participate
or
be
booked
and
prosecuted
if
they
decide
to
participate
they
will
be
assigned
a
case
manager
who
does
a
brief
assessment
and
asks
them
what
their
immediate
needs
are
participants
can
also
come
through
the
social
contact
door
meaning
they
can
be
referred
by
someone
in
the
community
this
was
added
because
in
seattle
police
officers
were
finding
that
people
were
willing
to
implicate
themselves
in
drug
offenses
in
order
to
get
the
help
they
needed
officials
said
they
don
t
expect
an
overnight
change
in
those
who
are
diverted
recovery
is
usually
a
long
process
and
they
expect
relapses
but
it
does
not
automatically
kick
them
out
of
the
program
a
lot
of
people
have
very
unrealistic
expectations
about
fixing
people
and
they
think
that
you
ought
to
be
able
to
fix
people
quickly
nyrop
said
the
reality
is
that
if
you
ve
been
homeless
for
something
years
and
you
have
mental
health
issues
and
you
have
chemical
dependency
or
substance
use
issues
there
is
not
going
to
be
an
easy
or
quick
solution

lebron
james
issued
a
searing
and
personal
response
to
the
discovery
of
racist
graffiti
spray
painted
outside
his
los
angeles
home
early
wednesday
using
a
news
conference
to
deliver
a
somber
soliloquy
about
race
in
america
on
the
eve
of
the
nba
finals
james
explicitly
placed
his
social
standing
as
the
world
s
best
basketball
player
ahead
of
preparation
for
perhaps
the
most
anticipated
series
of
his
career
i
think
back
to
emmett
till
s
mom
actually
james
said
that
s
one
of
the
first
things
i
thought
of
the
reason
she
had
an
open
casket
was
that
she
wanted
to
show
the
world
what
her
son
went
through
as
far
as
a
hate
crime
and
being
black
in
america
no
matter
how
much
money
you
have
no
matter
how
famous
you
are
no
matter
how
many
people
admire
you
being
black
in
america
is
tough
we
ve
got
a
long
way
to
go
for
us
as
a
society
and
for
us
as
african
americans
until
we
feel
equal
in
america
police
said
a
racial
slur
had
been
spray
painted
across
the
front
gate
of
a
home
james
owns
in
los
angeles
the
lapd
said
it
would
investigate
the
vandalism
as
a
hate
crime
and
examine
security
camera
footage
from
nearby
homes
to
identify
a
suspect
james
lives
in
the
house
in
the
offseason
and
he
and
his
family
were
not
living
in
the
home
at
the
time
james
said
his
family
is
safe
and
that
s
most
important
but
the
crime
visibly
rattled
him
at
his
news
conference
at
oracle
arena
where
his
cleveland
cavaliers
will
open
their
title
defense
in
a
third
consecutive
finals
meeting
with
the
golden
state
warriors
on
thursday
night
james
appeared
shaken
but
resolute
he
wore
a
white
t
shirt
emblazoned
with
a
photo
of
muhammad
ali
s
face
he
measured
his
words
and
frequently
paused
to
swallow
hard
james
also
seized
the
incident
as
an
opportunity
to
prove
how
extensive
racism
remains
in
america
if
somebody
of
james
stature
is
not
immune
to
a
potential
hate
crime
james
reasoned
the
graffiti
showed
the
pervasiveness
of
hate
in
that
way
he
welcomed
the
maliciousness
as
i
sit
here
on
the
eve
of
one
of
the
greatest
sporting
events
that
we
have
in
sports
race
and
what
s
going
on
comes
again
and
on
my
behalf
and
on
my
family
s
behalf
james
said
but
i
look
at
it
as
if
this
can
shed
light
and
continue
to
keep
the
conversation
going
on
my
behalf
then
i
m
ok
with
it
it
just
goes
to
show
that
racism
will
always
be
a
part
of
the
world
a
part
of
america
hate
in
america
especially
for
african
americans
is
with
them
every
day
even
though
it
s
concealed
most
of
the
time
people
hide
their
faces
say
things
about
you
when
they
see
you
they
smile
in
your
face
it
s
alive
every
single
day
surprising
no
james
later
added
in
an
interview
with
espn
i
still
understand
how
race
plays
a
part
in
america
for
me
to
be
here
and
have
to
answer
questions
about
racism
it
just
lets
me
know
that
it
s
still
here
and
we
should
all
know
that
if
it
takes
for
someone
to
spray
my
gate
and
use
that
derogatory
term
that
hate
on
my
family
to
shed
a
light
on
what
the
real
issue
is
in
the
world
then
so
be
it
while
james
has
become
a
willing
megaphone
for
social
causes
in
the
second
decade
of
his
career
he
had
difficulty
processing
the
potential
effect
on
his
family
the
primary
source
of
his
consternation
he
said
was
being
away
from
his
three
children
a
daughter
and
two
sons
the
most
unfortunate
part
is
that
i
can
t
be
home
right
now

targeting
ms
a
gang
that
started
in
los

but
has
expanded
to
nearly
every

and
el
salvador
the
gang
is
blamed
for
horrific
violence
that
has
sent
salvadoran
immigrants
fleeing
that
country
for
the
united
states
because
of
the
group
s
propensity
for
violence
federal

local
agencies
used
tactical
and
swat
teams
to

some
of

strip
of
dilapidated

near

the

more

half
of
those
arrested

charged
in

are

illegally
fike

it

they
are
from
los

police

immigration
status
was
of
little

these

they
are
going
to
go
to
prison
beck
said
if
they
ever
get
out
their
immigration

may
become
an
issue

it
has
nothing
to
do

the
disturbing
incident
that
occurred
in

she
said
that
the
council
provides
an
important
service
in
the
community
we
can
call
the
police
and
i
did
and
they
ll
just
take
a
report
she
said
but
i
knew
we
had
someone
to
turn
to
and
that
s
what
these
folks
do
best
they
look
at
the
bigger
picture
to
create
understanding
between
communities
han
s
nonprofit
organization
was
founded
in
in
part
to
raise
money
and
develop
programs
overseen
by
the
orange
county
human
relations
commission
the
council
works
with
law
enforcement
agencies
compiles
an
annual
hate
crime
report
and
provides
mediation
and
violence
prevention
programs
in
partnerships
with
schools
corporations
cities
foundations
and
individuals
we
try
to
be
a
voice
of
reason
and
listen
han
said
and
we
re
committed
to
getting
people
from
all
sides
to
come
together
the
council
has
raised
about
million
in
the
last
years
to
support
the
county
commission
s
work
according
to
its
website
but
until
recently
the
council
was
in
danger
of
losing
the
funding
that
pays
for
three
members
of
its
staff
including
han
for
months
county
supervisors
debated
back
and
forth
threatening
to
cut
the
needed
to
pay
for
the
council
s
personnel
while
the
group
received
an
eviction
notice
to
vacate
the
county
building
where
it
has
operated
rent
free
by
july
meanwhile
the
number
of
reported
hate
crimes
increased
to
in
from
the
year
before
with
african
americans
and
the
lgbt
population
as
the
two
most
frequently
targeted
communities
across
the
county
according
to
the
council
s
latest
report
this
trend
coupled
with
the
fear
that
orange
county
could
lose
its
human
relations
advocates
prompted
more
than
supporters
to
swarm
supervisors
meetings
this
month
pushing
to
allow
the
two
groups
to
continue
their
partnership
among
the
proponents
praising
the
groups
anti
bullying
interfaith
and
mediation
campaigns
was
orange
county
sheriff
sandra
hutchens
who
said
there
is
a
lot
of
fear
in
our
immigrant
and
lgbtq
communities
this
is
an
important
public
safety
and
quality
of
life
issue
for
us
the
board
voted
to
last
week
with
supervisor
michelle
steel
dissenting
to
continue
funding
the
council
for
at
least
another
year
but
the
panel
also
urged
the
council
and
commission
to
stop
co
mingling
with
one
supervisor
noting
that
some
commission
staff
members
report
to
the
council
s
director
supervisor
andrew
do
the
most
vocal
opponent
before
the
vote
criticized
the
confusion
between
the
operations
of
the
council
and
commission
saying
it
raises
questions
about
accountability
and
leaves
the
board
vulnerable
to
violations
of
state
public
meeting
laws
the
public
has
to
be
clear
on
the
two
entities
right
now
they
re
so
intertwined
people
don
t
know
who
s
responsible
for
what
and
as
supervisors
we
don
t
know
what
s
going
on
at

later

to
allocate
the
money
because
the
work

he
said
people
around

spitzer
blamed
the
county
for
initially
pressuring
the
nonprofit
to
raise
funds
for
commission
programs
at
a
time
when
orange
county
faced
a
bankruptcy
scandal
he
said
the
board
must
choose
whether
to
give
money
to
programs
and
control
its
delivery
or
allow
the
nonprofit
to
continue
finding
revenue
commission

nothing
more
than

onto

s

for
a
criminal
felony
when
the
attacker
conspires
to
have
an

it
also
would

criminalizing

dababneh

this

why
jordan
s

is
so
important
we
need
to
make
clear

the

thursday
the

came
in

by
the
american

that
sought
a

worth
of

millions

from

to

educate
the
public
on
the
risks
to

posed
by

in
the

a
unanimous
supreme
court
ordered
a

to
consider
methods
to
make
the

anonymous
and
determine
whether
any
of
those
efforts
would
require
its

jennifer

assistant
county
counsel
for

said
in
a
statement
that
the
county
was
concerned
that
even
making
the

anonymous
could
pose
unique
and
unintended
problems
she
said
it
would
raise
those
concerns
in
detail
when

enforcement
agencies
nationwide
are

attached
to

the

the

is
passed
through
databases
to
instantly
check
whether
the
car
or
driver
has
been
linked
to

officials
say
the
scans
are
useful
in
tracking
stolen
vehicles
missing
children
and
people
wanted
by
police
for

authorities
chasing
a

in

the
systems
overwhelmingly
capture
innocent
drivers

information
about
their
locations
that
could
be
used
to
track
their
habits
and
whereabouts
the
aclu
and
electronic
frontier
foundation
said
the
agencies
hold
the
data
for
years
allowing
officers
to
use
it
in
future
investigations
the
state
supreme
court
rejected
a
lower
court
s
decision
that
the
scans
are
part
of
law
enforcement
investigations
and
therefore
exempt
from
disclosure
the
justices
said
the
scans
were
not
conducted
as
part
of
a
targeted
inquiry
into
any
particular
crime
or
crimes
it
is
hard
to
imagine
that
the
legislature
intended
for
the
records
of
investigations
exemption
to
reach
the
large
volume
of
data
that
plate
scanners
and
other
similar
technologies
now
enable
agencies
to
collect
indiscriminately

wrote
for
the
court
peter
bibring
a
senior
staff
attorney
at
the
aclu
of
southern
california
said
that
part
of
the
ruling
was
key
the
court
recognized
that
technology
does
make
a
difference
and
the
exemption
for
police
investigations
wasn
t
intended
to
encompass
the
kind
of
indiscriminate
collection
of
information
that
license
plate
readers
make
possible
today
he
said
bibring
said
the
aclu
wants
to
see
whether
law
enforcement
agencies
in
los
angeles
are
focusing
license
plate
readers
on
lower
income
communities
of
color
or
communities
of
a
particular
religious
persuasion
the
court
however
said
the
raw
data
would
fall
into
a
catchall
exemption
under
the
state
s
public
records
act
that
allows
agencies
not
to
disclose
records
when
the
public
interest
in
not
releasing
them
clearly
outweighs
the
interest
in
disclosing
them
but
the
justices
strongly
signaled
there
were
ways
to
redact
the
data
to
avoid
that
concern
and
sent
the
case
back
to
a
lower
court
bibring
said
he
was
confident
the
lower
court
would
be
able
to
release
the

in

local

officials
on
saturday
expressed
support
and
cautious
optimism
for
the
measure
that
would
provide
protections
for
illegal
immigrants
sb
recognizes
what
has
worked
in
los
angeles
for
nearly
four
decades
los
angeles
police
chief
charlie
beck
said
we
have
reduced
crime
by
building
strong
partnerships
with
our
communities
regardless
of
civil
immigration
status
we
are
committed
to
reducing
crime
through
community
partnerships
and
constitutional
policing
and
sb
enables
us
to
continue
abiding
by
these
effective
principles
beck
said
los
angeles
county
sheriff
jim
mcdonnell
said
the
revised
bill
will
preserve
his
department
s
ability
to
maintain
partnerships
with
federal
law
enforcement
in
the
fight
against
gangs
drugs
and
human
trafficking
i
strongly
opposed
sb
as
initially
introduced
because
i
viewed
it
as
a
threat
to
public
safety
mcdonnell
said
saturday
sb
as
passed
by
the
legislature
is
a
very
different
bill
today
thanks
to
the
leadership
of
governor
brown
and
his
staff
and
members
of
the
state
senate
and
assembly
we
can
move
beyond
the
bill
s
early
false
premise
that
local
enforcement
was
going
to
act
as
immigration
agents
this
is
fundamentally
not
true
the
bill
known
as
the
california
values
act
provides
protections
for
immigrants
who
are
in
the
country
illegally
but
also
was
altered
recently
at
the
request
of
brown
to
give
local
law
enforcement
more
freedom
to
work
with
federal
immigration
officials
and
to
hold
individuals
for
federal
authorities
if
they
have
been
convicted
of
a
felony
or
some
other
serious
crimes
sb
clearly
reflects
what
is
working
in
los
angeles
county
and
the
los
angeles
county
sheriff
s
department
mcdonnell
said
while
not
perfect
sb
kept
intact
our
ability
to
maintain
partnerships
with
federal
law
enforcement
officials
who
help
us
in
the
fight
against
gangs
drugs
and
human
trafficking
it
also
retains
the
controlled
access
that
the
united
states
immigration
and
customs
enforcement
has
to
our
jails
the
bill
authored
by
sen
kevin
de
leon
of
los
angeles
passed
the
state
senate
on
a
final
vote
saturday
of
it
was
introduced
in
reaction
to
president
donald
trump
s
actions
and
speech
on
illegal
immigration
including
a
vow
to
increase
deportations
trump
also
has
threatened
to
cut
off
federal
funding
to
sanctuary
jurisdictions
although
there
is
no
legal
definition
of
the
term
which
limit
cooperation
with
the
federal
government
on
immigration
enforcement
declaring
a
sanctuary
city
or
state
has
become
a
way
to
openly
defy
trump
while
many
cities
including
san
francisco
and
santa
ana
have
declared
themselves
sanctuary
cities
oregon
is
the
only
state
that
has
taken
on
the
identity
doing
so
in
on
friday
a
federal
judge
in
chicago
blocked
the
trump
administration
s
rules
requiring
so
called
sanctuary
cities
to
cooperate
with
immigration
agents
to
get
a
public
safety
grant
u
s
district
judge
harry
leinenweber
ruled
that
the
city
of
chicago
has
shown
a
likelihood
of
success
in
its
arguments
that
the
administration
exceeded
its
authority
in
imposing
new
standards
governing
edward
byrne
memorial
justice
assistance
grants
across
the
country
leinenweber
s
preliminary
injunction
applies
nationwide
not
just
to
chicago
u
s
attorney
gen
jeff
sessions
has
defended
the
new
policies
as
necessary
to
help
fight
illegal
immigration
so
called
sanctuary
policies
make
all
of
us
less
safe
because
they
intentionally
undermine
our
laws
and
protect
illegal
aliens
who
have
committed
crimes
sessions
said
when
he
announced
the

in

these

also
encourage

was

mcdonnell

said
the

strikes
a
necessary
balance
between

the

mcdonnell
fears

ultimately
be

the
los

regional
interoperable
communications
system
which
has
been
in
the
works
since
the
sept
terrorist
attacks
would
also
improve
communication
between

partners
it

various

to
communicate
with
each
other
particularly
during
times
of
emergency
but
on
a
regular
basis
as

mcdonnell
said
new

only
a

person
on

matters
the
justice
department
declined
to
comment
specifically
on
the
sheriff
s
department
s
policies
one
of
the
new
conditions
requires
jurisdictions
to
allow
federal
immigration
officers
into
detention
facilities
while
the
sheriff
s
department
allows
u
s
immigration
and
customs
enforcement
access
to
interview
certain
inmates
in
jails
and
to
pick
them
up
at
the
time
of
their
release
it
restricts
the
agency

access
to
those
with
serious

specified
under
the

act
though
it
s
not
required
to
do
so
the
sheriff
s
department
believes
that
limiting
ice
s
access
to
these
serious
offenders
helps
it
continue
to
build
trust
within
the

sheriff
s
officials
say
they
re
concerned
that
similar
conditions
could
also
be
placed
on
other
federal

the

has
been
benefiting
from
if
so
a
justice
department
program
that
provides
some
reimbursement
to
state

local

for

might
also
be
impacted
officials
said
federal
grant
funding
is
critical
for
the
safety
of
our
communities
rivero
said
in
a
written
statement
the
loss
of
these
funds
would
be
detrimental
to
advancements
in
technology
the
fight
against
terrorism
narcotics
trafficking
human
trafficking
and
many
other
vital
programs
the
department
would
have
to
seek
other
sources
such
as
state
and
county
funding
if
these
funds
were
no
longer
available
rivero
said
complicating
matters
is
state
senate
bill
sometimes
referred
to
as
the
sanctuary
state
bill
which
would
prohibit
the
use
of
state
and
local
public
resources
to
aid
ice
agents
in
deportation
actions
that
bill
has
been
passed
by
the
state
senate
and
is
making
its
way
through
the
assembly
mcdonnell
noted
that
his
primary
concern
is
not
financial
but
about
keeping
and
maintaining
the
public

trust
if
we
lose

we
put
the
safety
of

by
committing

in

a

to

a
dangerous
often
violent
journey
from

indeed
many
are
fleeing
the
very
gang
violence
in
their
home
countries
that
is
now
gripping
american
communities
the
law
enforcement
officials
testifying
today
have
identified
the
uac
population
as
highly
vulnerable
to
ms
recruitment
and
exploitation
ms

used
american
schools
to
recruit

and
carry
out
acts
of

the

younger
and
even
more
violent
than
in

past
tragically
the
victims
of
ms
violence
are
also
getting
younger

for
appearing
today
to
discuss
the
challenges
this
gang
and
other
criminal

pose
in

invited
to

star
ed

home
by
a
mutual
friend
when
their
uber

dropped
them
off
they
drank
and
hung
out
at
the
house
for
hours
eventually
they
each
went
to
a
spare
bedroom
to
sleep
then
the
women
both
alleged
in
separate
interviews
with
the
times
the
british
actor
forced
himself
on
them
the
women
said
the
incidents
happened
months
apart
three
years
ago
at
the
time
the
women
were
each
dating
someone
friends
of
westwick
a
third
woman
who
asked
that
her

not
be
published
told
the

that
westwick
grabbed
and
slapped
her
backside
at
fyf
fest
near
downtown
los
angeles
that
same
year
you
don
t
know

westwick
adamantly
denied

forward
i

two
days
later
he
said
he
s
cooperating
with
authorities
so
that
they
can
clear
my
name
as
soon
as
possible
it
is
disheartening
and
sad
to
me
that
as
a
result
of
two
unverified
social
media
claims
there
are
some
in
this
environment
who
could
ever
conclude
i
have
had
anything
to
do

such
vile
and
horrific
conduct

wrote
i

absolutely
not

but
the
man
a
legal
permanent
u
s
resident
said
he
would
not

los

city
councilman
mitchell

is
hoping
to
provide
extra
incentive
to
pawnbrokers
and
others
who
may
be
able
to
help
authorities
bring
down
knock
knock
burglary
rings
that
target
upscale
homes
in
the
san
fernando
valley
and
other
parts
of
the
city
englander
on
wednesday
introduced
a
motion
seconded
by
councilman
bob
blumenfield
calling
for
a
reward
to
be
offered
for
information
to
help
authorities
identify
arrest
and
convict
people
responsible
for
this
series
of
knock
knock
burglaries
such
burglaries
have
been
a
growing
epidemic
throughout
the
san
fernando
valley
and
throughout
the
city
of
los
angeles
englander
said
during
a
news
conference
wednesday
prior
to
making
the
motion
the
proposed
reward
is
aimed
at
the
public
particularly
pawnshop
owners
and
employees
who
are
the
first
people
who
are
going
to
know
particularly
when
they
get
repeat
offenders
who
are
bringing
in
stolen
merchandise
englander
said
these
burglaries
are
not
victimless
crimes
he
said
adding
that
some
of
the
stolen
jewelry
include
family
heirlooms
that
cannot
be
replaced
while
the
motion
was
introduced
amid
a
spate
of
knock
knock
style
burglaries
englander
noted
the
reward
is
actually
being
offered
to
anyone
with
a
tip
about
any
type
of
residential
burglary
no
matter
the
method
as
it
is
sometimes
difficult
to
know
what
method
a
burglar
used
the
motion
which
is
expected
to
be
voted
on
next
week
needs
city
council
approval
before
the
reward
can
be
offered
in
february
the
los

police
department
launched
a

knock

task
force
to
address
the
problem
news
of
the

force
came
amid

who
try
to
enter
from
a

entrance
of
the
home
lapd
officials
said
wednesday
the
alleged
rings
appear
to
be
based
mostly
in
south
los
angeles
with
the
burglars
using
more
sophisticated
methods
than
in
the
past
the
burglars
have
been
operating
in
the
valley
for
some
time
and
they
have
really
taken
the
game
to
the
next
level
from
the
beginning
of
this
year
valley
bureau
cmdr
jorge
rodriguez
said
the
burglars
are
monitoring
when
people
typically
leave
their
homes
as
well
as
driving
cars
and
wearing
clothes
that
help
them
blend
into
the
neighborhood
according
to
lapd
officials
among
the
hardest
hit
areas
are
porter
ranch
chatsworth
and
granada
hills
devonshire
division
lt
tim
torsney
said
the
devonshire
division
which
patrols
those
communities
has
recorded
a
spike
in
burglaries
that
goes
against
the
trend
in
most
of
the
valley
as
of
march
burglaries
were
reported
up
from
burglaries
from
the
same
time
last
year
for
the
area
alone
according
to
figures
released
by
the
lapd
out
of
the
additional
burglaries
this
year
the
majority
appear
to
have
been
committed
using
knock
knock
methods
devonshire
division
capt
kathleen
burns
said
lapd
figures
also
show
burglaries
in
the
van
nuys
division
are
up
percent
from
last
year
torsney
noted
police
have
made
some
inroads
on
knock
knock
burglary
crimes
within
the
last
two
months
we
ve
made
significant
arrests
of
multiple
crews
with
no
affiliation
with
one
another
which
has
resulted
in
a
significant
decrease
over
the
last
two
weeks
in
the
area
torsney
said
even
with
the
improvements
englander
said
the
job
is
not
done
the
arrests
are
happening
but
the
crimes
are
not
stopping

james
issued
a
searing
and
personal
response
to
the
discovery
of
racist
graffiti
spray
painted
outside
his
los
angeles
home
early
wednesday
using
a
news
conference
to
deliver
a
somber
soliloquy
about
race
in
america
on
the
eve
of
the
nba
finals
james
explicitly
placed
his
social
standing
as
the
world
s
best
basketball
player
ahead
of
preparation
for
perhaps
the
most
anticipated
series
of
his
career
i
think
back
to
emmett
till
s
mom
actually
james
said
that
s
one
of
the
first
things
i
thought
of
the
reason
she
had
an
open
casket
was
that
she
wanted
to
show
the
world
what
her
son
went
through
as
far
as
a
hate
crime
and
being
black
in
america
no
matter
how
much
money
you
have
no
matter
how
famous
you
are
no
matter
how
many
people
admire
you
being
black
in
america
is
tough
we
ve
got
a
long
way
to
go
for
us
as
a
society
and
for
us
as
african
americans
until
we
feel
equal
in
america
police
said
the
n
word
had
been
spray
painted
across
the
front
gate
of
a
home
james
owns
in
los
angeles
the
lapd
said
it
would
investigate
the
vandalism
as
a
hate
crime
and
examine
security
camera
footage
from
nearby
homes
to
identify
a
suspect
james
lives
in
the
house
in
the
offseason
and
he
and
his
family
were
not
living
in
the
home
at
the
time
james
said
his
family
is
safe
and
that
s
most
important
but
the
crime
visibly
rattled
him
at
his
news
conference
at
oracle
arena
where
his
cleveland
cavaliers
will
open
their
title
defense
in
a
third
consecutive
finals
meeting
with
the
golden
state
warriors
on
thursday
night
james
appeared
shaken
but
resolute
he
wore
a
white
t
shirt
emblazoned
with
a
photo
of
muhammad
ali
s
face
he
measured
his
words
and
frequently
paused
to
swallow
hard
obviously
he
said
you
see
i
m
not
my
normal
energetic
self
james
also
seized
the
incident
as
an
opportunity
to
prove
how
extensive
racism
remains
in
america
if
somebody
of
james
s
stature
is
not
immune
to
a
potential
hate
crime
james
reasoned
the
graffiti
showed
the
pervasiveness
of
hate
in
that
way
he
welcomed
the
maliciousness
as
i
sit
here
on
the
eve
of
one
of
the
greatest
sporting
events
that
we
have
in
sports
race
and
what
s
going
on
comes
again
and
on
my
behalf
and
on
my
family
s
behalf
james
said
but
i
look
at
it
as
if
this
can
shed
light
and
continue
to
keep
the
conversation
going
on
my
behalf
then
i
m
okay
with
it
it
just
goes
to
show
that
racism
will
always
be
a
part
of
the
world
a
part
of
america
hate
in
america
especially
for
african
americans
is
with
them
every
day
even
though
it
s
concealed
most
of
the
time
people
hide
their
faces
say
things
about
you
when
they
see
you
they
smile
in
your
face
it
s
alive
every
single
day
surprising
no
james
later
added
in
an
interview
with
espn
i
still
understand
how
race
plays
a
part
in
america
for
me
to
be
here
and
have
to
answer
questions
about
racism
it
just
lets
me
know
that
it
s
still
here
and
we
should
all
know
that
if
it
takes
for
someone
to
spray
my
gate
and
use
that
derogatory
term
that
hate
on
my
family
to
shed
a
light
on
what
the
real
issue
is
in
the
world
then
so
be
it
while
james
has
become
a
willing
megaphone
for
social
causes
in
the
second
decade
of
his
career
he
had
difficulty
processing
the
potential
effect
on
his
family
the
primary
source
of
his
consternation
he
said
was
being
away
from
his
three
children
a
daughter
and
two
sons
the
most
unfortunate
part
is
that
i
can
t
be
home
right
now
james
said
i
can
t
be
home
to
see
my
kids
my
little
girl
is
actually
too
young
to
understand
it
right
now
i
can
t
sit
in
front
of
my
boys
right
now
and
i
won
t
be
home
until
next
week
it
s
kind
of
killing
me
inside
right
now
my
wife
is
unbelievable
my
mother
my
mother
in
law
my
sister
in
law
they
re
going
to
do
a
great
job
when
they
get
home
from
school
today
at
the
end
of
the
day
i
ll
be
focused
on
thursday
on
our
game
plan
and
focused
on
these
games
i
m
at
a
point
in
my
life
where
my
priorities
are
in
place
and
basketball
comes
second
to
my
family
i
will
be
as
focused
as
i
can
be
on
the
job
at
hand
thursday
this
is
a
situation
where
it
puts
me
back
in
place
as
far
as
what
s
actually
more
important
basketball
is
not
the
most
important
thing
in
my
life
teammates
asserted
their
belief
the
incident
would
not
affect
james
who
willed
the
cavaliers
to
cleveland
s
first
championship
last
season
by
reversing
a
three
games
to
one
series
deficit
against
the
warriors
i
know
bron
i
know
how
locked
in
he
is
cavaliers
forward
tristan
thompson
said
nothing
like
this
is
going
to
affect
his
psyche
in
terms
of
the
finals
obviously
the
world
is
crazy
nowadays
people
have
bad
intentions
we
just
got
to
be
there
for
him
and
know
he
s
a
tough
guy
it
s
unfortunate
said
cavaliers
forward
richard
jefferson
one
of
the
league
s
most
respected
veterans
he
does
such
a
great
job
of
not
letting
those
things
be
a
distraction
it
sucks
not
only
for
him
as
a
grown
man
i
think
he
can
handle
that
but
that
feeling
of
wanting
to
make
sure
your
kids
feel
safe
that
your
family
feels
safe
i
think
that
is
the
part
that
is
most
frustrating
as
a
man
we
deal
with
these
types
of
things
on
a
daily
basis
the
things
that
we
ve
seen
and
had
to
deal
with
a
lot
of
times
they
might
not
even
get
picked
up
on
on
wednesday
james
was
both
downbeat
and
an
eager
messenger
he
also
vowed
his
focus
would
be
on
basketball
by
tip
off
thursday
night
it
will
pass
james

add
armed
robbery
to
the
threats
facing
hikers
this
year
on
the
pacific
crest
trail
a
section
of
the
popular
trail
which
runs
from
mexico
to
canada
remained
closed
monday
as
kern
county
swat
team
members
joined
deputies
to
search
for
two
armed
men
who
robbed
rescuers
trying
to
aid
a
distressed
hiker
the
incident
saturday
in
the
remote
piute
mountains
about
miles
north
of
los
angeles
occurred
after
hiker
charles
brandenburg
became
dehydrated
in
scorching
heat
and
activated
a
rescue
device
that
allowed
him
to
send
text
messages
to
authorities
hikers
trying
to
complete
the
mile
trail
have
encountered
several
challenges
from
an
exceptionally
wet
winter
that
left
a
persistent
snowpack
and
has
made
for
arduous
plodding
and
presented
several
hazards
several
hikers
have
been
injured
and
others
have
reported
close
calls
scaling
icy
passes
and
fording
raging
rivers
brandenburg
had
left
the
trail
for
three
weeks
in
june
to
give
the
snowpack
more
time
to
melt
before
he
tackled
the
rugged
high
sierra
nevada
however
the
delay
meant
he
was
hiking
through
extreme
desert
heat
in
the
past
week
with
diminishing
options
for
water
along
the
way
i
needed
water
really
bad
brandenburg
said
i
undercut
it
it
was
a
mistake
on
my
part
after
hiking
through
heat
as
high
as
degrees
he
became
extremely
dehydrated
friday
and
began
dry
heaving
and
cramping
he
awoke
at
a
m
saturday
hoping
to
hike
before
it
got
hot
but
he
had
about
a
cup
of
water
left
and
was
nine
miles
short
of
his
water
stop
he
only
made
it
a
few
miles
before
he
called
for
help
four
volunteers
with
the
kern
county
search
and
rescue
team
set
out
on
foot
to
bring
brandenburg
water
and
became
separated
sgt
zack
bittle
said
one
pair
turned
down
the
wrong
trail
where
they
encountered
the
robbers
who
stole
their
radios
the
rescuers
were
unharmed
but
they
were
followed
by
the
gunmen
as
they
hiked
back
toward
the
pacific
crest
trail
bittle
said
eventually
the
two
men
ran
off
its
extremely
rare
for
rescuers
to
be
assaulted
but
its
not
unheard
of
last
year
a
volunteer
rescuer
searching
for
a
missing
hiker
was
shot
and
wounded
near
the
south
yuba
river
in
northern
california
while
brandenburg
waited
for
help
to
arrive
other
hikers
showed
up
and
gave
him
some
water
and
waited
with
him
what
he
expected
would
take
a
couple
hours
turned
into
about
a
hour
ordeal
as
he
learned
by
text
message
about
the
robbery
and
was
told
to
stay
put
until
a
helicopter
could
airlift
him
and
the
others

brandenburg
of
mendocino
said
one
man
hid
in
the
sparse
forest
while
they
waited
for
help
but
he
and
two
others
werent
sure
how
seriously
to
take
the
warning
until
the
helicopter
arrived
and
lowered
a
swat
officer
in

to

then
we

it
was

it
was

to
avoid
potentially
losing
out
on
as
much
as
million
in
federal

the

has
begun
cracking
down
on

that

says
protect
undocumented

who
have
committed
crimes
while
undermining
the
nation
s

latest
threat
on
thursday
attorney
general
jeff

sent
letters
to
four
cities
including
two
in
california
threatening
to
deny
federal
crime
fighting
aid
if
the
cities
don
t
step
up
efforts
to
help
detain
and
deport
people
living
in
the
country

the
targeted
cities
which
have
all
struggled
with

are
stockton
san
bernardino
baltimore
and
albuquerque
new
mexico
all
expressed
interest
in
the
justice
department
s
new
public

partnership
federal
officials
said
the
program
provides
assistance
from
federal
agents
analysts
and
technology
to
find
solutions
to
crime
while
the
justice
department
did
not
target
any
communities
in
l
a
county
in
its
latest
move
to
punish
so
called
sanctuary
cities
mcdonnell
has
said
the
county
s
limited
cooperation
with
federal
immigration
officers
strikes
a
necessary
balance
between
public
safety
and
public
trust
it
would
have
a
negative
impact
on
public
safety
on
l
a
county
and
southern
california
mcdonnell
said
in
a
recent
phone
interview
of
the
potential
loss
of
resources
the
bulk
of
federal
grant
funds
that
mcdonnell
fears
could
ultimately
be
in
question
million
of
the
million
would
come
from
dhs
for
the
continued
development
of
a
system
to
enhance
radio
and
broadband
communication
for
police
firefighters
paramedics
and
other
emergency
responders
in
the
county
the
los
angeles
regional
interoperable
communications
system
which
has
been
in
the
works
since
the
sept
terrorist
attacks
would
also
improve
communication
between
local
agencies
and
their
state
and
federal
partners
it
allows
various
departments
to
communicate
with
each
other
particularly
during
times
of
emergency
but
on
a
regular
basis
as
well
mcdonnell
said
new
rules
for
grant
for
now
only
a
small
fraction
of
the
million
in
federal
grants
that
the
sheriff
s
department
would
expect
to
benefit
from
in
the
next
three
years
appears
to
be
in
jeopardy
the

announced
new
conditions

for

to

documents
l
a
county
s
office
of
county
counsel
is
still
reviewing
these
new
conditions
to
determine
if
the
sheriff
s
department
would
be
considered
compliant
said
l
a
county
assistant
sheriff
eddie
rivero
who
is
mcdonnell
s
point
person
on
immigration
matters
the
justice
department
declined
to
comment
specifically
on
the
sheriff
s
department
s
policies
one
of
the
new
conditions
requires
jurisdictions
to
allow
federal
immigration
officers
into
detention
facilities
while
the
sheriff
s
department
allows
u
s
immigration
and
customs
enforcement
access
to
interview
certain
inmates
in
jails
and
to
pick
them
up
at
the
time
of
their
release
it
restricts
the
agency
s
access
to
those
with
serious
offenses
specified
under
the
state
s
trust
act
though
it
s
not
required
to
do
so
the
sheriff
s
department
believes
that
limiting
ice
s
access
to
these
serious
offenders
helps
it
continue
to
build
trust
within
the
community
rivero
said
some
immigrant
rights
advocates
argue
the
sheriff
should
not
cooperate
with
ice
at
all
federal
funding
critical
for
safety
besides
the
byrne
jag
grants
sheriff
s
officials
say
they
re
concerned
that
similar
conditions
could
also
be
placed
on
other
federal
grant
programs
the
department
has
been
benefiting
from
if
so
a
justice
department
program
that
provides
some
reimbursement
to
state
and
local
governments
for
the
costs
of
incarcerating
undocumented
criminal
aliens
could
also
be
at
risk
grant
funds
benefiting
the
los

regional
human
trafficking
task
force
and
the
los

joint
regional
taskforce
which
is
a
regional
anti
terrorism
effort
might
also
be
impacted
officials
said
federal
grant
funding
is
critical
for
the
safety
of
our
communities
rivero
said
in
a
written
statement
the
loss
of
these
funds
would
be
detrimental
to
advancements
in
technology
the
fight
against
terrorism
narcotics
trafficking
human
trafficking
and
many
other
vital
programs
the
department
would
have
to
seek
other
sources
such
as
state
and
county
funding
if
these
funds
were
no
longer
available
rivero
said
complicating
matters
is
state
senate
bill
sometimes
referred
to
as
the
sanctuary
state
bill
which
would
prohibit
the
use
of
state
and
local
public
resources
to
aid
ice
agents
in
deportation
actions
that
bill
has
been
passed
by
the
state
senate
and
is
making
its
way
through
the
assembly
mcdonnell
noted
that
his
primary
concern
is
not
financial
but
about
keeping
and
maintaining
the
public
s
trust
if
we
lose
that
we
put
the
safety
of
everyone
in
all
of
our
communities
at
greater
risk

on

expressed

cautious

for
the

provide

sb
recognizes
what
has
worked
in
los

for
nearly
four
decades
los

police
chief
charlie
beck
said
we
have
reduced
crime
by
building
strong

with
our
communities
regardless
of
civil
immigration
status
we
are
committed
to
reducing

through

and
constitutional

sb
enables

to
continue
abiding
by
these
effective
principles
beck
said
los

said
the

will
preserve
his
department
s
ability
to
maintain
partnerships
with
federal
law
enforcement
in
the
fight
against
gangs

i
strongly
opposed

as
initially
introduced

i
viewed
it
as
a
threat
to
public

mcdonnell
said
saturday
sb
as
passed
by
the
legislature
is
a
very
different
bill
today
thanks
to
the
leadership
of
gov
brown
and
his
staff
and
members
of
the
state
senate
and
assembly
we
can
move
beyond
the
bill
s
early
false
premise
that
local
enforcement
was
going
to
act
as
immigration
agents
this
is
fundamentally
not
true
the
bill
known
as
the
california
values
act
provides
protections
for
immigrants
who
are
in
the
country
illegally
but
also
was
altered
recently
at
the
request
of
brown
to
give
local
law
enforcement
more
freedom
to
work
with
federal
immigration
officials
and
to
hold
individuals
for
federal
authorities
if
they
have
been
convicted
of
a
felony
or
some
other
serious
crimes
sb
clearly
reflects
what
is
working
in
los
angeles
county
and
the
los

county
sheriff
s
department
mcdonnell
said
while
not
perfect
sb
kept
intact
our
ability
to
maintain
partnerships
with
federal
law
enforcement
officials
who
help
us
in
the
fight
against
gangs
drugs
and
human
trafficking
it
also
retains
the
controlled
access
that
the
united

immigration

customs
enforcement
has
to
our

the

authored
by

a

trump
also
has
threatened

cut

jurisdictions
although
there
is
no
legal
definition
of
the
term
which
limit
cooperation
with
the
federal

on

enforcement
declaring
a
sanctuary
city
or
state
has
become
a
way
to
openly
defy
trump
while
many
cities
including
san
francisco
and
santa

declared
themselves
sanctuary

u

attorney

has
defended
the
new
policies
as
necessary
to
help
fight
illegal
immigration
so
called
sanctuary
policies
make

undermine

protect
illegal
aliens
who
have
committed

sessions
said
when

announced
the
new

these

also
encourage
illegal

over

she
s
a
powerful
advocate
for
providing

and
her
life
story
is
testimony
to
the
human
capacity
for
resilience
and

america
s
greatest
failure
in
the

century
may
be
that
far
too
many
children
grow
up
in
a
twilight
zone
of
poverty
chaos
violence
drugs
and
failing
schools
we
can
t
afford
to
help
them
we
say
and
then
we
spend
billions
of
dollars
building
prisons
to
house
them
burton
now
has
co
written
a
stunning
memoir
that
will
be
published
next
week
detailing
how
after
overcoming
narcotics
she
eventually
founded
a
nonprofit
called
a
new
way
of
life
re
entry
project
to
help
women
leaving
prison
in
a
preface
of
the
book
michelle
alexander
a
civil
rights
advocate
describes
burton
as
a
st
century
harriet
tubman
and
there
s
something
to
that
the
memoir
is
called
becoming
ms
burton
and
that
s
the
journey
it
describes
as
a
black
girl
growing
up
in
a
dysfunctional
family
in
the
watts
neighborhood
of
los
angeles
burton
was
repeatedly
raped
and
then
her
child
was
run
over
and
killed
by
a
policeman
she
self
medicated
with
alcohol
cocaine
and
crack
after
six
prison
commitments
at
the
end
of
those
i
was
more
broken
than
when
i
went
into
the
system
she
told
me
each
time
i
was
released
i
would
say
i
m
going
to
get
it
together
but
each
time
it
was
more
daunting
her
cycles
in
prison
ended
only
after
she
chanced
into
a
drug
treatment
program
in
santa
monica
that
mostly
served
a
more
affluent
clientele
a
day
stint
there
helped
her
turn
her
life
around
a
reminder
that
america
would
be
far
better
off
if
we
treated
addiction
as
less
a
criminal
justice
issue
than
a
public
health
crisis
that
s
particularly
true
now
that
some
americans
die
annually
from
drug
overdoses
more
than
times
the
number
who
died
in
the
entire
iraq
war
starting
in
burton
began
to
help
other
women
leaving
prison
providing
them
with
shelter
and
coaching
them
on
staying
sober
and
finding
jobs
the
effort
was
an
immediate
success
and
philanthropists
took
note
when
theodore
forstmann
asked
her
to
make
a
list
of
what
she
needed
burton
initially
wrote
down
toilet
paper
a
friend
explained
that
forstmann
was
a
billionaire
and
burton
upped
the
ante
to
request
a
van
and
forstmann
came
through
burton
now
has
staff
members
including
six
lawyers
she
runs
five
homes
for
women
who
have
left
prison
and
has
been
recognized
as
a
cnn
hero
and
she
burns
with
a
passion
to
help
other
women
find
an
exit
ramp
as
well
we
keep
a
woman
in
prison
for
decade
after
decade
at
a
cost
of
a
year
and
then
give
them
when
they
hit
the
gates
for
release
she
said
shaking
her
head
and
adios
people
have
to
get
their
ids
social
security
cards
they
have
to
get
clothing
housing
apply
for
benefits
and
services
and
it
s
impossible
to
do
with
bucks
the
upshot
she
said
is
that
people
re
offend
and
then
get
locked
up
once
more
at
a
huge
expense
burton
showed
me
the
homes
she
has
set
up
and
the
women
in
them
are
a
reminder
of
how
difficult
it
can
be
to
start
over
after
years
in
prison
one
woman
unique
confided
that
she
hears
voices
in
her
head
shouting
at
her
and
burton
asked
her
why
she
didn
t
keep
a
doctor
s
appointment
i
m
afraid
to
go
out
unique
explained
so
burton
worked
out
an
escort
so
that
unique
could
see
the
doctor
and
get
her
medicines
if
we
don
t
help
her
with
those
voices
she
ll
be
right
back
in
prison
burton
said
when
we
were
outside
another
former
prisoner
proudly
gave
her
full
name
mary
mitchell
now
she
had
been
behind
bars
for
her
entire
adult
life
and
has
never
had
an
official
id
card
with
burton
s
help
she
is
getting
one
and
looking
for
a
job
but
mitchell
has
forgotten
how
to
walk
in
a
city
i
was
so
scared
she
said
i
didn
t
know
how
to
cross
a
crosswalk
burton
told
me
that
a
trigger
in
her
own
downward
spiral
was
the
gang
rape
that
resulted
in
her
pregnancy
if
she
had
received
counseling
she
thinks
she
might
have
avoided
unraveling
too
often
we
miss
these
chances
to
help
wounded
young
people
and
we
invest
only
in
jailing
them
so
i
m
celebrating
burton
s
new
book
and
amazing
second
career
but
with
a
bittersweet
feeling
that
there
are
so
many
other
susan
burtons
out
there
who
never
get
the
help
or
drug
treatment
they
need
and
are
still
incarcerated
in
ways
that
diminish
them
and
all
of
america

jerry

signed

that
will
remove
the
rights
of
school
administrators
to
decide
whether
employees
with
concealed
weapon
permits
can
bring
guns
on
campus
state
law
already
prohibited
civilians
who
are
not
school
workers
from
bringing
firearms
onto
campuses
but
a
change
in
the
law
last
year
gave
school
district
superintendents
power
to
decide
whether
employees
could
bring
concealed
weapons
onto
campuses
according
to
assemblyman
kevin
mccarty
d
sacramento
who
authored
the
bill
five
california
school
districts
including
the
kingsburg
joint
union
and
kern
school
districts
have
begun
to
issue
authorizations
for
some
school
employees
to
bring
guns
on
campuses
mccarty
said
he
said
it
has
increased
the
chance
of
school
shootings
a
safe
learning
environment
is
essential
for
our
children
to
be
successful
in
the
classroom
mccarty
said
that
s
not
possible
if
a
school
district
allows
armed
civilians
to
roam
california
school
campuses
the
measure
ab
was
opposed
by
groups
advocating
for
gun
owners
including
the
national
rifle
assn
and
the
firearms
policy
coalition
which
noted
that
there
have
been
no
shootings
involving
california
school
employees
who
brought
guns
to
campuses
the
constitutional
right
to
bear
arms
is
based
on
the
fundamental
human
right
to
self
defense
the
coalition
wrote
to
lawmakers
ab
undermines
these
very
important
principles
based
on
little
more
than
a
whim
under
separate
legislation
signed
by
brown
on
saturday
californians
who
are
convicted
of
hate
crimes
will
be
banned
from
possessing
firearms
for
years
assemblyman
reggie
jones
sawyer
sr
d
los
angeles
introduced
the
legislation
ab
he
recently
cited
the
august
violence
in
charlottesville
va
as
justification
for
expanding
the
gun
ban
to
those
who
commit
hate
crimes
the
recent
incident
in
charlottesville
where
heavily
armed
neo
nazis
klansmen
and
white
supremacists
spewing
hatred
and
inciting
violence
under
the
guise
of
protecting
free
speech
and
the
right
to
bear
arms
is
not
what
the
founding
fathers
of
this
great
nation
were
protecting
when
they
drafted
our
constitution
jones
sawyer
said
misdemeanor
hate
crimes
that
will
fall
under
the
firearm
ban
include
using
force
or
the
threat
of
force
to
interfere
with
another
person
s
free
exercise
of
any
constitutional
right
because
of
the
other
person
s
race
religion
gender
or
sexual
orientation
gun
possession
will
also
be
banned
for
people
who
deface
or
damage
property
in
order
to
interfere
with
constitutional
rights
for
example
a
person
prosecuted
for
painting
a
swastika
on
a
jewish
house
of
worship
could
lose
their
gun
possession
rights
both
measures

were
in

but
u

customs

this

said

as
he
joined
brown

this

with
multiple
felonies
and
misdemeanors
accusing
him
of
political
money
laundering
at
first
as
he
attended
board
meetings
his
colleagues
said
little
about
his
legal
troubles
but
after
the
charter
school
network
he
co
founded
recently
raised
separate
questions
about
alleged
conflicts
of

his
three
closest
allies
on

publicly
asked
him
to
take
a
leave
of

he
said
no

matter

important

supporters
on

more
than
a
dozen
charter
schools
are
counting
on
him
to
back
their
rebellion
against
rules
imposed
by
the
district
s
charter
school
division
all
of
which
makes
his
allies
stand
particularly
interesting
and
makes
reading
the
board
tea
leaves
tricky
here
s
a
breakdown
of
some
key
issues
why
was
it
noteworthy
that
these
three
school
board
members
proposed
the
leave
of
absence
they
are
rodriguez
s
ideological
allies
they
had
selected
him
as
board
president
in
july
after
they
won
a
majority
in
this
year
s
elections
he
resigned
from
that
leadership
role
when
he
was
charged
but
his
vote
counts
as
much
as
ever
in
their
majority
is
a
leave
of
absence
really
possible
l
a
unified
general
counsel
david
holmquist
said
there
s
no
district
policy
on
taking
a
leave
of
absence
nor
could
he
find
a
specific
provision
in
state
law
the
closest
analog
he
said
is
government
code
section
g
which
covers
a
public
official
abandoning
his
post
according
to
that
code
an
office
becomes
vacant
if
a
public
official
ceases
to
discharge
the
duties
of
his
or
her
office
for
the
period
of
three
consecutive
months
except
when
prevented
by
sickness
or
when
absent
from
the
state
with
the
permission
required
by
law
saying
you
re
taking
a
leave
of
absence
holmquist
said
would
be
like
declaring
in
advance
i
m
not
planning
to
perform
the
functions
of
a
board
member
for
some
time
and
leave
of
absence
or
not
after
three
months
rodriguez
s
job
would
be
considered
abandoned
how
likely
is
it
that
rodriguez
s
problems
could
be
resolved
in
less
than
three
months
barring
a
plea
deal
with
prosecutors
proceedings
could
last
for
several
years
trials
are
the
last
step
in
the
process
and
right
now
we
re
at
the
first
step
said
his
attorney
daniel
nixon
after
the
oct
arraignment
when
rodriguez
pleaded
not
guilty
to
the
money
laundering
charges
state
regulators
might
not
even
begin
to
investigate
the
more
recent
conflict
of
interest
allegations
raised
by
the
charter
school
network
until
the
money
laundering
case
is
resolved
through
nixon
rodriguez
also
has
denied
wrongdoing
on
this
front
why
would
rodriguez
s
allies
urge
him
to
take
a
leave
their
brief
statement
suggested
that
they
wanted
to
minimize
a
distraction
that
could
impede
the
work
of
the
nation
s
second
largest
school
system
garcia
and
melvoin
did
not
make
themselves
available
to
be
interviewed
but
gonez
said
rodriguez
s
staff
members
could
help
fill
in
the
gap
when
rodriguez
was
on
leave
constituents
would
still
have
someone
to
call
if
there
was
an
issue
at
the
school
she
said
she
said
she
was
aware
of
the
three
month
legal
limit
of
any
absence
and
that
she
understood
that
might
not
be
enough
time
for
rodriguez
to
resolve
his
problems
how
important
is
rodriguez
s
vote
on
upcoming
issues
potentially
crucial
at
tuesday
s
board
meeting
for
example
district
staff
members
plan
to
recommend
that
charter
schools
be
shut
down
because
they
refuse
to
comply
with
district
rules
the
futures
of
six
other
charter
schools
also
are
at
risk
mostly
over
the
same
issues
all
told
there
have
never
been
as
many
l
a
charter
schools
facing
potential
closure
at
one
time
certainly
never
over
conflicts
they
instigated
charter
leaders
say
they
are
standing
up
against
regulations
they
find
onerous
for
now
they
appear
ready
to
leave
it
to
board
members
to
decide
their
schools
fates
the
majority
that
includes
rodriguez
has
the
votes
to
help
them
though
it
s
not
clear
what
board
members
will
decide
some
charter
leaders
have
acknowledged
the
allegations
against
rodriguez
are
serious
but
a
group
that
took
part
in
a
media
call
this
week
declined
to
respond
when
asked
if
rodriguez
should
recuse
himself
from
voting
how
well
received
was
the
call
for
a
leave
of
absence
some
observers
praised
the
three
board
members
as
ethical
stewards
of
the
public
interest
willing
to
speak
out
against
an
important
ally
it
s
nice
in
the
political
miasma
we
re
in
these
days
to
see
people
act
with
a

this

according
to
the

the

remained
at

and
cooperated

was
under

by

the
morning
of

student
claudia
rueda
disappeared
in
east
l
a
the
year
old
immigrant
rights
activist
stepped
outside
her
aunt
s
home
to
move
her
mother
s
car
for
street
cleaning
but
never
returned
hours
later
her
family
learned
that
she
had
been
surrounded
by
three
unmarked
cars
carrying
an
estimated
nine
plainclothes
customs
and
border
protection
officers
who
whisked
her
off
to
a
detention
center
miles
away
claudia
is
a
latin
american
studies
major
at
cal
state
l
a
where
we
are
faculty
at
the
time
of
her
arrest
claudia
was
enrolled
in
one
of
our
courses
on
u
s
immigration
policy
that
studied
the
effects
of
deportation
on
families
and
communities
this
subject
was
not
just
academic
for
her
it
hit
close
to
the
bone
once
in
class
she
asked
why
aren
t
more
people
advocating
for
immigrant
rights
or
against
the
further
creation
of
illegality
when
populations
of
children
and
parents
across
borders
are
suffering
due
to
u
s
policies
although
she
is
eligible
for
the
deferred
action
for
childhood
arrivals
or
daca
program
which
would
protect
her
from
deportation
her
family
could
not
afford
the
application
fee
claudia
worried
constantly
that
she
or
one
of
her
family
members
would
be
deported
from
the
country
where
they
have
lived
for
more
than
years
in
late
april
it
seemed
that
claudia
s
worst
fears
were
realized
when
her
mother
teresa
vidal
jaime
was
swept
up
in
a
drug
raid
by
a
joint
task
force
of
the
cbp
and
the
l
a
county
sheriff
at
the
apartment
complex
where
they
lived
although
vidal
jaime
was
not
charged
with
a
crime
she
was
detained
by
immigration
officials
for
overstaying
her
visa
vidal
jaime
was
released
by
an
immigration
court
on
bond
thanks
in
part
to
a
high
profile
campaign
led
by
the
los
angeles
immigrant
youth
coalition
of
which
claudia
is
a
member
less
than
a
week
later
the
cbp
returned
to
east
l
a
looking
for
claudia
residents
reported
that
dozens
of
cbp
agents
knocked
on
doors
at
her
former
apartment
building
and
at
her
aunt
s
nearby
home
asking
for
information
about
claudia
s
whereabouts
and
even
followed
her
neighbors
for
miles
on
their
way
to
work
to
question
and
in
some
cases
arrest
them
in
total
the
cbp
arrested
seven
community
members
that
day
including
claudia
and
several
residents
from
her
former
apartment
building
although
none
had
a
criminal
record
four
were
deported
to
tijuana
within
hours
without
seeing
a
judge
or
a
lawyer
and
the
rest
are
detained
and
in
danger
of
deportation
the
cbp
claims
that
these
arrests
were
part
of
a
criminal
investigation
but
has
not
produced
any
evidence
that
connects
claudia
or
the
others
to
any
crime
claudia
is
the
face
of
immigration
enforcement
under
the
trump
administration
under
current
executive
guidelines
any
immigrant
suspected
of
a
crime
even
if
never
arrested
charged
or
convicted
has
become
a
priority
for
deportation
basic
due
process
such
as
the
right
to
know
the
charges
and
evidence
against
you
is
absent
in
the
immigration
system
this
policy
has
led
to
a
increase
in
immigrant
detentions
in
the
first
three
months
of
trump
s
presidency
compared
with
the
same
time
last
year
and
a
increase
in
the
detention
of
people
with
no
criminal
record
or
with
only
minor
traffic
infractions
criminal
investigations
serve
as
a
pretext
for
a
policy
of
mass
deportation
of
immigrants
who
have
deep
ties
in
local
communities
trump
recently
claimed
we
are
not
after
the
dreamers
we
are
after
the
criminals
however
data
show
a
increase
in
the
deportation
of
dreamers
as
daca
recipients
are
known
in
the
first
three
months
of
trump
s
presidency
compared
with
the
same
time
last
year
immigrant
youth
who
encounter
the
police
are
more
likely
to
have
their
daca
status
revoked
and
be
detained
by
u
s
immigration
and
customs
enforcement
claudia
s
case
also
illuminates
the
government
s
apparent
practice
of
going
after
undocumented
activists
who
challenge
its
immigration
policies
claudia
s
detention
less
than
one
week
after
her
mother
was
released
seems
like
payback
by
the
cbp
for
her
activism
and
leadership
she
is
one
of
several
youth
activists
since
trump
s
inauguration
who
have
been
targeted
by
immigration
agencies
in
what
seems
to
be
an
attempt
to
silence
them
in
march
undercover
ice
agents
in
vermont
arrested
three
prominent
undocumented
activists
associated
with
the
group
migrant
justice

of
them

after

to
citizenship
for
immigrants
those
concerned
about
creeping
authoritarianism
in
u
s
governance
should
be
deeply
troubled
by
claudia
s
experience
after
four
weeks
in
detention
without
seeing
a
judge
claudia
will
finally
have
a
bond
hearing
on
friday
ice

and
should
exercise
its
discretion
to
release
her
immediately
and
process
her
application
for

state
and
local
politicians
who
promised
to
create
sanctuaries
for
residents
like
claudia
need
to
ensure
that

are
not

next
tuesday
november
will
see
the
release
of
marvel
s
runaways
tv
series
on
hulu
critics
have
responded
optimistically
in
early
reviews
with
deadline
even
heralding
the
show
as
a
response
to
trump
s
america
runaways
is
based
on
the
early
s
ya
comic
of
the
same
name
initially
written
by
brian
k
vaughan
saga
y
the
last
man
and
drawn
by
adrian
alphona
ms
marvel
uncanny
x
force
the
book
was
a
triumphant
read
for
teens
growing
up
in
that
era
myself
included
in
a
world
where
most
super
teams
consist
of
just
one
girl
the
runaways
with
only
two
male
members
were
mostly
but
not
entirely
female
runaways
avoided
an
isolating
girl
group
trope
that
rarely
makes
narrative
sense
see
brian
wood
s
all
girl
run
on
x
men
but
reexamining
the
book
now
it
seems
clear
in
light
of
some
of
our
recent
political
movements
that
it
made
pretty
bad
choices
regarding
race
warning
the
following
is
full
of
spoilers
if
you
haven
t
read
runaways
or
are
planning
on
watching
the
show
this
may
give
away
some
of
the
plot
the
runaways
comic
tells
the
story
of
six
los
angeles
teenagers
who
find
out
that
their
parents
are
part
of
a
supervillain
outfit
known
as
the
pride
the
pride
s
goal
is
to
enable
otherworldly
entities
known
as
the
gibborim
to
initiate
an
apocalyptic
event
where
humanity
will
perish
with
only
a
few
members
of
the
pride
surviving
each
pair
of
parents
fulfills
a
different
supervillain
trope
which
matches
symbolic
requirements
for
the
gibborim
s
rites
there
s
the
travelers
time
travelers
magicians
outcasts
mutants
the
wise
men
mad
scientists
and
the
colonists
aliens
then
there
s
the
thieves
who
surprise
surprise
are
the
only
black
family
geoffrey
and
catherine
wilder
and
their
son
alex
along
with
being
members
of
the
pride
geoffrey
and
catherine
are
the
premier
crime
bosses
of
los
angeles
they
re
drug
kingpins
who
have
the
corrupt
lapd
serving
as
their
lapdogs
vaughan
seems
at
least
marginally
aware
of
some
of
the
stereotypes
to
avoid
when
creating
these
characters
while
geoffrey
does
speak
in
an
african
american
vernacular
the
wilder
family
live
in
a
house
in
malibu
dress
in
a
fairly
average
style
and
have
an
extensive
sports
car
collection
they
re
more
sopranos
than
boyz
n
tha
hood
but
vaughan
still
decides
to
outright
classify
geoffrey
and
catherine
as
thieves
the
wilder
s
son
alex
along
with
the
rest
of
the
progeny
of
these
supervillains
starts
out
the
comic
ostensibly
rebelling
against
his
parents
murderous
catastrophic
ambitions
but
there
s
a
tragic
twist
at
the
end
of
the
first
series
alex
reveals
himself
as
a
mole
betrays
his
teenage
do
gooder
friends
and
the
story
ends
with
his
death
alongside
the
rest
of
the
pride
vaughan
would
go
on
to
bring
back
geoffrey
and
catherine
in
later
editions
of
runaways
resurrecting
them
to
continue
on
as
thorns
in
the
kids
side
while
their
mostly
white
fellow
pride
members
remained
dead
the
japanese
minoru
family
of
witches
are
the
only
other
racial
minorities
among
the
principle
characters
of
the
story
to
be
clear
i
don
t
think
there
s
anything
wrong
with
having
black
antagonists
in
runaways
based
on
the
concept
of
the
book
where
all
the
teen
protagonists
parents
are
villains
you
would
need
to
have
black
villains
to
have
a
black
hero
also
it
makes
sense
for
alex
to
be
the
mole
being
the
son
of
criminal
masterminds
he
s
a
whiz
at
planning
and
organizing
but
why
did
alex
the
traitor
have
to
be
the
token
black
character
as
opposed
to
one
of
the
other
runaways
why
are
the
black
villains
the
thieves
as
opposed
mutants
or
mad
scientists
it
seems
as
if
unconscious
bias
is
at
play
this
may
be
just
a
comic
book
but
the
stereotypes
on
which
these
characters
seem
to
have
been
based
have
real
world
damaging
consequences
in
the
worst
cases
the
consequences
of
this
pervasive
racial
bias
are
lethal
in
making
these
narrative
choices
vaughan
has
fed
into
harmful
and
inaccurate
stereotypes
that
criminalize
black
citizens
of
this
country
taking
this
into
consideration
it
would
have
been
better
if
runaways
had
had
no
black
characters
at
all
and
this
isn
t
the
only
glaring
racial
misstep
none
of
the
original
runaways
characters
are
latino
yet
it
s
set
in
l
a
this
is
more
than
an
oversight
in
a
city
where
percent
of
the
population
is
hispanic
or
latino
hulu
s
runaways
seems
to
have
smartly
remedied
that
changing
the
character
of
mutant
molly
hayes
into
molly
hernandez
played
by
allegra
acosta
and
latina
actor

jeff

said
during
a
news
conference
tuesday
where
officials
played
a
video
displaying
what
was
found
at
the
acre
property
in
the
block
of
jackson
street
what
was
found
was
more
than
roosters
including
dead
birds
a
variety
of
weapons
believed
to
be
used
in
cockfighting
contests
adding
up
to
what
was
called
the
largest
such
seizure
in
the
country
s
history
perry
said
investigators
also
found
recovered
were
hundreds
of
gaffs
or
slashers
he
said
they
put
them
on
the
roosters
claws
so
when
they
fight
they
literally
slash
each
other
to
death
perry
said
syringes
and
steroids
for
the
animals
were
also
recovered
he
said
perry
who
commands
the
sheriff
s
community
partnership
bureau
said
the
warrants
served
monday
in
val
verde
were
the
culmination
of
a
months
long
investigation
by
detectives
who
specialize
in
animal
blood
sport
type
crimes
it
was
very
large
and
in
a
remote
location
in
a
canyon
perry
said
who
added
that
sheriff
s
department
personnel
secured
the
location
and
helped
with
animal
care
and
control
ten
people
were
detained
at
the
scene
perry
said
he
described
them
as
lower
level
workers
who
took
care
of
the
animals
the
property
owner
has
been
identified
as
the
primary
suspect
but
officials
declined
to
name
him
we
anticipate
to
make
several
arrests
in
relation
to
this
case
perry
said
the
humane
society
received
complaints
earlier
this
year
from
area
residents
of
suspected
cockfighting
going
on
in
the
val
verde
castaic
area
said
eric
sakach
senior
law
enforcement
specialist
for
the
humane
society
the
complaints
were
turned
over
to
the
l
a
county
department
of
animal
care
and
control
and
its
major
crimes
unit
sakach
said
he
said
his
organization
learned
in
the
property
had
been
the
site
of
a
search
warrant
and
birds
were
seized
it
appears
after
that
initial
one
was
shut
down
they
started
back
up
even
bigger
said
perry
adding
that
his
department
believes
the
site
is
primarily
being
used
for
breeding
raising
and
selling
the
animals
to
buyers
in
los
angeles
and
neighboring
counties
perry
said
the
property
has
had
the
same
owner
since
the
previous
search
warrant
sakach
defined
cockfighting
at
the
news
conference
as
two
roosters
being
forced
to
fight
to
the
death
often
with
at
least
one
or
both
birds
dying
a
violent
agonizing
death
it
s
a
problem
beyond
santa
clarita
where
tens
of
thousands
of
dollars
are
waged
at
cockfighting
events
and
exchanged
through
illegal
bird
sales
throughout
the
country
said

deputy
district
attorney
and
animal
cruelty
case
coordinator
for

a
county
district
attorney
s
office
in

sakach
estimates
that
birds
can
sell
for
between
and
on
cockfighting
websites
prices
can
range
from
to
and
a
bird
with
a
winning
reputation
can
fetch
more
than
four
figures
sakach
said
perry
recommended
people
call
their
local
law
enforcement
agency
humane

or
society
for
the
prevention
of

who
identified
himself
only
as
royce
citing
security
concerns
it
was
for
less
than
worth
of
beer
it
s
not
worth
it
royce
said
that
people
particularly
transients
and
gang
members
try
to
shoplift
on
occasion
because
they
think
it
s
easy
they
don

know
there

a

there
that
s
how
ghetto
it
is

for
expelling
them
from

s
gutierrez
said
that
people
in
that
line
of
work
have
to
weigh
the
risk
when
confronting
a
shoplifter
who
may
already
have
a
criminal
record
essentially
you
never
know
who
you
are
approaching
he
said
it
may
not
be
the
safest
behavior
to
try
to
detain
someone
he
said
and
extreme
caution
should
be
used
when
a
private
person
makes
an
arrest

it
s
the
heart
of
our
blue

economy
it
s
the

of
our
middle

and
it
s
about

eye
off
the
ball
the
mayor
said
this
is
something
that
is
important
to
all

the

have
long
lamented

that

leaders

proposal
drafted
by

released
last

the

seeking
to
run

to
address
the
uneven
effects
of

for
so
long
people
that

that

we
have
paid
the

for

city
council
president

who

african
american
said
at
a
recent
community
forum
in

and
as
we
move
this
into
the
legal
realm
it
is
important
to
us
that
we
have
a
piece
of
the
action
local
governments
cannot
give
preferential
treatment
based
on
race
or
ethnicity
under
california
law
a
fact
that
wesson
quickly
acknowledged
at
the
watts
forum
instead
the
l
a
program
would
benefit
poor
people
who
have
been
convicted
of
a
marijuana
crime
in
california
poor
people
whose
immediate
family
members
have
been
convicted
people
with
low
incomes
who
live
or
have
lived
in
neighborhoods
that
were
heavily
affected
by
marijuana
arrests
and
companies
that
agree
to
help
disadvantaged
applicants
this
is
not
about
race
said
donnie
anderson
cofounder
of
the
california
minority
alliance
which
advocates
for
the
inclusion
of
people
of
color
in
the
marijuana
industry
this
is
about
communities
that
were
hurt
by
the
failed
war
on
drugs
without
such
a
program
you
d
just
have
corporate
people
getting
into
the
industry
anderson
said
where
s
the
justice
in
that
under
the
proposed
social
equity
program
the
city
would
provide
different
levels
of
assistance
to
the
four
categories
of
eligible
applicants
with
the
maximum
assistance
going
to
poor
people
convicted
of
marijuana
crimes
however
the
city
could
still
deny
marijuana
licenses
to
people
convicted
of
violent
or
serious
crimes
as
outlined
in
state
law
people
in
the
program
could
get
help
applying
for
city
licenses
training
employees
and
finding
vacant
city
properties
those
that
are
not
suitable
for
affordable
housing
to
rent
for
free
or
at
reduced
rates
the
city
would
also
help
people
expunge
old
convictions
for
marijuana
crimes
and
l
a
would
also
waive
or
defer
fees
and
provide
start
up
loans
at
low
rates
in
addition
cannabis
businesses
run
by
wealthier
applicants
could
get
tax
rebates
if
they
help
disadvantaged
entrepreneurs
by
providing
them
floor
space
mentoring
or
other
assistance
because
l
a
is
allowing
marijuana
businesses
only
in
limited
zones
entrepreneurs
have
been
eager
to
get
city
approval
quickly
before
the
available
space
is
snapped
up
by
other
businesses
existing
pot
shops
that
have
been
operating
in
line
with
an
earlier
set
of
city
rules
are
first
in
line
for
licenses
after
that
the
city
will
start
handing
out
licenses
to
other
applicants
under
the
proposal
for
every
general
applicant
who
gets
a
license
the
city
would
give
out
one
license
to
someone
participating
in
the
social
equity
program
a
rule
meant
to
ensure
equitable
participation
in
the
industry
according
to
the
proposal
the
recommended
rules
which
were
drafted
by
the
consulting
firm
amec
foster
wheeler
with
the
help
of
city
staff
are
expected
to
be
vetted
by
a
council
committee
this
month
the
firm
also
analyzed
geographic
and
racial
disparities
in
marijuana
arrests
in
los
angeles
and
identified
which
neighborhoods
had
been
disproportionately
affected
in
addition
to
assisting
disadvantaged
applicants
the
proposed
rules
would
also
require
new
cannabis
businesses
to
ensure
that
at
least
half
of
their
workforce
are
people
with
low
incomes
residents
living
in
the
heavily
affected
neighborhoods
or
those
who
have
been
convicted
of
a
marijuana
crime
and
their
family
members
the
proposed
rules
would
also
set
aside
of
city
revenue
from
taxing
marijuana
businesses
to
help
pay
for
community
beautification
drug
treatment
and
other
services
for
communities
heavily
affected
by
marijuana
arrests
the
consultants
also
recommended
that
the
city
streamline
the
approval
process
for
all
marijuana
businesses
to
make
it
less
time
consuming
and
costly
marijuana
industry
groups
such
as
the
united
cannabis
business
assn
which
have
closely
tracked
the
proposed
regulations
were
still
reviewing
the
newly
released
proposal
friday
but
applauded
the
idea
adam
spiker
executive
director
of
the
southern
california
coalition
said
the
consultants
had
spent
so
much
time
trying
to
get
this
right
this
is
about
who
was
most
affected
by
the
war
on
drugs
and
what
can
we
do
as
the
city
of
los
angeles
to
make
that
right
spiker
said
quickly
adding
or
try
to
make
that
right
people
going
to
prison
their
kids
going
to
foster
care
there
s
no
way
to
right

groups
that
brought

offenders
in

to
divert

the

disproportionately

is
working
to
revamp

policies
and
sponsored
some
of

including
a

that

said
she
and

plan

that
have
seen
the
largest
upticks
in

including
los

their
hope
is
to
gather
with
local
elected
officials
law

business
leaders
to
discuss
what
their

need
to
implement
the
legislation
and
to
ensure

are
not
revolving

doors
this

only
if
they
have
been
convicted
of
a

among
the
most
significant
bills
signed
wednesday
is
one
that
limits
cities
and
counties
from
collecting
fees
from
families
with
children
under
in

under

while
there
those
fees
vary
widely
by

and
momentum
to

systems
had
been
building

steadily

los

according
to
a
study
released
in
march
by
the
policy
advocacy
clinic
at
uc
berkeley
law
school
that
analysis
found
that
many
counties
engage
in
fee
practices
that
violate
state
and
federal
laws
while
some
make
little
revenue
or
even
lose
money
due
to
the
work
it
takes
to
obtain
payments
from
parents
and

among
vocal
critics
of
the
court
fees

generated
by

she
said
last
year
in
her
judiciary
address
to
the
legislature
we
have
a
system
of
fines
and
fees
that
has
morphed
from
a
system
of
accountability
to
a
system
that
raises
revenue
for
essential

services
she
said
among
the
former
youth

to
applaud
the
changes
was
joel

told

at

de

began
by
thanking

beck
and
others
for
supporting
the
bill
before
decrying
the
reckless
trump
administration
for
its
efforts
to
withhold
federal
dollars
from

that
say
they
won
t
cooperate
with
federal

constitutional
threats
from

at
the

conference
held
in
the
ronald
reagan
state
building
in
downtown
los

de
le

n
noted
a
recent
decision
by
a
federal
judge
in
san
francisco
who
blocked
president
donald
trump
s
order
to
withhold
federal
funding
from
so
called
sanctuary
cities
that
don
t
cooperate
with
federal
immigration
officials
but
he
said
local
police
still
need
protection
against
federal
overreach
because
we
stood
up
to
the
trump
administration
threat
with
an
aggressive
defense
of
our
immigrant
communities

jeff
sessions
has
had
to
narrow
his
definition
of

city
de

said
his
plan
to
punish
so
called
sanctuary
cities
by
withholding
federal
grant
dollars
has
been
rejected
by
the

of
law
still
our
local
law
enforcement
officers
are
under
threat
of
being
commandeered
to
the
president

deportation
forces
senate
bill
will
protect
local
police
against
federal
overreach
de
le
xfffd
n
said
that
since
the
start
of
the
year
reports
of
sexual
assault
and
domestic
violence
have
decreased
because
those
who
might
report
such
crimes
fear
deportation
if
they
re
undocumented
under
senate
bill
local
police
officers
will
maintain
the
trust
of
immigrant
communities
that
has
been
carefully
nurtured
the
trust
that
is
so
important
to
our
safety
de
le
xfffd

also
said
his
bill
requires
state
corrections
officials
to
notify
u
s
immigration
and
customs
enforcement
days
before
they
release
anyone
with
a
violent
felony
conviction
senate
bill
is
not
about
safeguarding
criminals
de
le
xfffd

said
it
would
assure
that
dangerous
criminals
serve
their
full
sentence
in
california
holder
who
state
senate

have
hired
as
outside

said
de

bill
would
ensure
undocumented
immigrants
report
crimes
california
is
leading
holder
said
california
is
doing
the
right
thing
this
is
something
that
needs
to
be
done
nationwide
as
the
former
attorney
general
of
these
united
states
i
know
from
experience
immigrants
even
when
they
are
victims
of
crime
or
witnesses
to
criminal
acts
often
fear
interacting
with
local
law
enforcement
officers
when
those
officers
also
engage
in
federal
immigration
enforcement
holder
added
that
means
more
crime
it
means
more
victims
and
it
means
not
fewer
we
have
concluded
that
it
is
constitutional
holder
said
under
the
united
states
constitution
states
have
the
power
over
the
health
and
safety
of
their
residents
and
the
allocation
of
state
resources
despite
statements
from
the
trump
administration
suggesting
that
laws
similar
to
the
california
values
act
are
somehow
unconstitutional
the
act
is
a
core
exercise
of
california
s
authority
beck
said
it
s
crucial
to
ensure
that
witnesses
to
crimes
aren
t
deterred
from
sharing
information
with
police
because
they
fear
deportation
we
do
not
want
to
lose
trust
because
we
believe
trust
is
the
most
important
thing
in
policing
beck
said
the
ability
to
get
witnesses
to
come
forward
the
ability
to
get
victims
to
come
forward
can
be
severely
detrimented
by
civil
enforcement
of
immigration
by
local
authorities
this
is
not
a
soft
on
crime
bill
he
added
we
depend
on
our
communities
particularly
our
immigrant
communities
to
cooperate
with
us
not
only
to
keep
them
safe

to

immigrant
advocates
had
long
pushed
los
angeles
to
legalize
street
vending
arguing
that
sidewalk
sellers
who
hawk
ice
cream
hotdogs
wrapped
in
bacon
or
other
food
and
goods
should
not
face
criminal
charges
that
could
put
them
at
risk
of
being
deported
but
the
idea
languished
at
city
hall
as
politicians
sparred
over
where
and
how
sidewalk
vending
should
be
allowed
activists
grew
frustrated
as
the
years
passed
with
hearing
after
hearing
yet
no
clear
plan
for
legalizing
and
regulating
their
trade
then
donald
trump
was
elected
president
and
local
officials
decided
to
hustle
fearing
a
coming
crackdown
on
immigrants
los
angeles
city
council
members
joe
buscaino
and
curren
price
vowed
to
stop
punishing
vending
as
a
crime
and
begin
setting
up
a
regulated
system
the
council
voted
to
draft
a
law
that
would
decriminalize
sidewalk
vending
councilman
jose
huizar
told
reporters
it
was
a
sign
to
this
trump
administration
that
we
will
not
abide
by
his
fear
his
vilification
his
scapegoating
of
immigrants
instead
los
angeles
is
saying
you
do
not
have
to
work
in
the
shadows
huizar
said
city
staffers
say
it
could
take
months
however
for
los
angeles
to
work
out
all
of
the
details
and
begin
handing
out
permits
to
vendors
in
the
meantime
vendors
who
ply
their
trade
on
city
sidewalks
could
still
be
cited
and
fined
for
violating
the
municipal
code
but
they
would
not
face
criminal
convictions
such
charges
could
jeopardize
immigrants
in
the
country
illegally
trump
has
signed
an
order
that
emphasized
deporting
not
only
people
convicted
of
crimes
but
also
people
who
were
charged
with
crimes
not
yet
adjudicated
and
even
those
who
have
not
been
charged
but
are
believed
to
have
committed
acts
that
constitute
a
chargeable
criminal
offence
those
disturbing
developments
helped
spur
the
city
to
take
action
said
mike
dennis
who
sits
on
the
steering
committee
of
the
l
a
street
vendor
campaign
it
took
something
horrible
at
the
national
level
for
them
to
see
the
urgency
that
we
ve
been
seeing
for
a
long
time
business
groups
including
many
that
had
raised
concerns
about
vending
also
said
they
supported
decriminalization
sidewalk
vendors
and
their
advocates
have
argued
that
some
of
the
proposed
rules
are
too
restrictive
the
l
a
street
vendor
campaign
contends
that
the
city
should
not
allow
neighbourhoods
to
totally
prohibit
sidewalk
vending
nor
require
vendors
to
get
permission
from
neighbouring
shops
to
do
business
outside
the
coalition
to
save
small
business
which
has
raised
concerns
about
how
sidewalk
vending
can
affect
bricks
and
mortar
businesses
has
insisted
that
communities
should
be
able
to
choose
more
less
or
no
sidewalk
vending
if
they
desire
eliminating
criminal
charges
for
sidewalk
vending
is
one
of
a
string
of
proposals
that
los
angeles
politicians
have
backed
to
counter
actions
of
the
trump
administration
including
opposing
the
proposed
environmental
protection
agency
chief
and
approving
the
hiring
of
an
immigrant
advocate
at
city
hall
if
los
angeles
wants
to
stand
up
for
immigrants
we
can
t
simply
talk
about
opposing
trump
s
policies
or
nominees
buscaino
said
we
need
to
take
serious
actions

using

comfort
zone
for
my
audience
the
docudrama
also
marks
the
latest
in
a
stream
of
hollywood
projects
that
reflect
the
ongoing
interest
in
the
scandalous
murders
which
centered
on
whether
the
menendez
brothers
were
cold
blooded
murderers
or
victims
of
horrific
child
abuse
who
killed
their
parents
to
escape
torment
the
brothers
were
sentenced
to
life
in
prison
in
among
the
various
projects
were
lifetime
s
june
film
menendez
blood
brothers
which
featured
courtney
love
as
kitty
menendez
and
two
separate
made
for
tv
movies
in
the
law
order
version
is
the
first
to
position
abramson
as
the
central
character
and
it
plans
to
offer
a
more
extensive
examination
of
the
killings
executive
producer
and
showrunner
rene
balcer
believes
the
brothers
were
unfairly
treated
by
what
he
called
a
corrupt
justice
system
these
guys
never
should
have
been
sentenced
to
life
without
parole
balcer
said
they
were
over
charged
and
over
sentenced
they
were
abused
kids
who
killed
their
abusers
although
she
had
little
interest
at
the
time
falco
said
she
was
attracted
to
the
series
by
the
complicated
dynamics
things
are
never
what
they
seem
the
actress
said
on
location
in
pasadena
just
minutes
earlier
she
had
put
on
the
wig
that
matched
abramson
s
famously
frizzy
mane
her
appearance
was
worlds
away
from
that
of
manicured
mob
wife
carmela
soprano
or
bleary
drug
addicted
nurse
jackie
peyton
it
s
a
story
of
child
abuse
that
stuff
hopefully
affects
everyone
but
it
really
just
gets
me
right
in
my
gut
what
these
boys
were
put
through
said
falco
the
mother
of
two
young
kids
there
s
something
more
grotesque
about
the
fact
that
they
had
money
they
were
not
allowed
to
be
seen
as
victims
people
were
not
receptive
to
hearing
how
hard
it
was
for
them
she
was
also
moved
by
abramson
s
mission
to
do
right
by
the
brothers
leslie
is
a
woman
who
is
very
good
at
her
job
she
said
she
is
passionate
about
it
and
believes
in
her
clients
that
doesn
t
necessarily
mean
she
believes
they
re
innocent
but
she
believes
in
their
right
to
a
fair
defense
that
s
commendable
of
her
i
think
she
really
cared
about
these
guys
beyond
working
for
them
moments
later
falco
was
on
the
steps
of
an
office
building
substituting
for
the
beverly
hills
courthouse
surrounded
by
extras
playing
reporters
at
a
brief
news
conference
her
tone
was
direct
and
stern
as
she
channeled
abramson
accusing
prosecutors
and
police
of
violating
her
clients
rights
of
doctor
patient
privilege
by
seizing
notes
from
erik
menendez
s
psychiatrist
any
of
us
that
sees
a
doctor
consults
a
lawyer
or
even
confides
in
a
priest
minister
or
rabbi
had
better
be
worried
she
said
as
abramson
although
falco
captures
the
attorney
s
tough
as
nails
demeanor
she
got
no
advice
from
her
real
life
counterpart
i
did
not
meet
her
says
falco
i
don
t
think
she
has
any
interest
in
being
involved
with
this
that
was
the
word
i
got
but
there
s
plenty
to
see
of
her
on
youtube
and
in
photos
she
also
wrote
a
great
book
called
the
defense
is
ready
which
said
a
great
deal
about
who
she
is
and
about
the
justice
system
especially
at
that
time
lesli
linka
glatter
homeland
who
directed
the
first
two
episodes
and
also
serves
as
an
executive
producer
said
she
was
continually
impressed
by
falco
s
performance
edie
is
an
amazing
actress
and
she
cannot
lie
said
glatter
when
she
takes
on
a
role
she
gets
fully
inside
a
character
taking
on
such
an
intense
character
in
a
broadcast
network
drama
was
not
part
of
a
specific
career
plan
said
falco
i
have
never
known
my
creative
direction
after
two
iconic
roles
she
said
for
a
long
time
after
the
sopranos
the
offers
were
all
italian
wives
after
nurse
jackie
it
was
tons
of
scripts
about
drug
addicts
reflecting
on
those
roles
gives
her
both
personal
and
professional
perspective
the
only
thing
that
comes
to
mind
is
gratitude
she
says
i
feel
tremendously
blessed
that
i
was
presented
with
these
two
things
that
kept
me
busy
for
years
each
it
kept
me
working
and
living
in
new
york
which
is
what
makes
me
happiest

and
a
week
ago
she
learned
he
would
be
arriving
in

a
the
one
bit
of
information
toosbuy

he

his

which
led
detective
to
reached
out
to
the

she
learned
of
at
least
two
other
complaints
against
him
which
led
to
a
news
conference
in
july
where
other
women
came
forth
the
common
pattern
is
that
mr
gaspar
was
the
nursing
assistant
for
all
these
victims
toosbuy
said
adding
he
was
tasked
with
caring
for
them
after
their
surgeries
in

according

center
the
ownership
has
changed
twice
in

toosbuy
added
at
the
news
conference
the
process
of
finding
gaspar
was
frustrating
but
toosbuy
said
she
carried
on
for
every
time
someone
told
me
to
give
up
on
it
and
let
it
go
it
made
me
pissed
off
and
not
give
up
on
it
toosbuy
explained
officially
getting
him
into
custody
i
don
t
even
know
how
to
describe
it
anna
arnett
who
also
said
she
was

by

said
she
will
never
forget
what
happened
to
her
i
ended
up
having
to
have
another
emergency
surgery
years
later
so
i
had
someone
from
my
family
in
my
room
hours
a
day
arnett
said
even
today
if
i
were
to
go
back
to
the
hospital
someone
would
be
in
there
hours
a
day
for
rosenberg
she
describes
her
current
emotions
as
scary
with
gaspar
back
i
think
we
all
accepted
he
was
gone
and
that
was
just
the
way
it
was
rosenberg
said
and
now
he
s
back
will
he
go
to
trial
will
he
take
the
plea
we
don

it

a
little
scary
because
it

not
just
you
go

jerry

denied
parole
thursday
for
former
mexican
mafia
shot
caller
rene
boxer
enriquez
marking
the
third
time
that
the
governor
has
blocked
the
convicted
killer
s
bids
for
freedom
in
recent
years
enriquez
disavowed
his
violent
tenure
with
the
mexican
mafia
and
became
a
darling
of
law
enforcement
by
cooperating
with
investigators
filming
training
videos
and
lecturing
at
conferences
brown
commended
enriquez
s
efforts
at
self
improvement
and
noted
that
prosecutors
have
praised
his
help
but
ultimately
decided
enriquez
remains
unsuitable
for
release
mr
enriquez
is
personally
responsible
for
an
immeasurable
amount
of
death
and
destruction
brown
wrote
in
his
decision
i
still
do
not
believe
that
he
has
shown
an
adequate
understanding
of
why
he
was
so
willing
to
devote
himself
to
brutality
and
gang
leadership
enriquez
is
serving
a
life
term
in
ironwood
state
prison
about
miles
east
of
palm
springs
for
two
murders
committed
in
he
ordered
the
killing
of
cynthia
gavaldon
a
drug
dealer
he
believed
was
stealing
from
him
he
also
killed
another
mexican
mafia
member
by
injecting
him
with
heroin
then
shooting
him
five
times
in
the
back
of
the
head
his
criminal
history
also
includes
jailhouse
attacks
on
other
inmates
including
his
admission
to
sexually
assaulting
a
fellow
inmate
along
with
drug
sales
burglary
and
counts
of
robbery
state
commissioners
have
thrice
recommended
enriquez
for
parole
only
to
be
met
by
brown
s
refusal
it
will
probably
take
about
a
year
before
he
next
returns
for
another
hearing
state
corrections
officials
said
in
the
last
year
enriquez
has
begun
to
publicly
assert
that
he
was
physically
and
sexually
abused
by
family
members
including
his
elder
brother
after
joining
the
mexican
mafia
in
he
found
a
place
where
he
could
defeat
his
brother
i
could
be
crazier
than
him
i
could
participate
in
more
violence
than
him
i
could
be
more
respected
in
the
gang
than
him
he
traced
his
career
of
gang
related
brutality
to
childhood
trauma
and
said
shame
prevented
him
from
acknowledging
this
before
being
completely
powerless
as
a
victim
i
later
became
a
perpetrator
in
attempt
to
i
guess
gain
control
he
told
a
panel
of
parole
commissioners
this
summer
brown
acknowledged
the
difficulty
of
childhood
abuse
and
how
it
explains
enriquez
s
motive
to
join
the
mexican
mafia
but
he
said
the
explanation
failed
to
account
for
his
pursuit
of
violence
and
ascendance
within
the
gang
the
governor
cited
a
psychologist
who
concluded
that
the
new
sexual
abuse
allegations
cast
doubt
on
enriquez
s
credibility
and
indicate
a
moderate
risk
of
future
violence
in
january
enriquez
s
unusually
close
relationship
with
law
enforcement
became
the
subject
of
controversy
after
the
lapd
ushered
him
to
a
downtown
l
a
event
where
he
spoke
privately
to
business
leaders
the
extensive
security
was
paid
for
with
tax
dollars
although
the
organizers
offered
to
reimburse
the
city
after
the
event
was
covered
by
the
times
and
other
media
in
his
most
recent
parole
hearing
enriquez
said
that
in
the
last
years
he
has
striven
to
live
the
life
of
a
normal
inmate
he
s
denied
offers
to
live
in
federal
custody
tried
not
to
bask
in
the
accolades
from
law
enforcement
and
testified
only
twice
in
that
time
period

the
los
angeles
police
department
s
slow
and
careful
process
for
developing
a
policy
on
how
it
will
deploy
drones
is
imperfect
but
chief
charlie
beck
and
his
department
are
approaching
the
question
in
the
proper
spirit
taking
public
input
and
considering
the
many
very
serious
concerns
about
drones
being
used
for
unwarranted
police
snooping
if
only
l
a
county
sheriff
jim
mcdonnell
would
take
heed
both
the
lapd
and
the
sheriff
s
department
have
already
acquired
the
small
remote
controlled
and
camera
equipped
devices
that
could
prove
valuable
in
providing
an
aerial
view
of
tense
standoffs
or
could
just
as
easily
be
misused
to
ramp
up
intrusive
public
surveillance
ostensibly
in
the
name
of
crime
prevention
mcdonnell
unveiled
his
program
in
january
as
a
done
deal
and
has
deployed
one
drone
despite
criticism
from
members
of
the
sheriff
civilian
oversight
commission
who
want
publicly
vetted
standards
for
using
the
equipment
beck
by
contrast
has
sworn
off
drone
flights
pending
the
drafting
of
guidelines
and
a
series
of
public
meetings
and
amid
demonstrations
by
activists
who
oppose
any
use
of
the
devices
in
their
belief
not
altogether
unreasonable
given
how
some
departments
have
used
red
light
cameras
and
license
plate
readers
that
once
police
have
them
they
will
be
prone
to
misuse
them
the
lapd
presented
its
drone
proposal
to
the
civilian
police
commission
on
tuesday
and
reiterated
that
the
drones
won
t
fly
until
that
panel
signs
off
on
deployment
guidelines
that
have
yet
to
be
drafted
that
process
is
important
it
demonstrates
that
the
police
department
understands
public
concern
over
new
technologies
and
their
penchant
to
erode
privacy
especially
when
wielded
by
armed
government
officers
with
powers
to
arrest
and
by
a
department
with
a
history
of
compiling
dossiers
not
merely
on
criminal
suspects
but
on
political
enemies
and
individuals
holding
controversial
opinions
the
process
also
underscores
the
lapd
s
relationship
with
its
civilian
overseers
on
the
commission
which
at
least
in
name
are
collectively
in
charge
of
the
department
and
dictate
its
policy
the
police
commission
has
already
sought
public
input
on
the
use
of
a
different
recording
technology
body
cameras
which
were
once
widely
embraced
by
police
critics
as
a
tool
to
provide
an
unbiased
view
of
shootings
arrests
or
other
police
encounters
in
a
cautionary
note
for
the
lapd
s
drone
ambitions
many
supporters
of
body
cameras
now
reject
them
on
the
argument
that
police
exercise
too
much
control
over
the
video
before
the
public
sees
it
tools
are
just
tools
whether
they
are
body
cameras
drones
or
flashlights
and
are
intrinsically
neither
good
nor
bad
without
carefully
crafted
publicly
reviewed
and
strictly
enforced
rules
for
using
them
such
rules
should
be
subject
to
periodic
review
as
should
each
use
of
a
drone
the
benefits
of
the
technology
should
be
weighed
against
not
just
the
monetary
costs
but
the
potential
for
impingement
on
civil
liberties
and
the
burden
should
fall
on
law
enforcement
to
make
the
case
for
deploying
it
without
such
rules
and
processes
even
older
tools
are
subject
to
abuse
as
was
the
case
more
than
a
decade
ago
when
lapd
officers
improperly
used
their
heavy
flashlights
as
batons
much
time
was
spent
over
replacement
flashlight
models
but
the
process
was
important
and
won
back
a
measure
of
the
community
support
that
the
department
had
lost
after
more
and
more
cases
surfaced
of
officers
beating
suspects
with
their
old
style
flashlights
the
lapd
could
improve
its
drone
process
by
making
its
proposed
guidelines
public
before
asking
for
input
then
revising
them
as
appropriate
as
many
times
as
necessary
without
that
step
public
meetings
become
a
sort
of
suggestion
box
not
without
value
but
not
as
useful
as
they
could
be
like
beck
s
department
mcdonnell
s
has
an
oversight
panel
but
one
that
is
less
than
a
year
old
has
no
enforcement
powers
and
is
still
figuring
out
its
role
mcdonnell
launched
a
one
year
drone
pilot
project
without
waiting
for
commission
input
the
law
entitled
him
to
do
that
good
judgment
and
political
acumen
however
would
have
dictated
a
different
course
last
month
after
testimony
and
public
input
a
majority
of
the
sheriff
s
oversight
commissioners
called
for
grounding
mcdonnell
s
drone
pending
further
study
the
department
has
relied
on
a
survey
showing
public
support
for
drone
use
but
such
surveys
are
no
substitute
for
careful
vetting
by
an
oversight
body
of
deployment
guidelines
mcdonnell
would
be
wise
to
follow
the
lapd
s
lead
in
grounding
his
drone
pending
a
process
that
invites
meaningful
public
input
and
oversight
as
much
as
some
politicians
police
unions
and
pundits
want
it
to
be
true
crime
isn
t
out
of
control
in
california
in
fact
crime
rates
are
about
as
low
as
they
have
ever
been
in
the
past
years
on
aug
the
state
attorney
general
released
statewide
crime
data
for
overall
the
violent
crime
rate
ticked
up
percent
compared
with
and
property
crime
fell
by
percent
for
every
californians
there
were
violent
crimes
in
and
property
crimes
while
any
amount
of
crime
is
a
problem
it
s
important
to
step
back
and
assess
the
numbers
in
context
since
the
violent
crime
rate
per
californians
has
barely
changed
rising
from
to
meanwhile
the
property
crime
rate
per
fell
from
to
that
is
after
the
passage
and
implementation
of
assembly
bill
proposition
and
proposition
significant
criminal
justice
reforms
that
helped
drive
down
the
state
prison
population
from
about
at
the
start
of
to
about
today
a
review
of
crime
trends
since
the
year
ab
was
passed
shows
that
after
an
increase
in
crime
hit
all
time
lows
in
and
ticking
up
again
in
and
dropping
back
down
in
to
put
the
crime
rates
in
further
perspective
the
violent
crime
rate
per
in
when
the
prison
population
peaked
at
was
and
years
before
that
was
numbers
which
reveal
how
low
the
state
s
figure
of
is
likewise
despite
all
the
rhetoric
about
proposition
letting
drug
addicts
and
thieves
loose
to
steal
whatever
they
want
the
state
s
property
crime
rate
is
half
or
less
than
half
of
what
it
was
in
any
year
before
it
was
lower
in
than
any
year
in
the
past
years
other
than
when
it
hit
the
record
low
of
per
as
low
as
crime
is
you
wouldn
t
know
it
based
on
much
of
the
rhetoric
thrown
around
about
california
s
supposedly
soft
on
crime
policies
in
a
video
announcing
his
run
for
governor
travis
allen
asserted
that
crime
is
on
the
rise
in
every
major
market
and
blamed
criminal
justice
reforms
similarly
after
the
shooting
of
police
officer
keith
boyer
sen
jeff
stone
r
temecula
and
whittier
police
chief
jeff
piper
took
the
opportunity
to
attack
proposition
and
ab
you
re
passing
these
propositions
you
re
creating
these
laws
that
are
raising
crime
said
piper
such
assertions
would
be
significant
if
they
were
true
but
they
re
not
it
turns
out
you
don
t
need
to
throw
people
in
state
prisons
at
an
annual
cost
of
over
per
inmate
for
low
level
theft
and
drug
offenses
but
this
apparent
revelation
threatens
those
with
a
vested
interest
in
the
public
misperceiving
levels
of
crime
as
higher
than
they
really
are
recently
robert
sass
vice
president
of
the
association
for
los
angeles
deputy
sheriffs
told
the
los
angeles
daily
news
that
proposition
increases
crime
and
it
is
simply
reckless
of
course
the
vice
president
of
a
public
safety
union
would
say
that
with
crime
near
historic
lows
it
s
hard
to
justify
current
spending
priorities
which
remain
unduly
skewed
toward
arresting
and
imprisoning
people
instead
of
preventing
crime
or
making
it
possible
for
former
offenders
to
reintegrate
into
society
without
hysteria
over
crime
how
else
could
the
law
enforcement
lobby
justify
its
contracts
pensions
and
assorted
legal
protections
despite
large
drops
in
our
prison
population
corrections
spending
is
set
to
surpass
billion
this
year
up
from
billion
in
much
of
that
is
due
to
a
lucrative
contract
awarded
to
the
prison
guard
union
adding
million
in
costs
this
fiscal
year
alone
are
we
any
safer
or
better
off
because
of
that
of
course
not
unsurprisingly
the
law
enforcement
lobby
continues
to
oppose
almost
every
criminal

reform
the

anaheim

on
thursday
tried
to
assuage
the
frustrations
of
many
in

by
promising
to
conduct

police
investigators
expect
to
file
their
report
with

which
will
weigh
charges
within

quezada
said
that
during

there
was
insufficient
evidence
to
arrest
the
officer
but
at

clear
and
compelling

to

i
wish

had

arrival
quezada
said
as

as

i
too
am
disturbed
by
what
i

posted

as

said

and
any

would

this

several

it
was
unclear
if
he
fired
on
purpose
the
shot
appeared
to
go
downward
and
no
one
was
struck
the

have

little
kid
it
is
unclear
whether
the
off
duty
officer
identified
himself
as
a
cop
but
based
on
video
evidence
in
which
voices
can
be
heard
debating
whether
he
was
really
a
cop
common
sense
leads
you
to
believe
he
probably
identified
himself
at
some
point
said
wyatt
the
anaheim
police
spokesman
police
officers
even
when
off
duty
have
the
ability
to
arrest
people
lapd
officers
have
the
option
to
carry
firearms
when
off
duty
a
department
spokesperson
said
the
officer
s
personal
firearm
was
legal
and
there
s
no
question
about
his
ability
to
carry
it
wyatt
said
a
boy
who
said
he
was
the
year
old
arrested
for
assault
and
battery
told
orange
county
register
on
thursday
that
he
punched
the
officer
to
get
him
to
release
the
younger
boy
when
he
shot
he
almost
hit
my
foot
the
teen
said
then
i
ran
away
it
is
still
unclear
why
the
officer
fired
his
gun
but
wyatt
said
that
the
witnesses
including
juveniles
shown
in
the
video
said
in
interviews
that
the
officer
never
pointed
it
at
anyone
and
they
didn
t
feel
threatened
that
doesn
t
mean
he
couldn
t
be
charged
with
negligent
discharge
of
a
firearm
wyatt
said
in
the
anaheim
neighborhood
where
the
incident
played
out
on
tuesday
tensions
remained
high
on
thursday
the
residential
area
had
been
rattled
the
night
before
by
rowdy
protesters
who
broke
windows
and
vandalized
homes
while
demanding
the
arrest
of
the
off
duty
policeman
twenty
three
people
were
arrested
among
the
several
hundred
protesters
who
had
gathered
that
largely
peaceful
protest
devolved
into
chaos
at
times
with
house
windows
and
vehicle
windshields
broken
and
graffiti
sprayed
on
walls
and
a
garage
calling
police
pigs
and
calling
for
people
to
kill
cops
epithets
were
hurled
as
police
in
riot
gear
formed
a
scrimmage
line
others
called
for
peace
and
denounced
a
system
they
view
as
inherently
racist
i
don
t
call
them
heroes
i
call
them
killers
said
claudia
garcia
of
anaheim
every
time
i
ve
called
them
they
haven
t
done
anything
on
thursday
as
neighbors
gathered
in
their
yards
anaheim
police
officers
remained
in
patrol
cars
outside
of
the
house
they
also
guarded
the
officer
s
home
against
demonstrators
joe
gulrich
said
the
shooting
took
place
in
his
yard
about
a
half
block
from
the
officer
s
home
wednesday
night
police
officers
spirited
gulrich
and
his
wife
to
a
friend
s
house
as
protesters
moved
in
i
got
the
hell
out
said
gulrich
it
was
ugly
when
gulrich
returned
home
around
a
m
wednesday
he
found
that
protesters
had
thrown
a
brick
through
a
bedroom
window
and
spray
painted
a
profanity
on
his
garage
door
apparently
believing
the
officer
lived
there
the
incident
had
echoes
of
a
similar
one
five
years
ago
when
a
pair
of
police
shootings
happened
on
back
to
back
days
and
led
to
rowdy
protests
in
front
of
city
hall
the
world
s
eyes
are
on
anaheim
again
because
of
a
confrontation
between
a
police
officer
and
young
people
said
anaheim
councilman
jose
moreno
there
has
been
so
much
work
that
people
have
put
in
to

substantive
and
meaningful
relationships
to
bring
people
and

together
