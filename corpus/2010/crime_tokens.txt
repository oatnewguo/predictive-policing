the
first

the

said
its

has
tripled
in

chicago
mayor
richard
daley
relaunched
a
proposal
last

to
build
non

rail
service
between
downtown

chicago
o

it
would
not
replace
the
chicago
transit
authority

service
travel
time
from
downtown
to
o
hare
on
the
blue
line
is
about

and
costs
about
the
new
service
would
be
faster
but
also
cost
more
in
a
statement
daley
said
the
project
would
also
expand
economic
opportunity
and
create
jobs
he
has
created
a
committee
of
experts
that
will
review
the
project
s
financing
routes
implementation
schedules

operation
no
city
dollars
would
be
used
and
foreign
investors
are
already
interested
in
the
project
daley
said
last
week
in
the
cta
had
proposed
a
similar
project
betting
that
travelers
would
pay
extra
to
avoid
jockeying
with
commuters
for
seats
but
the
million
plan
was
scrapped
after
the
cost
exceeded
the
budget
and
the
city
couldn
t
come
up
with
enough
money
to
finish
it
the
initial
plan
called
for
a
new
station
in
the
heart
of
the
downtown

urbanksi
adds
with
a
flourish
just
why
this
letter
revealed
for
the
first
time
this
week
ended
up
in
a
file
painstakingly
assembled
by
the
australian
crime
commission
as
part
of
its
wickenby
investigation
into
suspected
tax
fraud
is
a
long
story
but
the
short
answer
lies
in
a
note
composed
days
earlier
by
the
ernst
and
young
tax
adviser
marcus
davis
headed
paul
hogan
tax
residency
and
dated
april
it
outlines
hogan
s
plans
to
take
himself
his
wife
linda
kozlowski
and
son
chance
back
to
the
us
to
live
after
three
years
spent
in
australia
between
july
and
june
davis
finds
it
pertinent
to
observe
that
paul
has
been
advised
by
his
manager
and
other
professional
advisers
that
if
he
wishes
to
continue
his
career
he
will
need
to
relocate
to
the
us
handwritten
next
to
this
someone
has
noted
letter
to
come
sure
enough
urbanski
s
letter
arrives
two
weeks
later
urbanski
flatly
denied
the
letter
was
solicited
by
hogan
s
australian
accountant
tony
stewart
to
whom
it
was
copied
by
fax
or
email
i
don
t
take
instructions
from
tony
stewart
and
i
don
t
listen
to
or
follow
instructions
from
accountants
he
snapped
but
whoever
assembled
the
acc
file
must
have
thought
the
letter
had
some
place
in
the
mosaic
of
events
affecting
hogan
s
shifting
tax
residency
status
with
hogan
and
his
family
crossing
the
pacific
first
in
one
direction
then
another
between
and
the
acc
investigators
suspected
stewart
of
constructing
a
series
of
false
residency
windows
periods
in
which
hogan
was
paying
tax
in
neither
country
and
they
suspected
the
strategy
involved
retrospectively
re
casting
hogan
s
move
from
the
us
to
australia
in
july
as
only
temporary
thus
the
acc
schedule
of
inferences
seen
by
the
media
for
the
first
time
in
court
documents
released
this
week
states
in
the
tax
advantage
lay
in
telling
the
us
authorities
he
was
coming
to
australia
permanently
but
in
the
tax
advantage
lay
in
telling
the
australian
authorities
that
he
came
here
only
temporarily
in
both
cannot
however
be
the
case
the
brief
further
claims
that
stewart
codenamed
a
in
acc
documents
ultimately
intended
to
facilitate
an
assertion
to
australian
taxation
authorities
that
p
the
codename
for
hogan
was
not
domiciled
in
australia
between
and
much
then
turned
on
what
was
in
hogan
s
mind
when
he
came
back
to
australia
in
mid
and
whether
he
genuinely
thought
he
was
returning
for
good
in
this
respect
the
acc
also
notes
that
hogan
and
kozlowski
bought
a
waterfront
pile
in
vaucluse
in
july
shortly
after
their
return
from
the
us
where
they
had
been
living
for
some
years
meanwhile
millions
of
dollars
were
swirling
through
a
merry
go
round
allegedly
devised
by
hogan
s
tax
advisers
in
one
instance
the
acc
alleges
an
offshore
entity
called
quatre
saison
trust
transferred
funds
to
another
virgin
islands
entity
called
trelene
which
then
paid
us
million
to
a
company
called
silverstream
nominees
for
hogan
s
benefit
the
money
was
allegedly
transferred
while
hogan
was
in
transit
between
the
us
and
australia
and
was
ostensibly
for
rights
to
a
film
never
made
crocodile
dundee
iv
but
hogan
has
reportedly
denied
receiving
the
payment
both
quatre
saison
and
trelene
were
beneficially
owned
or
part
owned
by
hogan
and
were
run
by
the
offshore
financial
advisory
outfit
strachans
operated
by
philip
egglishaw

prime

of

other
matters
attracting
the

relate
to
the
tax
treatment
of
a
loan
from
one
hogan
company
to
another
hogan
his
crocodile
dundee
partner
john
cornell
and
stewart
have
denied
wrongdoing
and
have
not
been
charged
with
any
tax
offences
despite
the
length
of
the
investigation
in
hogan
said
defiantly
from
the

come

get
me
you
miserable
bastards
moreover
while
the
acc
still
has
hogan
in
its
sights
on
other
grounds
with
more
to
surface
in
the

in
august
the
acc
has
not

its

against

based
on
the

dispute
it
is
understood
it
notified
the
federal
court
in
mid
that
it
had
dropped
that
part
of

investigation
nevertheless
hogan
maintained
furious
attempts
to
keep
the

pico
rivera
a
man
was
behind
bars
friday
on
suspicion
of
taking
part
in
a
smash
and
grab
jewelry
robbery
at
the
pico
rivera
indoor
swap
meet
authorities
said
christopher
holley
was
booked
on
suspicion
of
the
crime
which
took
place
about
p

at
the
swap
meet
paramount
blvd
sgt
rodney
johnson
of
the
los
angeles
county
sheriff
s
major
crimes
bureau
said
he
was
listed
as
a
los
angeles
resident
though
authorities
said
he
claimed
to
have
been
staying
in
lancaster
the
robbery
was
carried
out
by
holley
and
six
other
men
who
fled
the
scene
in
two
cars
leaving
him
behind
officials
said
he
got
left
behind
and
was
trying
to
blend
in
with
patrons
from
a
nearby
business
johnson
said
deputies
arrested
him
without
incident
while
thursday
s
heist
has
not
been
definitively
linked
to
any
others
the
robbery
highlighted
a
trend
of
smash
and
grab
jewelry
store
robberies
that
have
been
on
the
rise
throughout
los
angeles
county
and
southern
california
over
the
past
nine
months
or
so
johnson
said
we
don
t
have
any
evidence
that
holley
or
his
group
have
been
involved
in
others
but
it
seems
that
groups
have
decided
that
this
is
going
to
be
their
crime
of
choice
he
said
similar
crimes
took
place
in
pasadena
on
nov
oct
in
el
monte
and
in
other
places
such
as
los
angeles
glendale
and
orange
county
authorities
said
just
as
in
the
pico
rivera
crime
the
others
have
involved
groups
of
young
black
men
who
smashed
open
display
cases
with
hammers
or
other
items
before
helping
themselves
to
jewelry
and
fleeing
in
waiting
getaway
cars
officials
said
the
robbers
in
the
crimes
so
far
have
all
worked
quickly
johnson
added
they
re
in
and
out
within
seconds
or
a
couple
of
minutes
it
was
unclear
whether
the
recent
smash
and
grab
jewelry
robbery
trend
is
the
work
of
one
gang
johnson
said
or
if
it
s
simply
growing
in
popularity
among
criminal
groups
at
least
half
a
dozen
suspects
already
arrested
in
connection
with
the
crimes
have
all
been
members
of
the
crips
street
gang
from
los
angeles
investigators
said
johnson
said
detectives
were
still
looking
into
whether
holley
had
gang
ties
friday
according
to
sheriff
s
booking
records
holley
was
being
held
in
lieu
of
bail
at
the
sheriff
s
pico

he
was

for

california

as
electronic

become

the

is

even

previous

a
clampdown
on

the
public
has
traditionally
had
a

from

the
latest
attempt
to
go

was

sponsored

would

the
bill
was
written
at
the

of

he
feared

he
didn

how

victims
could
be
re
victimized
it
hasn
t
happened
he
acknowledged
but
it
is
only
a
matter
of
time
the
measure
would
have
restricted
information
about
a
crime
victim
s
address
to
the
city
in
which
they
live
that
hurts
our
ability
to
let
the

know
about
dangers
in
their
own
neighborhoods
while
not
by
any
means
endangering
anyone
else
newspapers
including
this
one
don

victims

the

predictive

pg

length
words
the
story
of
public
safety
in
los
angeles
has
long
been
mired
in
violence
gang
crime
and
corruption
for
too
long
the
streets
were
not
safe
and
neighborhoods
lived
in
fear
that
has
changed
our
streets
are
now
the
safest
they
have
been
since
the
eisenhower
administration
and
in
the
five
years
that
mayor
antonio
villaraigosa
has
been
in
office
los
angeles
has
witnessed
a
percent
drop
in
homicides
and
a
percent
reduction
in
violent
crime
our
mayor
made
public
safety
his
top
priority
and
has
delivered
results
at
the
end
of
los
angeles
had
the
fewest
homicides
and
violent
crimes
since
as
of
last
week
the
year
to
date
crime
statistics
show
that
crime
in
is
continuing
to
drop
with
violent
crime
down
percent
and
homicides
down
percent
from
the
same
period
last
year
one
major
contributing
factor
to
this
historic
drop
in
crime
has
been
the
mayor
s
unwavering
commitment
to
grow
the
los
angeles
police
department
another
factor
has
been
the
mayor
s
insistence
on
greater
investment
in
police
resources
prevention
strategies
and
intervention
initiatives
to
keep
our
young
people
out
of
gangs
and
off
the
streets
that
is
why
in
the
mayor
created
the
office
of
gang
reduction
and
youth
development
gryd
which
oversees
and
coordinates
all
city
gang
prevention
intervention
and
re
entry
programs
the
mayor
made
a
strategic
targeted
investment
in
the
neighborhoods
most
affected
by
gang
violence
the
youth
most
likely
to
join
gangs
and
those
individuals
who
are
seeking
a
safe
way
out
this
program
has
proven
results
overall
in
the
gryd
zones
gang
related
crime
is
down
percent
and
violent
crime
has
decreased
by
percent
that
same
year
the
mayor
also
launched
a
program
called
summer
night
lights
with
the
simple
idea
that
if
we
keep
the
lights
on
at
parks
in
the
communities
most
affected
by
violence
we
can
offer
positive
alternatives
to
crime
and
violence
throughout
long
summer
evenings
after
just
its
first
summer
communities
around
snl
parks
experienced
a
percent
drop
in
violent
gang
related
crime
with
an
astounding
percent
reduction
in
gang
related
homicides
snl
gained
national
acclaim
and
now
serves
as
a
model
for
cities
across
the
country
in
its
third
year
the
mayor
expanded
this
program
to
parks
across
los
angeles
and
by
summer
s
end
we
expect
hundreds
of
thousands
of
visits
to
the
city
s
snl
sites
these
efforts
represent
a
sea
of
change
in
the
way
we
work
to
reduce
gang
violence
and
offer
hope
and
alternatives
for
a
better
future
for
our
kids
we
are
taking
back
our
communities
for
families
who
want
and
deserve
to
live
in
peace
without
the
fear
of
violence
and
crime
when
he
first
took
office
the
mayor
villaraigosa
pledged
to
make
los
angeles
a
world
class
model
for
emergency
preparedness
and
homeland
security
since
then
he
has
worked
with
our
regional
partners
to
achieve
this
goal
by
opening
the
joint
regional
intelligence
center
and
creating
the
los
angeles
regional
interoperable
communications
system
once
completed
la
rics
will
provide
a
single
regional
communication
system
allowing
the
lapd
the
lafd
the
county
of
los

and
every
first
responder
in
the
greater
los
angeles
region
to
seamlessly
communicate
whether
during
routine
operations
or
large
scale
emergencies
much
like
his
commitment
to
the
police
department
the
mayor
has
also
stood
firm
in
his
support
for
the
los
angeles
fire
department
since
july
the
city
has
hired
new
firefighters
and
has
reduced
response
times
to
five
minutes
on
average
we
ve
built
new
fire
stations
increased
the
number
of
resources
at
existing
stations
and
have
more
dispatchers
than
ever
before
we
have
also
stepped
up
security
measures
at
our
airports
and
lax
now
has
more
sworn
police
officers
non

security
officers
and
bomb

canine

than
any
other

in

the

also
secured
million

for
lax
s
inline

program
a

of

in
addition
since
the

public

including
the

department
of
homeland
security
to
increase
our
capabilities
to
prevent
protect
respond
and
recover
to

of

the

has
been
clear
and
we

notorious
for
its

wright
carved
out
a
niche
that
enabled
him
to
make
over
million
over
his
nba

he
never
hesitated
to
give

to
his

sorokin
died
and
that
he
got
okey
doked
into
helping
a
friend
almquist
did
not
explain
his
decision
but
said
simply
he
found
reason
to
believe
all
three
participated
in
events
that
led
to
sorokin
s
death
and
that
it
began
with
a
plan
to
rob
him
almquist
said
he
believed
sorokin
was
not
dead
when
he
was
put
in
the
truck
after
skuba
s
attorney
charlie
stevens
argued
against
the
kidnapping
charge
by
asserting
there
is
no
evidence
he
was
moved
before
he
died
there
was
a
lot
of
ugly
stuff
and
a
lot
of
contradictory
stuff
but
nothing
shows
there
was
a
kidnap
stevens
said
according
to
earlier
testimony
roberts
who
had
a
daily
drug
and
alcohol
habit
cleaned
up
blood
in
the
garage
took
some
of
the
or
so
pounds
of
stolen
marijuana
and
prevented
her
father
from
calling
she
also
faces
charges
she
tried
to
use
sorokin
s
credit
card
the
case
broke
when
watsonville
police
stopped
roberts
and
skuba
about
days
later
believing
they
were
in
a
stolen
vehicle
after
that
stop
roberts
initiated
conversations
with
police
about
what
had
happened
the
night
sorokin
disappeared
wade
said
and
everything
she
said
was
later
corroborated
she
told
investigators
skuba
called
clamp
to
come
over
after
the
commotion
in
the
garage
and
that
clamp
advised
skuba
he
really
needed
to
think
about
whether
he
wanted
to
do
this
and
whether
he
could
live
with
it
wade

men
are
being

seized
about
pounds
of
marijuana
worth
about
million
from
a
boat
that
ran
aground
on
the
backside
of
the

it
took
dozens
of
sheriff
s
deputies
several
hours
to
load
the
large
rescue
helicopter
due
to
the
size
of
the
seizure
two
helicopter
flights
were
required
to
transport
the
marijuana
to

mainland
three
mexican

jesus
miguel
edeveriamontiel
luis
alfonso
avilezlopez
and
luciano
cendejas
sanchez
who
were
on
the
boat
were
arrested
and
transported
to
the
mainland
where
they
faced
federal
drug
trafficking
charges
on
monday
oct
a
federal
court
convicted
the
three
for
drug
trafficking
according
to
the
los
angeles
county
sheriff
s
station
in
avalon
before
announcing
their
punishment
the
presiding
judge
asked
them
why
they
committed
the
crime
the
three
men
told
the
judge
their
families
had
been
threatened
and
they
were
forced
to
be
smugglers
by
drug
traffickers
in
their
native
country
at
the
time
of
their
arrest
lt
jeff
donahue
of
the
sheriff
s
station
in
avalon
alluded
to
the
possibility
that
the
men
had
been
put
up
to
perform
the
crime
by
more
significant
figures
in
the
mexican
illegal
drug
trade
our
major
narcotics
investigating
crew
interviewed
the
three
suspects
lt
donahue
said
they
were
very
cooperative
cool
calm
and
collected
which
seems
a
bit
unusual
they
obviously
are
well
versed
in
dealing
with
the
police
lt
donahue
said
he
thought
the
suspects
probably
felt
better
off
in
the
custody
of
u
s
officials
than
having
to
face
the
people
who
sent
them
off
with
the
illegal
contraband
mexico
has
been
plagued
in
recent
years
with
a
rash
of
murder
and
violence
related
to
drug
trafficking
however
the
convicted
men
s
explanation
did
not
seem
to
move
the
court
after
hearing
their
answers
the
judge
sentenced
each
of
them
to
years
in
a
united
states
federal
prison
it
s
very
sad
that
the
main
players
can
t
get
caught
sooner
than
later
lt
donahue
said
the
violence
in
parts
of
mexico
is
unbelievable
innocent
people
and
children
as
well
as
other
drug
dealers
are
getting
killed
weekly
all
because
of
drugs
this
kind
of
shipment
that
we
seized
is
all
related
to
the
drug
cartel
down
there
after
their
arrest
the
three
mexican
suspects
told
authorities
they
had
left
from
mexico
s
rosa
rio
beach
slightly
south
of
tijuana
in
the
foot
ponga
type
boat
that
was
loaded
with
about
gallons
of
gasoline
in
containers
in
addition
to
the
pot
the
drug
trade
can
get
pretty
vicious
down
there
where
drug
smugglers
have
shootouts
with
police
lt
donahue
said
people
get
sent
messages
threats
and
warnings
in
the
form
of
body
parts
in
april
lt
donahue
said
authorities
would
probably
try
and
use
the
bust
to
go
after
more
of
the
people
involved
in
the
smuggling
of
illegal
substances
from
mexico
it
s
a
common
practice
we
would
use
to
try
and
catch
them
he
said
however
it
is
not
known
if
the
men
who
were
convicted
assisted
in
authorities
further
investigation
of
the
mexican
drug
trade
these
arrests
and
recovery
were
the
direct
result
of
a
diligent
and
observant
sheriffs
department
employee
said
sheriffs
headquarters
bureau
capt
mike
parker
he
called
for
backup
from
other
law
enforcement
agencies
and
coast
guard
personnel
and
we
had
a
very
successful
outcome
the
smuggling
of
illegal
marijuana
has
been
said
to
be
the
fuel
for
the
mexican
drug
cartels
to
conduct
billons
of
dollars
of
business
that
includes
other
illicit
drugs
such
as
cocaine
and
methamphet

california

there
is
no

that
it

to

however
what
probably
contributes
the
most
to
that
reduction
in
crime
is
the
fact
that
about
criminals
are
in

in
california
it
is
generally
accepted
that
career
criminals
commit
about
crimes
per

before
being
caught

another
view
jan
is
ludicrous
it
says
that
the
average
cost
of
treating
a

for
a
preventable

is
the
cost
of
providing
health
coverage
for
a
child
is
roughly
is
that
per
month
per
year
or
per
childhood
for
this
program
to
save
money
at
per
year
every
child
would
have
to
be
saved
from
a
hospitalization
every
six
years
or
so
and
of
course
that
will
never
happen
there
may
be
good
arguments
in
favor
of
providing
health
care
for
children
but
saving
money
on

hospital
costs
certainly
isn

one

los

sheriff

pushed
friday
for
passage
of
a
bill
that
would
authorize
police
agencies
to
keep
the
addresses
of
crime
victims
secret
the
bill
died
last
month
in
the
public
safety
committee
losing
on
a
vote
but
baca
who
wrote
the
proposal
and
torres

continued
pressing
lawmakers
to
pass
it
at
a
news
conference
friday
outside

the

will
reconsider
the
bill
tuesday
all

these
earnest

bill
and

it

baca
said
assemblyman
anthony
portantino
d
la
ca
ada
flintridge
a
member
of
the
committee
voted
against
the
bill
last
month
he
was
not
available
for
comment
friday
but
he
had
previously
said
he
could
not
support
the
bill
in
its
current
form
torres
said
the
bill
had
not
gone
through
any
substantive
changes
since
being
killed
in
committee
amendments
were
added
to
clarify
how
the
bill
would
protect
victims
she
said
she
added
that
proposed
law
is
necessary
because
victims
will
be
more
likely
to
report
crimes
if
they
know
their
personal
information
will
be
kept
confidential
we
want
victims
to
come
forward
she
said
we
need
to
do
everything
we
can
to
protect
them
to
protect
their
privacy
under
current
state
law
victims
address
information
can
only
be
obtained
if
a
person
goes
to
a
police
agency
and
signs
a
declaration
saying
they
are
a
member
of
the
media
or
the
government
according
to
peter
scheer
the
executive
director
of
the
first
amendment
coalition
a
public
records
advocacy
organization
although
baca
acknowledged
that
news
organizations
never
publish
victim
s
addresses
he
said
the
bill
was
necessary
to
prevent
victims
from
being
further
victimized
by
people
who
can
learn
their
addresses
baca
singled
out
bloggers
as
a
main
target
for
the
bill
saying
they
would
be
more
likely
to
publish
addresses
of
crime
victims
because
they
do
not
subscribe
to
any
ethical
canon
the
reality
is
that
bloggers
today
are
considered
journalists
baca
said
it
makes
no
sense
for
a
victim
to
be
further
traumatized
by
having
their
name
and
home
address
scattered
around
the
u
s
as
bloggers
do
baca
could
not
cite
any
specific
cases
in
which
bloggers
published
a
victim
s
address
but
he
said
the
bill
was
intended
to
keep
that
from
happening
scheer
said
the
public
records
law
already
allows
police
the
appropriate
level
of
discretion
in
releasing
the
names
of
victims
and
he
too
could
not
think
of
a
single
example
of
a
victim
being
preyed
upon
because
their
address
was
given
out
to
the
media
i
m
also
not
aware
of
anything
bad
that
s
happened
under
the
current
law
said
scheer
one
would
expect
a
little
more
than
just
pure
speculation
on
the
part
of
the
sponsors
about
the
need

the

american
legal

have

to
stop
the

arguing
that
the
constitution
preempts
states
from
enforcing
federal
law
and
that
the
measure
will
lead
to
racial

the

cooperation

they

the

pg
a
length

recent
statistics
indicating
that
crime
in
los
angeles
has
dropped
to
the
lowest
level
in
more
than
years
is
most
encouraging
above
all
it
s
a
testament
to
the
joint
efforts
of
our
political
leaders
and
law
enforcement
agencies
working
together
to
improve
our
quality
of
life
however
we
cannot
rest
on
our
laurels
but
must
continue
to
pursue
strategies
that
will
ensure
that
crime
in
our
communities
will
continue
to
decline
there
are
obviously
numerous
methods
that
can
be
employed
to
deter
criminal
activity
one
of
these
might
surprise
you
and
that
is
quality
early
childhood
education
research
shows
that
children
who
receive
a
quality
early
childhood
education
are
less
likely
to
turn
to
crime
later
in
life
that
is
an
outcome
that
has
major
implications
for
our
communities
as
public
safety
routinely
ranks
among
the
top
priorities
listed
by
the
public
and
elected
officials
the
question
then
becomes
should
we
invest
resources
to
ensure
access
to
effective
and
affordable
early
education
programs
especially
for
children
most
at
risk
for
school
failure
and
future
criminal
activity
the
answer
is
yes
if
we
wish
to
produce
future
generations
of
productive
citizens
who
are
disinclined
to
get
in
trouble
with
the
law
we
simply
cannot
afford
not
to
invest
in
early
childhood
education
because
the
evidence
is
clear
early
education
such
as
preschool
helps
reduce
crime
according
to
an
independent
survey
by
fight
crime
invest
in
kids
california
an
anti
crime
organization
an
overwhelming
percent
of
the
nation
s
law
enforcement
leaders
chose
the
provision
of
more
after
school
and
educational
child
care
programs
such
as
preschools
as
the
most
effective
strategy
for
reducing
youth
violence
and
crime
furthermore
consider
michigan
s
high
scope
perry
preschool
program
which
served
and
year
olds
from
low
income
families
children
randomly
assigned
to
a
control
group
that
did
not
attend
preschool
were
five
times
more
likely
to
have
become
chronic
lawbreakers
by
age
than
those
assigned
to
attend
the
preschool
program
today
there
are
only
about
licensed
preschool
spaces
available
for
year
olds
in
los
angeles
county
meaning
about
half
of
children
are
left
out
in
many
neighborhoods
the
problem
is
much
worse
publicly
funded
programs
like
state
preschool
and
head
start
are
available
to
some
but
only
the
poorest
families
qualify
and
spaces
are
scarce
at
any
given
time
tens
of
thousands
of
children
languish
on
a
waiting
list
for
spaces
in
publicly
funded
programs
private
preschools
often
cost
too
much
for
working
and
middle
class
families
even
when
chosen
from
the
long
waiting
lists
for
those
programs
that
is
why
we
believe
that
if
california
intends
to
continue
to
reduce
crime
additional
state
and
federal
money
should
be
found
so
that
all
children
can
have
access
to
quality
early
childhood
education
programs
los
angeles
universal
preschool
a
nonprofit
organization
funded
by
first
la
is
doing
its
part
currently
making
it
possible
for
about
children
to
attend
quality
preschool
at
affiliated
sites
in
los
angeles
county
at
little
or
no
cost
to
their
families
but
more
needs
to
be
done
according
to
the
rand
corp
for
every
dollar
we
invest
in
quality
preschool
the
public
saves
in
crime
prevention
special
education
needs
and
other
social
costs
other
prominent
studies
show
an
even
greater
rate
of
return
to
our
society
the
message
is
clear
quality
preschool
programs
are
a
wise
public
investment
and
one
of
our
most
effective
weapons
against
crime
in
fact
it
costs
about
a
year
to
incarcerate
a
young
person
that
would
cover
the
annual
enrollment
of
eight
to
children
in
a
quality
preschool
despite
that
the
number
of
children
enrolled
in
california
preschools
remains
well
below
the
national
average
there
s
little
doubt
that
making
quality
preschool
programs
available
to
more
children
is
crucial
to
an
effective
balanced
crime
prevention
strategy
continuing

ensure

many

however
have
proven
to

successful
in

the

in

so

none

said
in
buffalo
veterans
are
paired
with
mentors
and
must
adhere
to
strict
requirements
such
as
structured
treatment
and
regular
court
appearances
the
experiment
has
been
so
successful
that
roughly
two
dozen
other
court
districts
in
the
united
states
have
set
up
similar
programs
including
orange
county
federal
legislators
are
also
looking
to
pass

that
would

largely
by

estimates

with
stress

anywhere
from

when

dying
when

said
young
who
spent
a
year
in

during
the
vietnam
war
in
young
spearheaded
the
creation
of
a
free
yearlong
class
for
veterans
convicted
of
domestic
violence
offering
soldiers
a
similar
alternative
to
prison
or
jail
the
class
offers
a
space
for
veterans
to
talk
about
their
war
experiences
with
their
peers
it
s
based
on
a
simple
idea
veterans
unlike
the
general
population
were
taught
directly
to
be
violent
young
said
if
my
country
is
going
to
teach
me
how
to
be
violent
then
give
me
a
break
if
i
develop
some
symptoms
as
a
result
of
that
neither
young
nor
lonergan
believes
veterans
should
be
given
a
free
pass
but
they
do
believe
their
cases
should
be
given
special
attention
lonergan
noted
that
this
new

is
one
of
the
rare
examples
of

the

over

the

sheriff

touted

murders
in

in
were
down
about
percent
rutherford
said
other
violent
crimes
by
percent
and
property
crimes
by
percent
as
reasons
for
the
reductions
rutherford
cited
having
more
police
officers
more
community
involvement
and
a
new
top
prosecutor
angela
corey
rutherford
takes
every
chance
he
can
to
pummel
former
state
attorney
harry
shorstein
so
it
s
not
surprising
that
he
s
pumping
up
the
performance
of
corey
but
unless
corey
is
having
a
heckuva
impact
nationwide
what
s
the
explanation
for
crime
dropping
in
florida
and
across
the
country
there
are
a
number
of
theories
while
you
would
think
crime
would
go
up
during
a
deep
recession
criminologists
say
that
historically
that
s
not
the
case
going
back
to
the
great
depression
george
kelling
a
criminal
justice
scholar
at
rutgers
university
told
the
los
angeles
times
that
one
reason
might
be
that
because
of
layoffs
more
people
are
at
home
and
serving
as
guardians
in
their
neighborhoods
michael
hallett
the
chairman
of
the
department
of
criminology
and
criminal
justice
at
the
university
of
north
florida
said
this
about
crime
during
a
bad
economy
domestic
violence
goes
up
but
opportunity
crimes
go
down
with
decreased
circulation
of
people
out
at
night
decreased
money
flowing
through
the
markets
including
the
illicit
drug
markets
turf
battles
are
less
intense
over
territory
and
there
are
fewer
arrests
meaning
snitching
violence
decreases
as
well
and
james
alan
fox
a
criminologist
at
northeastern
university
offered
this
suggestion
to
the
associated
press
as
to
why
crime
rates
are
dropping
the
country
s
aging
population
as
the
over
population
grows
crime
goes
down
fox
said
about
the
drop
in
auto
thefts
which
rutherford
attributes
to
a
new
law
that
makes
it
difficult
to
dispose
of
stolen
cars
a
police
commander
offered
a
different
explanation
to
the
los
angeles
times
for
a
similar
reduction
in
that
city
vehicles
are
getting
much
harder
to
steal
andy
smith
told
the
times
a
few
years
back
with
all
of
the
old
american
cars
it
just
took
a
screwdriver
and
some
yanking
any
joy
rider
could
walk
down
the
street
and
rip
off
a
car
none
of
this
is
to
suggest
that
the
increased
community
involvement
and
smarter
policing
that
rutherford
touts
aren
t
important
but
adding
more
and
more
officers
to
the
department
which
already
eats
up
one
third
of
the
city
s
budget
may
not
be
necessary
if
there
are
other
reasons

he

statement
the
los

police
department
said
mr
gates
had
died
after
a
short
battle
with
cancer
mr
gates
s
aggressive
approach
to
law
enforcement
was
both
admired
for
its
innovation
and
criticized
for
the
racial
unrest
it
provoked
he
began
his
police
career
in
as
a
los
angeles
patrol
officer
it
ended
when
he
was
forced
to
step
down
in
june
the
years
in
between
were
a
raucous
era
in
which
los
angeles
almost
doubled
its
population
while
becoming
overwhelmed
by
drugs
gangs
guns
and
a
tide
of
violent
crime
mr
gates
responded
to
that
climate
by
stressing
discipline
in
the
ranks
of
his
strong
department
enlarging
the
police
presence
in
the
streets
and
developing
new
policing
tools
he
pioneered
the
use
of
police
helicopters
to
fight
crime
across
the
city
and
he
helped
develop
the
special
weapons
and
tactics
unit
or
swat
which
was
made
up
of
mobile
teams
of
highly
trained
officers
as
los

grew
more
dense
and
diverse
as
crime
increased
and
as
cultural
mores
and
racial
attitudes
shifted
in
the
s
his
oversight
of
the
department
came
under
mounting
criticism
black
and
hispanic
residents
accused
the
police
of
treating
them
harshly
and
mr
gates
of
doing
little
to
rein
in
his
officers
the
criticism
intensified
in
march
when
rodney
king
a
black
convicted
robber
and
parolee
was
viciously
beaten
by
white
officers
after
a
high
speed
car
chase
the
beating
was
videotaped
by
a
bystander
and
repeatedly
broadcast
around
the
world
provoking
widespread
revulsion
and
an
intense
national
debate
about
police
brutality
race
relations
poverty
and
mr
gates
s
leadership
in
april
four
white
officers
accused
of
assault
in
the
beating
of
mr

were
acquitted
by

all

the
decision
set
off

days
of
rioting
which
left

dead

faulted

this
explanation
about
why
arizona

wrong
the
tragedy
of

is
its
totally
flawed
reasoning
that

some

are
illegal

reported
mac
donald
a
contributing
editor
at
city
journal
and
a
fellow
at
the
manhattan
institute
yet
in
cities
where
the
crime
these
aliens
commit
is
the
highest
the
police
cannot
use
the
most
obvious
tool
to
apprehend
them
their
immigration
status
in
los

for
example
dozens
of
members
of
a
ruthless
salvadoran
prison
gang
have
sneaked
back
into

after
having
been
deported
for
such
crimes
as
murder
assault
with
a
deadly

and
drug
trafficking
the

in

repeatedly
going
down

up

these

officers
know
who
they
are
and
know
that
their
mere

is
a
felony
explained
mac
donald
yet
should
a
cop
arrest
an

gangbanger
for
felonious
re
entry
it
is
he
who
will
be
treated
as
a
criminal
for
violating
the
lapd
s
rule
against
enforcing
immigration
law
rooted
in
ideas
like
mahony
s
everyone
in
god
s
eyes
is
legal
policies
establishing
sanctuary
prohibit
city
employees
including
police
in
los

and
other
cities
from
reporting

the

reported
mac
donald
up

two
thirds
of

additionally
a

california

study

mafia
the
dominant
force
in

distribution
schemes

drive
by

mac
donald
s
conclusion
the
immigrant
population
has
grown
so
large
that
public
officials
are
terrified
of
alienating
it
even
at
the

of
ignoring
