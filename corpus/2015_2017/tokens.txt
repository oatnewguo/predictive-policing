n
courts
all
over
the
united
states
have
struggled
to
define
high
crime
area
since
the
supreme
court
s
decision
in
illinois
v
wardlow
n
wardlow
essentially
reduced
the
reasonable

totality
of
the
circumstances
analysis
to
a
two
factor
test
in
certain
geographic
areas
permitting
the
characterization
of
a
neighborhood
as
high
crime
to
serve
as
a
plus
factor
for
finding
reasonable
suspicion
n
however
the
wardlow
court
failed
to
define
the
term
high
crime
area
n
furthermore
the
court
did
not
offer
any
guidance
regarding
the
evidentiary
showing
necessary
to
corroborate
a
police
officer
s
assertion
that
a
neighborhood
has
a
high
propensity
for
crime
n
lacking
guidance
the
lower
courts
have
taken
a
haphazard
approach
to
defining
the
term
high
crime
area
leading
to
amorphous
and
inconsistent
definitions
across
jurisdictions
n
thus
courts
have
generally
deferred
to
a
police
officer
s
subjective
belief
that
an
area
is
high
crime
and
have
not
required
law
enforcement
agencies
to
corroborate
an
officer
s
belief
with
quantitative
evidence

the
courts
failure
to
require
law
enforcement
agencies
to
present
concrete
evidence
demonstrating
that
a
neighborhood
has
a
heightened
propensity
for
crime
raises
significant
constitutional
concerns

defined
as
high
crime
tend
to
disproportionately
represent
low

courts
deference
to
police
officers
subjective
experiences
has
created
significant
animosity
between
the
residents
of
these
neighborhoods
and
law
enforcement
n
the
high
crime
label
often
coincides
with
an
increased
police
presence
in
these
neighborhoods
n
moreover
using
the
high
crime
designation
as
a
plus
factor
in
a
two
factor
totality
of
the
circumstances
test
lowers
the
threshold
for
reasonable
suspicion
in
these
neighborhoods
and
ultimately
strips
residents
of
critical
constitutional
protections
n
thus
individuals
living
in
these
neighborhoods
do
not
enjoy
the
same
level
of
fourth
amendment
protections
as
individuals
residing
in
wealthier
whiter
neighborhoods
n
however
the
prevalent
use
of
predictive
policing
software
and
its
increasing
sophistication
provides
courts
with
an
opportunity
to
narrowly
define
high
crime
areas
based
on
both
geography
and
specific
crime
type
requiring
law
enforcement
to
use
narrow
crime
specific
definitions

compstat
to
compile
statistical
data
to
show
when
and
where
different
types
of
crime
occurred
in
the
city
n
the
nypd
used
this
data
to
distribute
personnel
and
tailor
its
policing
strategies
to
address
these
hotspots
of
criminal
activity
revolutionizing
the
nypd
s
operations
n
under
the
compstat
system
data
was
collected
and
analyzed
weekly
and
precinct
commanders
met
every
few
weeks
with
the
department
s
leadership
to
discuss
crime
statistics
and
modify
their
policing
strategies
as
needed
n
compstat
s
implementation
created
a
constant
feedback
loop
for
the
nypd
and
coincided
with
a
staggering
decline
in
crime
in
new
york
city
n
police
departments
across
the
united
states
began
using
the
compstat
system
after
they
learned
about
the
nypd
s
success
n
although
experts
continue
to
debate
the
role
of
compstat
in
facilitating
new
york
city
s
declining
crime
rate
in
the
s
and
early
s
n
this
software
paved
the
way
for
the
development
of
the
latest
emerging
predictive
policing
technologies
which
are
used
today
by
law
enforcement
agencies
across
the
united
states
n
a
general
overview
of
new
predictive
policing
technologies
the
development
of
next
generation
predictive
policing
programs
has
garnered
not
only
national
attention
but
also
federal
financing
because
of
the
software
s
cost
effectiveness
high
tech
image
and
promising
test
results
n
the
latest
predictive
policing
programs
appear
to
reduce
crime
without
significantly
disrupting
other
policing
efforts
in
the
small
geographic
areas
where
they
have
been
tested
n
moreover
in
an
era
of
significant
budget
cuts
law
enforcement
agencies
are
taking
advantage
of
the
fact
that
this
software
seamlessly
blends
into
their
existing
crime
fighting
operations
and
saves
money
by
more
efficiently
allocating
resources
n
predictive
policing
technology
is
built
upon
the
popular
understanding
that
criminals
are
creatures
of
habit
they
repeatedly
commit
the
same
types
of
crimes
at
around
the
same
time
of
day
in
the
same
geographic
area
n
studies
have
generally
shown
that
certain
property
crimes
such
as
burglary
are
highly
predictable
n
generally
predictive
policing
models
rely
on
an
assumption
that
criminals
are
rational
decision
makers
who
commit
crimes
by
exploiting
opportunities
created
under
certain
conditions
n
the
latest
predictive
policing
software
uses
years
sometimes
decades
worth
of
crime
reports
and
the
algorithm
analyses
sic
the
data
to
identify
areas
with
high
probabilities

types
of
crime

n
captain
john
romero
of
the
los
angeles
police
department
explains
burglars
tend
to
be
territorial
so
once
they
find
a
neighborhood
where
they
get
good
stuff
they
come
back
again
and
again
and
that
assists
the
algorithm
in
placing
the
boxes
n
historically
the
use
of
predictive
policing
technologies
has
been
limited
to
tracking
analyzing
and
predicting
property
crimes
n
because
the
software
was
designed
to
predict
where
and
when
crime
is
mostly
likely
to
occur
not
who
will
commit
it
n
however
unlike
compstat
which
relied
on
data
of
past
criminal
activity
to
extrapolate
patterns
and
predict
future
criminal
activity
the
new
generation
of
predictive
policing
technologies
is
forward
looking
and
truly
predictive
n
as
will
be
described
below
the
latest
software

analyze
vast
and
complex
data
sets
in
near
real
time
speeds
to
reveal
previously
unseen
patterns
of
crimes
n
as
the
capabilities
of
these
programs
have
advanced
police
departments
have
begun
to
experiment
with
using
the
software
to
predict
other
types
of
crimes
such
as
gun
violence
and
gang
activity
n
although
predictive
policing
technology
has
many
potential
uses
n
this
note
focuses
on
how
this
software
can
be
used
by
law
enforcement
and
the
courts
to
identify
and
classify
high
crime
areas
by
specific
crime
type
and
geography
to
illustrate
how
this
software
works
and
what
it
is
capable

and
the

terrain
model
rtm
b
the
near
repeat
model
the
near
repeat
model
for
predictive
policing
technology
assumes
that
crime
spreads
through
local
environments
on
a
micro
scale
like
a
contagious
disease
n
thus
when
certain
crimes
occur
at
a
location
these
crimes
tend
to
create
repeat
criminal
activity
in
the
same
location
n
professor
mohler
of
santa
clara
university
has
created
an
earthquake
modeling
algorithm
based
on
this
near
repeat
model
n
the
earthquake
modeling
algorithm
draws
a
grid
over
a
jurisdiction
and
estimates
the
background
rate
at
which
new
crime
appears
in
each
cell
of
the
grid
n
when
a
new
crime
occurs
in
a
cell
the
algorithm
assumes
that
the
rate
for
the
new
crime
will
temporarily
increase
like
an
aftershock
following
an
earthquake
n
over
time
the
rate
for
new
crime
declines
the
longer
the
cell
goes
without
seeing
any
new
crime
similar
to
how
the
aftershocks
of

diminish
over

up

up
again
in
really
complicated
ways
that
are
just
very
very
difficult
if
not
impossible
for
the
individual
to
intuit
n
thus
to
ensure
accuracy
when
using
the
near
repeat
model
agencies
must
regularly
input
new
data
into
the
software
because
without
up
to
date
information
the
utility
of
the
software
s
predictions
will
diminish
over
time
n
software
based
on
the
near
repeat
model
has
a
high
rate
of
success
for
predicting
where
and
when
burglaries
are
likely
to
occur
in
an
area
n
although
the
near
repeat
model
can
accurately
predict
patterns
in
property
crimes
it
is
unclear
whether
this
model
can
effectively
forecast
other
types
of
crime
such
as
gun
violence
or
crimes
of
passion
n
however
the
results
of
one
study
were
promising
the
study
showed
that
the
near
repeat
model
accurately
forecasted
the
location
of
violent
rival
gang
related
activity
n
these
findings
support
the
proposition
that
in
evidence
suppression
hearings
courts
could
rely
on
statistical
outputs
from
predictive
policing
software
to
evaluate
a
police

a

area
c
risk
terrain
modeling
rtm
the
risk
terrain
model
serves
as
the
foundation
for
some
predictive
policing
software
rtm
uses
geographic
information
systems
to
identify
geographic
features
that
contribute
to
elevated
crime
risk
and
overlays
them
onto
a
base
map
n
potential
geographic
features
used
to
predict
crime
risk
in
this
model
include
bars
liquor
stores
and
strip
clubs
n
rtm
is
akin
to
a
base
map
with
layers
of
tracing
paper
laid
on
top
of
it
as
more
environmental
features
are
plotted
on
top
of
each
other
clusters
of
potential
criminal
activity
are
revealed
based
on
these
existing
features
n
the
model
s
algorithm
then
makes
predictions
about
an
area
s
risk
for
crime
based
on
how
close
the
selected
geographic
location
is
to
identified
environmental
features
n
unlike
the
near
repeat
model
the
rtm
predicts
crimes
based
on
the
interactions
between
behavioral
social
physical
and
environmental
factors
instead
of
solely

about
where

when

d
general
limitations
of

although

provides
law
enforcement
agencies
with
a
powerful
tool
that
can
help
them
efficiently
allocate
crime
fighting
resources
these
technologies
have
some
common
limitations
first
effective
use
of
predictive
policing
technologies
requires
reliability
transparency
and
accuracy
in
data
collection
and
analysis
without
safeguards
in
place
data
is
susceptible
to
human
fallibility
n
second
taken
alone
predictive
policing
software
cannot
establish
the
requisite
level
of
particularized
suspicion
required
to
perform
a
lawful
terry
stop
premised
on
reasonable
suspicion
n
humans
create
data
which
leaves
it
fallible
to
human
error
currently
there
are
no
uniform
standards
or
best
practices
in
place
to
guide
police
departments
as
they
collect
the
data
that
will
be
used
as
inputs
for
statistical
analysis
data
creation
requires
humans
to
select
what
information
to
collect
and
what
information
to
discard
similar
to
the
old
adage
garbage
in
garbage
out
n
an
uninformed
user
may
believe
that
the
representation
of
previously
unseen
truths
generated
by
predictive
policing
software
tells
an
entirely
objective
story
n
however
this
is
not
the
case
because
data
is
something
we
create
n
by
making
choices
about
what
information
to
collect
and
the
method
used
to
collect
it
thus
police
departments
and
courts
should
proceed
cautiously
when
evaluating
the
statistical
outputs
from
predictive
policing
algorithms
because
the
word
data
connotes
fixed
numbers
inside
hard
grids
of
information
and
as
a
result
it
is
easily
mistaken
for
fact
n
moreover
humans
select
the
language
used
to
describe
data
there
is
no
mandatory
program
in
place
to
guide
data
classification
unfortunately
there
is
a
common
misconception
that
local
law
enforcement
agencies
are
required
to
conform
to
the
federal
bureau
of
investigation
s
fbi
uniform
crime
reporting
ucr
program
standards
to
classify
crimes
n
however
when
reviewing
the
ucr
handbook
it
becomes
clear
that
this
program
is
permissive
and
the
fbi
merely
recommends
that
agencies
conform
to
its
classification
system
n
as
the
fbi
explains
on
its
website
offense
definitions
may
vary
from
state
to
state
and
the
fbi
asks
agencies
to
report
offenses
not
according
to
local
or
state
statutes
but
according
to
those
guidelines
provided
in
the
handbook
n
the
fbi
notes
that
most
agencies
make
a
good
faith
effort
to
comply
with
established
guidelines
n
however
compliance
is
not
required
hence
law
enforcement
agencies
have
discretion
to
describe
crime
data
even
when
reporting
to
the
fbi
under
the
ucr
program
n
as
such
one
might
say
the
data
is
only
as
good
as
the
people
using
it
n
moreover
critics
of
predictive
policing
technologies
suggest
that
data
driven
policing
may
create
self
fulfilling
cycles
of
bias
for
police
departments
using
this
information
to
make
resource
allocation
decisions
n
for
example
if
statistical
outputs
suggest
that
a
neighborhood
is
a
high
crime
area
a
law
enforcement
agency
may
police
that
area
more
heavily
than
others
this
increased
police
presence
may
in
turn
generate
more
arrests
in
the
neighborhood
because
of
the
increased
crime
detection
capacity
thus
when
new
arrest
data
is
added
to
the
predictive
policing
software
it
may
reinforce
a
department
s
original
prediction
by
directing
crime
fighting
resources
to
an
area
that
is
already
heavily
policed
the
algorithm
then
gives
the
impression
that
there
are
heightened
levels
of
criminal
activity
in
that
neighborhood
when
in
reality
more
criminals
are
getting
caught
because
there
are
more
police
officers
present
to
detect
crime
n
heightened
police
presence
in
a
neighborhood
can
lead
to
more
stop
and
frisks
and
skew
the
data
so
it
appears
that
one
neighborhood
has
a
higher
crime
rate
than
other
areas
n
thus
without
safeguards
in
place
data
analytics
and
data
collection
are
susceptible
to
human
fallibility
predictive

can
be
a
very
useful

it
is
just
that
a

expert
laments

creates
categorical
suspicion
of

be
limited
to
helping

generalized
suspicion
about

however
the

has
chipped
away
at
this
constitutional
protection
since
its
groundbreaking
decision
in
terry
v

in
n
the
terry
court
carved
out
an
exception
to
the
probable

developed
a
new
threshold
standard
of
reasonable
suspicion

in

further
weakened

a
police

must
point
to
specific
and
articulable
facts
which
taken
together
with
rational
inferences
from

facts
reasonably
warrant
that
intrusion

a
practical
nontechnical
conception

balancing
direct
observations
of
a
suspect
s
behavior
and
the
entire

to
establish
particularized
suspicion
that

activity
is
afoot

in

to
perform
a
lawful
terry
stop
an
officer
needs
more
than
a
hunch
he
must
directly
observe

the
officer
must
demonstrate
that

the
suspect
somehow
distinguished

the
scope

the
search
must
be
strictly
tied
to
and
justified
by
the

rendered
its
initiation
permissible

the
terry
court
viewed
this
new
reasonable
suspicion
standard
as
carving
out
limited
exceptions
to
the
general
rule
that
seizures
of
the
person
require
probable
cause
to
arrest

are
two
scenarios
in

lawful
terry
stops
arise

first
type
of
terry
stop
occurs
when
an
officer
fears
imminent
danger
to
himself
and
the
context
in
which
the
terry
court
envisioned
these
stops
would
occur
n
in
this
situation
an
officer
can
conduct
an
over
the
clothes
pat
down
of
a
suspect
limited
to
a
search
for
weapons
n
the
second
scenario
developed
after
the
terry
decision
n
it
arises
when
an
officer
observes
a
suspect
s
behavior
and
believes
that
a
specific
type
of
criminal
activity
is
afoot
based
on
these
observations
n
in
this
scenario
an
officer
s
search
should
be
limited
to
frisking
for
evidence
related
to
the
specific
suspected
criminal
activity
n
for
example
a
police
officer
observes
members
of
hell
s
angels
outside
of
a
motorcycle
shop
after
observing
their
behavior
the
officer
suspects
that
they
intend
to
rob
the
shop
an
officer
may
lawfully
perform
a
limited
over
the
clothes
frisk
for
a
commercial
grade
lock
cutter
or
other
typical
burglary
tools
n
terry
stops
performed
under
the
purview
of
the
second
scenario
can
be
problematic
when
chief
justice
warren
wrote
the
terry
opinion
he
recognized
that
the
seizure
of
a
person
is
more
than
a
mere
minor
inconvenience
and
petty
indignity
rather
it
is
a
serious
intrusion
upon
the
sanctity
of
the
person
which
may
inflict
great
indignity
and
arouse
strong
resentment
and
it
is
not
to
be
undertaken
lightly
n
he
pointed
to
then
current
police
scholarship
to
underscore
his
concerns
that
police
officers
may
abuse
their
authority
to
stop
and
frisk
and
use
it
as
a
means
to
maintain
the
image
of

power
and
control

further
minimized
the

dramatically
expanded

many
wardlow
critics
have
questioned
whether

any
more
indicative

decision
has
significantly
weakened
the
fourth

protections
provided
to
individuals
living

areas
labeled

the

neighborhood
character
alone
could
not
justify
an
officer
s
finding

still
requires
a

officer
to
have

factor

particularized
suspicion
appears
to
carry
more
weight

alone
an

mere
presence
in

without
indicia
that

not
be
enough
to
justify

subjective
belief

to
offer
facts

his
testimony

have
labeled
an

any
data
to

this

generally
courts

typically
do
not

to
present
quantitative

are
rarely
introduced
in

prove
that

stop
actually
occurred
in
a
high

area
n
for
example
in
united
states
v
baskin
the
seventh
circuit
expressly
rejected
the
argument
that
the
government
must
produce
specific
data
to
establish
that
a
location
is
a
high
crime
area
n
the
court
held
that
the
location
of
baskin
s
unprovoked
flight
remained
a
relevant
factor
because
the
terry
stop
occurred
near
a
newly
discovered
methamphetamine
lab
in
a
county
park
n
the
court
accepted
the
government
s
decision
to
designate
a
park
as
a
high
crime
area
without
requiring
the
government
to
present
any
actual
data
to
support
its
assertion
n
the
lack
of
rigor
used
to
establish
an
objective
basis
for
defining
an
area
as
high
crime
has
frustrated
some
judges
n
many
judges
and
scholars
have
expressed
their
concern
about
the
continued
erosion
of
fourth
amendment
protections
in
neighborhoods
haphazardly
designated
as
high
crime
n
for
example
the
majority
opinion
in
united
states
v
montero
carmargo
stated
that
the
court
must
be
careful
that
the
high
crime
label
does
not
just
blanket
communities
in
which
members
of
minority
groups
regularly
go
about
their
daily
business
but
is
limited
to
specific
circumscribed
locations
where
particular
crimes
occur
with
unusual
regularity
n
although
the
montero
carmargo
court
expressed
that
it
wanted
to
exercise
caution
when
applying
the
high
crime
label
it
failed
to
employ
this
rigor
n
judge
kozinski
criticizes
the
majority
for
deferring
to
the
two
arresting
officers
perception
of
an
area
as
high
crime
as
sufficient
to
label
it
as
such
n
he
warns
to
rely
on
every
cop
s
repertoire
of
war
stories
to
determine
what
is
a
high
crime
area
and
on
that
basis
to
treat
otherwise
innocuous
behavior
as
grounds
for
reasonable
suspicion
strikes
me
as
an
invitation
to
trouble
n
judge
kozinski
further
laments
the
question
is
not
whether
the
characteristics
of
the
area
may
be
taken
into
account
but
how
these
characteristics
are
established
in
our
first
opinion
to
interpret
this
language
from
wardlow
the
majority
adopts
a
methodology
for
establishing
the
characteristics
of
the

is

continuing
to
permit

ambiguous
definitions

areas
comes
at
a
significant
cost
to
the
people
who
live
in

neighborhoods
as
noted
previously
the
high
crime
label
tends
to
attach
to
hypersegregated
low
income
minority
neighborhoods
across
the
united
states
n
many
of
these
neighborhoods
became
saturated
with
police
officers
when
the
united
states
began
its
war
on
drugs
during
the
reagan
administration
n
heavy
policing
of
these
low
income
minority
neighborhoods
has
led
to
a
disproportionate
number
of
people
of
color
being
stopped
and
frisked
n
the
wardlow
court
s
transformation
of
the
reasonable
suspicion
totality
of
the
circumstances
test
into
a
two
factor
test
has
made
it
even
easier
for
police
officers
to
justify
terry
stops
in
these
alleged
high
crime
areas
because
courts
are
deferential
to
police
officers
subjective
beliefs
about
elevated
crime
rates
in
particular
neighborhoods
n
thus
the
reduction
of
the
reasonable
suspicion
test
into
a
two
factor
test
and
the
structural
racism
built
into
our
criminal
justice
system
has
helped
fuel
a
culture
of
mass
incarceration
and
has
disproportionately
affected
low
income
minority
neighborhoods
n
mass
incarceration
refers
to
the
american
cultural
phenomenon
of
the
imprisonment
of
comparatively
and
historically
high
proportions
of
the
population
that
cannot
be
accounted
for
by
changes
in
crime
rates
n
currently
the
united
states
has
the
largest
reported
incarcerated
population
in
the
world
and
by
far
the
highest
rate
of
imprisonment
n
the
number
of
prisoners
in
both
federal
and
state
facilities
has
increased
by
nearly
percent
between
and
n
moreover
racial
disparities
in
imprisonment
rates
are
striking

are
disproportionately
overrepresented
in

in
the
new
jim
crow
michelle
alexander
describes
how
the
war
on
drugs
and
the
structural
racism
embedded
in
our
criminal
justice
system
have
devastated
low
income
minority
communities
across
the
united
states
n
the
culture
of
heavy
policing
created
by
the
war
on
drugs
in
low
income
minority
neighborhoods
has
fostered
significant
animosity
between
the
police
and
residents
of
these
neighborhoods
n
alexander
observes
that
even
though
studies
show
that
rates
of
drug
use
are
similar
across
races
each
year
a
disproportionate
number
of
african
american
men
are
swept
into
the
criminal
justice
system
for
low
level
drug
offenses
because
of
racially
biased
police
discretion
n
many
scholars
and
law
enforcement
agencies
have
tried
to
justify
heavily
policing
low
income
minority
neighborhoods
by
arguing
that
residents
of
these
communities
are
more
likely
to
engage
in
illegal
activity
outdoors
and
in
plain
sight
than
in
higher
income
areas
n
these
agencies
argue
that
concentrating
drug
enforcement
efforts
in
these
neighborhoods
enables
them
to
efficiently
allocate
resources
while
combating
illegal
activity
n
however
unlike
their
wealthier
neighbors
who
would
not
tolerate
heavy
policing
residents
of
low
income
minority
neighborhoods
often
lack
power
in
our
political
system
leaving
them
vulnerable
to
this
biased
policing
n
as
alexander
notes
hypersegregation
has
made
the
round
up
easy
confined
to
ghetto
areas
and
lacking
political
power
the
black
poor
are
convenient
targets
n
heavy
policing
of
these
low
income
neighborhoods
has
created
an
expectation
among
residents
particularly
among
young
black
men
that
they
will
be
stopped
interrogated
and
frisked
numerous
times
in
the
course
of
a
month
or
even
a
single
week
n
in
her
book
alexander
shares
a
story
from
a
law
student
who
participated
in
a
ride
along
with
a
chicago
police
officer
the
student
described
how
each
time
we
drove
into
a
public
housing
project
and
stopped
the
car
every
young
black
man
in
the
area
would
almost
reflexively
place
his
hands
up
against
the
car
and
spread
his
legs
to
be
searched
n
these
regular
encounters
with
law
enforcement
are
problematic
because
they
often
function
as
the
gateway
into
the
criminal
justice
system
for
non
violent
low
level
offenses
such
as
marijuana
possession
n
arrests
for
low
level
non
violent
offenses
have
created
a
climate
where
a
staggering
million
people
are
under
community
correctional
supervision
i
e
on
probation
or
parole
n
moreover
an
individual
does
not
even
need
to
be
convicted
of
a
crime
to
be
barred
from
gainful
employment
access
to
public
housing
or
other
public
assistance
getting
arrested
is
enough
to
essentially
lock
someone
out
of
mainstream
society
n
once
a
person
has
been
swept
into
the
criminal
justice
system
it
is
difficult
to
get
out
n
scholar
loic
wacquant
has
described
this
phenomenon
of
people
cycling
in
and
out
of
prison
and
trapped
by
their
second
class
status
as
a
closed
circuit
of
perpetual
marginality
n
thus
requiring
narrower
definitions
of
high

areas
could
reduce

number
of
terry
stops
that
occur
in

reducing
the

the
role
of
technology
in
fourth
amendment
jurisprudence
the
courts
have
not
only
struggled
with
defining
high
crime
areas
and
applying
wardlow
they
have
also
had
difficulty
evaluating
the
role
that
emerging
technologies
should
play
in
fourth
amendment
analyses
in
recent
years
technology
has
become
increasingly
complex
and
judges
have
had
trouble
staying
abreast
of
the
latest
developments
as
judge
posner
lamented
in
his
book
reflections
on
judging
federal
judges
are
on
the
whole
not
well
adapted
by
training
or
experience
to
the
technological
age
that
we
live
in
n
however
as
new
technologies
develop
the
courts
must
figure
out
how
to
embrace
these
technological
advancements
because
the
law
must
apply
itself
to
the
life
of
a
society
driven
more
and
more
by
technology
and
technological
improvements
n
the
supreme
court
has
yet
to
hear
a
case
specifically
addressing
the
use
of
predictive
policing
technology
however
past
cases
have
required
the
court
to
strike
a
balance
between
permitting
law
enforcement
to
use
emerging
technologies
and
safeguarding
americans
fourth
amendment
protections
n
for
example
when
deciding
whether
police
officers
use
of
a
thermal
imaging
device
constituted
an
unlawful
search
of
a
private
home
in
kyllo
v
united
states
justice
scalia
wrote
it
would
be
foolish
to
contend
that
the
degree
of
privacy
secured
to
citizens
by
the
fourth
amendment
has
been
entirely
unaffected
by
the
advance
of
technology
n
in
this
case
police
officers
suspected
that
kyllo
was
growing
marijuana
in
his
home
and
used
a
thermal
imager
to
determine
if
the
heat
emanating
from
his
home
was
consistent
with
the
high
intensity
heat
lamps
typically
required
to
grow
marijuana
n
although
justice
scalia
recognized
that
the
technology
of
the
particular
device
used
by
the
officers
was
crude
n
he
acknowledged
that
as
technology
evolves
these
devices
have
the
potential
to
reveal
all
human
activity
in
the
home
n
anticipating
that
significant
technological
advancement
was
on
the
horizon
the
court
ruled
that
the
use
of
thermal
imaging
devices
constituted
an
unlawful
search
in
violation
of
the
fourth
amendment
n
moreover
writing
for
the
court
justice
scalia
rejected
a
case
by
case
approach
to
deciding
whether
a
law
enforcement
agency
s
use
of
an
emerging
technology
was
lawful
n
justice
scalia
reasoned
that
before
a
law
enforcement
agency
uses
new
technology
as
part
of
its
policing
efforts
it
must
know
whether
the
use
of
such
technology
is
lawful
so
the
agency
can
adjust
its
policing
strategies
accordingly
n
the
court
s
reasoning
in
a
case
riley
v
california
further
illustrates
the
court
s
preference
for
using
a
long
term
and
uniform
approach
to
evaluating
the
role
of
new
technologies
in
fourth
amendment
jurisprudence
n
the
question
presented
to
the
court
in
riley
was
whether
the
police
may
perform
a
warrantless
search
of
the
digital
information
on
a
cell
phone
seized
from
a
person
who
was
lawfully
arrested
n
writing
for
the
court
chief
justice
roberts
focused
on
the
sophistication
of
emerging
technologies
such
as
the
smartphone
and
highlighted
the
pervasiveness
of
technology
in
our
society
n
he
observed
how
quickly
this
technology
has
evolved
citing
a
pew
research
center
study
from
and
noting
that
even
the
outdated
flip
phone
technology
of
one
of
the
arrestees
had
been
around
for
less
than
years
n
after
describing
the
sophistication
and
prevalence
of
these
smartphones
in
our
daily
lives
the
court
rejected
the
government
s
arguments
for
permitting
warrantless
cell
phone
searches
n
chief
justice
roberts
describes
the
court
s
general
preference
to
provide
clear
guidance
to
law
enforcement
through
categorical
rules
n
quoting
michigan
v
summers
the
court
reasoned
if
police
are
to
have
workable
rules
the
balancing
of
the
competing
interests
must
in
large
part
be
done
on
a
categorical
basis
not
in
an
ad
hoc
case
by
case
fashion
by
individual
police
officers

in
order
to
ensure
that
law
enforcement
agencies
understand
how
they
may
lawfully
use
the
technology
on
which
they
rely
they
need
clear
categorical
rules
delineating
these
parameters
even
for
emerging
technologies
as
judge
posner
further
observes
in
his
book
new
technologies
that
rely
on
complex
mathematical
models
and
statistical
analyses
can
be
particularly
difficult
for
judges
to
understand
when
compared
with
technologies
of
the
past
such
as
the
steam
engine
or
the
automobile
n
he
explains
that
compared
to
the
latest
emerging
technologies
even
when
technologies
of
the
past
were
complex
it
was
easier
to
explain
how
they
worked
to
judges
who
did
not
possess
a
technical
background
n
evaluating
emerging
technologies
places
judges
who
do
not
have
technical
or
scientific
backgrounds
in
uncomfortable
territory

they
must
make
sense
of
the
kinds
of
variables
that

measures
rather
than
the
soft
variables

are
accustomed

however
as
predictive
policing
technologies

increasingly
popular

become
an
essential
law
enforcement
tool
the
courts
will
not
be
able
to
ignore
the
existence
of
these
sophisticated
technologies
in
order
for
law
enforcement
agencies
to
fully
integrate
this
technology
into
their
daily
policing
strategies
and
avoid
running
afoul
of
the
fourth
amendment
these
agencies
need
guidance
from
the
courts
moreover
as
law
enforcement
begins
to
increasingly
rely
on
this
technology
americans
will
expect
courts
to
integrate
the
statistical
outputs
from
these

into
their
reasoning
to
ensure
that

are
protected
thus

this
area
n
for
example
the
fbi
already
uses
the
information
it
gathers
to
generate
reports
that
american
law
enforcement
agencies
can
use
to
guide
their
crime
fighting
strategies
in
areas
as
diverse
as
terrorism
and
white
collar
crime
n
because
the
fbi
has
the
capacity
to
serve
as
a
clearinghouse
for
information
it
is
well
suited
to
develop
best
practices
for
collecting
and
analyzing
data
second
providing
oversight
and
establishing
best
practices
for
the
use
of
predictive
policing
technologies
in
municipal
police
departments
aligns
with
both
the
fbi
s
mission
and
its
goal
of
combating
public
corruption
and
protecting
civil
rights
n
the
fbi
s
mission
is
to
uphold
and
enforce
the
criminal
laws
of
the
united

and
to
provide
leadership
and
criminal
justice
services
to
federal
state
municipal
and
international
agencies
and
partners
n
requiring
the
fbi
to
develop
mandatory
uniform
standards
will
help
the
fbi
further
its
mission
because
the
bureau
will
lead
the
way
by
developing
fair
and
appropriate
technology
based
policing
strategies
moreover
the
fbi
will
further
its
goals
of
combating
public
corruption
and
protecting
civil

by
helping
local
law
enforcement
agencies
understand
the
limitations
of
these

n
creating
data
neutral
policies
for
local
law

to
follow
will
minimize
the
risk
of
unreliable
and

and
help
safeguard
americans
fourth
amendment
protections
third
the
fbi
is
well
equipped
to
provide
neutral
third
party
oversight
because
the
agency
has
an
extensive
and
reputable
community
outreach
program
n
over
time
the
bureau
has
formed
many
successful
partnerships
with
law
enforcement
agencies
in
the
united
states
and
around
the
globe
n
the
fbi
often
calls
upon
former
graduates
of
its
national
academy
to
help
train
police
officers
and
build
interagency
relationships
to
increase
the
effectiveness
of
law
enforcement
operations
n
thus
the
fbi
is
already
a
well
established
and
well
respected
organization
capable
of
working
in
unison
with
the
agencies
around
the
country
to
develop
mandatory
standards
and
best
practices
to
ensure
the
responsible
use
of
predictive
policing
technology
b
establish
mandatory
uniform
standards
and
oversight
to
ensure
fairness
accuracy
reliability
and
transparency
establishing
mandatory
uniform
standards
that
guide
how
data
is
collected
and
entered
into
predictive
policing
programs
provide
for
routine
audits
of
local
law
enforcement
s
predictive
policing
systems
and
guide
how
algorithms
are
written
will
significantly
decrease
potential
risks
associated
with
human
fallibility
in
big
data
collection
n
having
the
fbi
implement
uniform
standards
will
help
safeguard
against
blind
reliance
on
the
forecast
divorced
from
the
reason
for
the
forecast
n
in
police
departments
use
of
predictive
policing
technologies
first
new
mandatory
standards
should
prescribe
procedures
that
ensure
data
is
systematically
gathered
and
entered
into
the
software
on
a
regular
basis
developing
a
uniform
system
for
data
collection
and
entry
will
reinforce
the
accuracy
of
the
system
s
algorithms
maximize
their
objective
predictive
utility
and
help
guard
against
human
bias
after
all
if
the
data
collection
recording
analysis
or
retention
is
flawed
then
the
entire
system
is
called
into
question
n
second
when
developing
these
standards
the
fbi
should
require
police
departments
to
provide
mandatory
predictive
policing
training
to
their
staff
during
this
training
law
enforcement
agencies
would
describe
permissible
methods
for
data
collection
the
limitations
of
this
technology
as
a
crime
fighting
tool
and
the
constitutional
concerns
triggered
by
the
use
of
this
technology
the
fbi
should
also
provide
third
party
oversight
by
conducting
routine
audits
of
predictive
policing
systems
during
these
audits
the
fbi
can
ensure
that
local
police
departments
comply
with
its
mandatory
standards
for
training
data
collection
and
analysis
by
auditing
these
systems
the
fbi
can
effectively
allay
concerns
about
human
manipulation
of
crime
data
n
third
fbi
oversight
is
needed
to
validate
and
test
algorithms
of
predictive
policing
software
requiring
neutral
third
party
testing
of
these
algorithms
ensures
that
they
paint
an
unbiased
picture
of
criminal
activity
and
do
not
create
self
fulfilling
prophecies
of
bias
against
any
demographic
or
geographic
location
n
recently
the
need
for
third
party
monitoring
of
police
practices
to
protect
civil
liberties
was
recognized
in
floyd
v
city
of
new
york
where
the
nypd
was
accused
of
abusing
its
power
to
stop
and
frisk
n
although
floyd
s
procedural
history
led
to
debate
about
the
validity
of
the
court
s
decision
n
the
nypd
consented
to
adhere
to
some
of
judge
scheindlin
s
holdings
primarily
the
nypd
consented
to
allow
third
party
oversight
of
its
aggressive
stop
and
frisk
program
which
led
to
a
disproportionate
number
of
stop
and
frisks
taking
place
in
black
and
latino
neighborhoods
n
similar
to
the
nypd
s
stop
and
frisk
program
predictive
policing
algorithms
require
closer
inspection
when
law
enforcement
uses
predictive
policing
software
to
allocate
resources
civil
liberties
are
at
stake
because
inaccurate
data
collection
and
algorithms
can
lead
to
crime
forecasts
tainted
by
human
bias
in
order
to
avoid
abuses
of
police
power
law
enforcement
must
be
held
accountable
for
their
policing
strategies
especially
in
already
vulnerable
low
income
minority
communities
a
neutral
third
party
testing
requirement
would
also
help
legitimize
this
technology
and
make
judges
more
inclined
to
accept
the
statistical
outputs
from
these
programs
as
evidence
in
the
courtroom
using
the
fbi
as
the
gatekeeper
for
this
testing
would
be
particularly
advantageous
because
it
would
enable
private
companies
developing
proprietary
algorithms
to
maintain
their
trade
secrets
while
simultaneously
ensuring
that
the
quantitative
data
output
from
these
programs
is
reliable
additionally
requiring
mandatory
third
party
testing
and
validation
of
these
programs
will
enable
judges
to
rely
on
the
quantitative
data
presented
to
them
by
parties
in
a
courtroom
without
requiring
judges
to
act
as
statisticians
who
must
parse
complex
algorithms
or
evaluate
the
minutia
of
data
collection
techniques
in
this
scenario
judges
could
defer
to
a
sophisticated
neutral
party
s
opinion
about
the
validity
of
the
data
presented
and
focus
on
requiring
police
departments
to
define
high
crime
areas
with
increased
specificity
and
accuracy
moreover
requiring
police
departments
to
narrowly
define
high
crime
areas
is
no
herculean
task
a
lot
of
crime
data
is
readily
available
and
can
be
plugged
into
common
platforms
such
as
google
earth
thus
communities
need
not
even
rely
on
expensive
proprietary
predictive
policing
software
instead
they
can
use
these
rather
rudimentary
programs
to
track
various
types
of
crime
and
demonstrate
a
propensity
for
a
specific
type
of
crime
at
a
specific
location
c
courts
should
use
predictive
policing
technology
to
create
narrow
definitions
of
high
crime
areas
based
on
both
geography
and
crime
type
neutral
third
party
oversight
can
bolster
the
legitimacy
of
predictive
policing
software
and
transform
how
judges
evaluate
high
crime
classifications
at
evidence
suppression
hearings
across
the
united
states
n
as
the
use
of
this
technology
becomes
a
ubiquitous
part
of
policing
and
standards
are
implemented
to
ensure
data
reliability
judges
should
create
narrowly
defined
high
crime
area
designations
based
on
not
only
geographic
location
but
crime
type
as
well
judges
should
require
law
enforcement
agencies
and
prosecutors
to
present
quantitative
data
to
demonstrate
that
an
area
labeled
as
high
crime
is
in
fact
high
crime
law
enforcement
agencies
will
likely
claim
that
procuring
and
preserving
the
quantitative
data
an
officer
used
to
justify
a
finding
of
reasonable
suspicion
is
too
burdensome
of
a
responsibility
however
this
is
not
the
case
technological
advancements
in
the
united
states
have
created
an
overarching
public
expectation
of
transparency
in
government
n
and
have
made
it
easier
for
government
agencies
to
preserve
data
in
order
to
safeguard
this
transparency
many
americans
believe
that
government
agencies
have
an
institutional
responsibility
to
preserve
data
that
is
critical
to
maintaining
this
transparency
n
the
widespread
growth
of
cloud
computing
has
made
it
easy
for
government
agencies
to
store
vast
quantities
of
data
without
overburdening
their
resources
n
and
fulfill
the
public
s
expectations
for
government
transparency
as
explained
in
part
i
predictive
policing
technologies
have
the
capability
of
not
only
forecasting
where
crime
will
occur
on
a
micro
scale
of
a
foot
radius
but
can
also
predict
the
specific
types
of
crime
that
are
likely
to
occur
at
a
given
location
in
a
community
n
therefore
predictive
policing
software
has
the
capability
of
meaningfully
defining
high
crime
areas
based
on
both
geographic
location
and
crime
type
harnessing
the
full
technological
capabilities
of
this
software
enables
law
enforcement
agencies
to
eliminate
the
vague
and
generic
high
crime
area
label
existing
vague
high
crime
area
definitions
can
be
replaced
by
specific
classifications
of
criminal
activity
such
as
designating
a
location
as
a
high
brown
heroin
drug
trafficking
area
or
high
residential
robbery
area
using
these
crime
specific
classifications
will
help
restore
individuals
fourth
amendment
protections
in
communities
that
were
historically
characterized
as
high
crime
under
wardlow
s
vague
and
overbroad
standard
n
narrowly
defining
crime
areas
can
help
restore
fourth
amendment
protections
by
tightening
the
required
nexus
between
direct
observation
of
suspicious
conduct
and
an
area
s
propensity
for
crime
tightening
this
nexus
will
make
police
officers
more
accountable
for
their
stop
and
frisk
activity
and
limit
the
role
that
a
person
s
presence
in
a
high
crime
area
can
play
when
searching
based
on
reasonable
suspicion
moreover
if
law
enforcement
wants
to
benefit
from
predictive
policing
technology
s
ability
to
predict
crime
in
a
foot
radius
then
law
enforcement
should
be
constrained
by
this
same
specificity
an
officer
should
be
required
to
use
the
same
level
of
specificity
to
prove
that
she
had
reasonable
suspicion
to
perform
a
terry
stop
of
a
suspect
in
an
area
alleged
to
have
a
high
propensity
for
a
specific
crime
type
finally
because
predictive
policing
technology
is
more
objective
than
a
patrol
officer
s
hunch
about
an
area
n
and
harnesses
the
power
of
big
data
to
find
patterns
of
criminal
activity
based
on
statistical
algorithms
judges
should
place
the
burden
on
law
enforcement
agencies
and
prosecutors
to
present
quantitative
data
supporting
their
high
crime
designation
law
enforcement
agencies
and
prosecutors
should
carry
the
burden
of
demonstrating
that
the
data
relied
upon
reflects
a
high
crime
rate
for
the
specific
type
of
criminal
activity
the
police
officer
suspected
was
afoot
for
example
if
we
applied
the
facts
of
terry
v
ohio
to
a
community
using
predictive
policing
software
under
this
proposed
model
would
the
court
still
find
that
officer
mcfadden
the
officer
in
terry
had
the
requisite
reasonable
suspicion
to
perform
a
stop
and
frisk
n
officer
mcfadden
could
meet
the
threshold
requirement
for
particularized
suspicion
because
he
watched
the
suspects
walk
back
and
forth
past
the
jewelry
store
alone
dozens
of
time
and
each
time
stopping
to
peer
in
the
window
n
however
officer
mcfadden
s
finding
of
reasonable
suspicion
could
be
further
bolstered
if
ten
minutes
before
seeing
the
two
suspects
walking
by
the
jewelry
store
the
predictive
policing
software
installed
in
his
patrol
car
corroborated
his
belief
that
the
neighborhood
had
a
high
propensity
for
non
residential
burglary
n
although
the
facts
of
terry
are
straightforward
because
of
the

repetitive
behavior
this
example
demonstrates
how
a
court
could
use

as

tool
to
decide

n
text
introduction
the
fourth
amendment
requires
reasonable
suspicion
to
stop
a
suspect
n
as
a
general
matter
police
officers
develop
this
suspicion
based
on
information
they
know
or
activities
they
observe
suspicion
is
individualized
to
a
particular
person
at
a
particular
place
n
most
reasonable
suspicion
cases
involve
police
confronting
unknown
suspects
engaged
in
observable
suspicious
activities
n
essentially
the
reasonable
suspicion
doctrine
is
based
on
small
data
discrete
facts
limited
information
and
little
knowledge
about
the
suspect
n
but
what
happens
if
this
small
data
suspicion
is
replaced
by
big
data
suspicion
n
what
if
police
can
know
personal
information
about
the
suspect
by
searching
vast
networked
information
sources
the
rise
of
big
data
technologies
offers
a
challenge
to
the
traditional
paradigm
of
fourth
amendment
law
with
little
effort
officers
can
now
identify
most
unknown
suspects
not
through
their
observations
but
by
accessing
a
web
of
information
containing
extensive
personal
data
about
suspects
n
new
data
sources
including
law
enforcement
databases
third
party
records
and
predictive
analytics
combined
with
biometric
or
facial
recognition
software
allow
officers
access
to
information
with
just
a
few
search
queries
n
at
some
point
inferences
from
this
personal
data
independent
of
the
observation
may
become
sufficiently
individualized
and
predictive
to
justify
the
seizure
of
a
suspect
the
question
this
article
poses
is
whether
a
fourth
amendment
stop
can
be
predicated
on
the
aggregation
of
specific
and
individualized
but
otherwise
noncriminal
factors
for
example
suppose
police
are
investigating
a
series
of
robberies
in
a
particular
neighborhood
arrest
photos
from
a
computerized
database
are
uploaded
in
patrol
cars
facial
recognition
software
scans
people
on
the
street
n
suddenly
there
is
a
match
police
recognize
a
known
robber
in
the
targeted
neighborhood
the
suspect
s
personal
information
scrolls
across
the
patrol
car
s
computer
screen
prior
robbery
arrests
prior
robbery
convictions
and
a
list
of
criminal
associates
also
involved
in
robberies
n
the
officer
then
searches
additional
sources
of
third
party
data
including
the
suspect
s
gps
location
information
for
the
last
six
hours
or
license
plate
records
which
tie
the
suspect
to
pawn
shop
trades
close
in
time
to
prior
robberies
n
the
police
now
have
particularized
individualized
suspicion
about
a
man
who
is
not
doing
anything
overtly
criminal
or
perhaps
predictive
software
has
already
identified
the
man
as
a
potential
reoffender
for
this
particular
type
of
crime
n
or
perhaps
software
has
flagged
the
suspect
s
social
media
comments
or
other
internet
postings
that
suggest
planned
criminal
or
gang
activity
n
can
this
aggregation
of
individualized
information
be
sufficient
to
justify
interfering
with
a
person
s
constitutional
liberty
this
article
traces
the
consequences
of
a
shift
from
small
data
reasonable
suspicion
focused
on
specific
observable
actions
of
unknown
suspects
to
a
big
data
reality
of
an
interconnected
information
rich
world
of
known
suspects
with
more
specific
information
police
officers
on
the
streets
may
have
a
stronger
predictive
sense
about
the
likelihood
that
they
are
observing
criminal
activity
n
this
evolution
however
only
hints
at
the
promise
of
big
data
policing
the
next
phase
will
use
existing
predictive
analytics
to
target
suspects
without
any
firsthand
observation
of
criminal
activity
relying
instead
on
the
accumulation
of
various
data
points
n
unknown
suspects
will
become
known
to
police
because
of
the
data
left
behind
n
software
will
use
pattern
matching
techniques
n
to
identify
individuals
by
sorting
through
information
about
millions
of
people
contained
in
networked
databases
this
new
reality
simultaneously
undermines
the
protection
that
reasonable
suspicion
provides
against
police
stops
and
potentially
transforms
reasonable
suspicion
into
a
means
of
justifying
those
same
stops
this
article
seeks
to
offer
three
contributions
to
the
development
of
fourth
amendment
theory
first
it
demonstrates
that
reasonable
suspicion
as
a
small
data
doctrine
may
become
practically
irrelevant
in
an
era
of
big
data
policing
second
it
examines
the
distortions
of
big
data
on
police
observation
investigation
and
prediction
concluding
that
big
data
information
will
impact
all
major
aspects
of
traditional
policing
third
it
seeks
to
offer
a
solution
to
potential
problems
using
the
insights
and
value
of
big
data
itself
to
strengthen
the
existing
reasonable
suspicion
standard
part
i
of
this
article
examines
the
development
of
fourth
amendment
law
on
reasonable
suspicion
much
of
this
case
law
involves
unknown
suspects
such
as
when
a
police
officer
sees
an
individual
on
the
street
but
does
not
know
his
or
her
identity
in
these
cases
reasonable
suspicion
necessarily
derives
from
the
suspect
s
observable
actions
most
fourth
amendment
cases
involving
police
citizen
encounters
are
of
this
stranger
variety
n
thus
the
reasonable
suspicion
test
as
it
evolved
required
the
police
officer
to
articulate
individualized
particularized
suspicion
to
distinguish
a
stranger
s
suspicious
actions
from
non
suspicious
actions
n
the
resulting
doctrine
created
around
actions
not
individuals
makes
sense
within
the
context
it
arose
as
presumably
most
officers
would
not
know
all
of
the
potential
criminals
in
their
patrol
areas
n
the
resulting
reasonable
suspicion
test
however
becomes
significantly
distorted
when
officers
have
access
to
more
individualized
or
predictive
information
about
a
suspect
part
ii
of
this
article
addresses
the
rise
of
big
data
in
criminal
law
enforcement
law
enforcement
organizations
are
working
to
grow
the
scope
sophistication
and
detail
of
their
databases
n
agencies
and
their
officers
may
now
search
national
databases
and
gain
instant
access
to
the
information
n
indeed
data
is
the
new
watchword
in
many
smart
policing
districts
n
crimes
are
recorded
n
criminals
are
cataloged
n
some
jurisdictions
record
data
about
every
police
citizen
encounter
making
both
the
person
and
justification
for
the
stop
not
necessarily
even
an
arrest
instantly
available
to
any
officer
n
some
jurisdictions
have
compiled
bad
guy
lists
identifying
suspects
in
a
neighborhood
based
on
computer
analysis
of
past
actions
and
arrests
n
in
addition
law
enforcement
agencies
increasingly
rely
on
predictive
algorithms
to
forecast
individual
recidivism
and
areas
of
likely
criminal
activity
n
just
as
law
enforcement
agencies
now
collect
and
electronically
analyze
more
personal
data
so
do
private
third
party
organizations
n
these
third
party
entities
are
a
familiar
part
of
our
daily
lives
smartphones
record
where
we
go
n
credit
card
companies
record
what
we
buy
and
banks
chronicle
what
we
spend
n
onstar
systems
in
cars
catalog
where
and
how
fast
we
drive
n
phone
records
reflect
our
contacts
and
communications
n
internet
searches
reveal
what
we
read
and
expose
our
interests
n
social
media
sites
such
as
twitter
and
facebook
even
disclose
what
we
think
n
currently
law
enforcement
officers
may
access
many
of
these
records
without
violating
the
fourth
amendment
under
the
theory
that
there
is
no
reasonable
expectation
of
privacy
in
information
knowingly
revealed
to
third
parties
n
while
certain
statutory
protections
exist
most
statutes
include
law
enforcement
exceptions
n
and
in
any
case
these
private
commercial
data
aggregators
have
turned
personal
data
into
a
commodity
available
for
purchase
and
analysis
to
anyone
willing
to
pay
n
the
rise
of
big
data
means
that
this
information
is
potentially
available
for
use
by
law
enforcement
in
the
same
way
that
a
drug
store
can
predict
that
you
will
need
a
coupon
this
month
because
you
bought
a
similar
product
last
month
n
the
police
will
be
able
to
anticipate
that
you
will
be
selling
drugs
this
week
because
you
purchased
an
unusual
number
of
mini
plastic
bags
last
week
n
neither
prediction
is
necessarily
accurate
but
both
are
based
on
individualized
and
particularized
data
that
makes
the
prediction
more
likely
part
iii
analyzes
the
intersection
of
big
data
and
the
current
fourth
amendment
framework
the
wrinkle
of
big
data
is
that
now
officers
are
no
longer
dealing
with
strangers
even
people
unknown
to
officers
can
be
identified
and
with
a
few
quick
searches
revealed
as
a
person
with
recognizable
characteristics
or
about
whom
certain
predictions
can
be
made
n
if

view
those
individualized
and
particularized
identifying
characteristics
such
as
prior
convictions
gang
associations
and
gps
coordinates
near
the
scene
of
the
crime
as
suspicious
then
otherwise
innocent
actions
might
create
a
predictive
composite
that
satisfies
the
reasonable
suspicion
standard
in
essence
reasonable
suspicion
will
focus
more
on
an
individual
s
predictive
likelihood
of
involvement
in
criminal
activity
than
on
an
individual
s
actions
part
iii
then
looks
at
fourth
amendment
reasonable
suspicion
through
three
different
lenses
situations
involving
officers
observing
an
ongoing
crime
situations
involving
officers
investigating
a
past
crime
and
situations
involving
officers
predicting
a
future
crime
big
data
affects
the
analysis
in
each
application
distorting
the
reasonable
suspicion
standard
knowing
who
the
suspect
is
and
having
more
information
even
innocent
information
will
allow
officers
to
meet
the
reasonable
suspicion
threshold
more
easily
because
the
information
will
be
sufficiently
individualized
and
particularized
part
iv
assesses
this
new
technological
reality
can
the
current
reasonable
suspicion
doctrine
adapt
should
it
what
are
the
possible
benefits
or
dangers
of
big
data
reasonable
suspicion
using
big
data
may
help
reduce
the
negative
consequences
of
traditional
policing
techniques
but
at
the
same
time
may
create
a
whole
new
set
of
concerns
this
section
evaluates
the
tradeoffs
of
big
data
as
applied
to
the
fourth
amendment
part
v
offers
a
few
solutions
to
the
problem
presented
by
the
big
data
distortions
of
fourth
amendment
doctrine
this
article
suggests
that
the
nature
of
big
data
itself
might
provide
a
means
of
strengthening
the
reasonable
suspicion
standard
if
big
data
resources
are
used
to
tip
the
scales
of
reasonable
suspicion
in
favor
of
law
enforcement
then
courts
should
require
a
higher
level
of
detail
and
correlation
using
the
insights
and
capabilities
of
big
data
this
requirement
would
involve
precise
statistical
analysis
geospatial
analysis
temporal
analysis
and
link
analysis
of
the
data
big
data
can
provide
information
about
a
person
on
a
generalized
or
granular
scale
and
the
latter
should
be
required
the
power
of
big
data
allows
investigators
to
go
deep
into
the
data
and
make
sure
that
the
information
is
as
tightly
correlated
as
possible
in
this
way
a
big
data
infused
reasonable
suspicion
standard
will
do
what
the
reasonable
suspicion
requirement
was
always
supposed
to
do
distinguish
the
criminal
from
the
noncriminal
in
a
manner
that
balances
the
need
for
effective
law
enforcement
with
a
measure
of
personal
liberty
i
reasonable
suspicion
a
small
data
doctrine
the
fourth
amendment
serves
as
a
constitutional
barrier
protecting
individuals
from
unreasonable
police
intrusion
n
on
the
street
the
police
may
not
constitutionally
stop
seize
or
search
individuals
without
the
requisite
legal
justification
n
to
seize
a
person
temporarily
a
police
officer
must
have
reasonable
suspicion
that
the
individual
is
committing
is
about
to
commit
or
has
committed
a
crime
n
the
reasonable
suspicion
standard
first
arose
in
terry
v
ohio
when
the
supreme
court
created
a
new
threshold
for
fourth
amendment
suspicion
lower
than
probable
cause
to
justify
a
brief
detention
n
in
terry
detective
martin
mcfadden
observed
three
unknown
men
walking
back
and
forth
in
front
of
a
downtown
store
n
mcfadden
an
experienced
police
officer
while
not
knowing
the
men
involved
believed
their
actions
were
consistent
with
the
actions
of
individuals
seeking
to
rob
a
store
n
based
on
this
suspicion
mcfadden
stopped
the
individuals
n
in
the
process
of
frisking
them
mcfadden
recovered
unlawful
firearms
n
possession
of
these
firearms
served
as
the
basis
for
the
arrest
conviction
and
later
appeal
of
the
constitutionality
of
the
initial
stop
and
frisk
n
in
finding
the
stop
permissible
the
court
established
a
new
fourth
amendment
standard
for
investigatory
stops
requiring
that
police
be
able
to
point
to
specific
and
articulable
facts
which
taken
together
with
rational
inferences
from
those
facts
reasonably
warrant
the
intrusion
n
terry
mirrors
a
common
factual
situation
that
recurs
millions
of
times
a
year
across
the
country
officers
on
the
street
observe
a
particular
suspect
or
group
of
suspects
because
police
officers
do
not
know
all
of
the
suspects
in
a
jurisdiction
personally
the
officers
must
focus
on
the
suspect
s
actions
and
on
the
inferences
that
can
be
drawn
from
those
actions
the
amount
of
information
an
officer
knows
about
the
suspect
is
necessarily
limited
like
detective
mcfadden
in
terry
officers
are
usually
limited
to
evaluating
observed
actions
through
intuition
this
practice
epitomizes
small
data
policing
suspicion
generated
by
information
discrete
in
amount
fixed
in
time
and
isolated
in
context
thus
the
predictive
judgments
made
about
the
suspect
are
similarly
limited
and
disconnected
from
other
data
sources
this
part
discusses
how
reasonable
suspicion
has
developed
as
a
small
data
doctrine
the
language
the
supreme
court
used
to
define
reasonable
suspicion
the
standard
s
application
in
a
variety
of
contexts
and
the
law
s
assumption
of
unknown
suspects
and
direct
observations
all
speak
to
the
doctrine
s
utility
in
certain
situations
in
general
the
archetypical
reasonable
suspicion
setting
involves
police
officers
reacting
to
a
quickly
unfolding
criminal
situation
with
unknown
suspects
and
without
the
time
or
resources
to
find
more
information
the
fourth
amendment
calculus
though
changes
when
officers
have
access
to
personal
data
about
the
suspects
specifically
law
enforcement
officers
can
more
easily
satisfy
the
reasonable
suspicion
standard
when
a
third
party
provides
some
minimal
information
about
an
otherwise
unknown
suspect
already
the
reasonable
suspicion
standard
provides
little
protection
in
situations
involving
suspects
previously
known
to
police
this
reality
illustrates
one
of
the
many
shortcomings
of
a
small
data
doctrine
specific
and
particularized
data
about
a
suspect
even
if
not
specific
and
particularized
about
a
crime
tends
in
practice
to
reduce
the
protection
of
the
reasonable
suspicion
standard
because
the
police
can
obtain
information
about
a
suspect
more
easily
in
a
world
of
big
data
this
doctrinal
weakness
points
to
a
problem
in
the
protective
scope
of
current
fourth
amendment
law
a
the
reasonable
suspicion
standard
despite
the
common
application
of
the
reasonable
suspicion
language
in
tens
of
thousands
of
federal
and
state
court
cases
the
contours
of
the
standard
remain
ill
defined
n
cases
from
terry
to
the
present
day
emphasize
that
suspicion
must
be
based
on
specific
and
articulable
facts
n
those
facts
must
be
objective
n
suspicion
must
be
particularized
n
it
must
relate
to
criminal
activity
not
just
to
the
criminal
n
officers
must
have
reasonable
suspicion
before
the
stop
occurs
retroactive
justification
is
not
sufficient
n
the
suspicion
must
relate
to
current
criminal
activity
n
with
some
latitude
for
post
crime
investigative
actions
n
and
pre
crime
intervention
n
courts
evaluate
these
suspicious
facts
under
the
totality
of
circumstances
test
which
means
that
all
relevant
factors
should
be
considered
n
the
content
and
the
quality
of
the
information
are
both
relevant
considerations
n
but
courts
have
not
settled
on
a
required
quantum
of
proof
n
innocent
factors
characteristics
about
an
area
and
specialized
law
enforcement
training
are
all
factors
that
shape
the
totality
of
the
circumstances
n
the
result
has
been
a
standard
which
retains
the
virtue
of
flexibility
and
the
vice
of
malleability
as
the
supreme
court
has
explained
reasonable
suspicion
involves
commonsense
nontechnical
conceptions
that
deal
with
the
factual
and
practical
considerations
of
everyday
life
on
which
reasonable
and
prudent
men
not
legal
technicians
act
n
scholars
have
been
less
charitable
critiquing
the
standard
as
being
at
best
meaningless
and
at
worst
discriminatory
n
at
a
minimum
the
reasonable
suspicion
standard
requires
police
to
articulate
why
an
individual
was
stopped
which
may
reduce
overly
arbitrary
or
animus
based
stops
the
standard
while
applicable
in
many
situations
makes
the
most
sense
for
unknown
suspect
cases
the
requirement
of
specific
particularized
objective
facts
seeks
to
distinguish
by
their
observable
actions
those
individuals
who
have
done
nothing
wrong
from
those
who
have
done
something
wrong
detective
mcfadden

mr
terry
not
because
he
recognized
mr

as
a

because
there

but
because
of
the

in

this
section
traces
how
an
officer
s
knowledge
about
a
suspect
influences
the
reasonable
suspicion
analysis
as
discussed
below
the
more
data
known
or
discovered
about
a
particular
suspect
the
easier
it
is
to
justify
a
stop
based
on
reasonable
suspicion
this
result
is
not
necessarily
negative
or
surprising
as
more
information
connecting
a
suspect
to
a
crime
increases
the
likelihood
that
the
suspect
was
involved
it
does
however
show
how
the
aggregation
of
information
even
innocent
information
can
shift
the
balance
within
a
fluid
legal
standard
unknown
suspect
cases
perhaps
not
surprisingly
many
fourth
amendment
reasonable
suspicion
cases
have
followed
the
terry
small
data
model
n
such
cases
involve
officers
observing
unknown
suspects
n
engaged
in
what
officers
believe
to
be
suspicious
activity
these
encounters
regularly
occur
on
the
street

and
as
part
of

that
lead
to

of

on
speculations
about
the
criminal
nature
of
the
actions
involved
independent
of
the
person
because
the
actor
s
identity
is
unknown
in
determining
reasonable
suspicion
a
court
will
evaluate
whether
the
officer
s
observations
were
objectively
reasonable
to
warrant
the
stop
sibron
v
new
york
is
a
useful
example
of
the
application
of
the
reasonable
suspicion
standard
with
respect
to
unknown
suspects
n
in
sibron
a
case
decided
the
same
day
as
terry
v
ohio
an
officer
observed
an
unknown
suspect
in
a
series
of
meetings
with
known
narcotics
addicts
for
approximately
eight
hours
n
the
police
officer
did
not
know
sibron
personally
and
could
not
overhear
any
of
the
conversations
n
yet
after
observing
sibron
communicate
with
nine
to
eleven
known
addicts
over
the
course
of
the
day
the
officer
concluded
that
he
had
observed
a
series
of
drug
transactions
the
officer
then
approached
sibron
and
searched
his
pockets
recovering
heroin
n
the
supreme
court
held
that
sibron
s
activity
did
not
create
reasonable
suspicion
n
the
officer
did
not
see
any
drug
transactions
did
not
know
the
subject
of
the
conversations
and
accordingly
did
not
have
the
requisite
suspicion
to
justify
the
search
under
the
fourth
amendment
n
while
sibron
might
be
decided
differently
today
the
court
it
should
be
noted
here
determined
that
the
officer
lacked
reasonable
suspicion
because
the
officer
had
no
information
about
sibron
that
gave
rise
to
the
inference
of
criminal
activity
merely
associating
with
addicts
was
not
a
crime
in
both
terry
and
sibron
officers
did
not
know
the
suspect
but
instead
inferred
from
the
unknown
suspect
s
actions
that
criminal
activity
was
afoot
n
in
both
cases
officers
based
their
predictive
judgments
on
limited
data
points
which
were
disconnected
from
larger
information
sources
about
the
suspect
while
the
supreme
court
came
to
different
conclusions
in
terry
and
sibron
about
whether
the
police
had
reasonable
suspicion
it
reached
both
outcomes
based
solely
on
the
facts
observed
by
the
officers
this
reality
has
been
repeated
in
hundreds
of
cases
since
then
some
information
on
the
suspect
a
slight
wrinkle
to
the
classic
unknown
suspect
case
involves
situations
in
which
some
minimal
information
is
provided
about
an
otherwise
unknown
suspect
informant

police
tips
or
further
police
investigation
can
alter
the
reasonable
suspicion
analysis
n
that
is
the
likelihood
that
a
court
will
find
reasonable
suspicion
increases
proportionally
to
the
amount
of
personal
data
the
police
officer
has
about
the
suspect
in
florida
v
j
l
an
anonymous
caller
reported
to
the
miami
dade
police
that
a
young
black
male
standing
at

particular
bus
stop

plaid

found
a
gun
on
j
l
and
arrested
him
n
in
determining
whether
this
anonymous
tip
was
sufficient
to
justify
the
stop
the
court
held
that
such
a
bare
tip
without
either
identifying
information
about
the
suspect
or
predictive
details
corroborated
by
observation
was
insufficient
for
reasonable
suspicion
n
there
was
no
identifying
or
predictive
information
involved
the
only
data
point
was
an
anonymous
accusation
without
context
or
verifiability
in
alabama
v
white
by
contrast
the
supreme
court
found
that
a
tip
including
the
suspect
s
name
location
and
predicted
route
of
travel
was
sufficient
to
establish
reasonable
suspicion
n
in
white
the
anonymous
tipster
claimed
that
the
suspect
would
be
leaving
c
lynwood
terrace
apartments
at
a
particular
time
in
a
brown
plymouth
station
wagon
with
the
right
taillight
lens
broken
that
she
would
be
going
to

and
that
she
would
be
in

about
an
ounce
of
cocaine
inside
a

attache
case

the
police
followed
the
suspect
as
she
left
the
motel
in
a
plymouth
station
wagon
stopped
her
and
requested
to
search
her
car
n
she
consented
and
police
recovered
marijuana
n
the
court
held
that
in
this
situation
the
stop
was
justified
by
reasonable
suspicion
n
the
differences
between
white
and
j
l
are
slight
but
revealing
a
more
descriptive
account
of
the
suspect
and
corroborated
predictive
detail
changed
an
insufficient
anonymous
tip
into
constitutionally
sufficient
reasonable
suspicion
n
note
however
that
many
of
the
same
concerns
that
caused
the
court
to
find
no
reasonable
suspicion
in
j
l
were
still
present
in
white
an
anonymous
tip
revealing
a
single
and
obvious
pattern
of
movement
does
not
provide
much
proof
of
insider
knowledge
most
individuals
drive
a
particular
type
of
car
and
follow
a
predictable
routine
in
parts
of
daily
life
e
g
driving
to
work
to
daycare
to
the
gym
to
the
local
coffee
shop
yet
the
court
still
found
the
additional
individualized
information
about
the
suspect
sufficient
for
reasonable
suspicion
n
the
supreme
court
s
first
transition
to
a
medium
data
case
occurred
in
ornelas
v
united
states
n
in
ornelas
officers
developed
reasonable
suspicion
by
proactively
searching
for
data
to
support
their
hunch
n
the
case
involved
a
milwaukee
detective
who
observed
a
suspicious
car
parked
at
a
local
motel
n
the
car
was
purportedly
suspicious
because
it
was
a
make
and
model
frequently
used
by
drug
dealers
a
two
door
oldsmobile
n
not
having
any
information
about
the
owner
of
the
oldsmobile
the
detective
radioed
his
dispatcher
and
found
the
car
was
registered
under
ornelas
s
name
n
a
further
inquiry
with
the
local
office
of
the
drug
enforcement
administration
revealed
that
ornelas
s
name
appeared
in
a
federal
database
of
known
and
suspected
drug
traffickers
the
narcotics
and
dangerous
drugs
information
system
naddis
n
with
this
additional
information
which
would
otherwise
have
been
unknown
the
detective
stopped
ornelas
and
another
man
when
they
exited
the
motel
and
entered
the
car
the
underlying
constitutional
issue
in
the
case
was
whether
the
information
connecting
the
car
the
name
and
the
criminal
database
was
sufficient
to
create
reasonable
suspicion
n
while
the
supreme
court
deferred
answering
the
fourth
amendment
question
focusing
instead
on
the
appropriate
standard
of
appellate
review
the
trial
court
both
initially
and
on
remand
found
that
the
information
together
was
sufficient
cause
for
reasonable
suspicion
n
note
though
that
ornelas
s
actions
were
not
suspicious
at
all
he
parked
overnight
at
a
motel
and
then
exited
the
motel
and
got
into
his
car
what
created
the
suspicion
was
independent
data
about
ornelas
himself
the
detective
by
searching
for
more
information
about
ornelas
discovered
personal
data
particularized
and
individualized
facts
to
support
his
suspicion
n
this
development
of
reasonable
suspicion
resulting
more
from
aggregated
information
about
a
suspect
and
less
from
the
actions
of
the
suspect
occurs
with
some
regularity
in
the
case
law
n
in
essence
courts
reason
that
the
tip
or
database
hit
provides
information
that
shifts
the
balance
toward
reasonable
suspicion
this
is
true
even
if
the
observable
innocent
actions
on
the
street
remain
the
same
known
suspects
the
third
situation
involves
known
suspects
stopped
by
police
because
of
their
identity
and
not
necessarily
because
of
any
observed
activities
the
supreme
court
has
not
directly
ruled
on
the
issue
but
united
states
v
hensley
provides
an
interesting
example
of
a
stop
based
solely
on
identity
n
hensley
involved
a
stop
based
on
a
wanted
flyer
for
a
suspect
in
an
armed
robbery
n
the
police
department
in
st
bernard
ohio
had
issued
a
flyer
identifying
mr
hensley
as
a
suspect
and
sent
it
to
surrounding
jurisdictions
n
the
flyer
did
not
indicate
that
the
police
had
a
warrant
for
mr
hensley
s
arrest
n
the
covington
police
department
located
in
neighboring
kentucky
received
the
flyer
and
its
officers
were
on
the
lookout
for
mr
hensley
n
based
on
the
wanted
flyer
covington
police
officers
stopped
mr
hensley
and
eventually
recovered
a
handgun
n
the
supreme
court
had
to
decide
whether
this
wanted
poster
identifying
mr
hensley
specifically
created
reasonable
suspicion
to
stop
hensley
in
its
discussion
the
court
noted
that
if
police
have
a
reasonable
suspicion
grounded
in
specific
and
articulable
facts
that
a
person
they
encounter
was
involved
in
or
is
wanted
in
connection
with
a
completed
felony
then
a
terry
stop
may
be
made
to
investigate
that
suspicion
n
the
principle
applies
even
if
another
jurisdiction
s
police
officers
generated
that
reasonable
suspicion
thus
the
covington
police
permissibly
relied
on
the
st
bernard
s
police
department
s
determination
of
reasonable
suspicion
hensley
shows
that
a
stop
can
be
based
simply
on
identifying
information
about
a
suspect
that
is
provided
to
police
in
hensley
the
arresting
officers
did
not
have
an
arrest
warrant
or
any
predictive
detail
about
hensley
s
future
actions
and
they
did
not
corroborate
any
of
the
allegations
of
criminal
activity
the
only
data
point
for
suspicion
was
hensley
s
identity
yet
the
court
nonetheless
held
that
if
information
about
an
identified
suspect
rises
to
the
level
of
reasonable
suspicion
a
stop
is
justified
n
because
police
collect
a
significant
amount
of
information
about
suspects
and
create
regular
target
lists
of
potential
suspects
this
type
of
stop
based
merely
on
identity
raises
serious
questions
hensley
also
substantially
broadened
the
application
of
the
reasonable
suspicion
standard
from
preventing
or
apprehending
ongoing
criminal
activity
to
investigating
it
after
the
fact
after
hensley
reasonable
suspicion
was
no
longer
limited
to
ongoing
criminal
action
but
could
be
used
to
justify
stops
to
investigate
completed
crimes
other
courts
have
been
even
more
explicit
that
prior
knowledge
of
the
suspect
can
factor
into
reasonable
suspicion
the
seventh
circuit
stated
that
knowledge
of
gang
association
and
recent
relevant
criminal
conduct
while
of
doubtful
evidentiary
value
in
view
of
the
strictures
against
proving
guilt
by
association
or
by
a
predisposition
based
on
past
criminal
acts
is
a
permissible
component
of
the
articulable
suspicion
required
for
a
terry
stop
n
courts
in
massachusetts
n
minnesota
n
and
hawaii
n
among
others
n
recognize
that
knowledge
of
a
defendant
s
criminal
history
can
factor
into
the
reasonable
suspicion
analysis
as
one
massachusetts
court
reasoned
the
officers
were
also
entitled
to
consider
their
personal
knowledge
of
the
defendant
including
the
fact
that
he
had
a
pending
court
case
involving
charges
of
firearm
possession
and
armed
assault
with
intent
to
murder
in
several
cases
this
court
has
allowed
police
knowledge
of
a
person
s
arrest
record
or
unspecified
criminal
record
to
be
considered
in
a
reasonable
suspicion
evaluation
n
of
course
courts
draw
a
line
between
using
prior
knowledge
about
a
suspect
to
justify
a
stop
and
using
prior
knowledge
as
one
factor
in
the
totality
of
the
circumstances
n
prior
knowledge
of
past
criminal
activity
alone
is
not
enough
to
stop
an
individual
n
as
one
court
stated
knowledge
of
a
person
s
prior
criminal
involvement
to
say
nothing
of
a
mere
arrest
is
alone
insufficient
to
give
rise
to
the
requisite
reasonable
suspicion
if
the
law
were
otherwise
any
person
with
any
sort
of
criminal
record
or
even
worse
a
person
with
arrests
but
no
convictions
could
be
subjected
to
a
terry
type
investigative
stop
by
a
law
enforcement
officer
at
any
time
without
the
need
for
any
other
justification
at
all
any
such
rule
would
clearly
run
counter
to
the
requirement
of
a
reasonable
suspicion
and
of
the
need
that
such
stops
be
justified
in
light
of
a
balancing
of
the
competing
interests
at
stake
n
thus
knowledge
about
the
suspect
cannot
alone
justify
a
stop
the
officer
s
knowledge
must
be
tied
to
a
suspected
criminal
activity
past
or
present
data
regarding
a
suspect
s
criminal
history
however
can
influence
the
officer
and
be
included
in
the
totality
of
the
circumstances
analysis
for
reasonable
suspicion
c
concluding
thoughts
fourth
amendment
case
law
suggests
that
personal
information
about
a
suspect
influences
the
reasonable
suspicion
analysis
even
if
the
suspect
s
actions
remain
the
same
when
data
about
the
suspect
corroborates
suspicion
from
observation
the
information
helps
the
officer
justify
his
or
her
suspicion
in
simple
terms
personal
data
provide
the
individualized
objective
facts
that
officers
need
to
articulate
their
suspicion
while
it
makes
intuitive
sense
that
information
about
a
suspect
in
connection
with
a
crime
can
help
provide
reasons
for
the
officer
s
suspicion
there
are
real
concerns
associated
with
this
increased
access
to
personal
information
first
the
personal
information
can
be
overbroad
in
ornelas
for
example
the
officer
s
suspicion
that
a
particular
car
was
connected
with
a
known
drug
dealer
did
not
alone
create
a
reasonable
suspicion
that
the
individual
possessed
drugs
at
the
time
n
the
actions
of
the
suspect
including
staying
overnight
at
a
motel
also
did
not
necessarily
suggest
drug
distribution
to
justify
the
stop
the
police
officer
considered
additional
data
points
in
his
calculus
but
the
data
themselves
did
not
meaningfully
relate
to
the
likelihood
of
criminal
activity
at
the
particular
time
second
the
personal
information
can
be
wrong
in
white
for
example
the
tipster
was
wrong
about
some
facts
including
the
type
of
narcotics
police
would
recover
from
the
suspect
n
third
the
personal
information
can
be
unreliable
after
hensley
police
generated
watchlists
can
be
used
to
justify
stops
of
individuals
as
these
lists
are
shared
nationally
there
is
no
guarantee
of
accuracy
or
any
mechanism
to
correct
mistakes
n
potential
clerical
errors
errors
in
judgment
and
a
lack
of
judicial
oversight
all
create
red
flags
for
this
broadening
of
factors
included
in
the
reasonable
suspicion
analysis
n
these
concerns
animate
the
discussion
about
how
new
data
sources
will
affect
the
reasonable
suspicion
doctrine
information
may
shape
reasonable
suspicion
but
as
developed
in
the
next
part
the
available
data
can
also
overwhelm
officers
and
interfere
with
the
determination
of
who
should
be
stopped
for
suspected
criminal
activity
ii
the
rise
of
big
data
policing
big
data
both
as
a
catchphrase
and
a
reality
is
transforming
the
world
n
this
part
outlines
the
growth
of
big
data
and
its
potential
impact
on
law
enforcement
practices
the
big
data
revolution
is
just
beginning
but
it
has
already
begun
influencing
how
police
identify
and
investigate
criminal
activity
big
data
will
affect
police
officers
on
the
streets
in
two
primary
ways
first
in
conjunction
with
facial
recognition
or
other
biometric
identification
technologies
n
unknown
suspects
can
be
known
not
simply
identified
by
name
but
revealed
through
a
web
of
facts
involving
criminal
records
personal
history
and
past
location
data
n
vast
troves
of
networked
data
can
provide
individualized
and
particularized
facts
from
which
to
form
suspicion
n
second
patterns
emerging
from
the
data
will
allow
individuals
to
be
identified
predictively
as
suspects
because
their
past
actions
generate
suspicion
about
future
criminal
involvement
n
law
enforcement
already
uses
predictive
policing
software
to
predict
areas
of
crime
but
big
data
will
soon
predict
actions
if
not
individuals
n
the
data
will
reveal
predictive
profiles
to
identify
those
believed
to
warrant
further
investigation
by
police
n
in
both
cases
the
growth
of
big
data
has
the
potential
to
change
the
reasonable
suspicion
calculus
because
more
personal
or
predictive
information
about
a
suspect
will
make
it
easier
for
police
to
justify
stopping
a
suspect
a
big
data
an
introduction
big
data
refers
to
the
accumulation
and
analysis
of
unusually
large
datasets
n
it
provides
a
shorthand
term
for
data
collection
in
a
variety
of
industries
and
settings
n
as
described
in
the
next
few
sections
this
collection
involves
a
network
of
sources
relying
heavily
on
a
host
of
consumer
social
media
and
law
enforcement
datasets
as
well
as
more
established
surveillance
and
tracking
technologies
n
in
their
book
on
big
data
viktor
mayer
schonberger
and
kenneth
cukier
define
big
data
in
two
ways
first
big
data
is
the
ability
of
society
to
harness
information
in
novel
ways
to
produce
useful
insights
or
goods
and
services
of
significant
value
n
second
they
write
that
big
data
refers
to
things
one
can
do
at
a
large
scale
that
cannot
be
done
at
a
smaller
one
to
extract
new
insights
or
create
new
forms
of
value
in
ways
that
change
markets
organizations
the
relationships
between
citizens
and
governments
and
more
n
jules
berman
describes
big
data
using
the
three
v
s
n
first
you
must
have
volume
large
amounts
of
data
n
second
you
must
have
variety
the
data
comes
in
different
forms
including
traditional
databases
images
documents
and
complex
records
n
third
you
must
have
velocity
the
content
of
the
data
is
constantly
changing
through
the
absorption
of
complementary
data
collections
through
the
introduction
of
previously
archived
data
or
legacy
collections
and
from
streamed
data
arriving
from
multiple
sources
n
to
understand
the
scope
of
the
growth
of
big
data
the
next
few
sections
will
outline
the
sources
volume
and
promise
of
big
data
technologies
with
a
focus
on
those
areas
most
useful
for
law
enforcement
b
the
growth
of
data
collection
in
many
ways
the
building
blocks
of
big
data
are
not
new
at
all
n
data
collection
has
been
increasing
for
the
last
few
decades
n
the
growth
in
the
volume
of
data
collected
the
ability
to
connect
previously
discrete
data
networks
and
the
analytical
capabilities
made
possible
by
faster
computer
processors
and
more
data
storage
capacity
however
are
new
developments
n
these
issues
will
be
addressed
in
turn
volume
of
data
the
volume
of
collected
data
is
growing
exponentially
the
data
surge
just
keeps
rising
doubling
in
volume
every
two
years
just
two
days
of
the
current
global
data
production
from
all
sources
five
quintillion
bytes
a
letter
of
text
equals
one
byte
is
about
equal
to
the
amount
of
information
created
by
all
the
world
s
conversations
ever
n
this
amount
of
information
is
hard
to
comprehend
in
the
amount
of
stored
information
in
the
world
was
estimated
to
be
around
exabytes
of
which
less
than
percent
is
non
digital
there
is
no
good
way
to
think
about
what
this
size
of
data
means
if
it
were
all
printed
in
books
they
would
cover
the
entire
surface
of
the
united
states
some
layers
thick
if
it
were
placed
on
cd
roms
and
stacked
up
they
would
stretch
to
the
moon
in
five
separate
piles
things
really
are
speeding
up
the
amount
of
stored
information
grows
four
times
faster
than
the
world
economy
while
the
processing
power
of
computers
grows
nine
times
faster
n
although
law
enforcement
may
not
use
all
of
this
electronic
data
much
of
it
nonetheless
reveals
information
about
individuals
that
simply
was
not
knowable
in
previous
generations
as
daniel
solove
has
observed
we
are
becoming
a
society
of
records
and
these
records
are
not
held
by
us
but
by
third
parties
n
digital
records
reveal
who
we
talk
to
where
we
go
and
what
we
purchase
they
give
insight
into
our
hobbies
our
financial
status
our
employment
and
our
criminal
histories
n
when
linked
together
these
disparate
data
points
can
create
a
revealing
composite
of
our
identity
and
when
accessible
by
the
government
they
can
serve
as
a
valuable
source
of
investigatory
power

it
s
almost
impossible
to
anonymize

networked
data
the
investigatory
utility
of
standalone
databases
improves
when
law
enforcement
agencies
and
private
companies
connect
those
databases
and
aggregate
their
data
indeed
linking
traditional
criminal
justice
data
with
private
data
provides
a
wealth
of
insights
about
a
person
n
in
recent
years
the
federal
government
created
two
such
networked
database
programs
but
eventually
discontinued
their
use
due
to
public
concerns
about
privacy
the
first
database
the
multi
state
anti
terrorism
information
exchange
program
matrix
included
a
networked
database
that
allowed
police
officers
to
check
a
broad
range
of
information
with
one
search
including
criminal
history
credit
information
driver
s
license
information
vehicle
registration
arrests
utility
connections
ucc
filings
concealed
weapons
permits
faa
aircraft
and
pilots
licenses
hunting
and
fishing
licenses
professional

and
voter
registration
records
n
as
the
electronic
privacy
information
center
argued
in
its
amicus
brief
in
hiibel
v
sixth
judicial
district
court
of
nevada
a
police
officer
using
the
matrix
system
could
develop
an
entire
profile
of
a
suspect
simply
by
running
a
name
in
the
database
during
a
routine
encounter
n
according
to
the
department
of
homeland
security
s
privacy
office
in
its
review
of
the
program
only
of
the
cases
investigated
over
the
course
of
the
matrix
pilot
project
were
related
to
terrorism
in
fact
the
matrix
project
was
predominantly
used
to
investigate
fraud
robbery
and
other
crimes
including
assault
homicide
and
narcotics
cases
underscoring
the
value
of
the
program
as
a
tool
for
traditional
law
enforcement
n
the
second
database
the
even
more
orwellian
sounding
total
information
awareness
system
was
designed
by
the
department
of
defense
to
fight
terrorism
by
linking
data
sources
into
one
searchable
national
information
collection
center
n
renamed
the
terrorism
information
awareness
system
n
this
program
had
several
components
all
designed
to
aggregate
available
information
for
predictive
surveillance
purposes
n
the
department
of
defense
reportedly
designed
the
program
to
connect
the
dots
in
an
attempt
to
avoid
repeating
the
missed
opportunities
to
intervene
before
the
terrorist
attacks
of
september
n
among
other
things
the
program
sought
to
create
predictive
risk
profiles
for
particular
citizens
based
on
the
available
data
n
while
these
two
programs
and
others
were
canceled
over
privacy
concerns
n
law
enforcement
and
private
companies
have
embraced
the
idea
of
networking
and
sharing
personal
information
first
the
federal
bureau
of
investigation
s
criminal
justice
information
services
division
coordinates
access
to
databases
that
include
public
and
private
sources
n
fbi
agents
and
analysts
regularly
access
these
databases
which
contain
hundreds
of
millions
of
records
n
law
enforcement
has
benefited
and
continues
to
benefit
from
the
growth
of
private
surveillance
collection
services
n
for
example
the
technology
that
ran
the
total
information
awareness
program
is
now
owned
by
lexisnexis
a
private
company
n
as
one
expert
has
written
the
private
sector
is
developing
domain
specific
technologies
that
is
applications
developed
specifically
for
law
enforcement
purposes
to
aggregate
and
mine
data
using
both
link
analysis
and
pattern
matching
in
criminal
investigations
and
these
technologies
are
already
being
adopted
and
employed
in
a
variety
of
law
enforcement
environments
n
police
thus
can
and
do
request
information
from
third
party
data
sources
including
commercial
data
aggregators
google
phone
companies
and
social
and
financial
networks
n
this
creates
the
potential
to
replicate
in
the
private
sector
much
of
what
was
envisioned
in
the
original
government
surveillance
projects
that
were
considered
threatening
to
americans
privacy
n
finally
because
commercial
entities
rather
than
the
government
own
these
fourth
party
records
they
avoid
many
of
the
constitutional
and
statutory
protections
that
might
ensure
privacy
of
these
records
n
today
data
aggregators
are
able
to
cross
index
various
sources
of
information
to
produce
incredibly
extensive
and
invasive
lists
for
practically
any
purpose
for
example
many
can
provide
lists
of
people
who
take
prozac
for
depression
believe
in
the
bible
gamble
online
or
buy
sex
toys
n
similarly
the
aggregators
can
tailor
searches
to
identify
those
allegedly
engaged
in
illicit
activities
who
otherwise
would
avoid
suspicion
such
tools
are
increasingly
useful
to
generate
personalized
individualized
information
about
a
suspect
and
remain
largely
unregulated
identifiable
data
to
solve
crimes
law
enforcement
must
not
only
collect
information
but
also
identify
and
link
individuals
to
their
accumulated
data
in
short
data
must
be
connected
with
identifiable
human
beings
facial
recognition
software
biometric
identification
technologies
and
mobile
communication
make
it
easier
to
identify
unknown
suspects
and
access
data
associated
with
these
suspects
n
today
facial
recognition
software
can
identify
a
suspect
by
comparing
the
observed
suspect
s
face
to
a
database
of
stored
faces
n
as
sources
of
photographs
proliferate
and
law
enforcement
databases
link
these
sources
together
the
utility
and
ease
of
the
technology
will
expand
rapidly
n
in
more
technologically
advanced
jurisdictions
mobile
handheld
devices
can
match
faces
to
a
central
database
n
soon
the
technology
will
complete
searches
in
real
time
by
allowing
police
to
scan
multiple
faces
along
a
street
n
as
more
police
use
portable
computers
linked
to
these
photograph
databases
the
ability
of
law
enforcement
to
scan
and
analyze
faces
to
identify
suspects
will
become
more
common
n
the
scale
of
available
photo
databases
demonstrates
the
power
of
networked
data
as
reported
by
the
washington
post
the
fbi
s
own
facial
recognition
database
has
about
million
criminal
mug
shots
bureau
officials
are
pushing
to
expand
that
by
tens
of
millions
more
by
encouraging
states
to
upload
their
criminal
justice
photos
into
the
national
system
n
many
states
have
complied
or
are
complying
with
this
request
and
some
have
created
their
own
systems
the
pinellas
county
sheriff
s
office
in
florida
for
example
has
built
one
of
the
country
s
most
advanced
facial
recognition
programs
n
the
faces
of
more
than
million
people
are
in
searchable
photo
databases
that
state
officials
assembled
to
prevent
driver
s
license
fraud
but
that
increasingly
are
used
by
police
to
identify
suspects
accomplices
and
even
innocent
bystanders
in
a
wide
range
of
criminal
investigations
n
pennsylvania
s
justice
network
which
has
allowed
police
anywhere
in
the
state
to
compare
a
facial
image
with
mug
shot
databases
has
become
a
key
investigative
tool
and
last
month
it
added
access
to
million
driver
s
license
photos
n
these
examples
represent
only
the
beginning
as
twenty
six
states
now
allow
local
law
enforcement
to
access
driver
s
license
photographs
for
facial
recognition
purposes
n
in
addition
facial
recognition
programs
can
easily
search
a
wealth
of
personal
photographs
uploaded
online
n
facial
recognition
is
but
one
technology
used
to
identify
suspects
on
the
streets
law
enforcement
can
also
use
biometric
identification
technologies
n
that
look
to
irises
tattoos
scars
face
shape
and
even
the
habitual
manner
in
which
people
walk
n
the
goal
a
comprehensive
remote
scanning
technology
that
would
allow
instant
identification
of
suspects
through
a
quick
search
of
a
massive
database
n
one
existing
program
dubbed
moris
already
allows
an
ordinary
iphone
user
to
scan
an
iris
and
compare
it
to
a
database
of
biometric
identifiers
n
with
moris
police
can
take
a
picture
of
the
subject
s
face
from
up
to
five
feet
away
and
conduct
an
iris
scan
from
up
to
six
inches
from
the
person
s
eye
the
device
matches
photographs
against
a
national
criminal
records
database
that
is
managed
by
biometric
intelligence
and
identification
technologies
bi
technologies
the
private
company
that
designed
moris
n
other
techniques
will
also
be
developed
that
may
allow
similar
scanning
through
other
surveillance
techniques
n
these
growing
mobile
technologies
not
only
allow
law
enforcement
to
identify
previously
unknown
suspects
but
also
provide
other
networked
personal
information
about
those
suspects
n
as
one
state
law
enforcement
officer
remarked
i
can
call
up
everything
about
you
your
pictures
and
pictures
of
your
neighbors
n
in
addition
these
technologies
will
allow
law
enforcement
to
identify
targeted
populations
easily
such
as
gang
members
or
suspects
identified
on
most
wanted
lists
n
for
example
police
in
lincoln
nebraska
carry
a
mobile
application
called
p
i
proactive
police
patrol
information
that
displays
the
location
of
suspected
gang
members
registered
sex
offenders
people
with
outstanding
warrants
parolees
and
criminal
incident
reports
n
the
result
is
that
big
data
technology
can
provide
vastly
more
identifying
information
to
help
determine
reasonable
suspicion
on
the
streets
c
predictive
data
big
data
also
promises
another
change
in
law
enforcement
techniques
the
expansive
collection
of
data
allows
for
more
sophisticated
analysis
that
might
reveal
previously
unknown
patterns
of
criminal
activity
n
predictive
policing
technologies
are
already
in
use
in
major
cities
such
as
los
angeles
and
seattle
n
while
current
technologies
focus
primarily
on
expected
places
of
criminal
activity
they
also
predict
patterns
of
criminal
actions
computer
programs
can
analyze
these
patterns
and
police
accordingly
could
use
these
patterns
to
stop
unknown
suspects
whose
actions
fit
the
predicted
activity
n
available
technologies
provide
different
levels
of
sophistication
but
the
underlying
theory
that
crime
patterns
can
be
identified
analyzed
and
predicted
is
well
established
n
traditional
hot
spot
mapping
n
compstat
systems
n
and
more
modern
technologies
like
predictive
policing
all
rely
on
data
analysis
to
track
crime
patterns
n
the
logic
behind
these
technologies
is
that
certain
environmental
vulnerabilities
exist
to
encourage
crime
at
a
particular
location
n
repeated
observation
of
these
place
based
vulnerabilities
allows
analysts
or
algorithms
to
predict
the
next
area
of
likely
criminal
activity
n
the
collected
crime
data
also
holds
other
keys
to
understanding
the
actions
of
criminals
n
criminals
adopt
certain
modi
operandi
and
generally
are
creatures
of
habit
n
in
fact
one
reason
why
certain
crimes
encourage
almost
contagious
criminal
activity
in
the
surrounding
areas
is
because
the
same
criminals
or
groups
of
criminals
are
doing
the
acts
n
identifying
these
patterns
may
well
provide
clues
as
to
who
was
involved
in
the
crimes
n
sometimes
these
patterns
in
conjunction
with
other
factors
such
as
bus
routes
escape
routes
weather
patterns
paydays
license
plates
and
special
events
may
also
reveal
a
likely
offender
n
at
a
deeper
level
of
sophistication
with
enough
data
police
will
be
able
to
predict
criminal
networks
from
patterns
or
connections
n
just
as
companies
can
identify
you
and
your
interests
and
associates
from
past
activities
law
enforcement
might
be
able
to
target
criminal
networks
using
similar
pattern
recognition
technologies
n
for
example
police
concerned
with
the
manufacture
of
methamphetamine
could
glean
valuable
information
from
commercial
sales
data
in
a
jurisdiction
big
data
analysts
might
track
all
of
the
purchases
of
individuals
who
bought
several
of
the
component
parts
required
to
make
the
drug
lye
iodine
ephedrine
sudafed
drano
brake
fluid
and
lighter
fluid
n
each
of
these
products
has
a
lawful
use
but
identifying
the
individuals
who
bought
all
of
these
products
would
be
a
valuable
clue
in
determining
who
might
also
be
making
methamphetamine
patterns
of
anonymous
sales
data
alone
might
demonstrate
the
levels
of
meth
manufacture
taking
place
identifying
the
actual
identities
of
repeat
purchasers
would
benefit
investigators
even
more
though
merely
a
more
sophisticated
form
of
criminal
profiling
n
this
possibility
has
drawn
the
interest
of
major
players
including
the
fbi
n
who
see
the
potential
of
big
data
pattern
matching
n
several
jurisdictions
have
even
compiled
bad
guy
lists
of
individuals
they
predict
will
commit
crimes
in
the
future
or
are
involved
in
ongoing
criminal
activity
but
have
not
yet
been
caught
as
rodney
moore
the
chief
of
police
of
charlotte
mecklenburg
north
carolina
stated
we
could
name
our
top
offenders
so
we
will
focus
on
those
individuals
the
persons
responsible
for
the
criminal
activity
regardless
of
who
they
are
or
where
they
live
we
re
not
just
looking
for
crime
we
re
looking
for
people
n
these
unofficial
lists
are
not
based
on
ongoing
observed

instead

few
limits
exist
on
accessing

the
controlling
fourth

standard
derived
from
katz
v

asks
whether
an
individual

an
expectation

that
society
would
consider

reasonable
n
this
expectation

test
has

who
enter
the
criminal

it
also
has
little

the

reasoned
that

n
in
addition

some
inclination
to
reconsider
the
third

doctrine
n
by
and
large
however
fourth
amendment
protection
is
currently
unavailable
for
this
type
of

unlike
these
constitutionally
unprotected
categories
of

there
exists
a
patchwork
of
statutes
that
limit
the
disclosure
of
health
information
financial
information
and
some
online
communication
n
to
be
clear
these
statutes
cover
direct
access
to
third
party
information
for
example
the
health
insurance
portability
and
accountability
act
of
n
hipaa
protects
access
to
medical
records
although
it
allows
law
enforcement
to
access
the
records
through
an
administrative
trial
or
grand

likewise

such
as
the
gramm

n
the
bank
secrecy
act
n
the
right
to
financial

act
of

and
the
fair

n
provide
some
measure
of
protection
from
unauthorized
access
to
financial
records
although
these
protections
can
be
surmounted
by
a
subpoena
or
court
order
similarly
the
content

statutorily
protected
by
the
electronic

privacy
act

lapses

telephone

through
the
telephone

they

if
the
evidence
is
relevant
based
on
specific

articulable
facts
n
in
addition
to
constitutional
and
statutory
protections
certain
consumer
guidelines
established

yet
most
major
commercial

n
these
economic
incentives
combined
with
a
willingness

consider
a
modern
day
terry
v
ohio
situation
detective
mcfadden
is
patrolling
the
street
he
observes
john
terry
and
using
facial
recognition
technology
identifies
him
and
begins
to
investigate
using
big
data
detective
mcfadden
learns
through
a
database
search
that
terry
has
a
prior
criminal
record
including
a
couple
of
convictions
and
a
number
of
arrests
n
mcfadden
learns
through
pattern
matching
links
that
terry
is
an
associate
a
hanger
on
of
a
notorious
violent
local
gangster
billy
cox
who
had
been
charged
with
several
murders
n
mcfadden
also
learns
that
terry
has
a
substance
abuse
problem
and
is
addicted
to
drugs
n
these
factors
all
true
but
unknown
to
the
real
detective
mcfadden
are
individualized
and
particularized
to
terry
alone
they
may
not
constitute
reasonable
suspicion
that
terry
is
committing
or
about
to
commit
a
particular
crime
but
in
conjunction
with
terry
s
observed
actions
of
pacing
outside
a
store
with
two
associates
the
information
makes
the
reasonable
suspicion
finding
easier
and
likely
more
reliable
in
observation
cases
by
using
mobile
facial
recognition
to
identify
the
suspect
the
officer
now
can
turn
any
unknown
suspect
into
a
known
suspect
and
can
search
for
information
that
might
justify
reasonable
suspicion
this
change
allows
the
officer
to
review
traditional
data
sources
known
to
law
enforcement
including
prior
criminal
history
arrests
addresses
gang
associations
known
associates
and
even
concealed
weapons
permits
perhaps
this
individual
is
on
a
local
most
wanted
list
or
a
watch
list
as
someone
who
has
already
been
identified
as
being
trouble
in
the
neighborhood
n
perhaps
his
height
weight
race
hairstyle
facial
hair
or
other
distinguishing
marks
match
a
robbery
suspect
this
traditional
law
enforcement
information
might
also
now
include
data
from
automatic
license
plate
readers
digitally
archived
surveillance
video
and
intelligence
reports
created
and
maintained
by
police
even
this
limited
information
may
be
as
a
constitutional
matter
enough
for
an
officer
to
stop
the
suspect
if
for
example
the
suspect
had
an
extensive
history
of
commercial
robberies
or
if
license
plate
data
connected
him
to
prior
robberies
in
the
area
this
information
might
well
constitute
reasonable
suspicion
that
the
suspect
was
going
to
commit
a
robbery
additional
big
data
innovations
may
also
assist
the
police
for
example
the
new
york
police
department
nypd
has
unveiled
the
domain
awareness
system
das
in
partnership
with
microsoft
n
this
technology
allows
an
officer
to
observe
through
video
surveillance
or
automated
license
plate
readers
the
location
of
a
suspect
prior
to
the
initial
observation
das
is
capable
of
rapidly
blending
and
analyzing
realtime
data
gathered
from
roughly
civic
closed
circuit
cameras
call
recordings
and
license
plate
readers
as
well
as
historical
crime
reports
now
the
nypd
can
do
things
like
track
a
vehicle
and
instantly
determine
nearly
everywhere
it
s
been
for
the
past
few
days
or
weeks
instantly
access
a
suspect
s
arrest
record
and
all
the
calls
related
to
a
particular
crime
and
map
criminal
history
to
geospatially
and
chronologically
reveal
crime
patterns
n
thus
the
officer
could
determine
whether
the
suspect
had
just
arrived
with
a
getaway
driver
had
been
casing
the
store
or
had
merely
been
doing
non
criminal
errands
all
morning
n
these
patterns
may
well
affect
whether
an
officer
has
reasonable
suspicion
that
a
suspect
is
about
to
commit
a
crime
for
a
second
level
of
inquiry
imagine
the
police
officer
uses
networked
databases
owned
by
third
parties
to
discover
personal
information
about
a
suspect
this
data
might
include
credit
information
financial
records
credit
card
activity
employment
past
addresses
and
telephone
numbers
names
and
addresses
of
family
members
neighbors
addresses
and
telephone
numbers
business
associates
make
model
and
color
of
registered
vehicles
social
security
numbers
dates
of
birth
bankruptcies
liens
and
judgments
and
gps
locational
data
while
access
to
some
of
these
data
would
usually
require
particular
legal
authorization
law
enforcement
can
circumvent
statutes
restricting
direct
access
by
instead
using
fourth
party
commercial
aggregators
n
such
personalized
information
will
allow
an
officer
to
develop
a
more
individualized
picture
of
a
suspect
while
generally
unemployment
credit
card
debt
and
bankruptcy
are
not
indicia
of
criminal
activity
when
viewed
in
conjunction
with
suspicious
action
in
front
of
an
expensive
jewelry
store
however
a
personal
financial
crisis
might
be
relevant
to
the
totality
of
circumstances
further
accurate
gps
data
tying
the
suspect
to
a
prior
robbery
or
to
a
pawnshop
might
lead
to
reasonable
suspicion
even
the
otherwise
innocent
purchase
of
a
wool
cap
or
ski
mask
at
walmart
might
tip
a
seasonal
purchase
into
reasonable
suspicion
finally
imagine
if
law
enforcement
could
access
the
suspect
s
social
media
data
n
search
queries
facebook
and
twitter
posts
youtube
videos
emails
texts
and
similar
communications
are
all
available
to
third
party
providers
if
not
publically
available
while
personal
content
is
usually
statutorily
or
commercially
protected
it
is
generally
not
constitutionally
protected
this
mosaic
of
personal
information
might
well
provide
individualized
facts
necessary
to
make
the
police
officer
s
suspicion
reasonable
n
for
example
a
suspect
s
admission
of
financial
difficulties
or
photograph
displaying
the
fruits
of
the
crime
through
social
media
could
appropriately
be
added
to
the
totality
of
circumstances
with
each
level
of
search
officers
can
access
additional
individualized
and
particularized
facts
that
when
viewed
within
the
totality
of
circumstances
help
justify
the
officer
s
stop
of
a
suspect
the
effect
is
that
additional
personalized
information
encourages
a
finding
of
reasonable
suspicion
a
trip
to
a
pawnshop
could
indicate
a
person
is
selling
stolen
goods
or
is
merely
poor
enough
to
have
to
sell
belongings
at
a
steep
discount
a
photograph
of
jewelry
could
be
an
admission
of
theft
or
could
simply
be
a
photograph
of
jewelry
yet
in
a
criminal
investigation
the
inferences
of
suspicion
are
easy
to
develop
and
against
a
low
legal
threshold
easy
to
meet
of
course
suspicious
facts
must
be
connected
with
a
suspected
crime
it
would
not
be
relevant
if
the
searches
revealed
a
pattern
of
domestic
violence
crimes
unrelated
to
robbery
it
would
also
not
be
relevant
if
the
information
was
not
directly
connected
to
the
suspect
being
a
friend
of
a
friend
of
a
known
robber
is
a
fact
but
not
one
that
should
influence
the
constitutional
calculus
but
as
long
as
the
data
are
connected
to
both
the
suspected
criminal
activity
and
the
suspected
criminal
it
would
likely
be
persuasive
in
evaluating
reasonable
suspicion
in
observation
cases
b
investigation
of
completed
crimes
many
crimes
occur
without
direct
police
observation
and
police
must
investigate
the
crime
to
identify
the
perpetrator
reasonable
suspicion
is
still
relevant
in
investigating
past
crimes
assuming
the
information
available
does
not
rise
to
the
higher
level
of
probable
cause
n
in
hensley
the
supreme
court
set
out
the
standard
for
investigating
past
crimes
based
on
reasonable
suspicion
the
precise
limits
on
investigatory
stops
to
investigate
past
criminal
activity
are
more
difficult
to
define
the
proper
way
to
identify
the
limits
is
to
apply
the
same
test
already
used
to
identify
the
proper
bounds
of
intrusions
that
further
investigations
of
imminent
or
ongoing
crimes
that
test
which
is
grounded
in
the
standard
of
reasonableness
embodied
in
the
fourth
amendment
balances
the
nature
and
quality
of
the
intrusion
on
personal
security
against
the
importance
of
the
governmental
interests
alleged
to
justify
the
intrusion
when
this
balancing
test
is
applied
to
stops
to
investigate
past
crimes
we
think
that
probable
cause
to
arrest
need
not
always
be
required
n
while
acknowledging
that
courts
might
balance
these
interests
differently
when
investigating
a
past
completed
crime
as
opposed
to
an
ongoing
crime
n
the
supreme
court
still
held
that
the
ability
to
briefly
stop
that
person
ask
questions
or
check
identification
in
the
absence
of
probable
cause
promotes
the
strong
government
interest
in
solving
crimes
and
bringing
offenders
to
justice
n
by
adopting
a
reasonable
suspicion
test
for
investigation
of
past
crimes
the
court
gave
police
the
flexibility
to
stop
suspects
based
on
this
lower
threshold
of
suspicion
n
as
in
observation
cases
the
primary
use
of
big
data
would
be
to
identify
unknown
perpetrators
for
arrest
and
prosecution
as
one
security
expert
explained
imagine
the
ability
to
instantly
take
a
security
camera
photograph
from
a
bank
robbery
and
match
it
using
a
facial
recognition
algorithm
to
a
photograph
in
an
out
of
state
motor
vehicle
database
and
then
to
link
that
person
s
name
to
a
mobile
phone
from
a
private
sector
marketing
database
n
already
police
have
relied
on
similar
linkages
of
networked
information
in
more
run
of
the
mill
cases
n
with
new
search
technology
disparate
pieces
of
data
are
compiled
to
link
match
and
identify
a
suspect
through
pattern
matching
techniques
this
can
be
done
not
only
with
a
name
address
or
license
plate
but
also
with
a
particular
modus
operandi
n
this
information
specific
to
a
person
and
particularized
to
a
crime
meets
both
requirements
needed
to
establish
reasonable
suspicion
the
value
of
big
data
to
reasonable
suspicion
investigations
is
probably
greater
than
its
value
to
observation
cases
because
police
have
time
to
surmount
the
legal
process
requirements
necessary
to
obtain
third
party
information
n
with
an
official
request
a
court
order
or
a
subpoena
let
alone
a
warrant
or
grand
jury
subpoena
law
enforcement
officers
can
obtain
most
third
party
data
if
doing
so
in
furtherance
of
a
criminal
investigation
n
software
can
isolate
patterns
and
identify
suspects
through
existing
public
and
private
data
in
novel
ways
one
fascinating
example
of
big
data
sleuthing
arose
out
of
the
investigation
of
a
major
swedish
armed
robbery
of
millions
of
dollars
n
police
assumed
that
to
disguise
their
plot
the
thieves
must
have
used
prepaid
disposable
phones
data
analysts
then
searched
through
the
list
of
all
prepaid
disposable
phones
in
the
area
looking
for
a
set
of
phones
that
stayed
within
their
own
miniature
network
n
police
analysts
found
a
single
set
of
phones
that
only
communicated
with
each
other
did
so
only
for
a
few
weeks
leading
up
to
the
heist
and
then
went
silent
after
the
robbery
identifying
this
network
allowed
police
to
solve
the
case
police
traced
the
phones
to
specific
cell
tower
locations
corresponding
with
the
robbers
locations
before
during
and
after
the
robbery
n
in
fact
once
police
knew
the
numbers
they
could
track
location
by
location
exactly
where
the
robbers
had
been
when
police
identified
one
person
who
had
purchased
the
phones
they
were
able
to
determine
how
the
crime
occurred
and
the
location
of
the
thieves
at
all
times
n
major
police
departments
as
well
as
the
fbi
have
adopted
this
type
of
pattern
matching
investigation
technique
n
in
child
abduction
cases
amber
alerts
have
led
to
quick
reviews
of
license
plate
reader
databases
by
searching
the
location
of
a
car
police
can
determine
the
likely
route
of
the
suspect
n
in
gang
cases
recordings
of
gunshots
have
helped
map
out
areas
of
contested
gang
turf
n
returning
to
the
robbery
example
imagine
that
a
particular
jewelry
store
was
robbed
by
an
unknown
suspect
police
officers
have
a
video
still
from
the
robbery
that
does
not
allow
for
a
facial
recognition
match
the
photo
however
clearly
shows
a
neck
tattoo
and
officers
obtain
a
partial
description
of
the
getaway
car
running
a
search
for
the
tattoo
against
a
database
might
narrow
the
list
of
suspects
comparing
the
narrowed
list
with
owners
of
a
particular
type
of
car
might
further
limit
the
list
of
suspects
looking
at
the
remaining
suspects
associates
movements
or
even
bank
deposits
credit
card
expenditures
or
social
media
comments
might
again
tighten
the
search
the
result
is
that
big
data
can
help
identify
the
suspect
with
a
few
search
queries
while
these
data
might
not
be
enough
to
get
an
arrest
warrant
they
would
likely
provide
the
reasonable
suspicion
needed
to
stop
and
investigate
the
suspect
n
c
predicting
crimes
unlike
observation
or
investigation
cases
reasonable
suspicion
based
on
prediction
remains
the
stuff
of
science
fiction
police
have
begun
to
predict
areas
of
heightened
criminal
activity
n
and
may
predict
likely
troublemakers
involved
in
criminal
enterprise
through
an
unofficial
bad
guy
list
but
predictive
analytics
cannot
yet
tell
police
whom
to
stop
for
a
crime
not
yet
committed
to
be
clear
these
are
prediction
based
stops
where
no
crime
has
occurred
and
no
crime
is
observed
yet
big
data
invites
provocative
questions
about
whether
such
predictive
tips
should
factor
into
the
reasonable
suspicion
calculus
for
example
if
a
drug
distribution
gang
is
run
by
a
tight
knit
family
or
neighborhood
organization
such
that
the
pattern
for
several
years
has
been
that
when
one
family
member
is
arrested
another
cousin
or
brother
takes
their
place
then
why
can
we
not
predict
who
will
be
the
next
member
of
the
gang
n
if
burglaries
are
contagious
in
part
because
the
same
gang
of
burglars
commits
similar
crimes
and
police
identify
one
burglar
why
should
we
not
target
a
burglar
s
associates
as
likely
suspects
for
future
burglaries
n
in
these
cases
police
could
show
specific
and
articulable
facts
indicating
that
a
particular
person
is
likely
to
participate
in
ongoing
criminal
activity
e
g
drug
dealing
or
burglaries
n
because
the
criminal
enterprise
is
ongoing
the
terry
standard
might
well
apply
and
police
could
try
to
stop
and
investigate
would
be
members
of
these
criminal
organizations
if
they
were
observed
doing
anything
that
might
suggest
drug
dealing
or
burglary
the
questions
get
harder
when
no
ongoing
criminal
enterprise
exists
yet
the
same
predictive
logic
holds
in
chicago
analysts
have
identified
young
people
at
greater
risk
of
being
involved
in
gun
violence
n
researchers
can
predict
their
likelihood
of
being
a
victim
or
perpetrator
of
gun
violence
using
big
data
metrics
including
place
of
residence
social
associations
e
g
past
experience
with
victims
of
gun
violence
and
gang
connections
and
age
n
assuming
the
accuracy
of
these
data
could
police
target
these
individuals
as
part
of
a
predictive
stop
strategy
n
in
fact
the
chicago
police
department
appears
to
have
adopted
this
predictive
logic
in
its
intervention
program
as
described
by
the
new
york
times
in
recent
months
as
many
as
officers
a
day
working
overtime
have
been
dispatched
to
just
small
zones
deemed
the
city
s
most
dangerous
the
police
say
they
are
tamping
down
retaliatory
shootings
between
gang
factions
by
using
a
comprehensive
analysis
of
the
city
s
tens
of
thousands
of
suspected
gang
members
the
turf
they
claim
and
their
rivalries
the
police
are
also
focusing
on
more
than
people
they
have
identified
as
having
associations
that
make
them
the
most
likely
to
be
involved
in
a
murder
as
a
victim
or
an
offender
n
those
four
hundred
individuals
part
of
a
list
of
predicted
offenders
were
identified
through
big
data
techniques
chicago
police
call
it
a
heat
list
n
young
men
on
the
heat
list
are
targets
of
predictive
intervention
based
strategies
while
a
fourth
amendment
stop
based
solely
on
an
individual
s
inclusion
on
this
list
without
more
might
not
be
sufficiently
particularized
big
data
tools
exist
to
generate
the
necessary
reasonable
suspicion
n
for
example
imagine
one
of
those
four
hundred
individuals
is
a
young
man
whom
police
wish
to
stop
because
they
suspect
that
he
is
up
to
no
good
and
likely
in
possession
of
a
gun
plainly
an
officer
s
suspicion
that
someone
is
up
to
no
good
does
not
constitute
constitutionally
sufficient
justification
for
a
stop
an
officer
sees
the
young
man
on
the
streets
but
not
engaged
in
any
overt
criminal
activity
the
officer
identifies
the
young
man
as
being
on
a
list
of
individuals
that
predictive
analytics
suggested
are
at
a
heightened
risk
of
involvement
in
gun
violence
a
quick
ncic
database
search
reveals
gang
contacts
criminal
associates
and
prior
arrests
including
gun
charges
gang
tattoos
link
the
young
man
to
local
gangs
a
license
plate
reader
places
the
family
car
in
the
general
vicinity
of
a
gang
shooting
in
the
last
month
his
facebook
profile
contains
statements
that
police
could
interpret
as
directing
violence
at
rival
gang
members
n
finally
predictive
policing
software
has
forecast
the
young
man
s
location
as
the
site
of
likely
gun
violence
if
the
police
officer
stops
the
young
man
doing
nothing
overtly
criminal
and
finds
a
gun
during
a
frisk
would
a
court
really
say
there
was
not
individualized
and
particularized
suspicion
that
this
individual
was
involved
in
gun
and
gang
related
activity
though
the
young
man
took
no
action
to
signify
criminal
activity
the
data
suggest
that
he
was
far
more
likely
to
be
in
possession
of
a
gun
than
most
people
in
chicago
how
courts
resolve
these
issues
will
determine
the
impact
of
big
data
on
law
enforcement
on
one
hand
judges
might
require
some
affirmative
imminent
suspicious
activity
correlating
with
gun
possession
before
upholding
the
stop
such
as
furtive
movements
a
suspicious
bulge
or
unexplained
nervousness
n
without
the
requirement
of
some
observable
activity
the
odds
increase
that
predictive
stops
will
target
innocent
people
criminalize
by
association
and
negatively
impact
individuals
based
on
little
more
than
a
hunch
supported
by
non
criminal
facts
on
the
other
hand
many
judges
might
find
this
totality
of
suspicions
even
if
focused
on
a
particular
suspect
and
not
a
crime
sufficient
to
justify
an
investigatory
stop
reasonable
suspicion
is
a
low
threshold
thus
in
practice
aggregated
reasonable
suspicion
would
likely
justify
a
stop
in
many
courtrooms

this
shift

big

suspicion
big
data
s
ability
to
generate
information
about
an
identified
suspect
reveals
the
inherent
vulnerability
in
the
reasonable
suspicion
standard
indeed
along
the
continuum
of
suspicion
more
data
makes
it
easier
to
satisfy
the
standard
for
two
primary
reasons
first
under
a
totality
of
circumstances
test
the
more
factors
a
court
considers
in
the
totality
the
easier
it
is
to
articulate
suspicion
quantity
can
make
up
for
quality
n
second
the
information
provided
by
big
data
is
individualized
and
particularized
consistent
with
the
terry
language
n
to
be
clear
the
data
are
individualized
to
the
criminal
not
the
crime
as
courts
apply
terry
however
which
arose
in
the
unknown
suspect
context
the
difference
becomes
blurred
this
latter
point
is
important
to
emphasize
the
language
in
the
earlier
reasonable
suspicion
cases
speaks
to
a
general
suspicion
of
unspecified
criminal
actions
using
terms
like
criminal
activity
may
be
afoot
n
involved
in
criminal
activity
n
legal
wrongdoing
n
or
illegality
n
the
general
language
does
not
require
discussion
of
a
particular
observed
crime
e
g
drug
distribution
or
gun
possession
because
the
officer
actually
observed
the
illegal
activity
in
question
the
observed
crime
and
the
observed
criminal
were
not
separate
things
to
analyze
no
distinction
was
needed
in
the
analysis
thus
in
a
small
data
world
the
traditional
language
describing
suspicious
behavior
has
no
meaning
outside
of
the
observed
activity
in
a
big
data
world
this
same
generalized
language
becomes
distorted
an
officer
may
know
information
about
a
suspect
but
the
question
becomes
how
does
that
information
relate
to
the
observed
actions
knowing
someone
is
a
drug
dealer
does
not
mean
that
the
individual
is
actively
dealing
drugs
at
the
moment
of
observation
courts
analyzing
big
data
suspicion
should
thus
be
careful
to
require
a
direct
link
between
the
past
data
about
a
suspect
and
the
observed
suspicion
with
big
data
suspicion
it
is
important
for
the
individualized
and
particularized
information
to
relate
to
the
particular
action
observed
if
a
police
officer
identifies
a
suspect
and
learns
information
about
the
suspect
s
arrests
convictions
or
associations
that
has
nothing
to
do
with
the
observed
actions
if
the
officer
observed
any
actions
at
all
then
the
new
information
should
be
irrelevant
to
the
reasonable
suspicion
calculus
only
when
those
particularized
factors
can
be
connected
to
observed
actions
that
signify
criminal
activity
should
they
affect
the
analysis
courts
will
soon
be
asked
to
address
the
impact
of
big
data
on
reasonable
suspicion
but
before
that
time
policymakers
will
need
to
think
through
and
evaluate
whether
this
innovation
is
good
or
bad
for
police
individuals
and
society
iv
evaluating
big
data
and
predictive
reasonable
suspicion
while
big
data
may
expose
the
fragility
of
the
reasonable
suspicion
doctrine
the
technology
has
arrived
and
its
impact
on
fourth
amendment
cases
is
imminent
as
such
it
is
necessary
to
evaluate
the
questions
of
law
and
policy
that
arise
from
the
move
to
big
data
policing
this
part
discusses
positives
and
negatives
of
big
data
policing
and
provides
suggestions
on
how
to
address
the
pending
evolution
of
fourth
amendment
doctrine
a
the
positives
of
big
data
suspicion
as
may
be
evident
from
early
adoption
and
experimentation
with
predictive
technologies
law
enforcement
officials
see
the
potential
of
these
tools
to
reduce
crime
big
data
suspicion
if
used
correctly
can
improve
accuracy
and
efficiency
and
it
will
yield
unexpected
insights
into
the
patterns
of
criminal
activity
improved
accuracy
reasonable
suspicion
based
on
big
data
primarily
benefits
law
enforcement
because
of
the
increased
accuracy
it
purports
to
offer
n
more
information
and
more
precise
information
should
make
it
more
likely
that
police
target
actual
criminals
rather
than
innocent
people
in
a
small
data
environment
police
rely
on
proxies
for
information
to
the
detriment
of
everyone
class
race
age
choice
of
clothing
and
gender
all
factor
into
police
officers
discretionary
decisions
on
the
street
n
police
perceive
ambiguous
actions
as
suspicious
because
of
subtle
cues
or
instincts
these
judgments
also
unfortunately
include
explicit
and
implicit
biases
policing
traditions
and
the
frailties
of
human
perception
n
replacing
those
generalized
intuitions
with
precise
detail
about
actual
people
should
result
in
a
more
accurate
policing
strategy
humans
are
notoriously
bad
at
making
snap
judgments
and
while
police
officers
make
more
snap
judgments
than
most
they
are
not
immune
from
the
imperfections
of
human
nature
n
for
example
stories
of
racial
profiling
involving
famous
celebrities
wealthy
professionals
and
other
citizens
show
how
racial
stereotypes
can
influence
suspicion
n
yet
in
a
big
data
world
a
quick
license
plate
scan
or
facial
recognition
check
and
a
query
of
other
databases
perhaps
including
professional
licenses
or
even
addresses
could
help
avoid
the
indignity
of
detention
based
solely
on
a
police
hunch
n
of
course
in
many
cases
information
will
not
reveal
that
the
individual
is
a
celebrity
but
even
basic
personal
or
employment
data
or
lack
of
criminal
information
might
provide
police
with
a
clue
that
a
suspect
is
just
an
ordinary
citizen
not
involved
in
criminal
activity
while
vulnerable
to
abuse
predictive
suspicion
ultimately
may
make
police
stops
more
reliable
at
its
core
reasonable
suspicion
is
a
doctrine
of
predictive
suspicion
the
collected
totality
of
circumstances
must
justify
an
officer
s
prediction
that
criminal
activity
is
afoot
n
thus
having
more
information
about
an
individual
should
result
in
more
reliable
predictions
n
if
police
focus
their
efforts
on
people
placed
on
bad
guy
lists
it
may
protect
individuals
who
are
not
on
the
lists
if
police
are
forced
to
use
big
data
to
identify
and
link
a
suspect
to
a
crime
they
may
also
see
patterns
that
suggest
that
the
suspect
was
not
involved
in
the
crime
in
this
way
big
data
policing
may
be
a
measure
more
protective
of
individuals
on
the
street
the
accuracy
that
big
data
provides
not
only
increases
the
likelihood
that
police
target
the
right
suspects
but
also
in
turn
prevents
the
resulting
physical
face
to
face
interactions
that
generate
tension
n
many
police
stops
involve
confirming
or
disproving
suspicion
n
even
if
no
arrest
results
the
unpleasant
and
perhaps
unnecessary
police
citizen
contact
breeds
resentment
and
distrust
n
allowing
police
to
confirm
a
person
s
lack
of
involvement
in
criminal
activity
through
a
database
search
rather
than
a
physical
stop
avoids
unnecessary
conflict
exculpatory
facts
suspicion
is
not
a
one
way
street
suspicion
can
be
disproved
suspicion
can
be
alleviated
the
advent
of
big
data
suspicion
may
require
consideration
of
exculpatory
factors
that
lessen
suspicion
just
as
big
data
enables
a
wealth
of
suspicious
inferences
it
also
generates
an
equal
number
of
potentially
exculpatory
facts
for
example
if
detective
mcfadden
learned
that
john
terry
s
wife
worked
near
the
downtown
location
of
the
observation
pacing
outside
a
store
might
turn
from
casing
a
robbery
to
waiting
for
a
loved
one
the
potentially
exculpatory
nature
of
big
data
is
a
strong
positive
argument
for
its
use
in
policing
presumably
if
big
data
information
exists
about
a
suspect
police
should
be
obligated
to
check
before
initiating
a
stop
n
the
totality
of
circumstances
should
not
be
understood
as
the
totality
of
suspicious
activities
it
should
include
exculpatory
information
that
reduces
suspicion
as
well
this
is
an
established
part
of
the
probable
cause
analysis
n
and
big
data
technology
allows
it
to
be
included
in
the
reasonable
suspicion
analysis
thus
existing
exculpatory
information
should
be
factored
into
the
totality
of
circumstances
and
weighted
just
as
heavily
as
suspicious
factors
courts
might
even
require
police
to
factor
in
exculpatory
information
as
a
self
contained
check
on
the
regular
discretionary
powers
granted
to
police
when
big
data
is
available
an
officer
who
did
not
use
it
in
an
exculpatory
manner
might
be
deemed
to
have
acted
recklessly
n
in
the
same
way
that
courts
may
take
a
negative
inference
from
an
unrecorded
confession
in
a
jurisdiction
where
videotaping
confessions
is
the
norm
a
failure
to
use
the
available
search
technology
might
be
held
against
the
officer
n
in
this
way
using
big
data
to
determine
reasonable
suspicion
might
actually
prevent
certain
stops
that
would
have
been
allowed
under
a
traditional
small
data
reasonable
suspicion
standard
accountability
focusing
on
big
data
sources
also
provides
the
potential
for
increased
documentation
of
stops
in
general
police
do
not
document
their
suspicions
before
a
stop
nor
does
anyone
do
so
on
their
behalf
n
data
driven
suspicion
though
can
be
documented
beforehand
police
officers
could
demonstrate
the
steps
they
took
to
investigate
a
suspect
by
producing
records
of
which
databases
they
accessed
and
which
search
queries
they
used
in
this
way
police
would
replace
the
ex
post
justification
for
a
stop
with
an
ex
ante
description
of
the
steps
taken
to
validate
a
hunch
before
conducting
a
stop
in
simple
terms
a
police
officer
could
show
that
she
checked
the
ncic
database
and
ran
a
license
plate
check
before
explaining
why
this
information
corroborated
her
initial
suspicion
this
record
has
the
potential
not
only
to
limit
whom
police
stop
but
also
to
make
a
judge
s
determination
of
an
officer
s
reasonable
suspicion
significantly
easier
this
documentation
will
also
encourage
the
development
of
a
culture
that
allows
for
auditing
of
data
standards
for
record
collection
and
perhaps
even
notice
requirements
for
targeted
suspects
for
example
police
administrators
as
an
internal
monitoring
strategy
might
examine
an
officer
s
history
of
stops
to
see
what
factors
influenced
his
decision
to
stop
a
suspect
looking
through
the
documented
history
of
big
data
searches
and
comparing
them
with
the
justifications
for
a
stop
might
help
police
develop
better
training
tools
and
build
stronger
accountability
measures
independent
of
any
court
case
internal
monitoring
measures
can
improve
hit
rates
for
arrests
in
other
data
driven
contexts
these
types
of
retention
and
accountability
efforts
are
built
into
the
regulating
structure

efficiency
a
move
toward
data
driven
policing
will
also
improve
the
efficient
use
of
police
resources
in
many
cases
better
information
will
lead
police
to
focus
scarce
resources
on
more
serious
risks

prevent
unnecessary
contacts
with
law
abiding
citizens
the
rise
of
predictive
policing
signals
the
beginning
of
this
shift
to
data
driven

underlying
the
theory

that

predictive

will
suggest

such
suspicion
will
often
be
unfounded
perhaps
a

might
stop
the
suspected
burglar
solely
because
of
this
correlation
one
can
imagine
that
those
individuals
who
find
themselves
on
a
bad
guy
list
will
be
marked
for
more
than
their
fair
share
of
borderline
suspicious
stops
n
big
data
suspicion
creates
the
real
concern
that
certain
individuals
by
virtue
of
their
past
criminal
activities
will
always
be
at
risk
to
be
stopped
those
with
lengthy
criminal
records
or
gang
associations
may
be
stopped
because
of
who
they
are
and
not
what
they
are
doing
prior
police
contacts
will
become
the
digital
scarlet
letter
marking
certain
people
in
a
community
as
suspicious
n
over
the
past
several
decades
poor
people
and
people
of
color
have
had
disproportionate
contact
with
the
criminal
justice
system
n
if
these
contacts
become
data
points
that
can
be
used
in
a
reasonable
suspicion
analysis
then
these
data
may
become
proxies
for
race
or
class
with
similar
effect
for
example
the
aclu
s
recent
national
study
on
marijuana
arrests
demonstrates
that
african
americans
are
more
likely
to
be
arrested
for
marijuana
than
whites
despite
equivalent
usage
rates
n
thus
more
data
has
been
collected
about
minority
marijuana
possession
even
though
whites
commit
the
crime
at
the
same
rate
if
data
are
collected
only
about
certain
classes
of
people
then
those
people
are
more
likely
to
become
future
targets
of
suspicion
simply
because
of
the
initial
selection
bias
thus
important
questions
remain
about
who
collects
interprets
and
chooses
the
big
data
to
study
n
worse
like
other
quantitative
systems
used
for
decisionmaking
big
data
based
predictive
policing
will
appear
to
be
objective
and
fair
when
it
may
in
fact
reflect
subjective
factors
and
structural
inequalities
just
as
we
have
credit
ratings
that
allow
lenders
to
predict
future
creditworthiness
police
could
develop
criminal
ratings
to
predict
future
criminal
proclivity
n
similarly
data
can
lead
us
to
believe
our
own
worst
instincts
n
if
published
data
demonstrate
a
higher
arrest
rate
for
people
of
color
then
this
information
may
well
influence
discretionary
decisions
about
who
to
stop
n
implicit
bias
and
confirmation
bias
will
result
in
police
seeing
what
they
have
been
told
to
see
even
if
it
is
not
actually
occurring
n
implicit
bias
involves
unconscious
prejudices
that
influence
individuals
making
discretionary
decisions
n
this
can
result
in
unequal
outcomes
for
similarly
situated
individuals
n
implicit
bias
inevitably
exists
in
the
ordinary
course
of
police
activities
but
is
even
more
damaging
when
combined
with
confirmation
bias
the
tendency
to
bolster
a
hypothesis
by
seeking
consistent
evidence
while
minimizing
inconsistent
evidence
n
thus
an
officer
conditioned
to
believe
that
a
particular
type
of
person
may
be
more
likely
to
commit
a
criminal
act
will
likely
see
that
person
through
the
lens
of
suspicion
by
providing
the
information
to
confirm
this
suspicion
big
data
will
make
it
easier
for
police
to
justify
a
stop
even
more
dangerously
an
officer
with
discriminatory
animus
may
be
able
to
justify
a
knowingly
unconstitutional
stop
using
an
aggregation
of
otherwise
innocent
data
n
this
risk
demonstrates
how
suspicions
about
past
criminal
actions
can
all
too
easily
morph
into
suspicions
about
current
criminal
activity
it
highlights
the
importance
of
requiring
a
nexus
between
the
suspected
criminal
and
the
suspected
criminal
activity
it
also
highlights
the
dangers
of
how
big
data
can
target
certain
populations
based
on
correlations
with
possible
criminal
activity
rather
than
causation
from
real
criminal
activity
justification
to
stop
these
individuals
marked
by
big
data
will
be
too
easily

this
article
is
an
attempt
to
sketch
the
potential
impact
of
big
data
information
on
a
small
data
reasonable
suspicion
doctrine
it
has
exposed
real
distortions
and
potential
vulnerabilities
as
well
as
clear
advantages
that
arise
from
this
technological
innovation
the
debate
over
big
data
is
noisy
and
contested
perhaps
revealing
its
immature
state
of
development
this
last
part
addresses
tentative
solutions
in
this
changed
landscape
a
doctrinal
changes
initially
we
could
simply
require
a
more
stringent
standard
of
reasonable
suspicion
to
be
clear
the
supreme
court
has
been
steadfast
in
articulating
that
it
has
no
intention
of
quantifying
or
even
clarifying
the
standard
instead
recognizing
that
police
officers
operate
within
the
factual
and
practical
considerations
of
everyday
life
on
which
reasonable
and
prudent
men
not
legal
technicians
act
n
but
if
the
underlying
logic
of
a
standard
based
on
unknown
suspects
has
been
upended
by
all
knowing
technology
then
perhaps
the
standard
needs
to
be
altered
the
factual
and
practical
considerations
are
no
longer
limited
to
small
data
observations
so
why
shouldn
t
the
factual
and
practical
considerations
include
requiring
more
data
now
easily
available
one
could
imagine
that
in
the
context
of
big
data
predictive
suspicion
where
police
can
more
easily
access
information
courts
might
require
more
information
to
satisfy
the
reasonable
suspicion
standard
n
in
practical
terms
this
could
result
in
a
different
standard
of
reasonable
suspicion
when
big
data
information
is
used
if
big
data
makes
more
information
available
with
relatively
little
effort
then
big
data
should
be
required
to
be
part
of
the
reasonable
suspicion
calculus
this
would
include
both
potentially
suspicious
and
potentially
exculpatory
information
after
all
if
the
original
justification
for
reasonable
suspicion
arose
out
of
a
situation
necessarily
limited
by
practicality
unknown
suspect
potentially
imminent
crime
limited
information
then
better
information
about
a
known
suspect
suggests
a
different
standard
should
be
used
n
b
big
data
changes
if
changing
the
standard
of
reasonable
suspicion
is
not
a
realistic
option
then
perhaps
the
solution
lies
in
the
nature
of
big
data
itself
at
its
core
big
data
encourages
a
heightened
focus
on
statistical
analysis
geospatial
and
temporal
analysis
and
link
analysis
adapting
these
three
methods
of
analysis
to
big
data
suspicion
on
the
streets
might
provide
some
precision
and
thus
some
limitation
for
an
otherwise
malleable
standard
statistical
analysis
first
big
data
not
only
involves
making
predictions
but
also
quantifying
the
likelihood
that
these
predictions
will
come
true
the
statistical
analysis
behind
the
predictive
analytics
provides
actual
observable
numbers
for
example
a
predictive
policing
algorithm
might
report
a
chance
of
a
burglary
on
a
particular
block
n
a
pattern
match
might
provide
police
with
a
percentage
likelihood
that
a
particular
suspect
associates
with
another
individual
in
these
cases
if
part
of
the
predictive
suspicion
of
an
individual
comes
from
big
data
courts
could
require
when
available
a
numerical
prediction
of
accuracy
n
this
quantification
process
would
necessarily
result
in
courts
having
to
confront
the
ultimate
question
of
how
certain
a
police
officer
must
be
to
constitute
reasonable
suspicion
n
this
has
been
a
forbidden
discussion
in
the
courts
and
the
possibility
of
such
a
discussion
would
likely
forestall
any
adoption
of
this
proposal
yet
big
data
creates
the
promise
of
using
quantitative
and
empirical
evidence
to
refine
what
has
ordinarily
been
a
quasi
subjective
judgment
courts
and
police
could
adapt
this
hallmark
of
the
big
data
revolution
to
sharpen
the
reasonable
suspicion
analysis
thus
a
court
might
find
a
likelihood
of
to
be
insufficient
in
the
reasonable
suspicion
analysis
but
a
likelihood
of
to
be
enough
even
if
courts
were
unwilling
to
establish
a
particular
percentage
threshold
as
reasonable
suspicion
the
quantified
likelihood
could
still
be
included
in
the
totality
of
circumstances
calculation
related
to
this
threshold
determination
would
be
the
more
difficult
question
of
whether
the
threshold
should
change
depending
on
the
type
of
crime
at
issue
should
a
predictive
judgment
be
enough
for
a
murder
investigation
but
not
a
drug
crime
should
the
scale
be
a
sliding
one
based
on
risk
of
harm
to
society
n
again
going
back
to
first
principles
terry
involved
a
potential
armed
robbery
this
may
be
different
than
a
potential
shoplifting
offense
risk
assessment
mechanisms
already
exist
that
use
an
adjusted
actuarial
model
that
starts
with
a
fixed
percentage
and
then
adjusts
based
on
other
factors
n
while
not
perfectly
aligned
this
type
of
model
may
prove
useful
in
designing
a
quantifiable
percentage
that
courts
would
be
comfortable
adopting
at
this
early
stage
of
the
development
of
big
data
any
normative
argument
about
how
statistical
precision
should
be
incorporated
into
a
police
officer
s
calculations
will
ultimately
be
unsatisfying
the
algorithms
do
not
yet
exist
that
would
project
numerical
likelihoods
while
one
could
demand
a
specific
numerical
target
we
simply
do
not
know
how
big
data
technology
will
be
integrated
in
everyday
policing
nor
do
we
know
how
data
will
influence
police
officers
discretionary
decisions
the
focus
of
this
article
is
to
highlight
the
existence
of
big
data
policing
and
instead
of
ignoring
it
or
pretending
it
will
not
affect
police
officers
on
the
street
make
courts
and
scholars
aware
of
the
constitutional
concerns
precision
of
place
and
time
second
in
evaluating
big
data
s
influence
courts
could
focus
on
the
precision
of
the
data
in
terms
of
place
and
time
to
observe
how
the
data
correlate
with
the
predicted
suspicion
big
data
s
value
as
a
predictive
tool
involves
its
ability
to
drill
down
to
specific
factors
that
identify
a
specific
person
at
a
specific
time
at
a
specific
place
because
all
predictions
might
come
true
at
a
certain
level
of
abstraction
big
data
also
poses
risks
an
officer
who
sees
a
suspect
on
the
street
outside
the
jewelry
store
and
looks
up
the
suspect
s
criminal
history
which
includes
several
theft
convictions
would
at
one
level
have
persuasive
information
to
consider
in
the
totality
of
circumstances
if
after
further
examination
however
the
officer
found
that
the
thefts
were
exclusively
downloading
digital
music
the
data
would
not
support
suspicion
of
a
jewelry
store
robbery
or
if
the
timing
of
the
prior
thefts
were
several
years
old
or
in
another
state
the
correlation
might
not
be
strong
reliance
on
big
data
because
it
can
provide
granular
information
on
particular
events
or
linkages
should
also
necessitate
a
requirement
of
precision
a
requirement
of
geospatial
and
temporal
precision
would
provide
some
measure
of
protection
as
a
related
point
if
the
reasonable
suspicion
standard
incorporated
an
imminence
requirement
such
that
the
predicted
crime
must
be
imminent
or
occurring
the
general
suspicion
created
by
big
data
would
be
limited
such
a
requirement
would
conflict
with
hensley
which
allows
for
reasonable
suspicion
of
already
completed
crimes
n
but
would
provide
a
counterweight
to
the
power
of
general
suspicion
of
some
unstated
criminal
activity
police
officers
would
need
to
be
able
to
articulate
the
particular
crime
that
was
imminent
based
on
the
data
or
be
foreclosed
from
using
the
information
grafting
on
an
imminence
requirement
could
offer
more
protection
within
the
existing
reasonable
suspicion
analysis
requiring
a
heightened
level
of
technological
precision
is
consistent
with
general
fourth
amendment
principles
requiring
particularity
and
individualization
n
and
preventing
arbitrary
invasions
of
individual
security
n
in
addition
the
availability
of
big
data
sources
now
allows
for
this
level
of
specificity
the
question
for
reviewing
courts
will
be
whether
to
require
it
if
it
were
possible
to
obtain
more
particularized
information
from
available
sources
and
officers
choose
not
to
obtain
that
information
instead
relying
on
generalized
data
then
judges
like
they
routinely
do
with
warrants
could
deny
the
use
of
generalized
data
in
their
reasonable
suspicion
findings
judges
will
be
in
the
best
position
to
make
these
decisions
and
the
more
precision
that
judges
demand
the
more
incentive
there
will
be
for
police
to
generate
precise
information
to
support
their
suspicion
limited
link
analysis
finally
predictive
suspicion
must
embrace
the
cautions
arising
from
link
analysis
which
examines
the
connections
between
data
points
n
in
the
context
of
criminal
activity
link
analysis
refers
to
the
connections
between
criminals
and
between
crimes
though
link
analysis
can
help
find
matches
in
patterns
identify
anomalies
where
known
patterns
are
absent
and
discover
new
patterns
it
remains
fundamentally
overinclusive
there
will
always
be
links
that
demonstrate
nothing
suspicious
correlations
do
not
prove
causation
in
order
to
overcome
uncertainty
in
data
analysts
have
to
go
beyond
direct
links
sometimes
several
links
or
hops
out
and
instead
look
for
approximations
in
identifying
data
this
indirectness
invites
error
in
identification
people
have
the
same
names
n
people
are
related
to
criminals
without
being
criminals
themselves
people
forsake
the
criminal
life
n
in
a
wired
world
people
are
more
closely
connected
than
we
think
researchers
have
validated
the
six
degrees
of
separation
theory
in
the
information
age
n
one
study
of
facebook
users
showed
that
the
average
number
of
acquaintances
separating
any
two
people
in
the
world
was
not
six
but
n
thus
a
link
analysis
that
goes
out
three
hops
can
cast
a
very
wide
net
accidentally
capturing
many
people
who
are
only
suspicious
by
this
loose
associative
relationship
in
response
predictive
suspicion
based
on
link
analysis
must
demand
a
tighter
connection
between
suspects
courts
must
not
blindly
accept
associational
suspicion
created
by
an
algorithm
stretched
to
link
two
people
instead
the
link
must
be
tightly
controlled
currently
no
rules
govern
these
links
but
in
order
to
prevent
the
use
of
associational
correlations
to
determine
suspicion
some
tighter
limits
must
be
required
conclusion
the
question
that
opened
this
article
was
whether
a
fourth
amendment
stop
can
be
predicated
on
the
aggregation
of
specific
and
individualized
but
otherwise
noncriminal
factors
n
in
a
big
data
world
the
answer
appears
to
be
perhaps
troublingly
yes
if
those
particularized
factors
can
be
connected
to
observed
actions
for
those
who
are
concerned
that
the
reasonable
suspicion
standard
has
already
allowed
for
overly
aggressive
policing
discriminatory
policing
and
unaccountable
policing
this
conclusion
will
only
raise
the
level
of
concern
at
the
same
time
more
accurate
data
may
well
prevent
many
of
the
rough
justice
tactics
that
are
based
on
class
race
or
age
profiling
and
that
have
nothing
to
do
with
the
actual
individual
involved
in
either
case
the
rise
of
big
data
is
only
just
beginning
the
search
for
new
data
sources
and
connections
has
just
commenced
and
as
society
s
technological
capabilities
improve
the
law
must
similarly
evolve
police
officers
on
patrol
in
may
not
be
able
to
immediately
scan
a
crowd
to
reveal
identities
but
that
technology
is
coming
n
as
with
many
technological
innovations
the
law
has
lagged
behind
the
concerns
raised
in
this
article
will
soon
be
addressed
by
courts
forced
to
confront
how
to
evaluate
reasonable
suspicion
in
a
big
data
world
perhaps
this
change
will
involve
new
interpretations
of
the
reasonable
suspicion
standard
or
perhaps
courts
or
legislatures
will
adopt
wholly
new
legal
standards
but
the
law
will
have
to
adapt
because
the
current
small
data
reasonable
suspicion
standard
cannot
survive

with

whom
he
patrolman

knew
from
past
experience
to
be

the
officer
testified
that
he
did
not
overhear
any
of
these
conversations
and
that
he
did
not
see
anything
pass
between
sibron
and
any
of
the
others
late
in

sibron
entered
a

patrolman
martin
saw
sibron
speak
with
three
more
known
addicts
inside
the
restaurant
once
again
nothing
was
overheard
and
nothing
was
seen
to
pass
between
sibron
and
the
addicts
sibron
sat
down
and
ordered
pie
and
coffee
and
as
he
was
eating
patrolman
martin
approached
him
and
told
him
to
come
outside
once
outside
the
officer
said
to
sibron
you
know
what
i

after
according
to
the

sibron
mumbled
something
and
reached
into
his
pocket

thrust
his
hand
into

id
n

id
at
because
sibron
was
decided
on
the
same
day
as

there
is
some
debate
about
whether
the

found
the
search
unconstitutional
because
the
officer
lacked
probable
cause
to
search
or
because
the
police
lacked
reasonable
suspicion
to
stop
and
frisk
the
majority
opinion
echoed
the
reasonable
suspicion
language
in
terry
without
specifically
using
the
term
the
inference
that
persons
who
talk
to
narcotics
addicts
are
engaged
in
the
criminal
traffic
in
narcotics
is
simply
not
the
sort

reasonable

not
meet
the
terry
reasonableness
standard
in
the
first
place
although
association
with
known
criminals
may
i
think
properly
be
a
factor
contributing
to
the
suspiciousness
of
circumstances
it
does
not
entirely
by
itself
create
suspicion

to

j
concurring
n
id
at
the
officer
was
not
acquainted
with

and
had
no
information
concerning
him
he
merely
saw
sibron
talking
to
a
number
of
known
narcotics
addicts
over
a
period
of
eight
hours
it
must
be
emphasized
that
patrolman
martin
was
completely
ignorant
regarding
the
content
of
these
conversations
and
that
he
saw
nothing
pass
between
sibron
and
the
addicts
so
far
as
he
knew
they
might
indeed
have
been
talking
about

contradicting

that
dominate
the

it
also
distorts
perceptions

in
ways
that
have
lasting
policy
consequences
moreover
this
distortion
is
visited
especially
heavily
on
minority

and
constitutes
an
engine

in
its

it

text
introduction
technological
and
scientific
advances
in
recent
decades
have
enabled
an
unprecedented
level
of
surveillance
and
permitted
law
enforcement
to
gather
store
and
retrieve
in
real
time
enormous
amounts
of
data
from
computerized
rap
sheets
and
dna
databases
to
sex
offender
and
other
registries
records
of
a
person
s
contact
with
the
criminal
justice
system
no
longer
rest
in
a
file
folder
or
card
catalog
in
a
local
precinct
instead
they
reside
indefinitely
on
law
enforcement
servers
and
in
many
cases
the
publicly
searchable
internet
n
for
most
of
the
last
century
the
criminal
justice
system
limited
recordmaking
and
increased
the
confidentiality
of
data
about
juveniles
n
that
reticence
and
protectiveness
no
longer
prevails
because
it
has
been
overwhelmed
by
technology
and
a
fervid
commitment
to
data
collection
today
the
criminal
justice
system
collects
and
stores
a
tremendous
amount
of
information
about
juveniles
n
state
and
federal
laws
compel
thousands
of
young
people
to
register
as
sex
offenders
and
provide
personal
information
that
is
posted
online
and
mandate
dna
collection
from
juveniles
as
a
result
of
delinquency
adjudications
and
arrests
children
as
young
as
ten
years
old
are
entered
into
databases
of
known
and
suspected
gang
members
often
in
the
absence
of
an
arrest
or
even
a
suspicion
of
wrongdoing
public
schools
across
the
nation
are
required
to
notify
law
enforcement
when
students
commit
certain
behaviors
at
school
and
law
enforcement
agencies
return
the
favor
providing
schools
with
criminal
or
delinquency
information
n
all
of
this
supplements
the
information
collected
by
police
during
street
encounters
and
bookings
and
the
records
amassed
and
maintained
by
criminal
and
juvenile
courts
the
numbers
of
which
have
also
greatly
expanded
in
recent
years
public
and
private
services
aggregate
much
of
this
information
making
it
available
to
law
enforcement
nationwide
private
employers
public
housing
authorities
colleges
and
the
general
public
often
at
no
cost
n
in
the
late
s
roger
clarke
offered
the
term
dataveillance
as
a
way
to
conceptualize
the
new
forms
of
surveillance
facilitated
by
the
widespread
use
of
computer
based
technology
n
this
article
critically
examines
the
expansion
of
the
modern
culture
of
dataveillance
to
youth
collectively
the
robust
and
expanding
data
collection
and
distribution
practices
described
in
this
paper
produce
what
i
call
criminal
justice
biographies
of
young
people
n
these
one
sided
negative
biographies
written
by
a
coercive
institution
label
youth
in
permanent
and
stigmatizing
ways
this
harms
individual
youth
and
distorts
the
perceptions
of
them
as
a
group
with
lasting
policy
implications
yet
the
literature
on
law
enforcement
surveillance
on
the
one
hand
and
traditional
juvenile
justice
on
the
other
have
yet
to
recognize
much
less
fully
grapple
with
the
databasing
of
delinquency
this
article
reveals
the
incoherence
and
destructiveness
of
databasing
delinquency
and
argues
that
we
must
rethink
this
practice
mindful
of
the
public
safety
benefits
and
inevitability
of
law
enforcement
information
gathering
it
calls
for
reforms
that
limit
the
amount
of
information
gathered
stored
and
shared
about
juveniles
this
would
not
prevent
data
collection
but
would
instead
add
appropriate
restraints
so
that
public
safety
gains
from
databasing
do
not
come
at
the
expense
of
privacy

or

itself
part
i
sets
the
context
instead
of
widely
discussed
constitutional
protections
like
the
fourth
amendment
or
privacy
n
this
article
examines
delinquency
databasing
through
the
lens
of
the
constructed
category
of
childhood
too
little
legal
scholarship
has
critically
examined
the
role
of
the
concept
of
childhood
in
shaping
law
and
social
practices
and
the
role
that
law
and
social
practices
play
in
shaping
the
conceptions
of
childhood
n
this
vacuum
leaves
juvenile
justice
scholarship
less
nuanced
than
it
could
be
drawing
on
the
insights
of
critical
childhood
studies
n
part
i
establishes
the
prevailing
conception
of
childhood
as
a
protected
space
separate
from
adult
society
marshaling
adolescent
brain
science
psychosocial
research
and
recent
supreme
court
jurisprudence
it
shows
that
young
people
s
vulnerability
their
capacity
for
change
and
their
future
as
adult
members
of
society
each
play
an
important
background
role
in
guiding
public
policy
regarding
youth
part
ii
uncovers
the
vast
extent
of
modern
delinquency
databasing
it
explains
how
despite
youths
vulnerability
to
harm
and
capacity
for
change
juveniles
now
find
themselves
indefinitely
cataloged
in
sex
offender
registries
gang
databases
and
dna
databases
it
documents
the
unprecedented
breadth
and
permanence
of
law
enforcement
and
court
recordkeeping
it
shows
how
schools
have
become
mandated
law
enforcement
informants
and
it
maps
the
many
ways
that
this
information
travels
within
and
outside
of
the
criminal
justice
system
while
extensive
data
collection
and
publicly
available
criminal
records
can
be
a
rational
law
enforcement
strategy
that
promotes
public
safety
part
iii
identifies
the
many
harms
that
databasing
delinquency
inflicts
on
juveniles
they
include
devastating
impacts
on
their
immediate
lives
in
the
form
of
punishment
restrictions
on
their
life
choices
stigma
and
perhaps
increases
in
recidivism
compiled
early
in
the
life
of
their
subject
when
identities
and
character
are
still
taking
shape
n
and
skewed
in
content
these
criminal
justice
biographies
also
distort
perceptions
of
juveniles
in
ways
that
facilitate
support
for
punitive
policies
toward
youth
and
discrimination
against
them
this
distortion
and
discrimination
is
visited
especially
heavily
on
minority
youth
and
constitutes
an
engine
of
racial
bias
in
its
own
right
part
iii
further
shows
that
databasing
delinquency
reshapes
the
very
meaning
of
childhood
breaching
its
protected
space
and
contradicting
the
special
understandings
that
guide
the
regulation
of
youth
n
rather
than
honoring
the
particular
developmental
characteristics
of
youth
databasing
delinquency
ignores
them
and
treats
young
people
like
adults
this
contradicts
the
long
dominant
diversionary
approach
to
juvenile
wrongdoing
n
and
gainsays
the
fundamental
message
of
a
quartet
of
recent
supreme
court
cases
that
criminal
law
and
the
police
cannot
proceed
against
young
people
as
though
they
were
not
children
n
cognizant
that
this
is
a
critical
time
in
the
rebuilding
of
juvenile
justice
norms
n
part
iv
proposes
limitations
on
what
information
law
enforcement
should
gather
how
long
that
information
should
be
stored
and
with
whom
the
information
may
be
shared
the
principles
and
values
discussed
in
part
i
young
people
s
vulnerability
their
capacity
for
change
and
their
future
as
adult
members
of
society
inform
the
recommendations
the
proposed
reforms
would
reduce
the
short
and
long
term
harms
caused
by
databasing
delinquency
enabling
the
criminal
justice
system
to
promote
public
safety
and
hold
juveniles
accountable
without
unduly
hindering
their
development
into
productive
adults
i
childhood
we
recognize
and
accommodate
many
values
when
we
choose
how
to
marshal
technology
s
unprecedented
data
collection
abilities
for
law
enforcement
purposes
that
we
have
extended
the
reach
of
law
enforcement
dataveillance
to
juveniles
necessarily
injects
the
developmental
characteristics
of
youth
and
the
purpose
and
meaning
of
childhood
into
the
debate
therefore
a
brief
introduction
to
the
concept
of
childhood
is
necessary
childhood
is
an
essential
and
permanent
component
of
the
social
order
n
it
is
a
natural
fact
children
are
different
from
adults
in
known
and
measurable
ways
n
yet
childhood
marks
something
more
than
empirical
biological
realities
or
chronological
age
n
it
is
also
a
social
construction
a
contingent
category
whose
boundaries
are
not
inevitable
or
fixed
but
are
instead
defined
and
maintained
by
law
n
as
such
childhood
is
the
product
of
our
collective
imagination
reflecting
prevailing
societal
priorities
and
aspirations
n
this
leads
to
varying
definitions
of
the
scope
of
childhood
individuals
cannot
lawfully
drive
a
vehicle
until
sixteen
vote
until
eighteen
or
drink
alcohol
until
twenty
one
n
the
variety
in
cut
offs
is
inevitable
as
different
activities
require
different
levels
of
skill
or
maturity
wherever
the
lines
between
childhood
and
adulthood
rest
the
expressive
function
of
the
law
then
feeds
the
law
s
definition
s
of
childhood
back
to
society
shaping
or
reinforcing
popular
views
of
childhood
n
the
prevailing
conception
of
childhood
today
is
a
protected
space
separated
from
the
broader
adult
society
n
childhood
is
separate
from
adulthood
because
children
are
different
from
adults
and
require
their
own
spaces
rules
and
institutions
n
childhood
is
protected
because
young
people
are
vulnerable
they
make
mistakes
and
have
a
greater
capacity
for
change
than
adults
as
a
result
the
law
applies
special
rules
to
young
people
n
indeed
it
provides
an
entirely
separate
forum
for
adjudicating
juvenile
matters
n
that
delivers
youth
focused
services
and
developmentally
appropriate
levels
of
accountability
as
a
matter
of
first
principles
the
law
aims
to
avoid
imposing
harsh
enduring
consequences
and
stigmas
so
that
juveniles
do
not
carry
the
burden
of
their
youthful
mistakes
into
adulthood
n
the
ultimate
goal
is
to
shepherd
children
into
a
self
sufficient
democratic
productive
and
autonomous
adulthood
n
this
part
explains
how
three
foundational
truths
about
youth
that
they
are
vulnerable
that
they
change
and
that
they
are
future
adults
guide
the
law
s
approach
to
childhood
a
youth
are
vulnerable
young
people
by
definition
are
immature
juveniles
are
in
the
earlier
stages
of
their
emotional
growth
their
intellectual
development
is
incomplete
they
have
had
only
limited
practical
experience
and
their
value
systems
have
not
yet
been
clearly
identified
or
firmly
adopted
n
their
immaturity
profoundly
impacts
how
they
live
their
lives
first
and
foremost
it
makes
them
vulnerable
according
to
leading
juvenile
developmental
psychologist
laurence
steinberg
adolescence
is
often
a
period
of
especially
heightened
vulnerability
n
two
particular
vulnerabilities
of
youth
their
susceptibility
to
poor
decisionmaking
and
their
physical
and
emotional
immaturity
shape
the
legal
regulation
of
juveniles
juveniles
incomplete
cognitive
and
psychosocial
development
undermines
their
ability
to
make
competent
decisions
n
young
people
are
less
able
to
process
information
quickly
and
thoughtfully
and
have
less
general
knowledge
and
experience
to
draw
upon
leading
to
poorly
reasoned
choices
n
in
addition
adolescents
are
less
likely
to
consider
the
long
term
consequences
of
their
actions
and
are
more
reward
sensitive
and
less
risk
averse
than
adults
n
this
poor
impulse
control
is
compounded
by
the
fact
that
they
are
profoundly
attuned
to
and
influenced
by
peers
n
taken
together
these
qualities
often
lead
to
delinquent
behavior
indeed
largely
on
account
of
these
attributes
offending
peaks
during
late
adolescence
n
leading
many
to
consider
delinquency
a
part
of
the
normal
life
course
n
their
physical
and
emotional
immaturity
also
makes
youth
especially
vulnerable
to
harm
young
people
suffer
specific
and
often
greater
harms
as
youth
and
they
are
more
likely
to
suffer
them
because
of
their
youth
n
they
are
for
example
more
susceptible
to
suffering
psychological
harms
than
their
adult
counterparts
under
similar
circumstances
n
they
are
especially
vulnerable
to
victimization
in
adult
institutions
and
are
at
a
greater
risk
than
adult
inmates
of
psychological
harm
and
suicide
n
young
people
are
also
particularly
vulnerable
to
lasting
problems
as
a
result
of
stigma
including
mental
health
problems
substance
abuse
and
re
offending
n
moreover
particular
practices
such
as
a
life
long
criminal
record
or
a
life
without
parole
sentence
impose
greater
harms
on
juveniles
by
virtue
of
the
simple
fact
that
juveniles
will
live
with
the
sanction
longer
n
on
account
of
their
immaturity
and
vulnerability
the
regulation
of
youth
has
long
been
infused
with
the
idea
that
they
deserve
special
protections
n
this
protective
regime
first
came
to
legal
fruition
in
the
late
nineteenth
century
when
progressive
era
reformers
the
so
called
child
savers
passed
compulsory
education
laws
restricted
child
labor
and
created
the
child
welfare
system
and
juvenile
court
n
over
one
hundred
years
later
it
still
prevails
rules
protect
juveniles
from
being
subjected
to
the
same
procedures
and
punishments
imposed
on
adults
in
civil
tort
proceedings
for
example
children
are
judged
by
a
reasonable
person
of
like
age
intelligence
and
experience
under
like
circumstances
standard
that
leads
to
limited
civil
responsibility
for
damages
they
cause
n
to
protect
minors
from
foolishly
squandering
their
wealth
through
improvident
contracts
with
crafty
adults
who
would
take
advantage
of
them
in
the
marketplace
n
a
contracting
minor
may
repudiate
the
contract
at
any
time
before
reaching
majority
or
within
a
reasonable
time
afterwards
n
the
protective
approach
to
childhood
necessarily
includes
the
criminal
law
the
juvenile
court
was
founded
over
a
century
ago
on
the
proposition
that
children
are
different
from
adults
and
should
avoid
the
punitive
and
stigmatizing
consequences
imposed
by
criminal
court
n
it
survives
today
because
society
continues
to
recognize
that
youth
deserve
a
separate
more
protective
forum
that
will
impose
accountability
while
honoring
the
childhood
of
those
before
the
court
many
protections
extend
to
those
juveniles
processed
in
criminal
court
n
for
instance
the
supreme
court
has
held
that
the
death
penalty
cannot
be
constitutionally
imposed
on
juveniles
because
their
vulnerability
and
comparative
lack
of
control
over
their
immediate
surroundings
mean
juveniles
have
a
greater
claim
than
adults
to
be
forgiven
for
failing
to
escape
negative
influences
in
their
whole
environment
n
their
vulnerability
similarly
prevents
law
enforcement
from
ignoring
childhood
during
criminal
investigations
n
this
is
not
to
say
that
youth
are
innocents
while
vulnerable
juveniles
are
autonomous
actors
who
have
the
ability
to
recognize
right
from
wrong
and
they
exercise
that
autonomy
by
choosing
at
times
to
do
bad
things
n
moreover
they
require
and
respond
to
accountability
but
youths
reduced
culpability
and
increased
vulnerability
to
harm
mean
that
the
quantity
of
accountability
appropriate
for
juvenile
behavior
is
necessarily
limited
n
b
youth
change
young
people
are
developing
in
almost
every
arena
physically
biochemically
intellectually
emotionally
and
psychosocially
their
physical
bodies
undergo
a
growth
spurt
between
the
ages
of
ten
and
eighteen
n
and
neuroscientists
describe
adolescence
as
a
period
of
profound
social
cognitive
change
n
it
is
also
a
time
when
identity
is
taking
shape
and
character
forms
n
as
the
supreme
court
observed
the
signature
qualities
of
youth
are
transient
n
the
dynamism
of
youth
matters
greatly
to
the
law
s
response
to
juvenile
offending
as
explained
above
youths
immaturity
contributes
to
delinquent
behavior
yet
most
youth
desist
from
delinquency
as
they
mature
into
adulthood
n
studies
frequently
find
that
only
five
percent
to
ten
percent
of
adolescent
offenders
continue
offending
in
adulthood
n
this
is
because
many
of
the
factors
associated
with
antisocial
risky
or
criminal
behavior
lose
their
intensity
as
individuals
become
more
developmentally
mature
n
in
fact
it
has
proven
nearly
impossible
to
researchers
to
identify
which
few
among
the
many
youthful
offenders
will
persist
into
adulthood
n
courts
and
policymakers
have
regularly
affirmed
the
relevance
of
youths
capacity
for
change
to
the
proper
regulation
of
childhood
it
goes
a
long
way
in
explaining
why
juvenile
court
was
invented
and
why
it
aims
to
privilege
rehabilitation
over
punishment
the
notion
of
change
pervaded
the
words
of
one
of
the
nation
s
earliest
juvenile
court
judges
who
explained
that
the
purpose
of
the
juvenile
court
was
not
so
much
to
punish
as
to
reform
not
to
degrade
but
to
uplift
not
to
crush
but
to
develop
not
to
make
him
a
criminal
but
a
worthy
citizen
n
as
such
delinquency
adjudications
do
not
necessarily
become
part
of
a
young
person
s
permanent
criminal
record
n
instead
stricter
confidentiality
provisions
protect
them
against
disclosure
and
juvenile
court
records
typically
can
be
sealed
or
expunged
when
the
young
person
reaches
a
particular
age
n
youth
s
capacity
for
change
likewise
protects
them
when
they
are
charged
in
criminal
court
in
a
trio
of
recent
sentencing
cases
the
supreme
court
recognized
that
the
character
of
a
juvenile
is
not
as
well
formed
as
that
of
an
adult
and
that
their
personality
traits
are
more
transitory
less
fixed
n
because
juveniles
are
more
capable
of
change
than
are
adults
their
actions
are
less
likely
to
be
evidence
of
irretrievably
depraved
character
than
are
the
actions
of
adults
n
in
short
a
greater
possibility
exists
that
a
minor
s
character
deficiencies
will
be
reformed
n
as
a
result
the
law
seeks
to
protect
them
from
conclusive
judgments
and
permanent
legal
disabilities
according
to
the
supreme
court
from
a
moral
standpoint
it
would
be
misguided
to
equate
the
failings
of
a
minor
with
those
of
an
adult
n
the
constitution
thus
forbids
the
imposition
of
the
death
penalty
and
mandatory
life
without
parole
sentences
for
crimes
committed
by
youth
and
protects
youthful
offenders

a

limited

as
leading
critical
childhood
scholars
allison
james
and
adrian
james
observed
all
children
do
grow
up
and
in
doing
so
leave
their
childhood
behind
them
n
that
young
people
will
leave
childhood
and
become
adults
has
two
important
consequences
for
the
regulation
of
childhood
first
children
must
be
taught
social
norms
including
that
society
imposes
consequences
for
misbehavior
n
second
that
lesson
must
be
delivered
in
a
way
that
preserves
their
chances
for
a
productive
adulthood
n
the
juvenile
court
was
created
to
accomplish
both
those
tasks
n
its
purpose
was
to
divert
juveniles
from
the
criminal
process
and
its
debilitating
punishments
and
stigma
to
a
forum
where
their
cases
would
be
handled
by
trained
specialists
dedicated
to
imposing
accountability
while
promoting
the
youth
s
rehabilitation
n
because
children
are
future
adults
the
criminal
justice
system
as
a
whole
including
law
enforcement
and
criminal
courts
has
a
greater
interest
in
promoting
youth
development
and
rehabilitating
those
who
offend
than
punishing
stigmatizing
and
marginalizing
them
thus
some
jurisdictions
have
recently
sought
to
make
transfer
of
youth
charged
with
crimes
to
adult
court
more
difficult
n
and
attempted
to
minimize
the
consequences
for
youth
processed
in
criminal
court
through
legislatively
created
classifications
like
youthful
offender
status
n
other
statutes
limit
the
amount
of
restitution
juveniles
may
be
ordered
to
pay
to
avoid
saddling
them
with
debts
that
would
cripple
their
transition
to
independent
adulthood
n
these
policies
aim
to
protect
youth
from
full
accountability
to
preserve
their
future
life
chances
these
protective
impulses
reflect
the
view
that
severe
punishments
permanent
disabilities
and
lasting
stigma
for
youthful
mistakes
do
not
serve
the
long
term
interests
of
society
while
reforms
have
not
gone
as
far
as
they
might
n
the
vulnerability
of
youth
their
capacity
for
change
and
their
future
as
adults
have
taken
a
more
central
role
in
policymaking
in
the
twenty
first
century
one
notable
exception
to
this
trend
is
law
enforcement
data
collection
where
special
protections
for
youth
are
falling
away
compiling
criminal
justice
biographies
of
youth
disregards
their
vulnerability
discounts
their
capacity
for
change
and
makes
more
difficult
the
transition
to
adulthood

those
practices
ii
the

concerns
raised
by

people

ii
of
this
article
demonstrates
in
contrast
to
decades
of
practices
that
mostly
shielded
young
people
from
accumulating
law
enforcement
records
the
criminal
justice
system
today
largely
treats
juveniles
like
adults
when
it
comes
to
the
collection
and
retention
of
information
all
told
the

justice
system
collects
a
remarkable
amount
of
information
about
youth
contacts
with
police
suspicions
misbehavior
arrests
charges
convictions
and
sentences
but
it
is
not
just
criminal
information
that
is
being
collected
stored
and
shared
law
enforcement
collects
genetic
samples
from
juveniles
it
catalogs
their
friends
family
associations
and
movements
and
the
law
requires
that
personal
information
of
youth
convicted
or
adjudicated
delinquent
of
sex
offenses
such
as
their
home
address
and
school
be
posted

linked

n
anticipating
that
these

will
become
offenders
law
enforcement
seeks
to
gather
as
much
information
as
it
can
about
them
the
modern
tool
it
uses
to
collect
organize
and
disseminate
intelligence
information
prior
to
a
criminal
case
is
the
gang
database
gang
databases
are
repositories
for
information
about
known
and
suspected
gang
members
the
los
angeles
county
sheriff
s
department
instituted
the
first
modern
gang
database
in
n
similar
gang
databases
are
now
maintained
across
the
nation
at
the
local
state
and
federal
levels
n
gang
databases
can
include
almost
anything
but
typically
record
the
youth
s
name
address
dress
tattoos
locations
behaviors
criminal
histories
vehicles
school
family
and
friends
n
law
enforcement
collects
the
information
entered
into
the
database
primarily
through
routine
stops
on
the
street
and
in
schools
n
gang
membership
is
not
a
crime
and
a
conviction
is
not
necessary
before
an
individual
s
information
can
be
entered
into
a
gang
database
n
indeed
neither
an
arrest
nor
a
criminal
investigation
need
precipitate
the
categorization
of
a
youth
as
gang
involved
n
instead
police
decide
who
gets
included
n
inclusion
can
be
triggered
by
street
encounters
with
police
self
admission
or
a
combination
of
other
indicators
in
some
jurisdictions
qualifying
criteria
are
statutory
while
that
ostensibly
limits
police
discretion
the
qualifying
criteria
can
include
vague
and
perfectly
lawful
things
such
as
being
in
a
photograph
with
a
known
gang
member
corresponding
with
known
gang
members
frequenting
a
gang
area
or
wearing
certain
clothing
n
in
victor
rios
s
study
of
oakland
youth
he
described
how
a
fifteen
year
old
who
was
not
in
a
gang
ended
up
in
a
gang
database
after
he
was
attacked
while
sitting
on
his
front
door
steps
talking
with
friends
n
because
the
attackers
were
gang
members
detectives
assumed
that
the
victim
was
as
well
and
registered
him
as
an
active
gang
member
n
the
broad
criteria
for
inclusion
in
gang
databases
and
the
discretion
afforded
to
law
enforcement
in
deciding
whom
to
include
make
it
difficult
for
young
people
living
in
gang
heavy
communities
to
avoid
qualifying
criteria
law
enforcement
s
desire
to
collect
as
much
intelligence
and
potential
evidence
as
possible
about
those
it
expects
to
be
offenders
encourages
it
to
be
over
inclusive
in
its
classifications
n
the
lack
of
age
limits
for
inclusion
in
gang
databases
means
that
children
as
young
as
ten
are
present
in
gang
databases
n
while
the
particularities
of
gang
databases
vary
most
use
a
software
platform

the
aggregation
and
organization
of

of

highest
penalty
possible
in

related
prosecutions
n
school
officials
use
gang
information
to
direct
security
resources
and
assign
counseling
resources
n
the
structure
and
management
of
gang
databases
make
it
difficult
if
not
impossible
to
know
whether
a
particular
person
has
been
classified
as
a
gang
member
the
information
in
gang
databases
is
not
publicly
available
according
to
the
california
attorney
general
website
release
of
calgang
r
criminal
intelligence
information
is
on
a
right
to
know
a
law
enforcement
officer
and
need
to
know
legitimate
law
enforcement
purpose
basis
only
n
only
a
few
gang
databases
have
provisions
that
require
law
enforcement
to
notify
parents
when
youth
are
classified
as
gang
members
n
moreover
law
enforcement
typically
does
not
offer
a
procedure
for
individuals
to
contest
their
inclusion
or
to
seek
or
confirm
their
purging
from
a
gang
database
this
means
that
youth
classified
as
gang
involved
by
police
can
remain
in
a
gang
database
often
unbeknownst
to
them
for
years
even
where
purging
procedures
are
in
place
they
are
rarely
carried
out
n
there
is
little
incentive
for
law
enforcement
to
purge
records
from
their
intelligence
databases
and
because
of
how
the
guidelines
governing
many
gang
databases
work
purging
is
allowed
only
if
no
new
information
is
entered
regarding
an
individual
for
two
or
five
years
n
police
can
intentionally
avoid
purging
by
checking
in
on
someone
regularly
entering
gang
related
information
gained
during
the
encounter
perhaps
about
friends
or
family
members
of
the
juvenile
though
gang
databases
are
not
publicly
available
and
despite
the
fact
that
many
youth
never
know
they
have
been
classified
by
law
enforcement
as
a
gang
member
the
information
in
gang
databases
leaks
beyond
law
enforcement
as
a
general
matter
criminal
law
scholar
james
jacobs
noted
that
once
information
is
entered
into
an
investigative
or
intelligence
database
it
can
easily
migrate
to
other
public
and
private
databases
and
therefore
can
become
more
difficult
to
purge
or
edit
effectively
n
specific
studies
of
gang
database
information
have
found
this
to
be
true
according
to
one
study
information
collected
in
calgang
has
been
shared
with
employers
landlords
public
housing
and
section
and
school
administrators
n
others
have
found
that
police
share
gang
information
with
schools
n
b
schools
as
informants
schools
have
increasingly
become
a
contact
point
for
youth
and
the
criminal
justice
system
scholars
in
many
fields
including
law
education
political
science
and
sociology
have
traced
the
rise
of
the
culture
of
control
in
the
classroom
and
its
devastating
impacts
on
youth
n
from
metal
detectors
and
fingerprint
identification
required
for
entry
to
video
surveillance
and
police
presence
on
campuses
schools
are
policed
more
than
ever
n
in
addition
schools
have
criminalized
normal
adolescent
behavior
pushing
and
shoving
has
become
battery
swiping
a
classmate
s
headphones
has
become
theft
or
robbery
and
talking
back
to
staff
has
become
disorderly
conduct
or
obstructing
n
as
a
result
young
people
are
intentionally
and
increasingly
diverted
from
the
classroom
to
the
juvenile
and
criminal
justice
systems
n
these
practices
are
particularly
prevalent
in
urban
public
schools
attended
primarily
by
minority
youth
n
a
disparity
that
is
not
explained
by
more
frequent
or
more
serious
misbehavior
by
students
of
color
n
the
upshot
of
these
changes
is
that
schools
are
less
likely
to
handle
disciplinary
matters
internally
n
this
criminalization
of
school
discipline
n
makes
schools
the
first
institution
in
which
most
youth
have
an
opportunity
to
be
marked
as
failures
criminals
or
deviants
n
the
fact
that
schools
increasingly
turn
to
law
enforcement
to
deal
with
misbehavior
reinforces
the
perceived
criminality
of
the
acts
in
the
last
two
decades
legislatures
across
the
country
have
turned
schools
into
mandated
informants
requiring
school
officials
to
report
to
law
enforcement
a
wide
variety
of
behaviors
and
suspected
acts
by
students
at
school
as
a
result
all
sorts
of
behavior
and
suspicions
that
in
the
past
would
have
stayed
on
campus
are
now
shared
with
law
enforcement
n
this
leads
to
more
criminal
justice
contact
for
youth
disruptions
in
their
education
and
negative
outcomes
n
one
main
reason
that
schools
are
now
in
the
collecting
and
reporting
business
is
that
congress
has
incentivized
it
two
major
pieces
of
legislation
do
most
of
the
work
the
improving
america
s
schools
act
of
provided
funds
to
public
schools
that
demonstrated
an
existing
crime
problem
compelling
schools
nationwide
to
develop
data
collection
systems
and
define
crimes
broadly
so
that
they
could
qualify
for
federal
funds
n
many
of
these
funds
were
spent
on
school
police
partnerships
such
as
hiring
security
or
law
enforcement
officers
to
patrol
school
campuses
n
the
mere
presence
of
these
officers
both
facilitates
reporting
and
makes
more
crime
possible
as
refusing
to
follow
the
orders
of
these
school
security
officers
is
a
crime
n
then
in
the
no
child
left
behind
act
required
school
districts
receiving
federal
funds
to
have
a
policy
requiring
that
any
student
who
brings
a
firearm
or
weapon
to
school
be
referred
to
law
enforcement
n
with
federal
money
tied
to
documenting
crime
in
school
and
reporting
it
to
law
enforcement
it
is
no
surprise
that
almost
all
states
require
school
officials
to
report
to
law
enforcement
suspected
violent
crimes
or
incidents
that
involve
deadly
weapons
or
dangerous
instruments
n
other
states
go
much
farther
many
including
california
require
schools
to
report
when
students
use
sell
or
possess
drugs
or
alcohol
n
connecticut
requires
principals
to
notify
law
enforcement
when
the
principal
believes
that
any
acts
of
bullying
constitute
criminal
conduct
n
and
illinois
requires
principals
to
notify
law
enforcement
of
each
incident
of
intimidation
and
each
alleged
incident
of
intimidation
which
is
reported
to
him
or
her
n
kansas
requires
an
immediate
report
to
law
enforcement
by
or
on
behalf
of
any
school
employee
who
knows
or
has
reason
to
believe
that
a
misdemeanor
was
committed
at
school
or
a
school
supervised
activity
n
given
the
funding
incentives
schools
are
likely
to
err
on
the
side
of
reporting
even
when
they
do
not
believe
or
know
that
an
act
constitutes
a
crime
the
failure
of
a
school
employee
to
report
incidents
to
law
enforcement
can
carry
consequences
for
example
it
is
a
class
b
misdemeanor
in
kansas
to
willfully
and
knowingly
fail
to
report
suspected
crimes
to
law
enforcement
n
and
it
is
an
infraction
punishable
by
a
fine
of
up
to
in
california
for
any
employee
of
a
school
district
who
is
attacked
assaulted
or
physically
threatened
by
any
pupil
to
not
promptly
report
the
incident
to
the
appropriate
law
enforcement
authorities
n
schools
are
not
just
sharing
behavioral
information
with
law
enforcement
reports
have
surfaced
of
schools
sharing
records
with
noncriminal
justice
government
agencies
such
as
immigration
enforcement
authorities
n
information
also
flows
from
law
enforcement
to
the
schools
at
least
nineteen
states
now
require
courts
or
law
enforcement
agencies
to
provide
criminal
or
delinquency
information
to
schools
n
c
police
and
court
records
while
gang

relatively
recent

nothing
new

the
quantity

that
can
be
gathered
and
the
ability
to
retrieve
that
information
at
will
at
the
same
time
the

has
expanded
the
kind
and

of
information
it
keeps
about

are
increasingly

n
policing
data
legislatures
and
law
enforcement
have
a
history
of
restricting
law
enforcement
s
ability
to
create
records
of
juveniles
for
decades
most
states
prohibited
police
or
juvenile
authorities
from
taking
fingerprints
or
photographs
of
juvenile
suspects
unless
taking
them
was
necessary
to
an
investigation
or
was
otherwise
approved
by
a
court
n
such
restrictions
were
an
extension
of
the
efforts
to
protect
the
identities
of
juveniles
and
to
make
their
contact
with
the
police
and
the
court
less
like
that
experienced
by
adult
offenders
n
by
restricting
the
practice
they
sought
to
safeguard
the
child
from
unwarranted
indicia
of
misconduct
becoming
a
part
of
police
and
court
records
and
protect
their
privacy
n
identity
records
of
juveniles
once
created
benefitted
from
enhanced
confidentiality
and
other
protections
compared
to
adult
law
enforcement
records
juvenile
records
kept
by
police
were
typically
held
in
decentralized
local
systems
apart
from
adult
criminal
records
n
this
confined
knowledge
about
a
juvenile
s
prior
contact
with
the
police
to
the
juvenile
s
locality
statutory
confidentiality
combined
with
sealing
and
expungement
provisions
further
ensured
against
any
lasting
effect
of
criminal
records
n
these
practices
continued
well
into
the
late
twentieth
century
as
recently
as
only
a
quarter
of
law
enforcement
agencies
fingerprinted
juveniles
n
today
these
protections
have
faded
juvenile
law
enforcement
records
increasingly
resemble
adult
law
enforcement
records
they
are
more
regularly
created
include
more
information
are
stored
with
adult
records
and
are
more
widely
available
nearly
every
state
allows
juveniles
to
be
fingerprinted
at
arrest
n
all
states
allow
juvenile
arrestees
to
be
photographed
and
nearly
all
send
information
about
juvenile
arrestees
to
statewide
repositories
n
the
fbi
authorizes
the
inclusion
of
juvenile
criminal
history
record
information
in
the
fbi
s
national
crime
information
center
ncic
database
on
the
same
basis
as
adult
records
n
the
supreme
court
has
held
that
the
media
cannot
be
stopped
from
disclosing
a
juvenile
arrestee
s
identity
as
long
as
it
acquired
the
information
lawfully
n
the
impact
of
eroded
protections
for
youth
has
been
multiplied
because
technology
has
enabled
law
enforcement
to
record
store
organize
and
retrieve
more
data
than
ever
a
traditional
method
for
police
to
gather
information
on
individuals
is
the
field
interview
fi
card
known
by
different
names
these
are
forms
filled
out
by
police
officers
after
encounters
with
individuals
n
they
record
pedigree
information
such
as
name
address
and
date
of
birth
and
details
about
the
encounter
n
police
often
complete
fi
cards
after
routine
encounters
done
without
probable
cause
a
great
many
of
which
did
not
end
in
an
arrest
n
the
fi
card
practice
has
been
transformed
by
technology
law
enforcement
staff
used
to
record
and
organize
the
information
by
hand
a
laborious
manual
entry
process
the
information
is
now
aggregated
and
stored
in
computers
making
it
easy
to
search
and
retrieve
software
companies
have
developed
computer
and
smartphone
applications
that
allow
officers
to
complete
fi
cards
using
their
smartphones
n
these
applications
eliminate
the
need
to
manually
enter
information
recorded
by
the
officer
on
the
paper
form
into
a
database
because
both
processes
happen
at
once
this
reduces
the
amount
of
time
required
for
data
entry
enabling
law
enforcement
to
record
more
information
after
more
encounters
n
it
also
makes
retrieval
and
analysis
of
the
information
gathered
much
easier
the
archetypal
police
record

of

and
prosecution

is
a
lifetime
record
of
an
individual

at
the
beginning
of
the
twentieth
century
the
rap
sheet
was
created
by
police
for

use
to
enable
police
to
link
records
with
people
n
rap
sheets
are
no
longer
just
for
the
police
congress

states
have
directly
authorized
certain
industries

other
groups
to
obtain
criminal
histories
from
the

in
the

some
seventeen
million
criminal
background
checks
for
employment
and
licensing
purposes
made
possible
by
networked
computers
n
moreover
some
police
departments
go
beyond
what
constitutional
and
statutory
law
requires
aggressively
disseminating
arrestee
information
n
as
a
result
a
system
created
by
police
for
the
police
is
now
more
often
used
to
provide
criminal
biographies
for
non
criminal
justice
purpose
n
law
enforcement
agencies
across
the
nation
also
maintain
a
variety
of
intelligence
databases
that
store
much
more
than
just
records
of
arrests
including
the
gang
databases
already
mentioned
as
well
as
tattoo
databases
birthmark
and
scar

teeth
databases
and
many
others
n
information
in
these
databases
comes
from
all
the
information
collected
by
officers
during
street
encounters
and
reported
in
fi
cards
as
well
as
from
bookings
calls
complaints
by

reports
on

and
moving

n

databases
collect
images
taken
at

and
those

n
the
granddaddy
of
all
law

databases
is
the

for
those

n
convictions

court
records
are
recorded
as
they
are
for
adults
other
than
the
limited
availability
of
youthful
offender
status
and
its
narrow
protections
no
special
provisions
protect
the
records
of
juveniles
convicted
in
criminal
court
n
this
is
significant
because
criminal
court
records
have
long
been
available
for
public
inspection
according
to
jacobs
only
the
united
states
and
canada
permit
anyone
to
look
at
case
files
without
having
to
persuade
a
judge
or
clerk
that
she
has
a
good
reason
to
see
the

n
before
the
computerization
of
court
records
though
they
were
difficult
to
access
n
review
required
physical
travel
to
the
local
courthouse
or
record
repository
and
time
spent
retrieving
and
reviewing
the
records
today
court
records
are
much
more
accessible
meaning
that
police
and
non
law
enforcement
personnel
can
access
an
individual
s
court
history
with
minimal
effort
most
state
court
systems
have
websites
that
allow
anyone
sometimes
for
a
fee
to
search
docket
sheets
and
retrieve
criminal
court
record
information
on
individuals
approximately
twenty
state
court
systems
sell
copies
of
their
criminal
court
docket
sheets
to
commercial
information
vendors
n
the
vast
majority
of
juveniles
charged
with
crimes
have
their
cases
handled
in
a
juvenile
court
instead
of
a
criminal
court
n
consistent
with
the
institution
s
diversionary
aim
to
prevent
children
from
being
treated
as
criminals
n
juvenile
courts
have
offered
more
robust
protections
against
the
creation
of
a
criminal
dossier
at
its
inception
juvenile
court
proceedings
were
held
in
private
before
only
a
judge
and
not
a
jury
by
design
such
proceedings
were
not
criminal
and
resulted
in
something
other
than
a
criminal
conviction
n
most
states
limited
disclosure
of
information
about
juveniles
adjudications
and
required
court
case
files
to
be
automatically
sealed
when
the
juvenile
turned
twenty
one
n
when
judicial
opinions
regarding
delinquency
proceedings
were
issued
they
protected
a
juvenile
s
identity
by
using
the
juvenile
s
initials
instead
of
her
full
name
many
of
these
protective
policies
remain
today
there
still
are
no
juries
n
and
case
opinions
continue
to
mask
the
juvenile
s
identity
delinquency
adjudications
do
not
necessarily
become
part
of
a
young
person
s
permanent
criminal
record
instead
stricter
confidentiality
provisions
protect
against
disclosure
of
juvenile
adjudications
and
juvenile
court
records
typically
can
be
sealed
or
expunged
at
a
particular
age
n
but
as
with
police
records
these
confidentiality
provisions
have
eroded
over
time
juvenile
court
proceedings
today
are
less
likely
to
be
closed
to
the
public
n
juvenile
court
records
are
also
more
broadly
available
as
no
state
completely
protects
juvenile
court
records
from
dissemination
to
certain
entities
outside
the
court
and
law
enforcement
n
only
nine
states
require
a
court
order
before
juvenile
court
records
can
be
released
only
eighteen
states
ensure
that
juvenile
record
information
is
not
available
to
the
public
or
accessible
on
any
online
database
n
in
maine
for
example
anyone
can
obtain
a
person
s
delinquency
adjudications
for
a
thirty
one
dollar
fee
n
juvenile
records
can
be
obtained
in
florida
for
twenty
four
dollars
n
arizona
and
idaho
provide
no
confidentiality
protections
to
juvenile
court
records
n
compounding
the
significance
of
this
confidentiality
erosion
the
supreme
court
has
also
ruled
that
state
laws
cannot
protect
testifying
witnesses
from
impeachment
by
these
juvenile
records
n
while
juvenile
courts
used
to
seal
or
expunge
juvenile
court
records
on
their
own
initiative
today
only
five
states
automatically
expunge
juvenile
records
n
in
all
other
states
the
youth
or
another
party
must
file
a
petition
and
convince
a
court
at
a
hearing
to
seal
or
expunge
a
juvenile
court
record
n
in
many
of
those
states
youth
are
not
advised
of
their
obligation
to
initiate
sealing
or
expungement
and
as
a
result
many
do
not
even
when
juveniles
do
initiate
sealing
or
expungement
procedures
more
than
half
the
states
include
statutory
exceptions
to
sealing
and
expungement
based
on
age
at
time
of
offense
the
nature
of
the
offense
and
the
amount
of
time
that
has
passed
since
the
case
was
closed
n
the
end
result
is
that
police
and
courts
create
more
records
about
youth
than
ever
the
records
last
longer
and
they
are
more
accessible
by
those
outside
of
courts
and
law
enforcement
than
ever
before
d
dna
databases
another
controversial
criminal
justice
practice
that
has
similarly
expanded
to
include
juveniles
is
dna
profiling
in
short
it
works
as
follows
a
biological
sample
containing
a
person
s
entire
genetic
code
is
collected
via
buccal
swab
or
blood
draw
n
and
analyzed
by
a
laboratory
to
create
a
dna
profile
n
dna
profiles
are
then
entered
into
one
or
more
government
databases
n
the
combined
dna
information
system
codis
is
a
software
program
that
facilitates
the
matching
of
the
dna
profiles
of
known
offenders
or
arrestees
to
profiles
generated
from
crime
scene
dna
evidence
n
dna
databasing
is
a
powerful
tool
that
makes
it
possible
to
solve
crimes
quickly
and
confidently
including
very
old
crimes
and
can
even
exonerate
the
wrongfully
convicted
n
collection
of
biological
samples
is
accomplished
primarily
through
contact
with
the
criminal
justice
system
the
federal
government
and
all
fifty
states
compel
dna
collection
from
anyone
convicted
of
a
felony
in
criminal
court
n
in
every
state
except
hawaii
this
includes
any
juvenile
convicted
of
any
felony
in
criminal
court
n
all
but
four
states
also
mandate
collection
from
all
persons
convicted
of
certain
misdemeanors
including
juveniles
n
dna
collection
from
juveniles
is
not
limited
to
those
charged
as
adults
twenty
nine
states
compel
dna
samples
from
juveniles
following
a
finding
of
juvenile
delinquency
n
of
those
twenty
nine
states
twenty
collect
dna
for
all
felony
adjudications
while
nine
collecting
only
for
a
subset
of
felony
adjudications
n
nineteen
states
mandate
dna
collection
from
juveniles
adjudicated
delinquent
for
a
misdemeanor
n
neither
a
conviction
nor
a
delinquency
adjudication
is
a
necessary
predicate
for
dna
collection
in
some
states
a
mere
arrest
can
trigger
compulsory
dna
collection
as
of
the
federal
government
and
twenty
seven
states
require
individuals
arrested
but
not
yet
convicted
or
adjudicated
delinquent
to
provide
dna
samples
n
of
the
twenty
seven
nineteen
permit
collection
from
juveniles
at
arrest
n
law
enforcement
also
acquires
dna
samples
from
juveniles
based
on
consent
most
notable
in
this
regard
is
orange
county
california
s
dna
collection
and
crime
deterrence
program
known
colloquially
as
the
spit
and
acquit
program
n
in
place
since
spit
and
acquit
permits
individuals
who
are
arrested
to
have
their
charges
dismissed
or
reduced
if
they
provide
law
enforcement
with
a
dna
sample
n
this
dna
collection
initiative
has
reportedly
generated
over
dna
profiles
n
the
program
does
not
restrict
collection
from
juveniles
even
in
the
absence
of
such
organized
dna
collection
initiatives
law
enforcement
seeks
dna
samples
from
juveniles
based
on
consent
for
example
police
went
to
albert
einstein
middle
school
in
sacramento
california
to
obtain
dna
cheek
swabs
from
adolescents
as
part
of
a
murder
investigation
n
authorities
in
brighton
colorado
similarly
acquired
consent
based
dna
samples
from
a
twelve
and
eleven
year
old
when
their
parents
were
not
home
as
part
of
an
investigation
into
car
break
ins
n
all
told
law
enforcement
has
already
compiled
dna
profiles
of
hundreds
of
thousands
of
juveniles
n
going
forward
as
many
as
several
hundred
thousand
juveniles
could
be
required
each
year
to
provide
a
genetic
sample
for
purposes
of
dna
profiling

while
most
criminal

for

use
some

a
much
broader
purpose
they
seek
to
publicize
criminal
record
information
about
those
who
have
committed
particularly
heinous
offenses
in
doing
so
they
enable
public
shaming
and
lasting
discrimination
the
leading
example
of
these
data
systems
are
sex

various
federal
and
state
laws
juveniles

not
specify
whether

the
states
decided
themselves
whether
such

were
subject
to

feel

the

research
has
shown

delinquent

criminal
labels
embed
juveniles
into
deviant
social
groups
through
association
and
exclusion

in
some
cases
the
stigmatized
person
is
thought
to
be
so
different
from

as
to
be
not
really
human
n
this
has
certainly
happened
with
juvenile
offenders
most
infamously
in
the
mid
s
when
john
diiulio
described

as
severely
morally
impoverished

super
predators
n
these
attitudes

your
youthful

labels
are

fulfilling
prophecies
when

are
identified
as

are
more
likely
to
act

delinquency
databasing
communicates
to
the
juveniles
subject
to
it
that
the
state
believes
they
already
committed
crimes
that

collection
will
help
solve
and
that
they
will
commit
crimes
in
the

then
internalize
this
label

leads
to
marginalization

additional

recent
research
has
suggested
a
slightly
different
mechanism
for
how
stigmatic
criminal
labels
impact
individuals
and
lead
to
deviance

labeling
theory
posits
that
the
individual
s
desire
to
manage
shame
leads
him
to
follow
strategies
such
as
withdrawal
and
secrecy
which
generate
secondary
deviance
n
sex
offender
registration
and
community
notification
requirements
for
example
cause
sex
offenders
to
isolate
themselves
in
the
community
away
from
support
systems
that
help
prevent
recidivism
n
the
harm
is
magnified
for
juveniles
the
label
of
sex
offender
child
molester
or
sexual
predator
can
cause
profound
damage
to
a
child
s
development
and
self
esteem
n
the
stigma
continues
even
when
a
juvenile
is
no
longer
subject
to
registration
and
law
enforcement
no
longer
publishes
her
information
on
a
website
n
perhaps
it
is
no
surprise
then
that
evidence
indicates
that
sex
offender
registration
actually
raises
the
risk
of
recidivism
amongst
juveniles
n
likewise
including
marginal
youth

gang
databases
so
called
wannabes
n
potentially
drives
them
into
gang
membership
because
they
are
being
treated
as
and
known
as
gang
members
n
rather
than
reducing
the
crime
problem
linked
to
gangs
it
exacerbates
it
the
same
effect
appears
when

the
first
social
institution

most

have
an
opportunity
to
be
marked

one
international
court
has
recognized
the
risk
of
stigmatization
brought
by
collecting

stigmatic
labels

criminal
justice
actors

others
to
stop
seeing

this
is
the
external
stigma

follows
which
is
then
accompanied
by
formal
and
informal
discrimination
n
it
should
not
be

less
mobility
than

making
it
more
difficult
for
them
to
escape
from
a
community
in

has
cast

character
n
indeed
experts
agree
that

to
predict

will
persist
into

n
therefore
because

information
has
much
less
value
than
it
does

in

less
deterrable

is
minimal

andrew
guthrie
ferguson
has
shown
how
police
access
to
the
kind
of
data
gathered
in
these

makes
it
easier
for
law
enforcement
to
believe
that

cause
exists
to
arrest
an

according
to
guthrie
ferguson
if
officers
view

individualized
and
particularized
identifying
characteristics
such
as
prior
convictions

associations
and
gps
coordinates

the
scene
of
the

innocent
actions
might
create

standard

of

stops
after
they
were
erroneously
entered

the

be

this
proclivity

heightens
the
harmful
impact
of

discussed
in
the
next
section
that
the
mistaken

widely
distributed

the

the
false

likely
remains

n
the
inaccuracy
problem
could
be
minimized
if
law

offered
a
procedure
for
youth
to
seek
or
confirm
the
purging
of
their
information
from
a
database
but
it
rarely
does
as
described
above
those
required
to

cannot
exit
the

they
can
provide

available
in

is
difficult

the
burden
to
initiate
and

is
almost
always
placed
on
the

procedures
are
in
place
they
are
rarely
carried
out
n
by
storing
negative
information

including
inaccurate

databasing
delinquency
ignores
the
foundational
principle

instead

a

label

increase

itself
troublesome
as
law
and
philosophy
scholar
anita
allen
has
explained
accountability
for
conduct
is
a
pervasive
feature
of
human
association
n
accountability
includes
being
accountable
to
individuals
often
in
the
form
of
providing
information
about
oneself
and
accountable
for
conduct
typically
in
the
form
of
negative
consequences
for
wrongs
n
criminal
law
and
law
enforcement
are
strong
forms
of
accountability
modern
surveillance
and
the
data
collection
practices
discussed
above
represent
a
technologically
supercharged
form
of
informational
accountability
n
some
amount
of
accountability
is
necessary
to
regulate
childhood
n
as
future
full
members
of
society
children
must
be
taught
social
norms
and
learn
that
society
imposes
consequences
for
misbehavior
n
no
one
maintains
that
children
not
be
held
to
some
amount
of
accountability
under
the
law
the
characteristics
that
define
youth
however
mean
that
the
quantity
of
accountability
appropriate
during
childhood
is
necessarily
limited
n
and
the
harms
imposed
by
databasing
delinquency
which
frustrate
juveniles
ability
to
succeed
in
adulthood
go
too
far
b
databasing
undermines
childhood
childhood
is
fragile
n
shifts
in
public
mood
can
lead
to
profound
changes
in
the
rights
and
responsibilities
of
young
people
one
such
shift
took
place
in
the
late
s
and
s
when
a
spike
in
violent
crime
by
young
people
triggered
a
moral
panic
about
juvenile
offending
n
events
like
the
central
park
jogger
case
where
five
youth
were
convicted
of
a
beating
and
rape
that
left
a
woman
comatose
a
crime
it
turned
out
that
none
of
the
five
committed
n
and
school
shootings
like
the
one
at
columbine
high
school
n
ignited
the
panic
academics
in
the
popular
press
fueled
the
flame
by
promising
a
coming
generation
of
severely
morally
impoverished
juvenile
super
predators
n
in
the
public
eye
juveniles
ceased
to
be
wayward
youth
in
need
of
help
and
became
hardened
criminals
in
need
of
being
locked
up
n
reforms
throughout
the
criminal
justice
system
led
to
more
juveniles
being
increasingly
treated
like
and
punished
alongside
adults
n
sentences
increased
and
laws
changed
permitting
the
prosecution
of
more
juveniles
in
criminal
court
the
supreme
court
refused
to
extend
or
recognize
special
protections
for
youth
n
confidentiality
waned
as
the
authors
of
a
report
on
juvenile
records
wrote
if
an
individual
wishes
to
be
protected
under
the
law
then
that
individual
must
first
act
within
the
law
when
a
juvenile
chooses
a
lifestyle
of
crime
and
violence
that
individual
should
not
expect
to
have
these
activities
shielded
from
disclosure
to
others
n
juvenile
justice
scholar
franklin
zimring
calls
this
the
forfeiture
theory
where
loss
of
the
protected
status
of
youth
becomes
in
effect
one
penal
consequence
of
the
forbidden
act
n
juveniles
who
break
the
law
are
seen
as
having
forfeited
by
their
conduct
the
protections
typically
afforded
to
youth
n
the
forfeiture
happens
despite
their
remaining
chronologically
developmentally
and
legally
children
as
zimring
observed
there
is
certainly
no
logically
necessary
reason
that
protective
features
of
youth
policy
are
only
for
nice
kids
n
databasing
delinquency
is
a
stout
and
expanding
remnant
of
the
forfeiture
era
it
subjects
juveniles
to
record
practices
and
consequences
akin
to
those
for
adults
including
juveniles
who
have
committed
no
crimes
sex
offender
registration
gang
databases
dna
collection
and
laws
turning
schools
into
informants
all
emerged
after
holistically
they
reflect
a
narrower
conception
of
the
protective
space
of
childhood
than
the
prevailing
notion
and
are
at
odds
with
developmental
science
the
continued
existence
of
juvenile
courts
and
recent
supreme
court
jurisprudence
as
a
result
databasing
delinquency
does
more
than
cause
immediate
and
lasting
harm
to
individual
juveniles
it
reshapes
the
very
meaning
of
childhood
breaching
its
protected
space
and
contradicting
the
special
understandings
that
policymakers
insist
must
dominate
the
regulation
of
youth
the
prevailing
concept
of
childhood
and
the
necessity
and
propriety
of
enhanced
protections
is
grounded
in
part
on
a
notion
of
childhood
as
innocence
n
that
childhood
is
marked
by
innocence
is
certainly
contested
and
undoubtedly
false
especially
with
regard
to
adolescents
despite
their
immaturity
juveniles
are
autonomous
actors
who
have
the
ability
to
recognize
right
from
wrong
and
exercise
such
autonomy
by
choosing
on
occasion
to
do
bad
things
n
indeed
delinquency
appears
to
be
a
normal
part
of
adolescence
n
their
offenses
however
do
not
make
them
adults
yet
the
criminal
justice
system
more
so
than
other
arenas
tends
to
treat
young
people
who
do
not
fit
the
innocent
image
as
outside
of
childhood
and
thus
not
cloaked
by
or
deserving
of
its
protections
in
the
last
decade
however
a
shift
back
to
first
principles
has
been
evident
the
superpredator
era
has
been
replaced
by
the
rebuilding
n
from
the
appropriate
amount
of
punishment
to
the
proper
treatment
by
police
courts
and
legislatures
have
displayed
a
renewed
commitment
to
the
primacy
of
special
protections
for
youth
n
in
the
wake
of
a
sharp
and
steady
decline
in
juvenile
offending
since
n
and
perhaps
in
response
to
the
punitive
extremes
of
s
reforms
courts
and
legislatures
have
made
it
clear
that
the
law
must
take
account
of
the
differences
between
youth
and
adults
n
as
a
result
several
juvenile
justice
policies
grounded
in
the
forfeiture
theory
have
been
rejected
in
recent
years
n
yet
it
is
not
just
the
dubious
forfeiture
theory
that
undergirds
delinquency
databasing
minority
youth
need
not
break
the
rules
before
they
lose
the
protections
of
childhood
n
for
them
by
virtue
of
being
black
or
brown
they
are
perceived
as
more
likely
to
be
criminal
more
culpable
for
the

behavior
committed
by
white

and
older
than
their
actual
chronological

it
seems
overrides

the
criminal

apparatus

justifying
their

like
law
enforcement
practices
like
databasing
americans
have
long
associated
blackness
and
criminality
n
the
perceived
link
between
blackness
and
criminality
has
contributed
to
racial
disparities
throughout
criminal
justice
including
skews
in
enforcement
and
punishment
of
black
juveniles
n
one
study
for
example
found
that
african
american
youth
are
disproportionately
arrested
in
twenty
six
of
twenty
nine
offense
categories
overrepresented
in
cases
referred
to
juvenile
court
more
likely
to
be
formally
charged
more
likely
to
be
waived
into
adult
court
and
disproportionately
detained
in
both
juvenile
and
adult
facilities
n
these
enforcement
skews
then
result
in
racial
skews
in
data
collection
as
law
enforcement
is
more
likely
to
collect
and
retain
information
on
minorities
because
it
disproportionately
makes
contact
with
minorities
n
emerging
research
connects
this
racial
perception
and
skew
data
to
the
expanding
surveillance
of
minority
youth
researchers
have
found
that
black
youth
are
seen
as
older
than
their
actual
age
and
more
culpable
for
the
same
behavior
as
white
youth
in
one
study
researchers
tested
police
officers
in
large
urban
areas
mostly
white
males
average
age
thirty
seven
and
mostly
white
female
undergraduate
students
from
large
public
u
s
universities
to
determine
their
levels
of
certain
types
of
bias
n
they
found
that
black
youth
were
more
likely
to
be
mistaken
as
older
than
their
actual
age
by
an
average
of
years
n
the
same
study
found
that
white
undergraduate
female
students
judged
children
up
to
nine
years
old
as
equally
innocent
regardless
of
race
but
considered
black
children
significantly
less
innocent
than
other
children
in
every
age
group
beginning
at
age
ten
n
in
another
study
researchers
had
a
nationally
representative
sample
of
white
americans
participate
in
an
online
study
about
support
for
life
without
parole
sentences
for

n
participants
read
a
sample
about
a
recipient
of
the
sentencing
option
a
fourteen
year
old
male
with
seventeen
prior
juvenile
convictions
on
his
record
who
brutally
raped
an
elderly
woman
researchers
manipulated
just
one
word
across
the
two
study
conditions
in
the
description
of
the
example
recipient
of
the
sentencing
option
the
juvenile
was
described
as
either
black
or
white
the
researchers
found
that
in
the
black
prime
condition
participants
perceived
juveniles
as
more
similar
to
adults
in
blameworthiness
than
they
did
in
the
white
prime
condition
n
this
led
participants
in
the
black
prime

to
express
more
support
for
life
without
parole
sentences
for
juveniles
in
non
homicide
cases
than
did
those
in
the
white
prime
condition
n
in
short
when
test
subjects
knew
the
subject
of
a
potential
criminal
justice
sanction
was
black
they
showed
increased
support
for
punitive
policies
n
this
effect
is
occurring
in
schools
as
well
professor
ann
arnett
ferguson
spent
over
three
years
observing
a
racially
mixed
public
intermediate
school
grades
four
to
six
n
she
concluded
that
african
american
boys
are
not
seen
as
childlike
but
adultified
as
naturally
naughty
and
as
willfully
bad
n
their
misbehavior
was
not
seen
as
typical
childishness
but
was
likely
to
be
interpreted
as
symptomatic
of
ominous
criminal
proclivities
n
in
one
example
a
white
teacher
described
african
american
children
who
borrowed
books
from
a
classroom
without
returning
them
as
looters
as
ferguson
put
it
what
might
be
interpreted
as
the
careless
behavior
of
children
is
displaced
by
images
of
adult
acts
of
thefts
that
conjure
up
violence
and
mayhem
n
as
a
result
of
this
adultification
black
male
youth
became
exempted
from
the
dispensations
granted
the
child
and
the
boy
justifying
increased
surveillance
and
harsher
more
punitive
responses
to
rule
breaking
behavior
n
this
research
shows
that
race
profoundly
affects
the
degree
to
which
juveniles
are
afforded
the
established
protection
associated
with
childhood
status
n
this
happens
even
in
the
absence
of
wrongdoing
indeed
race
appears
to
override
youth
when
it
comes
to
support
for
punitive
juvenile
justice
policies
black
youth
are
viewed
as
older
than
their
actual
age
are
associated
with
criminality
and
are
seen
as
responsible
for
their
actions
at
an
age
when
white
youth
remain
protected
by
the
reduced
culpability
conception
of
childhood
as
a
result
law
enforcement
practices
like
the
databasing
described
here
that
treat
youth
of
color
like
adults
flourish
iv
reforms
there
is
ample
evidence
that
policymakers
are
rethinking
the
punitive
adult
like
policies
adopted
in
a
climate
of
fear
and
hostility
toward
juvenile
offenders
in
the
late
twentieth
century
n
this
momentum
toward
first
principles
led
juvenile
justice
scholar
terry
maroney
to
describe
the
current
era
as
the
rebuilding
of
juvenile
justice
n
in
that
spirit
this
part
offers
three
recommendations
to
curbing
delinquency
databasing
that
would
realign
law
enforcement
data
collection
practices
with
current
developmental
research
and
the
prevailing
conception
of
childhood
as
a
separate
protected
space
first
to
account
for
juveniles
unique
vulnerability
to
harms
laws
should
limit
the
amount
of
information
that
law
enforcement
may
collect
about
juveniles
second
because
most
juveniles
do
not
persist
in
offending
but
instead
mature
into
law
abiding
individuals
laws
should
limit
the
length
of
time
that
gathered
information
can
be
retained
third
in
recognition
of
juveniles
future
lives
as
adults
laws
should
restrict
law
enforcement
s
ability
to
share
the
information
it
gathers
and
stores
this
would
have
no
impact
on
law
enforcement
s
mission
and
would
facilitate
access
to
the
employment
higher
education
and
housing
that
is
so
critical
as
youth
transition
to
adulthood
a
limiting
what
information
is
gathered
the
easiest
way
to
limit
the
harms
caused
by
databasing
delinquency
is
to
not
gather
the
information
in
the
first
place
n
it
would
avoid
the
privacy
intrusion
attendant
to
the
gathering
of
information
and
would
prevent
the
additional
punishments
and
stigma
discussed
above
that
ensue
it
would
also
eliminate
the
long
shadow
of
a
young
person
s
mistakes
helping
to
ensure
that
juveniles
enter
adulthood
with
the
greatest
chance
for
a
productive
life
but
law
enforcement
will
not
be
prohibited
from
gathering
information
in
any
foreseeable
future
a
feasible
focus
becomes
limiting
law
enforcement
s
data
collection
abilities
deciding
how
much
to
limit
it
depends
in
part
on
the
role
of
law
enforcement
with
respect
to
juveniles
if
the
police
play
a
role
similar
to
that
of
a
general
welfare
agency
then
all
data
is
potentially
pertinent
and
the
limitations
proposed
here
will
not
come
to
be
n
but
if
law
enforcement
s
mission
is
limited
to
crime
solving
and
suppression
then
much
of
the
information
about
a
young
person
gathered
in
the
delinquency
databases
loses
its
value
to
law
enforcement
instead
a
narrower
universe
of
data
collection
is
justified
this
is
especially
so
for
data
collection
that
occurs
before
a
young
person
has
become
the
target
of
a
criminal
investigation
it
seems
safe
to
say
that
the
police
are
not
child
welfare
officials
n
and
therefore
every
last
bit
of
information
about
young
people
is
not
of
police
concern
gathering
data
about
the
friends
and
associations
of
juveniles
or
logging
reports
from
schools
of
bullying
especially
in
the
absence
of
a
criminal
investigation
that
would
make
the
information
relevant
is
thus
difficult
to
justify
on
the
other
hand
it
is
difficult
to
cull
the
information
that
has
or
might
have
intelligence
value
to
law
enforcement
from
that
which
does
not
n
indeed
the
belief
that
it
is
better
to
have
information
and
not
need
it
than
to
need
it
and
not
have
it
and
the
lure
of
complete
collection
has
proven
irresistible
to
the
government
n
one
guiding
principle
could
be
that
law
enforcement
may
only
collect
information
relevant
to
an
individual
s
identity
or
to
a
specific
investigation
restrictions
on
law
enforcement
s
ability
to
gather
information
are
not
impossible
the
fourth
and
fifth
amendments
stand
as
foundational
hurdles
to
unrestricted
government
data
collection
n
and
states
still
maintain
protective
rules
for
children
with
regard
to
police
identity
records
take
fingerprints
as
an
example
while
some
states
such
as
alaska
make
no
distinctions
between
juvenile
and

fingerprinting

others
maintain
distinct
rules

fingerprinting

thereof

limited
the
content

the

policy
of
treating

differently
from

opportunity
of
rehabilitation
and
re
integration
the
federal
requirement
that

be
placed
on
the
sex

registry
under

is
in
direct
conflict
with
that
public
policy

out

similar
concerns
the
state
of
washington
abolished
child
sex
offender
registration

n
courts
have
also
found

unconstitutional

frustrates

of

fundamental
elements
of

confidentiality
and
the
avoidance
of

that

the
ship

collection

helps

and
plays
some
role
in
promoting

many
crimes
have
been

would
require
a
sea
change
in
attitude
to
generate
support
for

widespread

on
the
information
gathered
by
law

about

change
while
many
participate
in
some
form
of
delinquency
during

most
desist
as

mature
into

because
many
of
the
factors
associated
with
antisocial
risky
or
criminal
behavior
lose
their
intensity
as

that
youth
change
means
that

in
recognition
of
this
truth
limits
on
the
length
of

enforcement
to
keep
information
during
peak
offending
years
while
also
protecting
young
people
from
the
long
shadow
of
youthful
mistakes
numerous
proposals
have
sought
to
limit
the
length
of
time
that
law
enforcement
can
retain
records
about
juveniles
before
the
dawn
of
computerized
dataveillance
the
aba
issued
a
report
entitled
standards
relating
to

and

systems
n
in
it
the
aba
recommended
that
juvenile
police
and
court
records
be
destroyed
if
a
juvenile
who
is
arrested
or
detained
is
not
referred
to
a
court
n
the
report
emphasized
that
unless
the
juvenile
s
police
record
is
also
destroyed
when
the
court
record
is
destroyed
the
destruction
of
the
court
record
alone
would
become
a
relatively
meaningless
reform
n
in
a
foreshadowing
of
what
has
become
the
report
acknowledged
that
the
increasing
use
of
computers
to
disseminate
arrest
records
magnifies
the
risks
created
by
the
existence
of
arrest
records
n
the
juvenile
crime
wave
of
the
s
and
early
s
and
the
punitive
reforms
that
followed
meant
the
aba
s
proposal
was
not
heeded
similar
reform
proposals
are
now
making
headway
as
policymakers
have
begun
to
reimpose
limitations
on
how
long
juvenile
records
may
be
maintained
in
washington
state
passed
a
law
allowing
for
most
juvenile
records
to
be
automatically
sealed
when
the
youth
turns
eighteen

in
explaining
the
bill
representative
ruth
kagi
said
that
up
until
today
youth
in
washington
had
their
mistakes
follow
them
forever
the
sealing
of
juvenile
records
will
give
youth
the
chance
to
get
an
education
a
job
housing
and
a
productive
life
n
senators
rand
paul
and
cory
booker
proposed
a
similar
bill
at
the
federal
level
in
their
redeem
act
would
automatically
seal
juvenile
criminal
records
for
nonviolent
offenses
n
the
movement
toward
protective
juvenile
record
policies
is
not
limited
to
the
united
states
in
recent
commentary
on
the
european
rules
for
juvenile
offenders
the
council
of
europe
advised
that
sanctions
and
measures
imposed
on
juvenile
offenders
should
not
be
held
against
them
for
the
rest
of
their
lives
records
of
the
offences
of
juveniles
should
not
be
kept
for
longer
than
absolutely
necessary
n
just
how
long
is
necessary
would
undoubtedly
be
subject
to
great
debate
empirics
on
juvenile
offending
help
to
identify
an
appropriate
target
expunging
police
and
court
records
could
be
triggered
when
juveniles
hit
a
particular
age
such
as
eighteen
or
twenty
one
this
would
accord
with
offending
data
which
shows
that
offending
peaks
at
seventeen
and
then
sharply
and
steadily
decreases
n
as
a
result
the
intelligence
value
to
law
enforcement
of
all
that
the
delinquency
databases
contain
drops
off
just
as
sharply
and
steadily
into
the
future
since
it
is
increasingly
unlikely
to
be
actionable
information
there
is
less
justification
for
continuing
to
store
it
the
value
of
the
information
about
friends
and
associations
such
as
that
which
fills
gang
databases
diminishes
even
more
sharply
with
time
as
social
groups
and
activity
change
that
databasing
causes
such
extensive
harms
not
just
from
the
mere
gathering
of
the
information
but
also
from
the
retention
of
erroneous
information
and
the
broad
sharing
of
information
increases
the
need
for
limiting
its
storage
alternatively
records
could
be
expunged
when
a
juvenile
avoids
a
conviction
or
adjudication
for
a
certain
period
of
time
this
would
be
expungement
earned
not
by
simply
growing
old
but
by
behavior
data
about
desistance
would
support
such
an
approach
researchers
have
found
that
individuals
with
a
prior
criminal
justice
contact
who
stay
arrest
free
for
seven
years
or
more
pose
very
little
risk
of
future
crime
n
moreover
that
low
risk
converges
with
the
risk
of
a
same
aged
individual
from
the
general
population
at
around
seven
years
after
contact
and
approaches
though
never
equals
that
of
same
aged
individuals
with
a
clean
criminal
record
n
therefore
for
juveniles
who
avoid
arrests
and
conviction
there
would
be
little
risk
to
public
safety
of
destroying
their
old
records
the
upside
would
be
reduced
stigma
and
fewer
barriers
to
housing
education
and
employment
n
indeed
record
sealing
or
destruction
mechanisms
are
already
in
place
all
states
enable
the
destruction
expunging
or
sealing
of
some
juvenile
records
n
new
york
for
example
requires
fingerprint
records
to
be
destroyed
when
a
person
adjudicated
delinquent
reaches
the
age
of
twenty
one
or
has
been
discharged
from
placement
for
at
least
three
years
and
has
no
intervening
criminal
convictions
or
pending
criminal
actions
n
there
are
even
protections
in
some
states
for
juveniles
charged
in
criminal
court
under
youthful
offender
statutes
accusatory
instruments
can
be
sealed
and
records
that
would
otherwise
be
public
kept
confidential
n
the
software
that
enables
the
delinquency
databases
could
easily
accomplish
automatic
record
deletion
all
that
it
would
seemingly
require
would
be
an
allocation
of
resources
from
the
government
to
develop
programs
that
could
identify
records
due
for
sealing
or
destruction
and
accomplish
the
sealing
or
destruction
c
limiting
what
information
is
shared

described
above

are
able
to
access
the
information
in

according
to
leading
criminal
records
scholar
jacobs
the
united
states
which
invented
a
juvenile
court
committed
to
confidentiality
now
is
exceptional
for
the
amount
of
juvenile
offender
information
that
is
disclosed
to
diverse
government
agencies
and
the
public
n
once
the
information
gets
beyond
law
enforcement
and
into
the
hands
of
employers
school
officials
and
landlords
the
harmful
impacts
are
felt
immediately
moreover
once
the
information
gets
beyond
law
enforcement
it
is
almost
impossible
to
make
it
go
away
or
control
the
havoc
it
wreaks
n
as
a
result
its
impact
is
lasting
this
liberal
policy
regarding
disclosure
is
in
part
linked
to
the
american
commitment
to
open
government
and
the
freedom
of
the
press
and
it
is
also
a
result
of
the
gradual
shift
of
law
enforcement
records
from
a
system
created
by
police
for
police
to
one
used
heavily
by
noncriminal
justice
actors
like
employers
and
schools
distributing
the
information
is
particularly
harmful
because
of
its
devastating
impacts
on
an
individual
s
ability
to
secure
employment
housing
and
school
that
accompany
sharing
criminal
history
n
not
only
does
criminal
history
information
sharing
frustrate
the
ability
of
young
people
and
adults
with
a
youthful
criminal
record
to
earn
a
living
educate
themselves
and
find
a
place
to
live
all
of
these
factors
are
linked
to
desistance
n
instead
of
punishing
youth
far
into
the
future
the
law
should
cabin
the
information
that
is
gathered
and
stored
by
law
enforcement
to
law
enforcement
as
much
as
possible
this
is
especially
true
for
intelligence
information
like
that
gathered
in
gang
databases
and
nonconviction
records
like
those
for
arrests
noncriminal
justice
actors
like
employers
are
likely
to
believe
that
an
arrest
reflects
a
guilty
act
when
upwards
of
fifty
percent
of
arrests
are
not
followed
by
a
conviction
n
moreover
the
presumption
of
innocence
that
bedrock
axiomatic
and
elementary
principle
whose
enforcement
lies
at
the
foundation
of
the
administration
of
our
criminal
law
n
demands
that
the
criminal
justice
system
only
share
police
record
information
when
it
reflects
certainty
that
the
act
was
committed
a
number
of
reforms
limiting
the
sharing
of
law
enforcement
records
have
recently
been
put
in
place
as
discussed
above
jurisdictions
are
limiting
the
extent
to
which
juveniles
are
subject
to
sex
offender
registration
and
federal
guidelines
do
not
require
that
juveniles
be
subject
to
community
notification
procedures
n
there
is
a
nationwide
movement
to
restrict
what
criminal
history
information
employers
can
access
n
colleges
are
beginning
to
add
nuance
to
their
use
of
criminal
history
information
in
admissions
instead
of
using
it
as
a
blunt
sorting
tool
n
public
schools
have
also
been
seeking
ways
to
minimize
law
enforcement
involvement
in
school
matters
n
as
these
efforts
demonstrate
limiting
what
criminal
history
information
gets
shared
beyond
law
enforcement
is
probably
the
most
attainable
reform
proposal
it
is
also
arguably
the
most
important
cabining
the
information
to
law
enforcement
reduces
the
negative
impact
the
criminal
justice
biography
may
have
while
they
are
still
subject
to
privacy
invasions
and
stigma
harms
and
law
enforcement
is
more
likely
to
police
them
and
their
communities
each
no
small
consequence
law
enforcement
does
not
hire
them
for
jobs
accept
them
to
colleges
or
act
as
their
landlord
without
access
to
the
information
employers
colleges
and
landlords
will
not
be
able
to
so
easily
discriminate
against
individuals
based
on
criminal
history
conclusion
because
adolescents
are
vulnerable
because
they
change
and
because
they
are
future
adults
we
must
strive
for
a
constellation
of
practices
that
protect
them
from
harm
and
promote
their
positive
development
the
criminal
justice
system
is
a
critical
part
of
that
constellation
with
renewed
vigor
courts
legislatures
and
policymakers
today
are
correcting
the
missteps
of
the
s
that
favored
treating
juveniles
like
adults
in
the
criminal
justice
system
by
reinstating
the
primacy
of
special
protections
for
youth
databasing
delinquency
a
broad
data
collection
retention
and
distribution
system
that
treats
juveniles
on
par
with
adults
reveals
that
two
pernicious
distortions
continue
to
inform
this
aspect
of
juvenile
justice
policy
first
youth
who
break
the
rules
are
seen
as
having
forfeited
the
protections
of
childhood
second
childhood
status
is
particularly
fragile
for
minority
youth
who
age
out
of
childhood
s
protective
space
sooner
than
white
youth
as
a
result
many
youth
are
saddled
with
a
record
of
mistakes
and
suspicions
that
haunt
them
into
adulthood
the
unwillingness
to
forgive
and
forget
youthful
mistakes
embedded
in
databasing
delinquency
ignores
the
fundamental
nature
of
adolescence
rather
than
pursuing
adult
like
surveillance
practices
in
the
name
of
public
safety
that
inflict
debilitating
short
and
long
term
harms
the
developmental
characteristics
of
youth
and
the
purpose
and
meaning
of
childhood
must
guide
juvenile
justice
policy
to
that
end
we
must
avoid
practices
that
unduly
stigmatize
that
permanently
punish
and
that
promote
or
entrench
criminal
behavior
by
limiting
the
information
that
the
criminal
justice
system
gathers
stores
and
shares
about
juveniles
we
can
avoid
those
harms
without
frustrating
public
safety

community

in

shares
some

community

efforts

the

in

overpoliced
communities
and
exacerbate
intracommunity
inequalities
rather
than
enhance
participation
community
engagement
may
simply
provide
opportunities
for
select
members
of
muslim

to
approve
preexisting

this

illustrates
what

want
from

efforts
at
improving
communication

collaboration
with
communities
typically
on
the
wrong
side
of
the
gun
on
the
surface
it
appears
the
fbi
is
working
to
build
open
lines
of
communication
with
muslim
communities
to
learn
about
community
concerns
and
to
provide
reassurance
that
law

is
committed
to
equal
protection
for
all

the
federal

anchors
its
community
engagement

attempts

the

of

approaches
it
is
essential
to
appreciate
the
larger
context
of
law
enforcement
scrutiny
in
which
they
occur
the
article
provides
three
larger
frameworks
in
which
community
engagement
must
be
understood
first
law
enforcement
community
engagement
efforts
are
properly
understood
within
the
larger
context
of
the
rise
of
radicalization
theories
and
counterradicalization
and
countering
violent
extremism
cve
programs
n
radicalization
theory
posits
that
increased
religiosity
and
politicization
among
muslims
provokes
an
increased
threat
of
terrorism
incorporating
this
framework
government
counterradicalization
and
cve
programs
aim
to
monitor
and
influence
the
political
and
religious
cultures
of
muslim
communities
so
as
to
prevent
radicalization
and
violent
extremism
this
approach
brings
tremendous
government
scrutiny
to
bear
on
the
religious
and
political
beliefs
and
activities
of
american
muslim
communities
n
the
overlay
with
counterradicalization
and
cve
is
also
what
sets
community
outreach
with
muslim
communities
apart
from
outreach
with
other
communities
second
community
engagement
is
in
practice
and
effect
closely
intertwined
with
other
policing
methods
and
functions
n
unlike
other
types
of
national
security
policing
such
as
mapping
voluntary
or
pretextual
interviews
recruitment
and
deployment
of
informants
and
internet
monitoring
community
engagement
draws
its
legitimacy
from
community
policing
s
ideas
of
inclusion
and
democratic
participation
but
law
enforcement
deploys
community
engagement
as
one
among
several
of
its
national
security
policing
tools
creating
tension
between
trust
building
intelligence
collection
and
counter
radicalization
efforts
and
raising
questions
about
the
quality
of
inclusion
and
democratic
participants
these
programs
facilitate
n
third
community
engagement
with
american
muslim
communities
must
be
understood
in
conversation
with
community
policing
in
the
ordinary
criminal
context
and
more
specifically
with
the
earlier
debates
on
community
policing
inflected
by
broken
windows
theory
in
both
contexts
advocates
celebrate
communication
and
collaboration
as
ways
to
foster
inclusion
and
civic
engagement
in
marginalized
communities
on
the
one
hand
and
to
reduce
crime
and
increase
order
on
the
other
so
as
with
community
policing
community
engagement
initiatives
emphasize
the
idea
that
law
enforcement
must
build
trust
and
create
greater
channels
of
communication
with
american
muslims
to
this
end
law
enforcement
representatives
reach
out
to
muslim
communities
attend
community
events
host
career
fairs
and
so
on
in
the
same
way
that
community
policing
in
the
s
and
s
relied
on
partnerships
with
african
american
churches
and
youth
in
poor
neighborhoods
the
federal
government
s
current
community
engagement
programs
focus
on
mosques
community
institutions
and
youth
in
muslim
communities
the
realities
are
more
top
down
than
grassroots
in
both
contexts
aggressive
theories
of
crime
control
broken
windows
theory
in
the
context
of
ordinary
crime
counterradicalization
in
the
context
of
national
security

overlaid
atop
ambiguous
commitments
to
community
partnerships
narrowing
the
space
for
open
communication
and
contestation
by
the
subject
communities
in
preserving
law
and
order
police
occupy
an
important
role
in
the
balance
between
a
democratic
and
a
coercive
state
with
community
policing
painted
as
a
more
democratic
tactic
community
policing
and
community
engagement
trade
on
the
moral
authority
of
community
partnerships
by
invoking
ideas
about
popular
participation
in
government
and
localized
democracy
n
but
critics
have
challenged
the
normative
and
empirical
bases
for
community
policing
and
tactics
influenced
by
broken
windows
theory
calling
for
a
critical
assessment
of
the
costs
of
order
and
how
police
work
with
marginalized
communities
in
these
efforts
the
concern
in
essence
is
that
community
policing
allows
the
police
to
expand
their
power
and
reach
into
already
marginalized
communities
without
giving
subject
communities
the
opportunity
to
meaningfully
influence
or
determine
policing
priorities
or
strategies
a
central
insight
of
this
article
is
as
straightforward
as
it
might
be
surprising
community
engagement
in
the
national
security
context
shares
some
of
the
problems
of
community
policing
in
the
ordinary
criminal
context
as
with
the
criticisms
lodged
against
broken

styled
community
policing
counterradicalization
fueled
policing
serves
to
further
marginalize
an
already
marginalized
community
on
the
grounds
of
its
difference
moreover
as
with

policing
community
engagement
efforts
increase
the
presence
of

overpoliced
communities
and
exacerbate
intracommunity
inequalities

parts

the

frameworks

the
practices

the
links
between
the
burgeoning
enterprise
of
federal
community
engagement
efforts
and
the
larger
context
of
national

tactics
and
the
roots
of
such

ii
draws
on
earlier
literature
debating
community
policing
inflected
by
broken

theory
community
policing
theory
aims
to
reorder
relations
between
the
marginalized
and
the
police
through
community
and
collaboration
but
community
policing
programs
often
fail
to
fulfill
this
goal
when
they
rely
on
preventative
theories
of
crime
control
broken
windows
theory
posits
a
correlation
between
the
aesthetics
of
disorder
and
crime
calling
police
into
the
service
of
countering
disorder
as
a
way
to
keep
more
serious
crime
at
bay
in
the
ordinary
criminal
context
broken
windows
theory
is
used
to
shape
and
justify
forms
of
community
policing
while
counterradicalization
is
the
scaffold
in
the
national
security
context
broken
windows
and
counterradicalization
bring
government
visions
of
crime
control
to
bear
on
police
community
partnerships
and
grant
local
social
and
cultural
norms
an
outsized
role
in
the
origination
of
criminal
activity
these
assumptions
create
a
rationale
for
law
enforcement
to
police
and
surveil
the
minutiae
of
everyday
life
in
marginalized
communities
in
linking
noncriminal
activity
to
the
potential
for
crime
both
theories
reinforce
a
punitive
lens
through
which
police
interact
with
marginalized
communities
in
turn
policing
motivated
by
theories
of
radicalization
serve
to
racialize

significant
ways

moves
to
the
material
implications
of
community
engagement
community
engagement
efforts
constitute
one
of
many
entry
points
for
federal
law
enforcement
into
muslim
communities
today
but
unlike
other
types
of
radicalization
policing
community
engagement
efforts
draw
their
legitimacy
from
ideas
of
inclusion
and
democratic
participation
most
acutely
my
concern
is
that
community
engagement
turns
on
itself
by
providing
police
with
greater
power
and
discretion
over
marginalized
communities
rather
than
enhance
participation
community
engagement
may
simply
provide
opportunities
for
select
members
of
muslim
communities
to
approve
preexisting
law
enforcement
commitments
and
create
an
additional
source
of
pressure
on
muslim
communities
to
perform
their
americanness
without
meaningful
openings
for
muslim
communities
to
communicate
collaborate
and
contest
the
relationship
its
modalities
and
its
outputs
the
coercive
effect
of
these
practices
has
been
underexplored
even
as
their
success
at
increasing
democracy
and
inclusion
is
taken
for
granted
while
it
is
beyond
the
scope
of
this
article
to
engage
the
premise
that
cultivating
pro
law
enforcement
attitudes
is
necessary
for
democracy
the
article
does
raise
questions
about
how
the
government
should
cultivate
these
attitudes
and
how
cultivating
such
attitudes
may
clash
with
the
duty
of
people
to
hold
their
governments
accountable
by
putting
the
mirror
of
the
community
policing
literature
to
community
engagement
more
specifically
by
placing
the
literature
from
the
s
and
s
on
community
policing
with
african
american
communities
alongside
community
engagement
with
muslim
communities
the
article
engages
the
way
that
police
practices
are
discursive
experimental
and
derivative
my
aim
is
to
contribute
to
the
larger
discourse
on
the
relationship
between
policing
racialization
and
inequality
in
the
united
states
and
to
understand
the
continuities
and
distinctions
between
contexts
on
the
one
hand
positioning
these
practices
side
by
side
is
descriptive
in
that
it
reflects
the
federal
government
s
situating
of
community
engagement
efforts
within
a
history
of
community
policing
efforts
with
marginalized
communities
on
the
other
hand
the
cross
pollination
is
normative
in
that
it
reflects
my
effort
to
deconstruct
the
sharp
distinctions
often
drawn
between
the
ordinary
criminal
and
national
security
contexts
national
security
scholars
can
learn
from
longstanding
conversations
in
criminal
law
especially
regarding
criminal
justice
techniques
retooled
for
the
national
security
context
my
hope
is
that
this
article
will
contribute
to
our
thinking
about
the
role
of
police
in
comparative
racialization
that
in
thinking
about
community
policing
and
community
engagement
in
the
same
breath
we
will
see
new
possibilities
and
problems
in
the
way
that
police
relate
to
communities
of
color
and
thereby
construct
and
constitute
the
experience
of
race
in
the
united
states
including
for
american
muslims
n
i
do
not
mean
to
draw
overly
neat
parallels
or
to
manufacture
ghost
genealogies
between
the
two
sets
of
theoretical
frameworks
or
practices
nor
does
this
article
comprehensively
survey
historical
or
contemporary
practices
of
community
policing
or
community
engagement
my
concrete
focus
is
the
contemporary
national
security
context
in
the
united
states
and
i
am
working
with
the
limited
material
much
of
it
produced
through
government
accounts
available
on
these
initiatives
this
article
provides
a
sketch
of
the
problems
inherent
in
approaching
community
engagement
through
a
counterradicalization
and
cve
lens
particularized
case
studies
are
left
for

the
idea
of

may
capture
our
imaginations
now
as
community
policing
did
in
the
s
and

then
as
now

it
should
not
capture

policing
a
the
schematic
of
policing
radicalization
the
accounts
of
post

emphasize
the
federal
government
s
new
commitments
to
a
preventative
framework
for
fighting
terrorism
and
to
comprehensive
intelligence
gathering
n
although
this
narrative
obscures
the
existence
of
preventive
approaches
and
intelligence
gathering
before
it
embodies
important
kernels
of
truth
the
overt
merger
of
prevention
intelligence
gathering
national
security
and
criminal
power
has
changed
the
nature
of
contemporary
policing
in
the
united
states
less
commented
on
is
the
shift
from
emergency
policing
measures
n
to
the
routinization
of
national
security
policing
unquestionably
important
continuity
exists
between
the
emergency
response
and
the
routinized
police
practices
not
simply
because
many
of
the
practices
are
similar
but
because
they
borrow
their
legitimacy
from
the
same
discursive
universe
in
which
the
attack
is
a
fundamental
moment
of
authority
n
theories
of
radicalization
counterradicalization
and
cve
have
been
important
engines
in
the
movement
of
national
security
policing
from
the
realm
of
emergency
to
the
realm
of
routine
n
radicalization
theory
which
also
grounds
ideas
about
violent
extremism
was
exported
from
the
british
government
to
the
u
s
government
through
doj
and
the
new
york
police
department
nypd
the
theory
posits
a
correlation
between
religiosity
and
politicization
in
muslims
and
the
potential
for
terrorism
when
the
government
embraces
radicalization
theories
it
provides
a
new
imperative
to
surveil
and
shape
religious
and
political
activities
of
muslim
individuals
and
within
muslim
communities
that
same
embrace
has
also
spawned
a
growing
number
of
counterradicalization
and
cve
initiatives
of
which
law
enforcement
and
community
engagement
efforts
are
an
increasingly
important
part
n
law
enforcement
s
embrace
of
radicalization
and
counterradicalization
has
become
a
central
tenet
in
our
domestic
approach
to
national
security
a
fbi
report
and
nypd
report
constitute
the
building
blocks
of
this
evolution
n
since
the
publication
of
these
reports
both
entirely
focused
on
muslims
n
u
s
federal
and
local
government
literature
has
taken
for
granted
that
a
problem
of
muslim
radicalization
exists
in
plagues
even
the
united
states
the
fbi
s
intelligence
assessment
the
radicalization
process
from
conversion
to
jihad
asserts
the
existence
of
an
identifiable
and
predictable
process
by
which
a
muslim
becomes
a
terrorist
n
the
fbi
identifies
the
four
stages
of
radicalization
as
preradicalization
identification
indoctrination
and
action
n
the
assessment
is
vague
about
the
data
on
which
it
relies
with
almost
no
citations
sourcing
or
clear
methodology
the
nypd
s
report
radicalization
in
the
west
the
homegrown
threat
posits
a
similar
four
stage
process
pre
radicalization
self
identification
indoctrination
and
jihadization
n
each
stage
has
specific
signatures
associated
with
it
n
the
first
three
stages
of
radicalization
focus
on
where
muslims
live
and
congregate
manifestations
of
their
religious
and
political
beliefs
and
political
social
or
religious
activities
n
the
process
culminates
in
the
final
stage
jihadization
when

a
criminal
act

despite
deep
contestation
of
this
theory

to
national

these
ideas

the
following
first
radicalization
is
a
somewhat
predictable
process
with
visible
markers
and
geographies
by
which
muslims
become
willing
and
able
to
commit
violence
against
the
united
states
or
american
interests
in
the
name
of
islam
or
the
global
muslim
community
n
second
the
government

part
of
its
investment
in
national
security
must
monitor
and
counter
radicalization
third
radicalization
emerges
from
religious
and
political
currents
within
muslim
communities
n
radicalization
and
counterradicalization
have
become
the
language
of
prevention
in
national
security
criminal
law
with
the
federal
government
at
the
helm
this
commitment
is
echoed
far
and
wide
from
state
and
local
police
to
dhs
doj
fbi
and
u
s
attorneys
offices
n
as
a
result
federal
law
enforcement
with
the
aid
of
state
and
local
police
spend
considerable
resources
monitoring
and
shaping
political
and
religious
cultures
in
muslim
communities
the
federal
government
has
undertaken
numerous
initiatives
to
counter
radicalization
and
violent
extremism
almost
entirely
focused
on
muslims
despite
assurances
to
the
contrary
n
the
house
and
senate
homeland
security
committees
for
example
have
held
hearings
and
issued
reports
emphasizing
the
need
for
government
agencies
to
monitor
and
respond
to
radicalization
n
the
white

issued
two
national

papers

n
dhs

have
also
prioritized
counterradicalization
and

n
most
recently
the
attorney
general
has
announced
a
pilot
program
to
respond
to
the
lure
of
isis
for
american
muslims
the
white
house
held
a
three
day
cve
summit
and
the
dhs
secretary
has
been
touring
mosques
around
the
country
n
community
engagement
represents
but
one
of
a
range
of
policing
techniques
deployed
in
counterradicalization
efforts
the
specific
techniques
essential
to
policing
radicalization
include
mapping
voluntary
or
pretextual
interviews
recruitment
and
deployment
of
informants
internet
monitoring
and
community
engagement
n
these
tactics
are
aimed
at
gathering
intelligence
on
as
well
as
shaping
the
religious
and
political
currents
in
muslim
communities
the
geographies
where
muslims
gather
and
collective
identities
emerge
n
the
tactics
also
attempt
to
identify
individuals
of
concern
by
relying
on
participation
from
muslim
community
members
and
forms
of
coercion
that
vary
from
mild
to
severe
including
incentivized
cooperation
the
tactics
of
policing
radicalization
exist
in
symbiosis
all
feeding
into
each
other
n
given
the
dynamic
relationship
between
these
techniques
a
brief
summation
is
necessary
in
order
to
appreciate
national
security
community
engagement
in
context
mapping
refers
literally
to
the
practice
of
generating
maps
that
detail
where
muslims
gather
whether
in
schools
mosques
or
hookah
bars
n
the
fbi
s
domestic
intelligence
and
operations
guide
diog
empowers
fbi
field
offices
to
collect
map
and
analyze
racial
and
ethnic
demographic
information
including
the
location
of
businesses
and
other
facilities
servicing
those
demographic
groups
n
drawing
on
commercially
available
information
and
government
databases
fbi
offices
have
mapped
the
demographics
of
concentrated
muslim
communities
n
the
fbi
puts
such
maps
to
use
in
its
community
engagement
efforts
n
voluntary
or
pretext
interviews
known
as
knock
and
talks
in
the
ordinary
criminal
context
are
a
more
visible
method
of
policing
radicalization
n
agents
may
approach
individuals
at
mosques
home
work
or
community
institutions
they
may
identify
the
agency
for
which
they
work
or
may
simply
cite
a
generic
relationship
with
the
u
s
government
in
theory
voluntary
the
mode
of
approach
and
questioning
often
involves
substantial
coercive
force
n
individuals
targeted
are
often
led
to
believe
they
are
compulsory
n
law
enforcement
officials
regularly
ask
about
religious
and
political
opinions
and
activities
the
purpose
of
a
recent
trip
to
pakistan
or
saudi
arabia
for
example
or
opinions
on
the
arab
spring
or
drone
strikes
in
pakistan
n
these
interviews
appear
to
be
triggered
by
national
origin
and
ethnicity
as
well
as
travel
and
speech
activity
including
consumption
of
speech
for
example
watching
lectures
online
or
visiting
particular
websites
n
interviews
are
regularly
geared
toward
collecting
information
on
religious
and
political
opinions
whether
individual
or
collective
n
or
cultivating
informants
both
formal
and
informal
n
informants
are
key
to
national
security
policing
just
as
they
are
in
the
ordinary
criminal
context
problems
of
police
coercion
secrecy
and
lack
of
accountability
persist
in
both
contexts
n
the
nypd
for
example
recruits
informants
for
counterterrorism
projects
by
scanning
the
general
citywide
arrest
rolls
for
individuals
hailing
from
muslim
countries
regardless
of
the
crime
for
which
they
were
arrested
n
informants
are
widespread
in
muslim
communities
stationed
within
mosques
muslim
student
groups
social
networks
and
so
on
n
the
approach
is
less
likely
to
be
geared
toward
collecting
information
on
a
specific
individual
or
criminal
plot
and
more
likely
tilted
toward
gathering
as
much
information
on
as
many
people
in
the
muslim
community
as
possible
n
law
enforcement
uses
informants
to
gather
and
test
opinions
in
a
practice
reminiscent
of
past
police
infiltration
of
radical
political
groups
such
as
the
communist
party
and
various
black
liberation
organizations
n
informants
may
serve
as
passive
listeners
n
gathering
information
about
individuals
religious
and
political
views
or
vulnerabilities
such
as
immigration
status
lgbt
queer
identities
or
marital
indiscretions
that
can
be
used
to
pressure
individuals
into
becoming
informants
n
informants
also
test
impressionability
n
attempting
to
provoke
reactions
by
making
radical
or
extreme
statements
and
then
monitoring
people
s
responses
and
their
susceptibility
to
radical
or
extreme
points
of
view
n
perhaps
even
more
troubling
according
to
a
recent
report
by
human
rights
watch
and
columbia
law
school
s
human
rights
institute
all
but
four
of
the
last
decade
s
high
profile
terrorism
prosecutions
resulted
from
fbi
sting
operations
in
which
the
fbi
informant
was
directly
involved
in
proposing
crafting
facilitating
and
inducing
a
terrorist
plot
n
law
enforcement
also
monitors
what
muslims
consume
and
post
on
the
internet
about
their
opinions
and
activities
via
email
listservs
blogs
websites
chatrooms
and
social
media
n
these
efforts
seem
to
focus
on
those
who
download
content
by
particular
muslim
scholars
such
as
anwar
al
aulaqi
post
on
muslim
identified
news
websites
or
participate
in
muslim
identified
chat
discussion
forums
focused
on
religious
discourse
and
u
s
foreign
policy
or
watch
jihadi
videos
n
internet
monitoring
triggers
voluntary
interviews
as
well
as
informants
and
undercover
law
enforcement
urging
young
men
down
the
perceived
path
toward
radicalization
n
post
changes
to
the
fbi
s
investigative
guidelines
allow
for
broad
minimally
regulated
use
of
these
tactics
no
suspicion
of
criminal
wrongdoing
is
required
before
an
ordinary
agent
can
deploy
these
investigative
powers
n
the
fbi
can
use
unlimited
physical
surveillance
conduct
pretextual
interviews
and
deploy
confidential
informants
absent
any
suspicion
of
wrongdoing
or
particular
factual
predication
n
moreover
these
tools
can
be
mobilized
based
mostly
on
first
amendment
activity
for
example
on
attendance
at
a
particular
mosque
or
harsh
criticism
of
american
foreign
policy
n
nor
are
these
techniques
meaningfully
regulated
by
the
constitution
the
techniques
do
not
require
a
warrant
moreover
the
fourth
amendment
s
protections
against
unreasonable
search
and
seizures
can
be
waived
if
law
enforcement
obtains
consent

without

initiatives
are
premised
on
the
idea
that
muslim

can
serve
as
key
partners
in

work
n
community
engagement
depends
on
some
form
of
buy
in
from
and
contacts
in
muslim
communities
n
cultivating
these
contacts
is
an
important
aspect
of
these

obviates
any
concern

overpoliced
as

must
know
that

interactions
with
the
police
are
recorded

shared
the
fbi
thinks
otherwise
the
recently
released
fbi
policy
directive
on
community
engagement
asserts
that
members
of
the
public
contacted
through
a
community
outreach
activity
generally
do
not
have
an
expectation
that
information
about
them
will
be
maintained
in
an
fbi
file
or
database
n
how
can
communities
later
complain
that
they
are
under
watch
even
as
they
exchange
pleasantries
at
a
mosque
outreach
event
with
the
local
fbi
agent
this
is
to
miss
however
a
larger
set
of
normative
concerns
about
the
dialectic
between
the
exercise
of
police
power
and
the
ways
it
restricts
the
options
available
to
communities
of
color

concerns

approach

proved
sufficiently
flexible

be
put
to
use
in

adopted

policing
like
tactics
nationwide
with
muslim
communities
in
response
to
national
security
concerns
deploying
the
vocabulary
and
aspirations
of
community
policing
n
while
community
engagement
is
regularly
invoked
in
the
same
breath
or
included
in
the
same
conceptual
universe
as
community
policing
unnamed
is
the
dynamic
between
counterradicalization
cve
and
broken
windows
theory
at
first
blush
there
is
an
obvious
parallelism
counterradicalization
defines
the
contours
of
community
engagement
as
broken
windows
often
shaped
practices
of
community
policing
both
counterradicalization
and
broken
windows
theories
are
preventative
theories
of
crime
control
laid
atop
efforts
at
bettering
relationships
between
marginalized
communities
and
law
enforcement
n
both
theories
also
motivate
traditional
policing
tactics
and
approaches
beyond
those
that
claim
as
their
central
normative
force
partnerships
with
the
community
yet
there
are
important
theoretical
and
material
distinctions
between
broken
windows
and
counterradicalization
and
between
community
policing
and
community
engagement
in
focusing
on
the
critiques
of
community
policing
inflected
by
broken
windows
theory
i
do
not
mean
to
suggest
that
all
community
policing
is
defined
by
broken
windows
theory
or
that
order
maintenance
which
is
more
directly
linked
to
broken
windows
in
theory
as
well
as
practice
follows
from
community
policing
n
community
policing
and
broken
windows
theory
can
certainly
be
decoupled
n
community
policing
s
center
of
gravity
is
in
communication
and
collaboration
with
local
communities
while
broken
windows
theory
centers
police
discretion
to
pursue
disorder
and
minor
crimes
n
in
practice
and
in
particular
in
the
s
and
s
the
divide
has
proven
more
illusory
n
when
community
policing
and
broken
windows
theory
have
been
linked
in
practice
and
in
study
the
combination
provides
an
important
lens
through
which
to
see
the
problems
that
emerge
when
a
theory
of
crime
control
that
attaches
predictive
authority
to
social
markers
of
difference
shapes
police
communication
with
marginalized
communities
the
literature
examining
community
policing
shaped
by
broken
windows
theory
provides
insights
on
similar
problems
that
emerge
when
community
engagement
is
shaped
by
counterradicalization
this
part
first
provides
background
on
the
emergence
of
broken
windows
theory
and
community
policing
in
the
ordinary
criminal
context
with
its
focus
on
african
american
communities
then
it
explains
how
counterradicalization
has
come
to
racialize
american
muslims
providing
context
necessary
to
understand
the
coercive
qualities
of
community
engagement
a
community
policing
broken
windows
ordinary
crime
n
the
basic
intuition
behind
community
policing
is
that
increased
communication
and
collaboration
between
police
and
communities
will
benefit
both
parties
and
cultivate
a
stronger
ethos
of
civic
engagement
in
marginalized
communities
those
with
less
social
power
and
socioeconomic
standing
n
the
precise
causal
mechanics
of
this
process
however
are
far
from
clear
n
while
the
literature
takes
as
a
starting
point
the
poor
relationships
between
law
enforcement
and
marginalized
communities
it
generally
fails
to
meaningfully
engage
the
question
of
how
community
policing
practices
should
account
for
the
power
differential
between
police
and
those
communities
instead
assuming
that
the
communication
will
itself
have
a
democracy
enhancing
function
n
proponents
advocate
for
more
interaction
and
flexibility
but
provide
little
guidance
on
how
to
ensure
that
communication
and
police
action
is
not
predetermined
by
the
more
powerful
police
prerogative
n
beyond
its
basic
orientation
toward
communication
the
theory
and
practices
of
community
policing
are
muddled
n
reading
the
literature
one
encounters
an
avalanche
of

on
n
these
concepts
represent
an
evolving
spectrum
of
approaches
to
policing
n
often
these
concepts
fill
in
the
vagaries
of
or
complement
one
on
another
but
they
also
clash
and
confuse
where
one
set
of
practices
ends
and
the
other
begins
is
often
unclear
and
subject
to
debate
n
broken
windows
theory
defines
much
community
policing
in
the
context
of
ordinary
crime
one
could
even
argue
that
it
is
a
central
spoke
in
contemporary
preventive
policing
concepts
for
purposes
of
this
article
a
basic
account
of
the
theory
s
adaptation
to
policing
should
suffice
in
in
a
famous
psychology
experiment
two
cars
were
left
in
two
very
different
neighborhoods
without
license
plates
and
with
hoods
open
one
in
wealthy
palo
alto
and
one
in
a
poor
neighborhood
in
the
bronx
n
the
bronx
car
was
quickly
stripped
of
its
valuables
the
palo
alto
car
went
untouched
until
the
study
s
progenitor
publicly
smashed
in
the
windows
precipitating
others
to
codemolish
and
rob
the
car
n
in
social
scientists
george
l
kelling
and
james
q
wilson
announced
their
broken
windows
theory
in
the
atlantic
parlaying
the
psychology
experiment
into
a
theory
of
crime
control
they
argued
that
outward
signs
of
disorder
invite
law
breaking
criminality
by
signaling
to
would
be
criminals
that
the
geography
s
inhabitants
lack
effective
practices
of
social
cohesion
and
control
n
if
the
police
can
fix
the
visible
signs
of
disorder
broken
windows
the
argument
goes
they
can
reduce
serious
criminal
activity
the
translation
from
psychology
experiment
to
preventive
policing
theory
n
was
not
the
only
translation
at
work
however
kelling
and
wilson
also
forwarded
broken
windows
as
a
theory
to
motivate
collaboration
between

community
policing
was
framed
as
a
powerful
tool
for
the
government
to
address
the
legitimacy
deficit
in
african
american
communities
wherein
relationships
with
police
were
defined
by
histories
of
distrust
and
police
violence
n
but
community
policing
also
had
its
critics
n
many
of
whom
pointed
to
how
broken
windows
theory
even
in
a
community
policing
guise
had
shifted
the
focus
of
policing
from
criminal
conduct
to
disorder
broken
windows
theory
assumed
dichotomies
between
order
and
disorder
insider
and
outsider
and
the
law
abiding
and
lawless
n
assumed
these
categories
were
stable
and
observable
and
then
privileged
order
insiders
and
the
law
abiding
over
their
counterparts
n
the
meanings
of
disorder
outsiders
and
lawlessness
were
left
to
police
discretion
assuming
the
police
would
not
inevitably
draw
from
preexisting
terrains
of
difference
and
particularly
the
anti
black
racial
text
linking
blackness
and
criminality
in
making
these
distinctions
n
indeed
more
recent
work
has
contested
broken
windows
theory
s
assumption
that
the
perception
of
disorder
is
governed
by
actual
observed
levels
of
disorder
n
instead
racial
and
immigrant
concentration
proved
more
powerful
predictors
of
perceived
disorder
than
did
carefully
observed
disorder
n
broken
windows
theory
in
its
construction
of
the
disorderly
the
lawless
and
the
outsider
as
legitimate
subjects
of
policing
rendered
already
vulnerable
individuals
as
even
more
vulnerable
to

like

radicalization
theory
has
been
highly
contested
and
yet
broadly
influential
in
shaping
contemporary
policing
while
u
s
government
accounts
take
for
granted
a
problem
with
radicalization
that
warrants
government
intervention
the
literatures
of
governments
academics

stakeholders
around

world
express
profound
disagreement
over
the
meaning
of
radicalization
and
the
nature
and
extent
of
threat
embodied
by
muslims
n
radicalization
discourse
purports
to
predict
future

from
studies
of
prior
terrorist
acts
to
identify
trends
and
details
that
will
aid
in
identifying

and
expands
the
legitimate
scope
of
government
concern
from
terrorism
a
question
of
political
violence
of
crime
even
of
war
crime
to
radicalization
a
question
of
religious
and
political
cultures
and
beliefs
before
moving
further
into
the
problems
inherent
in
overlaying
radicalization
theory
onto
community
engagement
it
is
worth
exploring
the
similarities
and
differences
between
the
work
of
radicalization
theory
and
broken
windows
theory
the
primary
similarities
are
threefold
first
both
radicalization
and
broken
windows
are
preventative
theories
of
crime
control
calling
for
prophylactic
state
action
against
noncriminal
behavior
second
while
both
theories
appear
concerned
with
disorder
or
radicalization
in
the
abstract
their
practical
effect
is
to
bring
considerable
scrutiny
to
communities
already
marginalized
by
virtue
of
race
and
religion
as
a
practical
matter
broken
windows
theory
foregrounds
race
and
inequality
as
instigators
or
signs
of
disorder
n
counterradicalization
and
cve
in
practice
and
in
theory
are
almost
exclusively
focused
on
muslims
n
moreover
when
manifest
in
community
policing
and
community
engagement
approaches
the
theories
work
to
cultivate
partnerships
with
community
members
in
order
to
increase
the
legitimacy
and
reach
of
law
enforcement
into
the
subject
communities
third
in
addition
to
shaping
community
policing
engagement
approaches
both
theories
have
had
great
influence
on
the
broader
field
of
policing
tactics
in
the
relevant
communities
and
beyond
there
are
at
least
two
important
differences
in
terms
of
contested
causal
claims
broken
windows
theory
focuses
on
physical
signs
of
disorder
as
signals
of
deteriorating
social
order
whereas
radicalization
emphasizes
ideological
currents
of
disorder
as
motivators
for
acts
of
terrorism
radicalization
s
concern
is
predicated
on
a
false
belief
in
the
teleological
character
of
islam
that
if
muslims
communities
witness
conservative
religious
practice
and
critical
politics
they
will
view
such
currents
as
acceptable
and
gravitate
toward
radicalism
thereby
producing
more
terrorists
second
the
theories
arguably
have
propelled
different
types
of
police
action
whereas
broken
windows
theory
leads
to
aggressive
enforcement
against
misdemeanor
and
minor
crimes
counterradicalization
produces
increased
surveillance
n
this
distinction
has
its
limits
since
broken
windows
policing
serves
an
intelligence
gathering
function
and
counter
radicalization
shapes
prosecutorial
priorities
but
while
both
theories
expand
the
role
of
the
state
and
the
blueprint
of
policing
their
mechanics
are
distinct
to
be
clear
i
m
less
concerned
with
anaologies
between
the
causal
mechanics
of
the
theories
and
more
concerned
with
how
the
theories
construct
the
categories
of
the
disorderly
and
the
radical
and
the
implications
those
constructions
have
for
policing
and
the
subject
communities
blurring
dissent
and
difference
with
violence
even
aside
from
the
disproportionate
focus
on
politically
motivated
violence
by
muslims
in
terrorism
studies
there
are
key
definitional
problems
with
radicalization
discourse
most
fundamentally
the
terms
radicalization
and
extremism
are
used
sloppily
and
with
unclear
meaning
with
a
causal
connection
assumed
between
radical
ideas
and
committing
acts
of
terrorism
n
empirical
research
has
emphatically
and
repeatedly
concluded
that
there
is
no
single
terrorist
profile
and
no
obvious
markers
for
the
process
by
which
someone
becomes
a
terrorist
n
the
process
by
which
people
embrace
violence
is
not
linear
but
complex
n
importantly
studies
of
so
called
homegrown
terrorism
also
reject
the
ideas
that
islam
and
terrorism
are
linked
or
that
observing
the
muslim
faith
constitutes
a
step
toward
violence
n
nor
is
there
data
to
suggest
that
muslims
are
becoming
more
radical
in
their
views
let
alone
more
violent
n
national
security
prosecutions
in
the
headlines
provide
a
skewed
sense
of
the
threat
the
vast
majority
of
those
prosecutions
do
not
charge
defendants
with
any
violent
crime
or
with
any
intent
to
commit
violent

instead
with
material
support
for
terrorism
a
very
broad
concept
typically
far
removed
from
violence
n
despite
their
continued
hold
on
law
enforcement
the
nypd
and
fbi
reports
are
transparent
paper
tigers
now
deconstructed
many
times
over
n
the
stages
and
factors
of
radicalization
are
internally
inconsistent
and
vague
enough
to
justify
surveillance
of
any
person
who
identifies
as
muslim
or
is
linked
with
muslim
religious
or
political
community
consider
for
example
that
the
nypd
report
marks
as
radicalization
incubators
cafes
cab
driver
hangouts
flophouses
prisons
student
associations
nongovernmental
organizations
hookah
water
pipe
bars
butcher
shops
and
book
stores
mostly
locations
where
muslims
or
those
from
muslim
majority
countries
are
likely
to
spend
their
time
whether
for
religious
political
or
sentimental
reasons
n
the
reports
offer
little
to
no
data
in
support
of
their
ambitious
conclusions
with
the
lack
of
substantiation
reflecting
and
reconstituting
the
marginalization
and
stigmatization
of
american
muslims
the
data
on
which
the
reports
rely
include
national
security
prosecutions
involving
questionable
tactics
by
law
enforcement
constructing
the
plot
providing
the
means
and
incentivizing
the
conduct
in
other
words
the
data
results
in
part
from
cases
in
which
the
fbi
created
or
molded
the
behavior
it
then
purported
to
model
n
in
other
cases
the
defendants
never
committed
a
violent
act
confounding
the
link
between
their
behavior
and
a
willingness
to
commit
terrorist
acts
n
overall
there
remains
no
trustworthy
empirical
account
of
radicalization
that
suggests
the
idea
has
explanatory
or
predictive
power
n
racializing
muslims
under
the
guise
of
predicting
future
terrorism
radicalization
provides
a
guide
for
government
activity
in
so
doing
it
redefines
and
expands
the
relevant
field
of
state
concern
from
terrorism
to
radicalization
in
muslim
communities
marking
religious
and
political
activities
as
the
indicators
of
radicalization
the
discourse
links
religious
and
political
practices
in
muslim
communities
with
the
likelihood
of
terrorism
inviting
state
scrutiny
into
the
halls
of
muslim
communities
and
changing
the
terms
of
engagement
with
the
state
for
muslims
the
theory
creates
the
muslim
her
religious
and
political
habits
as
an
object
of
policing
the
theory
is
racially
productive
n
contributing
to
the
racialization
of
american
muslims
n
i
use
the
term
racialization
knowing
that
it
imperfectly
describes
the
shape
and
nature
of
the
stigma
that
has
attached
to
american
muslim
communities
after
not
least
because
african
americans
make
up
a
considerable
portion
of
the
muslim
population
in
the
united
states
american
muslims
are
unique
in
their
diversity
varying
by
race
language
ethnicity
nationality
and
class
still
racialization
best
approximates
the
process
by
which
a
diverse
group
of
people
become
lumped
together
by
stigma
stereotype
and
fear
all
of
which
draw
from
a
range
of
physical
attributes
and
signifiers
mobilized
by
law
as
a
method
of
control
and
subordination
as
with
other
subordinated
and
racialized
groups
for
example
blacks
latinos
native
americans
there
are
for
example
physical
attributes
associated
with
muslim
identity
from
skin
color
to
facial
hair
to
garb
n
by
focusing
on
the
post
era
i
do
not
mean
to
minimize
the
reality
that
muslims
were
racialized
before
or
that
a
significant
portion
of
american
muslim
communities
are
african
american
and
have
long
been
central
to
the
story
of
race
in
america
while
crime
is
the
primary
lens
through
which
african
americans
figure
in
the
american
imaginary
terrorism
is
the
lens
through
which
muslims
appear
african
american
and
muslim
identities
are
carved
by
and
in
opposition
to
particularized
types
of
suspicion
so
the
politics
of
respectability
of
each
group
is
distinct
with
the
pressure
on
african
americans
to
disavow
and
respond
to
black
on
black
crime
and
for
american
muslims
to
disavow
and
respond
to
terrorism
a
creating
muslim
suspects
the
categories
of
law
abiding
and
lawless
n
radical
and
moderate
are
both
overinclusive
and
indeterminate
n
depending
entirely
for
their
meaning
on
police
deployment
and
creating
deep
vulnerability
for
muslim
communities
n
muslims
are
forced
to
carry
the
stigma
borne
of
such
intense
scrutiny
and
are
powerless
to
escape
it
given
that
both
playing
up
and
minimizing
muslim
identity
can
be
seen
as
potentially
suspicious
n
evidence
suggests
however
that
muslims
have
changed
their
behaviors
in
response
to
the
reality
and
perception
of
extensive
surveillance
for
example
individuals
report
signaling
their
muslimness
less
openly
by
praying
at
home
rather
than
at
the
mosque
avoiding
political
conversation
in
mosques
and
other
muslim
specific
spaces
or
reducing
donations
to
muslim
organizations
similarly
mosques
may
ask
speakers
to
avoid
political
content
including
criticism
of
u
s
foreign
policy
n
radicalization
discourse
crystallizes
the
muslim
as
a
figure
of
legitimate
police
scrutiny
n
as
harcourt
observed
in
the
context
of
broken
windows
theory
the
theory
of
deterrence
and
punishment
focuses
on
the
disorderly
person
rather
than
the
criminal
act
and
thereby
facilitates
a
policy
of
control
relocation
and
exclusion
of
the
disorderly
the
category
of
the
disorderly
is
the
product
in
part
of
the
policing
itself
n
broken
windows
theory
does
its
work
in
a
two
step
dialectic
it
shifts
the
object
of
policing
from
crime
to
the
out
of
place
person
and
in
so
doing
constructs
the
out
of
place
person
as
someone
who
needs
to
be
surveilled
and
controlled
by
the
state
similarly
radicalization
theory
and
policing
shift
law
enforcement
s
attention
from
actual
plans
to
commit
a
terrorist
crime
to
muslim
religious
and
political
activity
by
literally
marking
observance
of
muslim
religious
practice
or
expressions
of
political
solidarity
with
other
muslims
as
within
its
causal
framework
the
radical
muslim
by
virtue
of
noncriminal
behavior
attending
a
halaqa
religious
study
group
visiting
family
in
pakistan
growing
a
beard
or
paying
off
a
mortgage
n
embodies
the
potential
threat
of
terrorism
and
in
so
doing
becomes
a
legitimate
object
of
policing
even
when
engaging
in
wholly
noncriminal
now
suspicious
behavior
politicization
becoming
involved
in
social
activism
and
community
issues
and
watching
jihadi
videos
that
highlight
atrocities
committed
against
muslims
bring
you
within
the
third
stage
it
is
not
until
the
fourth
stage
that
the
theory
concerns
itself
with
any
intent
to
undertake
a
criminal
act
in
other
words
you
could
be
three
fourths
radicalized
a
nearly
full
blown
threat
one
would
imagine
and
have
yet
to
form
any
concrete
thoughts
of
committing
any
crime
you
might
have
radical
beliefs
but
no
intent
to
commit
a
violent
crime
the
conservative
muslim
rolling
up
his
pant
sleeve
in
accord
with
a
certain
religious
practice
or
attending
the
friday
sermon
criticizing
u
s
foreign
policy
embodies
this
disorder
and
the
potential
for
a
much
larger
threat
the
religious
and
political
vectors
of
radicalization
theory
work
in
different
if
intersecting
ways
both
vectors
reflect
concerns
with
the
ideas
and
activities
of
muslim
communities
the
religious
vector
marks
basic
observant
behavior
and
conservative
modes
of
muslim
religious
practice
as
radical
and
therefore
worthy
of
suspicion
giving
up
cigarettes
drinking
and
gambling
for
example
or
wearing
traditional
islamic
clothing
are
markers
of
radicalization
n
it
matters
both
what
type
of
islam
you
believe
in
and
what
you
practice
whether
your
actions
do
you
follow
to
a
tee
the
hadith
of
the
prophet
muhammad
or
level
of
devotion
and
study
do
you
regularly
attend
a
halaqa
adhere
to
more
conservative
modes
of
practice
the
more
muslim
you
are
in
the
religious
sense
the
more
radical
and
the
more
potentially
threatening
you
appear
to
be
n
the
political
vector
marks
your
relationship
to
the
project
of
american
statecraft
vis
a
vis
your
concern
and
commune
with
other
muslims
the
ideological
questions
are
awash
in
a
loyalty
calculus
focused
on
whether
you
foreground
concern
with
muslim
community
and
muslim
suffering
at
home
and
abroad
or
the
imperatives
of
the
u
s
government
in
effectuating
its
policies
implicit
here
is
the
idea
that
such
concern
is
compatible
with
american
identity
only
to
the
extent
that
it
comes
second
or
does
not
compete
with
u
s
government
interests
n
the
activity
dimensions
focus
on
muslim
engagement
with
political
issues
vis
a
vis
other
muslims
and
the
u
s
government
does
this
person
or
community
protest
u
s
foreign
or
national
security
policy
does
this
person
or
community
comply
with
requests
to
inform
on
the
local
mosque
when
asked
by
the
fbi
to
do
so
the
radicalization
and
counterradicalization
discourses
have
clear
implications
for
the
meaning
of
good
citizenship
on
the
part
of
american
muslims
to
be
a
good
citizen
is
to
have
a
compliant
relationship
with
the
state
rather
than
to
relate
from
an
oppositional
or
contesting
stance
are
you
with
us
or
against
us
n
remains
the
question
if
radicalization
creates
ideological
force
for
the
idea
that
the
state
should
monitor
muslims
and
radical
muslims
in
particular
then
counterradicalization
initiatives
operationalize
the
distinction
offering
american
muslims
an
opening
to
perform
their
americanness
by
partnering
with
the
government
n
the
distinction
emerges
not
simply
from
how
muslims
signal
their
identity
or
allegiance
with
regard
to
muslim
religious
practices
or
other
muslims
the
distinction
between
the
radical
and
american
muslim
emerges
in
part
from
how
muslims
relate
to
u
s
statecraft
or
u
s
government
initiatives
counterradicalization
creates
friction
between
loyalty
to
the
u
s
project
and
practices
of
muslim
identity
in
particular
the
muslim
concept
of
the
ummah
or
global
muslim
community
comes
into
conflict
with
counterradicalization
commitments
resistance
to
or
criticism
of
american
foreign
policy
in
muslim
lands
is
a
factor
of
radicalization
n
so
is
concern
for
muslim
casualties
abroad
or
discrimination
against
muslims
in
the
united
states
n
traveling
abroad
to
muslim
countries
even
for
hyphenated
second
generation
americans
visiting
family
suggests
suspicious
connection
n
in
classifying
muslims
who
attend
mosque
who
travel
or
send
money
abroad
or
who
oppose
the
u
s
drone
policy
in
yemen
and
pakistan
as
within
the
process
of
radicalization
toward
terrorism
the
theory
marks
individuals
and
geographies
as
sufficiently
different
to
be
outside
the
protections
of
the
state
transforming
them
into
legitimate
objects
of
state
scrutiny
n
radical
muslims
become
the
lawless
out
of
place
subjects
deserving
of
little
protection
n
counterradicalization
cleaves
muslim
from
american
identities
in
another
way
equating
cooperation
with
the
state
with
americanness
and
loyalty
and
dissent
with
muslimness
radicalization
and
terrorism
efforts
at
partnering
with
muslim
communities
in
counterradicalization
efforts
create
opportunities
for
american
muslims
to
signal
their
allegiance
like
the
regulars
and
the
lawful
in
the
broken
windows
account
those
considered
american
muslims
are
partners
in
counterradicalization
they
stand
for
the
state
s
values
will
cooperate
with
the
police
in
their
efforts
to
monitor
and
influence
coreligionists
and
will
step
down
in
the
face
of
conflict
by
exercising
a
right
of
refusal
to
cooperate
with
the
state
the
american
muslim
moves
toward
radicalism
the
radical
emerging
in
response
to
the
state
s
policing
b
creating
the
terms
of
racial
obedience
radicalization
and
counterradicalization
place
identity
pressures
on
american
muslims
in
their
interactions
with
each
other
the
public
and
the
state
n
to
cooperate
no
matter
the
substance
of
law
enforcement
s
demand
and
expectation
is
to
validate
one
s
american
identity
to
refuse
or
to
dissent
is
to
express
radicalism
or
at
least
openness
to
it
n
radicalization
policing
creates
the
racial
obedience
toward
and
fear
of
the
police
manifested
in
particular
kinds
of
performances
to
signal
acquiescence
and
respectability
n
of
course
this
racialized
pressure
emerges
from
a
larger
social
context
people
of
color
are
subject
to
more
frequent
and
more
severe
police
scrutiny
and
they
are
fearful
that
refusing
the
police
will
stoke
racial
animosity
or
race
based
suspicion
and
aggravate
an
already
bad
situation
n
immigrants
in
particular
are
less
likely
to
know
their
rights
in
all
these
contexts
accountability
is
minimal
so
the
police
have
an
incentive
to
exploit
vulnerabilities
n
radicalization
theory
has
created
a
post
reality
in
which
muslims
are
more
vulnerable
to
compliance
requests
more
likely
to
comply
and
have
to
give
up
more
privacy
to
do
so
n
radicalization
informed
policing
produces
a
loyalty
discourse
in
which
there
are
good
and
bad
muslims
and
thereby
entrenches
the
idea
of
muslimness
as
a
crime
of
identity
n
encourages
group
surveillance
and
incentivizes
muslims
to
be
available
for
indeed
advocate
for
white
racial
inspection
of
muslimness
n
as
with
the
politics
of
respectability
in
black
communities
this
approach
does
not
protect
the
good
muslims
but
instead
renders
all
muslims
vulnerable
to
racial
profiling
n
indeed
radicalization
creates
geographies
of
suspicion
while
the
geography
of
broken
windows
theory
was
effectively
one
of
class
and
race
hoisting
the
specter
of
the
poor
black
neighborhood
the
sphere
of
radicalization
is
religious
and
cultural
though
of
course
inflected
by
race
and
class
as
well
n
in
large
metropolitan
centers
there
are
certainly
physically
contiguous
neighborhoods
where
muslims
of
similar
racial
or
class
backgrounds
reside
in
the
rest
of
the
country
however
muslims
of
different
classes
races
nationalities
and
linguistic
and
ethnic
groups
are
more
dispersed
in
these
places
government
surveillance
creates
a
different
kind
of
geography
out
of
the
places
where
muslims
gather
the
mosque
the
halal
butcher
or
the
indian
or
somali
grocery
store
and
visiting
these
places
makes
you
vulnerable
to
police
scrutiny
n
beyond
the
policing
practices
themselves
there
is
the
realm
of
public
discourse
and
debate
in
which
muslims
make
their
choices
the
most
public
and
theatrical
government
initiative
drawing
attention
to
radicalization
occurred
with
peter
king
s
first
in
a
series
of
hearings
before
the
house
homeland
security
committee
in
and
meant
to
address
a
crisis
of
radicalization
to
violence
within
the
muslim
american
community
n
and
a
refusal
by
muslims
to
cooperate
n
those
called
by
king
as
representatives
of
muslim
communities
testified
that
american
muslims
were
ignoring
concerns
with
radicalization
and
could
do
more
to
cooperate
n
the
witnesses
lampooned
a
number
of
mainstream
and
prominent
american
muslim
advocacy
organizations
muslim
advocates
the
council
on
american
islamic
relations
and
the
muslim
public
affairs
council
all
of
which
have
met
regularly
with
federal
state
and
local
city
officials
for
undermining
muslim
cooperation
with
law
enforcement
efforts
the
organizations
and
other
community
leaders
came
under
fire
especially
for
their
recent
initiatives
counseling
community
members
to
retain
a
lawyer
before
dealing
with
the
fbi
n
a
loyalty
discourse
thus
took
shape
during
the
king
hearings
as
cooperation
with
law
enforcement
was
counterposed
with
muslims
exercise
of
their
right
to
counsel
n
in
essence
muslims
were
encouraged
to
waive
their
rights
and
cooperate
with
the
state
without
undertaking
any
method
of
self
protection
as
a
way
to
demonstrate
their
americanness
and
their
loyalty
to
the
american
project
no
scrutiny
was
given
to
the
law
enforcement
efforts
with
which
they
were
being
asked
to
cooperate
n
while
the
king
hearing
is
a
particularly
egregious
example
of
a
government
initiative
that
creates
a
binary
between
muslim
and
american
identity
other
initatives
contribute
to
the
same
identity
cleavage
n
for
example
the
white
house
s
various
counterradicalization
cve
and
community
government
partnerships
have
all
contributed
to
this
discourse
charging
all
american
muslims
with
the
task
of
protecting
the
nation
against
terrorist
threats
n
in
this
context
joining
hands
with
counterradicalization
efforts
whatever
they
may
entail
becomes
the
good
american
thing
to
do
while
refusing
becomes
the
wrong
terrorist
or
muslim
option
c
racializing
ideology
in
addition
to
shaping
modes
of
political
engagement
with
the
state
radicalization
discourse
and
counterradicalization
practice
affect
the
parameters
of
religious
and
political
conversations
and
contestation
by
rendering
certain
viewpoints
or
topics
as
off
limits
n
of
course
it
is
not
just
the
existence
of
the
discourse
at
work
here
it
is
the
recurring
and
regularized
interactions
with
police
that
serve
as
constant
reminders
of
the
stakes
for
american
muslims
much
of
terrorism
and
radicalization
discourses
are
enshrouded
in
a
politics
of
anti
knowledge
n
terrorism
studies
tend
to
reduce
complex
social
historical
and
political
dynamics
n
chief
among
the
constraints
shaping
what
can
be
said
about
terrorism
is
denial
of
the
possibility
of
rational
causes
and
the
attribution
of
terrorism
to
pure
evil
n
the
mainstream
narrative
implies
that
once
an
individual
has
adopted
an
extremist
religious
ideology
terrorism
will
result

n
similarly
radicalization

discourse
displaces
any
attention
on

a
focus
on
theological
and
psychological
factors
that
supposedly
foment
radicalization
n
radicalization
theory
marks
certain
topics

as
beyond
the
pale

suggesting
that
they
are
un
american

likely
to
draw
government
scrutiny
n
as
a
result
radicalization
discourse
puts
pressure
on
the
contours
of
conversation
among
muslim
communities
about
the
public
issues
of
our
times
to
which
many
american
muslims
are
particularly
attuned

thus

about
the
exercise
of

power
in
iraq
afghanistan
pakistan
somalia
yemen
and
so
on
n
the
absence
of
muslim
voices
on
these
issues
is
particularly
notable
given
how
much
of
contemporary
u

is
focused

other
muslim
community
space
has
also
shrunk
and
warped

since
mosque
leaders
have
been
under
pressure
to
eject
anyone
expressing
radical
views
rather
than
engaging
with
them
and
seeking
to
challenge
their
religious
interpretation
address
their
political
frustrations
or
meet
their
emotional
needs
n
moreover
radicalization
discourse
may
serve
to
pathologize
complex
social
problems
displace
focus
from
the
role
of
government
activity
in
creating
those
problems

place
the
burden
of
solving

while
community
engagement
aims
to
build

with

to
gain
trust
and
enhance
communication
it
also
functions
as
a
technique
of
policing
radicalization
encouraging
all
encompassing
surveillance
of
muslim
communities
and
working
to
cultivate
in
muslims
a
suspicion
of
coreligionists
religiosity
and

n
community
engagement
becomes
yet
another
pressure
point
at
which
muslims
must
participate
in
surveillance
or
else
suggest
disloyalty
to
the
american
project
given
its
anchoring
in
counterradical
ization
the
order
that
community

seeks
to
impose
draws
from
ideas
about
the
proper
ways
to
practice
islam
in
america
the
right
balance
between
religious
and
secular
life
and
a
demand
for
a
certain
form
of
political
assimilation
n
it
closes
or
at
least
narrows
possibilities
for
meaningful
contestation
and
collaboration
while
obscuring
and
even
reinforcing
the
power
differential
between
muslim
communities
and
law
enforcement
the
space
between
how
community
engagement
appears
as
a
democracy
or
inclusion
enhancing
venture
and
the
work
it
actually
does
to
reinforce
coercive
policing
is
what
this
part
explores
throughout
the
foregoing
discussion
i
have
emphasized
the
dangers
associated
with
law
enforcement
s
community
engagement
efforts
in
particular
how
counterradicalization
and
community
engagement
work
to
cultivate
pro
law
enforcement
attitudes
and
affectations
such
that
muslims
open
up
their
communities
in
various
ways
for
government
inspection
and
regulation
in
so
emphasizing
i
do
not
mean
to
disparage
civic
engagement
which
is
no
doubt
constitutive
of
democracy
the
quality
of
civic
engagement
has
to
matter
though
if
the
end
is
democracy
of
any
meaningfully
participatory
or
accountable
variety
and
if
the
goal
is
to
bring
outsider
communities
into
the
fold
i
am
not
convinced
that
encouraging
marginalized
citizens
interactions
with
their
government
is
constructive
of
democracy
when
it
is
achieved
through
coercive
means
which
do
not
allow
for
contestation
of
terms
or
meaningful
input
and
instead
provide
pressure
on
communities
to
participate
in
the
very
policing
tactics
that
create
the
gulf
in
trust
that
propels
the
need
for
forays
into
trust
building
when
this
participation
and
consent
are
shaped
by
a
pressure
to
perform
americanness
and
to
dispel
racialized
assumptions
about
loyalty
and
allegiance
the
coercion
raises
acute
equality
and
antisubordination
concerns
the
federal
government
has
an
interest
in
community
engagement
apart
from
democracy
national
security
through
the
surveillance
and
acculturation
of
communities
marked
as
vulnerable
to
anti
american
persuasion
the
government
hopes
to
prevent
attacks
on
its
non
muslim
citizens
but
while
a
fear
of
muslims
or
so
called
islamic
terrorism
fuels
the
push
for
community
engagement
the
data
does
not
substantiate
the
extent
of
the
concerns
when
one
considers
the
size
of
the
global
muslim
population
or
even
simply
the
american
muslim
population
the
few
acts
of
terrorism
committed
by
muslims
in
the
united
states
are
infinitesimal
including
as
compared
to
other
threats
n
the
bloated
concern
with
terrorism
seems
to
be
motivated
more
by
politics
than
by
facts
community
policing
generates
its
moral
authority
by
tapping
into
the
ideas
of
community
support
and
democratic
legitimacy
but
the
slippery
quality
of
the
term
community
and
the
terrain
of
inequality
that
gives
rise
to
the
push
for
such
programs
provokes
two
nested
concerns
first
community
engagement
programs
are
largely
top
down
with
federal
government
prerogatives
imposed
on
muslim
communities
community
engagement
creates
the
aesthetics
of
democracy
and
inclusion
without
necessarily
reflecting
any
substantive
commitments
to
those
values
concretely
the
police
may
select
partners
that
ratify
preexisting
police
practices
n
or
pursue
community
engagement
primarily
as
another
entry
point
for
surveillance
and
norms
molding
as
opposed
to
a
source
of
accountability
or
contestation
the
appearance
of
collaboration
without
any
real
possibility
of
significant
contestation
may
undermine
rather
than
bolster
democracy
augmenting
the
coercive
power
of
the
state
moreover
to
the
extent
community
engagement
draws
on
racialized
pressures
on
muslims
to
perform
their
americanness
and
disavow
their
muslimness
as
a
way
to
prove
their
american
bona
fides
the
police
partnerships
exacerbate
autonomy
equality
and
subordination
concerns
implicated
in
the
broader
regime
of
policing
radicalization
second
the
police
partnerships
may
exacerbate
hierarchies
within
muslim
communities
police
partnerships
may
have
distributive
effects
internal
to
the
community
such
that
the
elite
may
be
further
empowered
over
the
marginalized
even
as
they
themselves
are
subject
to
coercive
state
power
if
the
inclusive
and
democratic
work
of
community
engagement
is
questionable
and
the
fear
of
muslims
outsized
we
must
be
suspect
of
the
heightened
push
for
community
engagement
with
muslim
communities
my
primary
concern
here
is
to
test
or
problematize
the
democratic
claims
of
this
tactic
n
a
a
top
down
approach
if
we
are
to
take
the
democracy
and
inclusion
claims
of
community
engagement
seriously
we
should
expect
that
communities
are
able
to
exert
meaningful
influence
n
or
have
a
determinative
role
in
setting
policing
goals
priorities
and
strategies
n
if
community
engagement
does
not
provide
opportunities
for
meaningful
or
determinative
input
but
rather
facilitates
involvement
only
to
the
extent
that
participants
lend
support
to
preexisting
law
enforcement
priorities
then
its
claim
to
democratic
legitimacy
should
be
questioned
there
is
strong
reason
to
question
the
democratic
claims
of
community
engagement
as
with
community
policing
in
the
ordinary
criminal
context
a
basic
tenet
of
community
engagement
is
that
there
is
value
for
muslim
communities
and
law
enforcement
in
cultivating
channels
of
communication
the
emphasis
in
official
government
statements
is
on
relationship
and
trust
building
inclusion
and
democracy
but
community
engagement
efforts
steeped
in
counterradicalization
play
important
norms
molding
and
intelligence
gathering
functions
raising
important
questions
about
the
implicit
claims
to
democracy
enhancement
on
which
the
efforts
rely
moreover
whereas
building
trust
and
relationships
is
based
generally
on
the
idea
of
two
way
obligations
in
reality
the
government
has
done
little
to
address
the
fundamental
root
of
distrust
which
starts
with
the
overly
broad
and
punitive
approach
to
policing
entire
muslim
communities
n
interacting
with
muslim
communities
law
enforcement
s
prevailing
focus
is
national
security
foregrounding
threat
potential
in
government
s
interactions
with
muslim
communities
n
above
and
beyond
the
concerns
with
community
engagement
serving
as
a
cover
for
surveillance
and
norms
molding
the
federal
government
has
repeatedly
signaled
little
room
for
american
muslim
communities
to
play
a
determinative
role
in
setting
priorities
community
engagement
provides
opportunities
for
american
muslims
to
partake
in
and
ratify
law
enforcement
s
work
in
a
community
engagement
push
by
federal
law
enforcement
with
minnesota
s
somali
communities
for
example
an
fbi
private
acknowledged
there
was
no
possibility
of
the
community
having
influenced
how
the
investigations
were
carried
out
n
to
the
contrary
the
aims
were
more
one
sided
to
correct
what
its
agents
called
misperceptions
such
as
that
suspects
in
somalia
might
be
imprisoned
without
trial
or
targeted
for
drone
killings
such
community
fears
were
consistent
with
official
us
policy
and
to
encourage
community
leaders
to
pass
information
to
federal
agents
about
young
people
n
while
there
might
be
space
to
raise
concerns
with
the
government
there
is
little
reason
to
suggest
any
real
possibility
for
meaningful
or
determinative
input
n
the
detachment
of
community
engagement
from
its
claim
to
democratic
authority
starts
at
the
foundational
level
community
policing
s
historical
aim
has
been
to
reduce
crime
in
an
inner
city
or
even
a
particular
neighborhood
the
subject
community
could
in
some
sense
be
imagined
to
be
working
with
the
police
to
enhance
its
own
welfare
central
to
proponents
arguments
for
community
policing
has
been
the
idea
that
african
american
communities
suffer
from
underenforcement
by
police
and
need
more
policing
to
rid
their
communities
of
crime
n
in
its
national
security
manifestation
however
community
engagement
s
aim
is
to
secure
the
state
muslims
are
made
responsible
not
for
their
own
condition
but
for
the
welfare
of
the
entire
nation
and
for
protecting
the
nation
against
terrorists
it
is
a
particularized
responsibility
for
the
welfare
of
the
nation
not
shared
by
other
groups
n
the
assignment
of
responsibility
should
trouble
us
for
a
number
of
reasons
including
basic
american
proscriptions
against
guilt
by
association
and
racial
and
religious
profiling
muslim
communities
had
not
identified
radicalization
or
violent
extremism
as
an
issue
of
concern
before
the
government
s
framing
of
radicalization
and
violent
extremism
as
a
national
priority
n
by
and
large
muslim
communities
and
advocacy
groups
have
not
only
objected
to
the
radicalization
framework
and
the
assertion
of
growing
radicalization
in
muslim
communities
n
but
have
also
insisted
that
they
are
cooperating
with
law
enforcement
efforts
n
community
engagement
in
its
current
manifestation
grounded
in
counterradicalization
and
cve
has
in
some
sense
been
foisted
on
muslim
communities
n
the
federal
nature
of
the
underlying
concern
also
undercuts
community
engagement
s
democratic
potential
federal
law
enforcement
entities
national
in
scope
and
in
responsibility
take
the
lead
in
community
engagement
efforts
whereas
local
police
embody
community
policing
as
originally
conceived
even
in
the
community
policing
context
critics
worried
that
more
marginalized
communities
or
more
marginalized
segments
of
communities
the
ones
most
in
need
of
protection
from
abusive
unaccountable
policing
would
be
unable
to
exert
enough
power
to
contest
or
hold
police
accountable
in
the
federal
context
not
to
mention
the
politically
charged
realm
of
national
security
the
concern
is
even
more
acute
the
idea
that
marginalized
dispersed
and
diverse
muslim
communities
could
hold
accountable
the
federal
government
or
federal
law
enforcement
on
national
security
issues
is
dubious
if
muslims
had
the
political
power
to
hold
the
police
accountable
community
engagement
programs
would
not
be
necessary
from
a
democracy
or
inclusion
perspective
to
begin
with
at
the
heart
of
radicalization
discourse
is
the
idea
that
muslims
and
islam
are
responsible
for
terrorism
radicalization
discourse
creates
false
and
stigmatizing
equivalences
between
islam
muslims
and
terrorism
and
between
islam
muslims
and
violence
in
turn
community
engagement
becomes
a
tool
of
counterradicalization
in
which
muslims
are
asked
to
participate
instru
mentalizing
muslim
leaders
to
share
information
on
their
co
religionists
in
a
regime
that
conflates
islam
with
the
problem
n
this
information
sharing
happens
knowingly
and
unknowingly
directly
and
indirectly
and
with
varying
degrees
of
consent
and
coercion
through
community
participation
in
community
engagement
efforts
the
well
intentioned
community
leader
seeking
to
forge
ties
with
law
enforcement
as
a
way
to
help
his
community
may
unwittingly
share
intelligence
that
renders
coreligionists
even
more
vulnerable
n
the
recently
released
fbi
policy
directive
on
community
engagement
reflects
the
sense
of
the
agency
that
community
members
do
not
have
an
expectation
that
community
engagement
will
generate
information
for
an
fbi
file
or
database
n
indeed
when
advocacy
groups
publicized
the
records
obtained
by
the
freedom
of
information
act
foia
demonstrating
the
bay
area
fbi
mosque
outreach
program
served
as
a
cover
for
surveillance
muslim
communities
reacted
with
surprise
n
the
revelations
that
community
engagement
initiatives
have
served
to
collect
intelligence
on
entire
muslim
communities
have
had
devastating
effects
on
the
ability
of
these
communities
to
function
cohesively
and
trust
in
law
enforcement
n
nonetheless
muslims
are
asked
to
choose
the
state
over
self
determination
and
autonomy
n
muslim
communities
are
asked
to
participate
in
political
and
religious
acculturation
of
their
communities
to
ensure
their
coreligionists
are
sufficiently
american
not
too
conservative
not
too
critical
of
the
united
states
there
is
pressure
on
muslims
to
moderate
their
religious
and
political
views
and
to
pressure
coreligionists
to
do
the
same
for
the
good
of
the
nation
a
significant
aspect
of
this
duty
is
to
facilitate
the
state
s
reach
into
muslim
communities
by
partnering
in
surveillance
and
culture
shaping
including
by
opening
doors
to
and
participating
in
law
enforcement
community
engagement
n
community
engagement
may
also
incentivize
community
members
to
share
information
about
coreligionists
day
to
day
activities
with
law
enforcement
this
incentivization
may
occur
through
opportunities
to
perform
americanness
an
american
muslim
specific
politics
of
respectability
perhaps
and
may
come
with
concrete
benefits
such
as
access
to
government
officials
invitations
to
other
community
engagement
programs
or
even
help
with
immigration
issues
n
but
the
pressure
to
participate
in
the
acculturation
does
not
end
at
the
town
hall
or
meet
and
greet
effort
the
community
engagement
contact
becomes
a
conduit
through
which
participants
become
part
of
the
larger
surveillance
apparatus
this
requires
accepting
the
premises
of
counterradicalization
and
the
view
that
conservative
modes
of
religious
practice
or
harsh
criticism
of
the
united
states
is
suspicious
or
dangerous
it
also
requires
adopting
the
view
that
muslims
have
a
role
in
sharing
information
on
and
regulating
the
political
and
religious
currents
in
their
communities
and
that
they
must
condemn
radicalism
and
extremism
in
any
form
in
their
communities
a
muslim
businessman
who
has
partnered
in
community
engagement
efforts
explained
the
fbi
is
really
helping
us
to
know
what
to
look
for
if
you
see
someone
changing
overnight
growing
a
beard
and
starting
to
wear
different
clothes
we
need
to
find
out
what
is
happening
n
similarly
in
a
presentation
to
muslim
community
leaders
in
houston
fbi
agents
asked
attendees
to
report
on
community
members
who
were
taking
extreme
positions

constitutive

around
a
desire
to
work
with
the
police

power

partnership
may

incredibly
diverse

infinite
varieties
of

specific
ethnic
or
religious
group
as
particularly
relevant
to
the
project

national
security
n
while
the
white
house
goes
to
some
length
to
emphasize
that
terrorist
recruitment
could
happen
in

the
force
of

been
on

to
blame
and
they
hold
entire
religious
communities
to
account
for
the
acts
of
individuals
community
engagement
initiatives
necessarily
focus
on
subgroups
within
muslim
communities
n
recent
data
suggests
community
engagement
efforts
focus
on
arab
american
muslims
to
the
relative
exclusion
of
african
american
south
asian
and
other
american
muslims
of
various
decent
n
in
focusing
on
certain
subgroups
youth
for
example
the
government
seems
to
have
assigned
them
a
particularly
high
threat
of
radicalization
which
in
turn
is
likely
to
intensify
vulnerability
in
these
communities
there
s
an
observable
synergy
between
the
focus
of
community
engagement
efforts
policing
radicalization
and
foreign
policy
priorities
n
government
focus
on
the
american
somali
community
in
the
form
of
community
engagement
and
other
policing
as
well
for
material
support
prosecutions
n
dovetailed
with
u
s
foreign
policy
concerns
about
al
shabaab
a
somalia
based
designated
foreign
terrorist
organization
n
which
several
somali
americans
allegedly
traveled
abroad
to
join
n
similarly
the
latest
focus
on
isis
has
come
with
a
resurgent
push
on
community
engagement
policing
and
material
support
prosecutions
in
american
muslim
communities
n
in
practice
then
community
engagement
is
closely
intertwined
with
other
policing
methods
and
functions
as
well
as
the
security
crisis
of
the
day
reconstituting
the
idea
that
federal
community
engagement
approaches
muslims
first
as
potential
threats
and
then
as
partners
n
while
community
engagement
initiatives
do
not
overtly
make
distinctions
based
on
class
they
inevitably
prioritize
community
elites
leaders
imams
businessmen
and
other
centers
of
influence
in
muslim
communities
n
other
more
blatantly
coercive
techniques
of
policing
radicalization
those
recruited
into
formal
informant
relationships
or
targeted
by
informants
for
radicalization
or
entrapment
are
likely
to
focus
on
community
members
more
vulnerable
by
virtue
of
their
class
immigration
status
or
criminal
records
thus
while
relative
elites
may
partner
with
law
enforcement
to
facilitate
access
those
that
suffer
the
most
acute
consequences
are
more
likely
more
vulnerable
there
may
be
financial
mechanics
to
counterradicalization
programming
n
both
with
regard
to
funding
for
state
and
local
law
enforcement
and
for
community
partners
raising
a
whole
host
of
other
issues
federal
dollars
may
induce
state
and
local
law
enforcement
to
approach
local
muslim
communities
with
a
new
counterradicalization
lens
and
may
warp
the
work
of
community
based
organizations
n
consider
the
st
paul
example
st
paul
s
police
department
secured
doj
funding
to
take
a
counterradicalization
community
engagement
approach
in
a
longstanding
outreach
program
with
local
american
somali
communities
n
in
turn
muslim
american
society
of
minnesota
got
funding
through
the
program
to
hire
a
police
liaison
n
in
other
words
doj
funded
the
local
police
department
which
in
turn
funded
the
community
based
organization
s
effort
the
executive
director
of
the
organization
was
asked
to
keep
track
of
attendees
at
outreach
meetings
but
when
asked
by
the
police
department
to
share
the
list
of
participants
he
refused
n
certainly
there
are
ideological
dimensions
to
partnership
with
the
federal
government
n
counterradicalization
programs
will
bolster
muslim
leaders
who
are
seen
as
moderate
in
their
religious
and
political
views
and
thereby
involve
the
government
in
shaping
of
acceptable
forms
of
islam
and
palatable
forms
of
political
engagement
n
equally
troublingly
community
engagement
programs
may
work
only
with
those
muslims
who
are
relatively
more
amenable
to
the
government
s
counterradicalization
approach
community
engagement
tends
to
empower
those
who
want
more
policing
at
the
expense
of
those
who
want
more
control
of
the
police
and
to
exclude
those
whose
interests
are
in
less
aggressive
policing
n
those
interested
in
more
policing
are
likely
to
be
more
politically
organized
have
more
political
capital
and
be
more
likely
to
be
invited
to
or
to
attend
police
community
forums
n
those
uninterested
in
more
policing
may
avoid
any
interactions
with
the
police
let
alone
cultivate
partnerships
refusal
to
participate
in
such
efforts
may
even
be
construed
as
a
sign
of
radicalization
n
more
generally
law
enforcement
plays
an
important
role
in
who
gets
a
seat
at
the
table
to
represent
the
american
muslim
community
take
the
case
of
the
council
on
american
islamic
relations
cair
the
largest
muslim
american
civil
rights
organization
in
the
fbi
cut
off
ties
with
cair
not
viewing
the
group
as
an
appropriate
liaison
partner
n
the
islamic
shura
council
of
southern
california
registered
its
complaint
with
the
los
angeles
field
office
suspending
the
membership
organization
s
participation
in
the
fbi
s
outreach
work
n
the
american
civil
liberties
union
later
complained
to
the
doj
office
of
inspector
general
about
the
fbi
s
publicly
and
selectively
ostracizing
cair
from
its
official
outreach
events
without
adequate
basis
to
exclude
the
civil
rights
organization
n
in
the
aftermath
the
muslim
public
affairs
council
mpac
started
to
play
a
more
significant
role
in
the
federal
government
s
outreach
and
counterradicalization
efforts
in
los
angeles
and
around
the
country
n
behind
the
vision
of
community
in
accounts
of
community
policing
and
community
engagement
there
tends
to
be
a
nostalgic
aspirational
idea
of
community
disconnected
from
reality
a
community
where
there
are
bright
boundaries
demarcating
who
is
inside
and
outside
and
the
community
s
wants
are
clear
and
unanimous
n
in
relying
on
this
imagined
community
community
policing
has
prioritized
order
over
dissent
and
agreement
over
disagreement
it
has
failed
moreover
to
take
communities
seriously
in
their
messy
realities
and
has
fallen
short
of
its
potential
to
be
a
more
democratic
form
of
policing
the
desire
to
partner
with
antiradical
or
moderate
elements
in
american
muslim
communities
imposes
a
similar
imaginary
for
american
muslims
creating
a
community
engagement
program
that
is
inflexible
and
unresponsive
to
dissent
or
contestation
c
push
back
since
muslim
communities
have
consistently
articulated
a
fear
of
being
outspoken
or
involved
in
the
public
sphere
for
fear
of
retribution
or
scrutiny
from
the
federal
government
n
the
concern
is
that
any
heightened
visibility
may
draw
the
surveillance
of
the
state
to
their
door
this
concern
has
manifested
in
a
reluctance
to
organize
or
articulate
criticism
of
u
s
policies
toward
muslims
at
home
and
abroad
and
in
changed
relationships
to
spaces
of
community
and
worship
n
at
the
same
time
muslim
communities
have
become
increasingly
vocal
in
their
objections
to
broad
based
surveillance
and
in
particular
the
use
of
informants
in
their
communities
n
in
the
most
recent
wave
of
community
engagement
initiatives
muslim
communities
have
notably
used
the
forums
discussed
herein
to
contest
the
modes
through
which
the
federal
government
is
interacting
with
them
when
the
secretary
of
homeland
security
visited
an
ohio
mosque
for
example
he
faced
a
litany
of
grievances
including
complaints
of
humiliating
border
inspections
by
brusque
federal
agents
and
f
b
i
sting
operations
that
wrongly
targeted
muslim
citizens
as
terrorists
n
the
mosque
s
youth
coordinator
told
the
new
york
times
our
relationship
has
to
be
built
on
trust
but
the
u
s
government
hasn
t
given
us
very
many
reasons
to
build
up
that
trust
n
public
boycott
of
high
profile
community
engagement
events
at
the
white
house
have
become
a
tool
for
organizing
and
resistance
n
in
advance
of
the
annual
white
house
iftar
during
the
month
of
ramadan
a
wide
ranging
debate
emerged
among
american
muslims
when
a
petition
calling
for
boycott
of
the
iftar
emerged
on
social
media
and
the
american
arab
anti
discrimination
committee
adc
issued
a
statement
in
support
n
the
boycott
was
framed
as
a
response
to
the
administration
s
support
for
israel
s
massacre
of
palestinians
in
gaza
and
the
latest
snowden
revelations
about
the
nsa
spying
on
american
muslim
leaders
including
those
involved
in
community
engagement
initiatives
n
the
adc
explained
that
political
engagement
is
important
and
having
a
seat
at
the
table
is
crucial
but
only
when
the
seat
is
intended
to
amplify
our
voice
as
a
community
not
tokenize
or
subdue
it
n
while
many
boycotted
the
iftar
many
attended
despite
sharing
the
concerns
motivating
the
boycott
n
similarly
a
number
of
muslim
american
community
groups
boycotted
and
protested
the
three
day
cve
summit
held
at
the
white
house
in
february
n
a
coalition
of
american
muslim
and
civil
rights
groups
issued
a
joint
statement
in
advance
of
the
summit
outlining
concerns
that
community
engagement
from
a
cve
standpoint
sets
american
muslim
communities
apart
as
inherently
suspect
that
cve
tasks
community
members
to
expansively
monitor
the
beliefs
and
expressive
or
associational
activities
of
other
muslims
and
creates
a
climate
of
fear
and
chills
constitutionally
protected
activity
and
that
mutual
trust
is
difficult
if
not
impossible
given
the
fbi
s
larger
set
of
police
practices
including
deceptively
conducting
intelligence
gathering
under
the
guise
of
community
outreach
and
relying
on
law
enforcement
agencies
to
play
the
lead
role
in
implementing
cve
n
while
some
of
the
signatories
declined
the
invitation
to
the
summit
the
groups
collectively
decided
that
representatives
from
some
of
our
groups
will
attend
in
order
to
provide
a
sorely
missing
critical
perspective
on
the
cve
framework
and
to
seek
more
information
about
the
rollout
and
implementation
of
cve
pilot
n
at
the
same
time
a
number
of
muslim
student
association
chapters
issued
a
strong
statement
opposing
cve
programs
to
ensure
that
our
american
muslim
community
is
not
mistreated
and
that
our
youth
are
able
to
live
their
lives
free
from
fear
of
surveillance
racial
and
religious
profiling
and
as
strong
active
members
of
their
communities
n
it
is
too
soon
to
know
whether
american
muslims
publicly
organizing
and
debating
the
merits
of
community
engagement
will
lead
to
change
or
lead
to
programs
that
simply
work
around
the
protest
and
protesters
law
enforcement
s
response
may
portend
the
democratic
potential
of
community
engagement
n
conclusion
this
article
has
attempted
to
identify
the
problems
with
community
engagement
and
counterradicalization
in
the
national
security
context
drawing
from
the
critiques
of
community
policing
and
broken
windows
in
the
ordinary
criminal
context
the
canvas
for
this
critical
engagement
was
limited
insofar
as
muslim
communities
experiences
in
these
programs
have
been
largely
sheltered
from
public
view
harvesting
those
experiences
is
no
doubt
essential
to
understanding
the
possibilities
and
limitations
of
these
programs
this
article
provided
a
sketch
of
the
problems
lurking
near
the
surface
that
is
left
to
future
work
is
community
engagement
salvageable
moving
community
engagement
toward
its
most
democratic
aspirations
toward
a
more
genuine
exercise
in
community
consultation
contestation
and
collaboration
would
involve
ridding
the
program
of
its
pernicious
baggage
for
example
law
enforcement
could
end
community
engagement
s
integration
with
community
wide
intelligence
gathering
or
could
decouple
community
engagement
from
cve
and
counterradicalization
certainly
there
are
strong
normative
reasons
including
those
that
motivate
this
article
to
expect
and
demand
that
law
enforcement
account
for
the
realities
of
marginalized
communities
but
we
cannot
expect
that
dialogue
will
necessarily
lead
to
accountability
meaningful
contestation
or
realignment
of
police
approaches
in
marginalized
communities
after
all
law
enforcement
is
itself
a
significant
vehicle
for
marginalization
and
racialization
in
the
united
states
it
is
reasonable
to
question
whether
community
policing
or
policing
at
all
can
be
expected
to
be
the
vehicle
for
the
change
we
are
seeking
the
problem
and
the
solution
may
be
entirely
mismatched
the
allure
of
community
policing
rests
in
part
on
a
broader
construct
of
dialogue
as
inherently
valuable
while
dialogue
can
certainly
be
valuable
its
value
will
depend
on
the
context
and
the
point
of
view
from
which
it
is
being
evaluated
dialogue
often
serves
a
different
function
for
the
more
powerful
in
the
conversation
than
the
less
powerful
the
idea
that
dialogue
is
the
cure
all
for
poor
relationships
between
police
and
marginalized
communities
emerges
from
a
failure
to
recognize
the
structures
and
histories
of
police
impunity
in
these
communities
as
well
as
the
material
realities
that
keep
inequality
in
place
when
the
dialogue
in
question
is
with
the
police
initiated
by
the
police
and
on
the
police
s
own
terms
not
only
is
the
function
of
the
dialogue
necessarily
limited
the
entire
initiative
should
raise
red
flags
how
will
the
dialogue
change
the
material
reality
of
policing
in
the
community
does
the
dialogue
further
exacerbate
inequality
or
simply
validate
preexisting
policing
practices
through
the
performance
of
democratic
legitimacy
or
is
it
really
allowing
for
messy
democratic
contestation
and
the
possibility
for
change
in
the
material
conditions
of
the
relationship
between
the
police
and
the
marginalized
for
community
policing
to
be
an
effective
tool
in
changing
the
relationship
between
the
marginalized
and
law
enforcement
marginalized
communities
cannot
simply
be
offered
a
seat
at
the
table
to
participate
in
preconceived
policing
programs
they
must
have
the
political
power
to
hold
police
accountable
for
community
policing
mechanisms
to
offer
potential
for
real
change
to
marginalized
communities
communities
must
build
capacity
and
political
power
to
demand
accountability
so
while
we
might
advocate
for
law
enforcement
to
engage
marginalized
communities
we
cannot
rely
on
law
enforcement
initiatives
to
recalibrate
relationships
long
rife
with
deep
inequality
the
pressure
for
meaningful
change
must
come
from
outside
from
the
communities
themselves
organizing
for
change

n
it
could
be
argued
that
the
relative
lack
of
details
on
these
community
engagement
programs
undermines
the
possibility
of
stigma
attaching
to
muslim
communities
that
raises
the
question
of
how
much
and
what
kind
of
detail
about
these
programs
translates
into
stigmatization
separate
and
apart
from
what
is
reported
and
what
the
public
hears
about
stigmatization
occurs
by

of
these
contacts

at
the
request
of
his

officer
tyrone
c
brown
came
to
a
community
auditorium
here
in
june
and
sat
alongside
about
other
mostly
young
black
men
with
criminal
records
men
who
were
being
watched
closely
by
the
police
just
as
he
was
he
expected
to
hear
an
admonition
from
law
enforcement
officials
to
help
end
violence
in
the
community
but
mr
brown
got
more
than
he
had
bargained
for
a
police
captain
presented
a
slide
show
featuring
mug
shots
of
people
they
were
cracking
down
on
up
popped
a
picture
of
mr
brown
linking
him
to
a
criminal
group
that
had
been
implicated
in
a
homicide
i
was
disturbed
said
mr
brown
who
acknowledges
having
been
involved
in
crime
but
denied
that
he
had
ever
been
involved
in
a
killing
that
discomfort
was
just
the
reaction
the
authorities
were
after
mr
brown
whose
criminal
record
includes
drug
and
assault
charges
is
at
the
center
of
an
experiment
taking
place
in
dozens
of
police
departments
across
the
country
one
in
which
the
authorities
have
turned
to
complex
computer
algorithms
to
try
to
pinpoint
the
people
most
likely
to
be
involved
in
future
violent
crimes
as
either
predator
or
prey
the
goal
is
to
do
all
they
can
to
prevent
the
crime
from
happening
the
strategy
known
as
predictive
policing
combines
elements
of
traditional
policing
like
increased
attention
to
crime
hot
spots
and
close
monitoring
of
recent
parolees
but
it
often
also
uses
other
data
including
information
about
friendships
social
media
activity
and
drug
use
to
identify
hot
people
and
aid
the
authorities
in
forecasting
crime
the
program
here
has
been
named
the
kansas
city
no
violence
alliance
or
kc
nova
and
the
message
on
that
june
night
to
mr
brown
and
the
others
was
simple
the
next
time
they
or
anyone
in
their
crews
commit
a
violent
act
the
police
will
come
after
everyone
in
the
group
for
whatever
offense
they
can
make
stick
no
matter
how
petty
such
was
the
case
for
mario
glenn
a
year
old
with
a
criminal
history
that
includes
drug
trafficking
and
assault
after
he
attended
a
program
meeting
called
a
call
in
last
year
he
was
caught
during
a
police
sting
to
take
down
a
group
implicated
in
several
homicides
mr
glenn
robbed
a
confidential
informer
trying
to
buy
a
gun
from
him
the
police
said
he
has
been
convicted
and
prosecutors
are
now
seeking
the
maximum
year
prison
sentence
we
have
a
moral
reason
to
do
a
better
job
at
addressing
violence
in
this
community
said
jean
peters
baker
the
prosecutor
for
jackson
county
which
includes
kansas
city
i
don
t
know
that
this
will
work
but
we
need
to
try
the
use
of
computer
models
by
local
law
enforcement
agencies
to
forecast
crime
is
part
of
a
larger
trend
by
governments
and
corporations
that
are
increasingly
turning
to
predictive
analytics
and
data
mining
in
looking
at
behaviors
typically
financed
by
the
federal
government
the
strategy
is
being
used
by
dozens
of
police
departments
including
los
angeles
miami
and
nashville
and
district
attorneys
offices
in
manhattan
and
philadelphia
at
a
time
when
many
police
departments
are
under
fire
for
aggressive
tactics
particularly
in
minority
neighborhoods
advocates
say
predictive
policing
can
help
improve
police
community
relations
by
focusing
on
the
people
most
likely
to
become
involved
in
violent
crime
civil
liberties
groups
take
a
dim
view
of
the
strategy
questioning
its
legality
and
efficacy
and
asserting
that
it
may
actually
worsen
the
rapport
between
the
police
and
civilians
ezekiel
edwards
the
director
of
the
criminal
law
reform
project
of
the
american
civil
liberties
union
said
predictive
policing
tended
to
legitimize
the
profiling
of
racial
minorities
who
live
in
poor
high
crime
neighborhoods
and
prompted
officers
to
enforce
laws
selectively
our
concern
is
guilt
by
association
mr
edwards
said
because
you
live
in
a
certain
neighborhood
or
hang
out
with
certain
people
we
are
now
going
to
be
suspicious
of
you
and
treat
you
differently
not
because
you
have
committed
a
crime
or
because
we
have
information
that
allows
us
to
arrest
you
but
because
our
predictive
tool
shows
us
you
might
commit
a
crime
at
some
point
in
the
future
but
researchers
working
with
the
police
to
develop
the
predictive
algorithms
say
that
they
can
come
closer
than
traditional
detective
work
to
figuring
out
who
is
most
apt
to
break
the
law
they
say
criminals
commit
violent
crimes
in
fairly
distinctive
patterns
and
often
have
similar
attributes
those
include
previous
arrests
unemployment
an
unstable
home
life
friends
and
relatives
who
have
been
killed
are
in
prison
or
have
gang
ties
and
problems
with
drugs
or
alcohol
in
chicago
the
police
have
developed
a
heat
list
of
people
who
are
considered
far
more
likely
than
the
average
person
to
be
involved
in
violent
crime
factors
in
compiling
that
list
included
their
criminal
records
social
circles
and
gang
connections
also
a
factor
was
whether
they
had
been
victims
of
an
assault
or
a
shooting
these
are
the
people
with
the
highest
propensity
for
violence
in
the
city
of
chicago
said
robert
j
tracy
chief
of
crime
control
strategies
for
the
chicago
police
department
in
the
year
since
its
program
has
been
fully
in
place
kansas
city
has
had
a
significant
decrease
in
homicides
the
city
had
averaged
homicides
a
year
over
a
four
and
a
half
decade
period
through
and
the
number
of
murders
hovered
over
in
the
roughly
five
years
before
nova
s
inception
but
murders
plummeted
to
last
year
a
percent
drop
from
while
assaults
with
guns
also
decreased
last
year
overall
assaults
increased
whether
those
changes
were
linked
to
nova
is
difficult
to
say
because
fluctuations
in
crime
are
almost
always
a
result
of
multiple
factors
at
the
same
time
a
report
released
recently
by
the
university
of
missouri
kansas
city
found
that
while
crime
decreased
drastically
early
last
year
as
nova
was
fully
in
place
the
drop
tapered
off
it
is
too
soon
to
determine
if
decreased
crime
will
be
a
long
term
trend
the
report
said
in
other
places
the
success
of
the
algorithms
has
been
spotty
or
difficult
to
assess
john
s
hollywood
a
senior
operations
researcher
at
the
rand
corporation
said
that
in
the
limited
number
of
studies
undertaken
to
measure
the
efficacy
of
predictive
policing
the
improvement
in
forecasting
crimes
had
been
only
or
percent
better
than
regular
policing
methods
the
memphis
police
force
a
pioneer
in
predictive
policing
has
worked
with
the
university
of
memphis
for
about
a
decade
to
forecast
crime
by
noting
time
and
location
of
episodes
and
information
about
victims
officers
then
flood
those
areas
with
marked
and
undercover
police
cars
and
also
increase
traffic
stops
the
department
said
but
violent
crime
has
proved
stubborn
in
memphis
and
the
city
continues
to
be
one
of
the
most
dangerous
places
in
the
nation
according
to
f
b
i
data
in
kansas
city
nova
officials
gather
about
to
patrol
officers
about
once
a
quarter
to
discuss
and
examine
intelligence
gathered
on
the
street
details
not
necessarily
captured
in
official
documents
the
information
often
comes
from
informal
conversations
that
officers
have
with
people
on
the
street
about
things
like
who
is
arguing
and
who
might
have
committed
a
violent
crime
the
authorities
have
identified
about
people
who
belong
to
criminal
groups
in
the
city
said
maj
joe
mchale
the
project
leader
for
nova
who
also
commands
the
police
department
s
violent
crime
division
and
there
are
about
people
whom
the
authorities
consider
central
figures
in
those
groups
he
said
the
kansas
city
authorities
say
they
hope
that
if
their
zero
tolerance
for
violence
message
gets
through
to
these
influential
figures
it
will
be
passed
on
to
others
who
listen
to
them
one
of
those
powerful
individuals
according
to
the
police
was
mr
brown
who
said
he
began
selling
drugs
at
because
he
was
raised
in
poverty
by
a
crack
addicted
single
mother
when
he
was
first
drawn
into
the
program
said
mr
brown
who
most
recently
served
jail
time
for
robbery
his
probation
officer
told
him
he
had
to
go
to
the
june
meeting
which
is
known
as
a
call
in
call
ins
are
central
to
the
program
the
authorities
invite
about
of
the
group
leaders
they
have
identified
to
usually
show
up
to
hear
from
a
range
of
officials
including
the
local
and
federal
prosecutors
the
police
chief
and
the
mayor
during
an
august
call
in
the
speakers
told
the
men
that
this
was
their
last
chance
tammy
dickinson
the
united
states
attorney
for
the
western
district
of
missouri
related
the
story
of
a
man
in
the
program
who
was
given
a
year
prison
sentence
for
being
caught
with
a
bullet
in
his
pocket
another
man
she
said
got
years
for
having
recreational
designer
drugs
known
as
bath
salts
and
posting
a
photograph
of
himself
with
a
gun
on
facebook
a
week
after
the
june
call
in
a
social
worker
called
mr
brown
into
a
meeting
he
said
his
heart
was
thumping
when
he
entered
the
room
and
saw
several
police
officers
waiting
for
him
we
know
that
you
are
the
head
of
this
and
of
that
mr
brown
recalled
the
officers
telling
him
if
we
can
change
you
you
can
change
them
people
who
have
gotten
in
trouble
with
the
law
often
think
they
can
keep
getting
away
with
minor
offenses
without
serious
consequences
said
mr
brown
whose
nickname
bird
slang
for
a
brick
of
cocaine
came
from
his
drug
dealing
but
what
resonated
with
him
he
said
was
the
nova
team
saying
that
harsh
penalties
will
be
imposed
for
even
petty
slights
once
warnings
have
been
given
mr
brown
has
come
to
see
some
benefit
in
the
program
nova
officials
have
helped
him
find
housing
he
said
and
pushed
him
to
get
a
job
he
now
works
as
a
delivery
driver
for
back
porch
bar
b
q
the
authorities
connected
him
with

to
help
him

he
has
four
children
ranging
from
months
to
years
and
he
works
with
young
people
to
help
keep
them
out
of
trouble
still
mr
brown
is
hardly

the
clear
domestic
assault
charges
are
pending
against
him
after
his
girlfriend
accused
him
of
choking
her
and
hitting

head
against

door
last

a
handful
of
shoddily
written
emails
spread
shock
waves
across
the
us
last
week
the
threats
were
familiar
warning
of
gunfire
backpack
bombs
and
mayhem
in
new
york
and
los
angeles
schools
sent
at
am
est
the
messages
were
routed
electronically
through
germany
though
the
author
s
whereabouts
are
still
unknown
the
two
cities
responded
in
dramatically
opposing
fashion
the
los
angeles
unified
school
district
shut
down
more
than
facilities
preventing
over
children
from
attending
class
officials
searched
buildings
and
police
patrols
were
expanded
throughout
the
week
the
price
tag
was
estimated
at
m
but
could
cost
much
more
new
york
on
the
other
hand
swiftly
dismissed
the
threats
as
a
hoax
their
assessment
was
made
possible
by
the
city
s
massive
investments
in
counter
terrorism
capabilities
following
the
tough
talking
chief
of
police
william
bratton
suggested
the
sender
had
indulged
in
too
many
episodes
of
homeland
though
called
out
by
new
york
s
mayor
for
overreacting
la
can
hardly
be
faulted
for
taking
the
terrorist
threat
seriously
it
came
on
the
heels
of
this
month
s
massacre
of
people
in
san
bernardino
less
than
miles
from
la
and
counter
terrorism
experts
have
been
expecting
attacks
for
months
the
goal
is
to
shut
cities
down
separate
people
from
one
another
and
push
them
into
mental
fortresses
david
kilcullen
nevertheless
the
jittery
reaction
seemed
to
reveal
a
chink
in
our
cities
armour
a
vulnerability
not
just
to
terror
attacks
but
to
the
mere
threat
of
such
attacks
post
paris
the
sense
of
unease
is
pervasive
us
homeland
security
regularly
issues
alerts
including
last
week
s
warning
of
self
radicalised
actors
who
could
strike
with
little
or
no
notice
that
come
without
any
specific
information
there
are
dozens
of
warnings
a
day
law
enforcement
agencies
are
bogged
down
and
the
probability
of
actual
attacks
seems
to
be
growing
which
means
that
pranksters
or
not
terrorists
are
inflicting
real
costs
both
in
terms
of
life
and
money
on
our
cities
which
is
of
course
the
point
in
other
words
our
increasingly
panicky
reaction
to
terror
threats
mean
you
can
inflict
a
degree
of
damage
on
a
city
at
the
click
of
a
mouse
it
s
no
surprise
then
that
there
has
been
a
increase
in
the
number
of
threats
to
us
schools
in
more
than
a
third
of
these
were
sent
electronically
many
resulted
in
evacuations
and
shutdowns
the
goal
is
to
shut
cities
down
for
as
long
as
possible
separate
people
from
one
another
break
down
communities
and
push
them
into
mental
fortresses
says
counter
insurgency
specialist
david
kilcullen
he
believes
that
cities
themselves
are
under
assault
precisely
because
they
are
the
places
that
different
communities
come
together
and
the
result
of
the
assault
is
that
different
ethnic
and
religious
communities
stop
trusting
one
another
and
become
more
susceptible
to
exploitation
terror
in
cities
is
nothing
new
of
course
la
was
rocked
by
home
made
bombs
in
and
parts
of
wall
street
were
decimated
by
a
wagonful
of
explosives
in
the
single
deadliest
act
of
domestic
terrorism
in
us
history
occurred
in
oklahoma
in
and
with
the
exception
of
violent
attacks
in
the
us
are
almost
all
homegrown
european
cities
are
even
more
accustomed
to
it
well
before
al
qaida
and
isis
the
people
of
london
madrid
and
rome
were
battered
respectively
by
the
ira
eta
and
anni
di
piomi
there
were
more
than
terrorist
attacks
in
europe
over
the
past
years
according
to
the
university
of
maryland
s
global
terrorism
database
most
of
them
during
the
s
and
s
moreover
it
is
easy
for
westerners
to
forget
that
the
vast
majority
of
terrorist
actions
occur
elsewhere
a
recent
study
of
more
than
cities
ranked
baghdad
mosul
and
ramadi
as
the
most
terrorism
prone
it
also
showed
that
cities
in
afghanistan
egypt
libya
nigeria
pakistan
and
somalia
are
far
more
vulnerable
to
devastating
violence
than
those
in
the
uk
france
or
us
from
there
were
terrorist
related
deaths
in
all
western
countries
combined
in
iraq
there
were
in
alone
what
can
the
worst
hit
cities
teach
the
rest
about
how
to
respond
unfortunately
not
much
there
is
no
one
size
fits
all
response
to
urban
terrorism
preventing
attacks
by
lone
wolves
or
sleeper
cells
in
america
requires
a
very
different
set
of
tactics
than
countering
sophisticated
networks
of
highly
trained
operatives
in
an
active
war
zone
such
as
yemen
where
terrorists
are
more
like
guerrillas
with
highly
elaborate
operations
and
weaponry
nevertheless
cities
aren
t
passive
for
example
many
are
installing
extra
layers
of
police
surveillance
in
crowded
spaces
and
re
routing
traffic
away
from
critical
infrastructure
others
are
adding
unobtrusive
adaptations
and
reinforcements
to
city
landscapes
to
reduce
blast
exposure
installing
physical
barriers
around
government
offices
and
major
businesses
and
hiring
counter
terrorism
advisers
positive
police
community
relations
are
also
widely
acknowledged
as
an
essential
feature
of
counter
terrorism
strategy
the
goal
of
all
this
is
to
minimise
risk
without
choking
city
life
altogether
as
the
saying
has
it
that
s
when
the
terrorists
win
in
the
meantime
technology
firms
are
lining
up
from
baghdad
to
boston
to
equip
city
authorities
with
the
software
and
skills
to
disrupt
terrorism
today
there
are
more
than
data
fusion
centres
in
major
us
cities
which
share
information
between
federal
state
and
municipal
agencies
it
is
increasingly
routine
to
use
crime
forecasting
programmes
the
los
angeles
police
department
has
itself
used
predictive
policing
algorithms
since
and
is
reportedly
mapping
historical
crime
trends
to
predict
future
incidents
not
without
some
controversy
new
york
too
launched
a
controversial
cyber
intelligence
unit
that
taps
into
conversations
of
potential
jihadi
recruits
and
advanced
electronic
surveillance
systems
are
commonplace
from
city
air
terminals
to
city
streets
civil
liberty
specialists
are
fearful
that
these
measures
confuse
lines
of
authority
undermine
privacy
legislation
and
militarise
law
enforcement
the
real
question
is
how
to
make
a
society
more
resilient
in
a
way
that
does
not
destroy
the
very
way
of
life
in
the
city
says
kilcullen
after
the
paris
killings
french
security
agencies
clamoured
for
more
power
leading
to
a
backlash
from
citizens
who
were
unwilling
to
let
terrorism
restrict
their
freedoms
so
how
does
a
city
judge
how
seriously
to
take
a
threat
why
did
la
shut
down
while
new
york
shrugged
the
short
answer
is
that
judging
a
threat
is
very
difficult
each
threat
needs
to
be
surfaced
and
addressed
in
the
context
of
the
public
safety
officials
existing
programmes
says
gary
margolis
ceo
of
social
sentinel
a
threat
awareness
group
focused
on
schools
alert
services
can
augment
the
existing
safety
and
security
plans
within
schools
municipalities
and
those
responsible
for
protecting
critical
infrastructure
by
alert
services
he
means
a
new
generation
of
social
media
monitoring
systems
the
tracking
of
millions
of
facebook
twitter
and
instagram
feeds
to
detect
would
be
perpetrators
who
telegraph
their
intentions
but
the
fact
is
that
there
are
limitations
to
what
physical
policing
and
technological
enhancements
in
cities
can
achieve
not
every
bit
of
critical
infrastructure
can
be
made
blast
proof
cctv
cameras
may
help
with
investigations
but
likely
won
t
prevent
new
attacks
although
french
railway
authorities
are
planning
to
roll
out
up
to
new
security
cameras
that
can
monitor
excessive
body
temperature
and
signs
of
anxiety
in
the
somewhat
orwellian
hopes
of
identifying
thought
crimes
before
anyone
gets
killed
in
truth
there
are
not
many
examples
of
cities
getting
it
right
in
baghdad
they
ve
essentially
resorted
to
the
urban
tourniquet
of
gated
communities
in
tel
aviv
the
locals
are
simply
getting
used
to
a
heightened
threat

are

the

said
we

technology
should
be

not
a

he
said
i
think
technology
as
a

are
good
for

he
said
adding
that

as
a

for
our

when
i
saw
this
opportunity
i
could
not
pass
up
the
chance
to
be
part
of
the
process
reynoso
said
there
s
something
different
about
this
department
he
said
it
really
is
a
family
atmosphere
el
monte
at
a
time
when
police
agencies
throughout
the
nation
are
under
heightened
scrutiny
el
monte
s
new
police
chief
david
reynoso
says
ethical
policing
and
community
relations
are
the
keys
to
fostering
trust
in
law
enforcement
a
positive
relationship
between
police
officials
and
the
communities
they
serve
is
not
automatic
said
reynoso
who
was
sworn
in
as
el
monte
s
top
cop
last
week
the
public
expects
a
lot
from
us
they
trust
us
and
we
have
to
earn
the
public
s
trust
he
said
and
building
relationships
between
police
and
the
community
will
be
reynoso
s
primary
focus
as
he
leads
the
department
s
officers
he
said
video
chief
reynoso
on
how
he
came
to
be
el
monte
s
new
police
chief
i
want
to
continue
to
build
the
trust
that
s
already
established
in
the
community
reynoso
said
we
need
them
as
our
eyes
and
ears
out
in
the
community
and
the
key
to
fostering
community
relationships
is
essentially
simple
he
said
treat
people
in
a
fair
and
respectful
manner
at
all
times
el
monte
mayor
andre
quintero
agreed
with
reynoso
s
community
policing
based
approach
a
police
department
is
only
as
successful
as
the
relationships
it
has
with
the
community
the
people
need
to
feel
comfortable
that
they
re
there
to
protect
and
serve
everybody
he
said
the
mayor
described
reynoso
s
appointment
as
historic
as
he
is
the
first
chief
selected
from
outside
of
the
department
s
ranks
reynoso
joins
the
department
after
years
as
a
baldwin
park
police
captain
as
high
profile
and
increasingly
commonly
caught
on
camera
police
shootings
and
incidents
bring
a
heightened
public
scrutiny
of
law
enforcement
officials
the
longtime
police
veteran
said
his
approach
to
police
work
hasn
t
changed
i
want
what
all
chiefs
want
and
that
is
for
their
personnel
to
lend
themselves
toward
ethical
constitutional
based
policing
whether
they
are
on
camera
or
not
the
chief
said
we
expect
our
officers
to
conduct
themselves
in
a
professional
manner
regardless
of
being
videotaped
technology
should
be
viewed
as
a
resource
for
police
not
a
challenge
he
said
i
think
technology
as
a
whole
to
include
body
cams
and
dash
cams
are
good
for
police
work
he
said
adding
that
they
preserve
a
record
of
what
took
place
and
the
footage
can
be
a
valuable
training
tool
the
el
monte
police
department
does
not
currently
outfit
its
officers
with
body
cameras
reynoso
said
he
hopes
to
add
six
additional
officers
in
the
near
future
to
bring
the
el
department
to
full
force
what
we
are
looking
for
in
a
police
recruit
is
a
good
smart
ethical
person
because
smart
ethical
people
become
smart
ethical
police
officers
reynoso
said
reynoso
said
he
was
also
excited
about
a
new
piece
of
predictive

technology
just
now
being
implemented

instead

the

it
seems
at
first
and
is
already
being
tried
out
in
many
important
cities
including
new

los

officers
associated
with
the

say
the

compare
it
with

a

been
floated
for

a
senior

told
toi
the

can
help
pre

for
example
a
violent
clash
between
two
gangs
it
can
identify
individuals
who
are
likely
to
join

take
to

in
an

based
on
the
analyses
of
their
behaviour
and
network
those
out
on
bail
or
parole
are
most
likely
to
commit
crimes
it
can
also
curb
domestic
violence
by
identifying
a
pattern
and
predicting
the
next
attack
the
officer
said
it
all
boils
down
to
spotting
patterns
in
mountains
of

using
tremendous
computing
power
investigators
should
be
able
to
perform

general
analysis
of

then
there
will
be
a

will
spot
common
indicators
of
a
crime
by
establishing
association
groups
of
events
that
regularly
occur
together
a
police
document
about
the
plan
states
using
neighbourhood
analysis
police
will
be
able
to
understand
crime
events
and
the
circumstances
behind
them
in
a
small
area
as
all
the
crime
activity
in

will
be

an

them
classification
will
be
done
through

and
the
modus

another

will
provide

text
introduction
police
in
major
metropolitan
areas
now
use
predictive
policing
technologies
to
identify
and
deter
crime
n
based
on
algorithmic
forecasts
from
past
crime
patterns
and
individual
criminal
risk
factors
police
claim
to
be
able
to
identify
places
and
persons
more
likely
to
be
involved
in
criminal
activity
n
this
data
driven
approach
impacts
police
patrols
investigations
and
public
health
like
strategies
to
disrupt
and
monitor
forecasted
criminal
activity
n
the
early
success
of
predictive
policing
has
led
a
few
prosecutors
offices
to
adopt
quasi
predictive
prosecution
strategies
n
predictive
prosecution
involves
identifying
and
targeting
suspects
deemed
more
at
risk
for
future
serious
criminal
activity
and
then
using
that
information
to
shape
bail
requests
charging
decisions
and
sentencing
arguments
n
the
potential
problem
however
is
that
the
data
used
to
inform
predictive
prosecution
strategies
may
be
subject
to
the
same
vulnerabilities
currently
limiting
predictive
policing
n
data
can
be
bad
biased
or
based
on
erroneous
correlations
n
data
driven
justice
challenges
values
of
transparency
accountability
and
autonomy
n
and
while
these
problems
matter
when
it
comes
to
questions
of
where
to
send
a
patrol
car
or
even
whom
to
investigate
they
matter
much
more
when
data
directly
impacts
a
prosecutor
s
decision
about
individual
liberty
fortunately
prosecutors
more
so
than
police
may
have
the
institutional
capacity
and
power
to
ensure
an
equitable
and
accountable
use
of
predictive
technologies
prosecutors
due
to
their
ethic
to
do
justice
n
may
be
in
a
better
position
to
ensure
that
issues
of
accuracy
transparency
validity
error
and
exculpatory
information
are
addressed
before
widespread
adoption
prosecutors
may
be
able
to
capitalize
on
the
innovation
of
predictive
analytics
and
promote
stronger
accountability
mechanisms
that
could
benefit
the
entire
criminal
justice
system
n
this
essay
sets
out
the
preliminary
questions
that
prosecutors
should
ask
before
adopting
any
type
of
quasi
predictive
prosecution
system
part
i
provides
a
brief
overview
of
the
growth
of
predictive
policing
and
its
evolution
into
predictive
prosecution
while
still
an
experimental
concept
certain
predictive
policing
techniques
rely
on
prosecutorial
involvement
and
action
primary
attention
will
focus
on
two
examples
of
predictive
policing
prosecution
in
chicago
illinois
and
manhattan
in
new
york
n
the
chicago
police
department
in
conjunction
with
sociologists
computer
scientists
and
social
workers
has
developed
innovative
strategies
to
identify
individuals
most
likely
to
be
victims
of
gun
violence
or
perpetrators
of
gun
violence
n
once
identified
public
health
like
intervention
strategies
are
used
to
contact
and
monitor
those
targeted
suspects
n
prosecutors
warn
targeted
suspects
of
potential
consequences
of
future
criminal
action
and
then
enforce
those
warnings
through
enhanced
bail
charging
and
sentencing
decisions
n
in
new
york
city
manhattan
district
attorney
cyrus
vance
jr
created
the
crime
strategies
unit
to
link
and
organize
previously
disparate
prosecutorial
databases
into
a
central
nervous
system
n
of
information
about
suspected
criminal
actors
n
under
this
moneyball
prosecution
system
police
and
prosecutors
have
targeted
approximately
nine
thousand
suspects
for
investigation
and
prosecution
n
similar
to
the
chicago
model
prosecutors
shape
bail
charging
and
sentencing
decisions
based
on
the
information
provided
n
part
ii
looks
at
the
promise
and
perils
of
predictive
prosecution
this
part
examines
three
big
questions
about
how
predictive
prosecution
might
impact
prosecutorial
decision
making
prosecutorial
role
and
crime
suppression
priorities
from
one
angle
predictive
prosecution
merely
strengthens
the
type
of
predictions
and
risk
assessments
already
employed
across
the
criminal
justice
system
but
with
more
extensive
information
sharing
capabilities
n
from
another
angle
predictive
prosecution
might
be
seen
as
a
repackaging
of
the
longstanding
focused
deterrence
theories
used
in
some
jurisdictions
n
however
whether
revolutionary
or
merely
evolutionary
a
risk
assessment
public
health
model
of
prosecution
may
have
unintended
consequences
if
sentencing
decisions
are
ratcheted
up
because
a
suspect
was
placed
on
a
target
list
then
prosecutors
better
be
sure
that
the
list
is
an
accurate
and
valid
basis
for
a
sentencing
enhancement
correlation
should
not
replace
causation
when
it
comes
to
actual
liberty
deprivations
further
if
police
officers
link
their
databases
with
prosecutors
offices
then
prosecutors
must
take
ownership
of
the
quality
and
accuracy
of
that
information
this
part
also
looks
at
the
legal
obligations
of
prosecutors
relying
on
predictive
systems
while
generally
consistent
with
ethical
duties
and
within
the
broad
grant
of
prosecutorial
discretion
data
driven
predictions
should
not
be
undertaken
without
internal
accountability
mechanisms
to
ensure
the
accuracy
and
validity
of
the
predictions
in
addition
the
growing
web
of
shared
information
may
create
brady
obligations
for
prosecutors
to
turn
over
collectively
available
exculpatory
information
n
part
iii
concludes
by
suggesting
that
prosecutors
may
be
in
the
best
position
to
create
mechanisms
to
ensure
accountability
transparency
and
validity
consistent
with
due
process
and
the
fair
administration
of
justice
satisfactory
answers
to
the
questions
raised
in
part
ii
will
be
the
first
step
in
evaluating
the
usefulness
of
predictive
prosecution
nationally
this
essay
seeks
to
raise
preliminary
questions
about
predictive
prosecution
saving
for
a
future
day
any
empirical
assessment
of
its
costs
benefits
and
promise
in
practice
i
the
influence
of
predictive
policing
on
predictive
prosecution
predictive
prosecution
is
an
outgrowth
of
the
reported
success
of
predictive
policing
n
predictive
policing
involves
the
use
of
data
collection
and
analysis
to
predict
areas
of
crime
and
individuals
involved
in
crime
n
the
generic
term
predictive
policing
encompasses
a
variety
of
different
techniques
proprietary
products
and
tactical
uses
n
predictive
policing
technologies
are
shaping
police
strategies
in
a
diverse
list
of
places
including
major
cities
like
los
angeles
new
york
city
chicago
philadelphia
miami
seattle
kansas
city
and
memphis
and
smaller
cities
like
reading
pennsylvania
and
alhambra
california
n
the
federal
government
has
funded
pilot
programs
n
and
large
and
small
companies
are
competing
for
city
contracts
n
this
section
briefly
details
the
history
of
predictive
policing
with
a
focus
on
why
the
purported
success
of
the
technology
might
be
appealing
to
prosecutors
in
three
previous
articles
i
have
described
the
full
history
of
predictive
policing
n
this
section
merely
sets
the
stage
for
a
discussion
of
how
predictive
policing
might
impact
predictive
prosecution
a
a
brief
history
of
place
based
predictive
policing
the
national
emergence
of
predictive
policing
can
be
traced
to
chief
william
bratton
s
appointment
as
chief
of
police
of
the
los
angeles
police
department
lapd
n
while
the
idea
had
been
percolating
before
that
moment
n
bratton
promoted
the
idea
in
public
forums
and
national
media
appearances
n
bratton
had
been
a
long
time
believer
in
data
driven
policing
having
restructured
the
new
york
police
department
based
on
data
driven
accountability
metrics
n
he
brought
his
faith
in
data
driven
policing
to
the
west
coast
and
eventually
partnered
with
a
group
of
academics
who
had
developed
algorithms
to
predict
future
crimes
n
the
algorithmic
approach
to
crime
prediction
was
based
on
decades
of
social
science
research
showing
that
certain
property
crimes
encouraged
similar
crimes
in
a
predictable
manner
n
a
burglary
in
one
neighborhood
might
encourage
additional
burglaries
in
that
same
neighborhood
n
an
auto
theft
at
a
particular
time
in
one
area
might
suggest
future
thefts
in
the
same
area
n
the
reasons
for
such
a
near
repeat
phenomenon

have
been
debated
but
the
correlation
of
additional

around
the
same
area
has
been
regularly
demonstrated

off
this
insight
and
adding

and

mapping
n
academic
researchers
developed
place
based
predictive
software
to
predict
certain
property
crimes
n
in
practice
police
officers
might
be
told
to
focus
attention
on
particular
geographic
areas
usually
block
sized
five
hundred
by
five
hundred
foot
areas
and
told
to
patrol
those
designated
areas
during
the
free
times
in
their
shifts
n
the
areas
would
change
daily
depending
on
crime
data
n
the
presence
of
additional
police
in
targeted
areas
was
meant
to
deter
criminal
activity
n
initial
results
showed
a
reduction
in
property
crime
although
longer
term
trends
remain
unclear
n
criticisms
have
also
been
leveled
that
certain
crime
reduction
claims
cannot
be
substantiated
n
these
initial
pilot
projects
eventually
developed
into
a
commercial
business
to
sell
the
predictive
software
the
company
predpol
began
marketing
its
services
to
local
police
forces
n
santa
cruz
california
became
an
early
adopter
and
demonstrated
impressive
initial
results
n
national
press
about
predictive
policing
fueled
interest
from
other
cities
n
and
predpol
soon
boasted
a
national
roster
of
large
and
mid
size
cities
as
customers
n
other
companies
and
technologies
joined
the
quest
to
be
able
to
predict
place
based
property
crime
and
then
violent
crime
n
researchers
at
rutgers
camden
developed
risk
terrain
modeling
rtm
n
which
looks
at
environmental
factors
such
as
bars
liquor
stores
bus
routes
and
other
urban
fixtures
to
map
crime
n
in
a
recent
national
study
rtm
demonstrated
significant
crime
reduction
across
several
jurisdictions
n
hunchlab
combines
the
crime
data
focus
of
predpol
and
the
environmental
focus
of
rtm
and
has
developed
its
own
proprietary
software
for
prediction
based
on
machine
learning
technologies
n
currently
more
than
half
a
dozen
predictive
policing
companies
including
large
corporations
like
ibm
hitachi
and
motorola
are
competing
for
business
n
these
first
predictive
technologies
have
different
names
and
different
theories
but
share
five
commonalities
the
technology
involves
crime
data
time
location
an
algorithm
and
a
theory
about
why
a
particular
area
has
a
heightened
likelihood
of
criminal
activity
n
place
based
algorithms
have
been
used
to
target
property
crimes
and
violent
crimes
n
many
questions
still
remain
about
the
application
effectiveness
and
promise
of
the
technology
but
as
commissioner
bratton
stated
in
predictive
policing
used
to
be
the
future
and
now
it
is
the
present
n
b
the
development
of
person
based
prediction
person
based
approaches
to
crime
arose
independently
of
predictive
policing
at
least
as
defined
by
predpol
rtm
or
hunchlab
and
were
largely
based
on
a
public
health
model
of
targeting
crime
n
for
decades
sociologists
identified
the
reality
that
a
small
subset
of
individuals
in
any
community
committed
the
vast
majority
of
crimes
n
police
recognized
that
targeting
those
individuals
could
result
in
a
disproportionate
reduction
of
crime
rates
n
for
violent
crimes
researchers
studied
shooting
victims
and
by
tracking
their
social
networks
could
identify
likely
future
victims
or
criminal
actors
n
the
theory
behind
this
approach
was
that
most
shootings
involve
a
social
network
of
retaliation
between
rival
groups
such
as
gangs
neighborhood
crews
and
drug
dealers
who
respond
in
relatively
predictable
ways
n
a
shooting
of
a
gang
member
would
lead
to
a
retaliatory
act
that
act
in
turn
would
continue
the
cycle
of
violence
professor
david
kennedy
demonstrated
that
by
targeting
youth
violence
through
a
public
health
model
police
could
dramatically
curtail
shootings
n
andrew
papachristos
anthony
braga
and
david
hureau
investigated
similar
social
network
intervention
strategies
between
rival
gangs
n
other
scholars
have
investigated
this
same
social
network
phenomenon
n
despite
arising
from
a
different
context
the
social
network
model
has
largely
been
subsumed
into
the
greater
predictive
policing
discussion
because
media
stories
described
person
based
predictive
techniques
under
the
larger
rubric
of
predictive
policing
and
because
police
administrators
benefited
from
the
good
will
i
e
good
press
of
predictive
policing
n
this
essay
continues
that
blurring
of
predictive
methodologies
but
it
recognizes
that
person
based
prediction
presents
different
issues
than
place
based
prediction
in
terms
of
liberty
autonomy
and
due
process
the
best
known
person
based
predictive
policing
system
involves
the
chicago
police
department
the
chicago
police
department
developed
a
data
driven
process
to
identify
the
most
likely
offenders
of
violent
crime
n
entitled
the
heat
list
the
concept
is
to
identify
young
people
who
might
engage
in
violence
or
be
victims
of
violence
and
intervene
before
the
violence
occurs
n
this
identification
is
conducted
by
police
officers
called
district
intelligence
officers
who
evaluate
past
criminal
activity
whether
the
target
has
been
identified
as
part
of
a
gang
audit
n
and
whether
the
target
has
been
placed
on
the
strategic
subjects

special
order

the
strategic
subjects
list
ssl
is
a
rank
order
list
of
potential
victims
and
subjects
with
the
greatest
propensity
for
violence
the
ssl
model
looks
at
individuals
with
criminal
records
who
are
ranked
according
to
their
probability
of
being
involved
in
a
shooting
or
murder
either
as
a
victim
or
an
offender
known
as
a
party
to

ptv
the
software

based
on
empirical
data
that
lists
attributes
of
a
person
s
criminal
record
including
the
record
of

associates
the
degree
to
which
his
criminal
activities

a
team
of
police
officers
social
workers

leaders
conduct
a
custom

the

the
individual

the
criminal
justice
system
as
well
as
potential
future
consequences
for
any
continued
criminal
activity
n
these
custom
notification
meetings
usually
involve
home
visits
n
essentially
the
young
person
is
offered
a
choice
take
advantage
of
social
services
to
prevent
involvement
in
future
violence
or
face
additional
law
enforcement
surveillance
and
perhaps
punitive
consequences
n
currently
the
chicago
police
department
includes
over
names
on
its
heat
list
n
this
suspect
and
social
network
focused
approach
to
policing
has
under
different
names
and
different
programs
been
adopted
in
kansas
city
boston
new
orleans
los
angeles
and
other
cities
n
juvenile
courts
have
also
begun
to
consider
implementing
similar
identification
processes
for
troubled
youth
n
the
open
question
however
is
how
the
algorithm
scores
the
criminal
record
connections
with
associates
and
intensity
of
criminal
history
among
other
considerations
with
few
exceptions
the
types
of
identification
mechanisms
have
not
been
validated
through
scientific
methods
n
c
early
predictive
prosecution
models
the
efficacy
of
predictive
policing
remains
both
alluring
and
unproven
significant
research
studies
have
yet
to
be
conducted
in
any
systemic
way
n
questions
remain
as
crime
rates
have
fluctuated
in
cities
using
the
technologies
n
yet
despite
the
unknowns
prosecutor
offices
have
embraced
the
insight
that
predictive
analytics
and
information
sharing
can
identify
risk
factors
in
a
community
and
improve
the
prosecutorial
function
n
the
same
broad
tactical
shift
toward
proactive
law
enforcement
has
thus
begun
influencing
proactive
prosecutorial
strategies
as
the
former
head
of
the
manhattan
criminal
strategies
unit
stated
the
change
is
as
much
one
of
philosophy
as
technology
n
the
goal
is
to
focus
on
crime
not
cases
intelligence
driven
prosecutions
seek
to
take
already
existing
information
in
prosecution
offices
organize
it
manage
it
and
deploy
it
to
target
those
most
at
risk
of
driving
crime
in
a
community
n
while
still
in
the
very
early
stages
two
distinct
predictive
prosecution
models
have
been
developed
here
i
describe
them
as
the
enforcer
model
and
the
investigator
model
neither
to
be
clear
involves
pure
algorithmic
or
machine
predictions
just
as
predictive
policing
is
more
of
a
risk
identification
tool
than
a
predictive
guess
so
too
predictive
prosecution
seeks
to
proactively
identify
risk
factors
areas
and
suspects
in
a
community
and
direct
attention
to
those
problems
predictive
prosecution
involves
data
driven
information
sharing
innovations
but
not
pure
algorithmic
judgments
about
places
or
people
as
will
be
discussed
some
blending
of
predictive
policing
techniques
and
predictive
prosecution
techniques
may
occur
in
the
future
but
currently
the
prosecution
side
has
relied
on
more
human
rather
than
algorithmic
predictions
enforcer
model
the
enforcer
model
arises
from
person
based
predictive
policing
strategies
in
this
model
prosecutors
play
a
role
of
enforcing
warnings
made
to
those
predicted
to
be
involved
in
criminal
activity
especially
violence
in
some
cases
this
prosecutorial
enforcement
might
be
indirect
but
in
other
cases
the
prosecutors
might
directly
and
personally
provide
verbal
notice
of
harsher
enforcement
penalties
for
example
the
special
order
detailing
the
process
of
custom
notification
in
chicago
makes
explicit
reference
to
prosecutorial
involvement
n
the
special
order
provides
that
when
someone
identified
on
the
heat
list
is
rearrested
the
police
will
recommend
the
highest
possible
charges
to
prosecutors
encourage
community
advocacy
against
bond
release
and
engage
in
direct
coordination
with
state
prosecutors
offices
n
section
v
d
reads
in
full
when
a
recipient
of
the
custom
notification
engages
in
criminal
activity
for
which
he
or
she
is
arrested
the
district
commander
will
ensure
notification
to
and
coordination
with
the
appropriate
bureau
of
detectives
area
to
ensure
appropriate
charging
occurs
the
highest
possible
charges
will
be
pursued
for
any
individual
in
the
vrs
custom
notification
program
court
advocacy
volunteers
are
notified
of
the
date
time
and
place
of
the
bond
hearing
or
other
court
hearings
and
encourage
attendance
at
the
hearing
to
demonstrate
the
community
s
support
in
decreasing
the
violence
coordination
with
the
cook
county
s
state
s
attorney
community
justice
center
unit
as
appropriate
n
prosecutors
are
thus
directly
influenced
by
a
suspect
s
placement
on
the
heat
list
the
custom
notification
letters
themselves
include
a
description
of
both
federal
and
state
sentencing
options
n
demonstrating
how
prosecutorial
decisions
will
be
impacted
by
this
designation
in
fact
in
the
definitions
section
the
custom
notification
letter
is
defined
as
an
information
tool
to
make
suspects
aware
of
enhanced
prosecution
possibilities
the
custom
notification
letter
will
be
used
to
inform
individuals
of
the
arrest
prosecution
and
sentencing
consequences
they
may
face
if
they
choose
to
or
continue
to
engage
in
public
violence
the
letter
will
be
specific
to
the
identified
individual
and
incorporate
those
factors
known
about
the
individual
inclusive
of
prior
arrests
impact
of
known
associates
and
potential
sentencing
outcomes
for
future
criminal
acts
n
the
procedures
and
policy
behind
custom
notification
thus
encourage
prosecutors
to
follow
through
on
the
charging
bond
and
sentencing
warnings
provided
in
the
custom
notification
letters
prosecutors
play
a
more
direct
enforcer
role
in
other
gang
violence
reduction
strategies
n
one
strategy
that
has
been
adopted
by
law
enforcement
is
called
focused
deterrence
n
focused
deterrence
involves
a
targeted
message
to
a
small
percentage
of
the
population
that
prosecutors
police
and
community
members
know
who
is
engaged
in
violence
and
that
they
are
committed
to
stopping
it
n
for
example
chicago
has
developed
a
broad
gang
violence
reduction
strategy
that
identifies
gang
members
through
gang
audits
and
the
ssl
n
identified
targets
are
then
invited
to
call
in
meetings
with
prosecutors
police
and
community
members
for
example
if
a
young
man
is
identified
through
a
gang
audit
the
ssl
or
some
other
targeting
measure
n
and
asked
to
participate
in
a
community
forum
it
is
not
uncommon
for
a
prosecutor
to
be
present
n
these
call
in
meetings
serve
as
a
scared
straight
warning
for
individuals
placed
on
the
heat
list
n
the
prosecutor
symbolically
and
sometimes
literally
describes
the
consequences
for
failing
to
heed
the
warning
to
stay
away
from
crime
as
described
by
andrew
papachristos
and
david
kirk
a
federal
partner
typically
from
the
u
s
attorney
s
office
explains
how
federal
statutes
might
be
leveraged
against
the
faction
including
continued
criminal
enterprise
and
armed
career
criminal
statutes
the
point
of
this
message
stresses
the
deterrent
aspect
of
the
program
representatives
from
local
police
and
prosecutors
provide
examples
of
recent
cases
and
shootings
to
underscore
the
reach
of
the
current
violence
and
how
they
are
working
in
a
coordinated
fashion
with
others
in
the
room
n
the
message
is
made
clear
by
prosecutors
if
you
violate
the
law
again
you
will
be
punished
harder
because
you
have
been
warned
one
u
s
attorney
referenced
a
fifteen
year
sentence
for
a
single
bullet
for
someone
who
had
not
heeded
the
warnings
n
the
point
was
made
clear
that
those
predicted
to
be
at
higher
risk
for
crime
had
better
turn
their
lives
around
or
face
additional
sanction
by
prosecuting
authorities
n
as
described
above
prosecutors
as
enforcers
for
predictive
policing
techniques
remain
in
a
fairly
typical
prosecutorial
role
with
one
exception
the
enforcement
threats
are
influenced
by
predictive
data
clearly
prosecutors
have
long
held
community
meetings
prosecutors
have
long
held
scared
straight
talks
in
community
forums
n
prosecutors
have
long
stood
arm
in
arm
with
police
to
send
a
message
that
criminality
will
not
be
tolerated
the
difference
here
is
that
the
targets
of
the
community
forum
and
thus
the
subjects
of
harsher
punishment
were
originally
identified
by
predictive
policing
techniques
and
other
data
driven
mechanisms
if
those
algorithmic
or
social
network
correlations
are
in
error
then
the
subsequent
harsher
punishment
may
be
unjustified
evidence
is
very
clear
that
arrest
records
are
filled
with
mistakes
n
similar
problems
exist
with
gang
databases
n
and
offender
registries
n
if
those
heat
lists
are
found
to
be
flawed
then
not
only
police
surveillance
but
prosecutorial
judgment
becomes
distorted
the
chicago
tribune
interviewed
a
young
man
robert
mcdaniel
whose
name
appeared
on
the
heat
list
because
a
friend
of
his
had
been
shot
n
mr
mcdaniel
s
prior
record
consisted
of
a
single
misdemeanor
conviction
and
a
few
minor
arrests
n
but
by
being
placed
on
the
list
mr
mcdaniel
was
now
associated
with
the
worst
of
the
worst
an
enhanced
sentence
predicated
in
part
on
a
connection
to
a
heat
list
that
later
turns
out
to
be
unwarranted
would
be
a
real
unfairness
to
someone
like
mr
mcdaniel
if
the
prosecutor
does
not
take
on
an
independent
duty
to
double
check
the
data
then
the
harm
from
such
a
prediction
could
be
significant
n
prosecutors
who
are
enforcing
predictive
policing
or
social
network
models
depend
on
the
accuracy
of
those
models
for
guidance
as
will
be
discussed
in
part
ii
this
enforcement
role
offers
benefits
and
risks
in
its
real
world
application
investigator
model
the
investigator
model
of
predictive
prosecution
involves
a
more
organic
prosecutor
led
information
sharing
system
such
a
system
like
the
crime
strategies
units
being
developed
in
manhattan
san
francisco
philadelphia
and
baton
rouge
n
is
data
driven
and
targets
identifiable
criminal
actors
n
these
systems
are
not
based
on
algorithmic
judgments
but
on
data
of
actual
crime
patterns
in
a
city
n
using
data
prosecutors
identify
geographic
areas
of
concern
based
on
reported
shootings
thefts
or
particular
types
of
crime
n
suspects
are
identified
as
being
engaged
in
violence
or
gang
activity
based
on
past
criminal
activity
n
these
individuals
are
monitored
through
social
media
and
traditional
law
enforcement
surveillance
n
the
predicted
targets
are
then
prosecuted
using
available
prosecutorial
leverage
to
extract
enhanced
pleas
or
sentences
from
those
identified
n
in
general
this
type
of
intelligence
driven
prosecution
involves
five
modifications
from
the
traditional
police
prosecutor
relationship
first
prosecutors
identify
geographical
areas
of
concern
based
on
reported
crime
patterns
in
a
city
n
the
focus
is
again
on
crime
not
cases
meaning
even
unsolved
crimes
also
capture
the
attention
of
prosecutors
second
prosecutors
identify
individuals
who
are
considered
the
crime
drivers
in
a
community
and
include
them
in
an
arrest
alert
system
n
these
individuals
become
the
primary
targets
of
prosecution
under
the
theory
that
by
removing
these
violent
actors
overall
violence
levels
will
fall
n
as
will
be
discussed
the
arrest
alert
system
triggers
heightened
attention
for
a
prosecutor
to
incapacitate
these
predicted
bad
actors
through
existing
legal
mechanisms
third
less
traditional
data
points
enter
into
the
calculation
of
whom
to
target
social
media
posts
a
past
lack
of
cooperation
with
police
status
as
a
victim
of
violence
and
other
less
formal
bits
of
information
are
included
in
the
risk
assessments
of
whom
to
target
n
fourth
the
information
sharing
between
police
and
prosecutors
is
prioritized
and
strengthened
n
intelligence
driven
prosecution
is
not
just
about
being
smarter
but
developing
actionable
intelligence
about
crime
patterns
in
an
area
finally
all
of
this
information
about
past
criminal
activities
is
memorialized
in
a
searchable
dataset
for
future
action
n
as
one
example
the
crime
strategies
unit
in
manhattan
has
developed
a
new
information
sharing
system
to
proactively
identify
the
most
wanted
of
new
york
s
criminal
actors
n
these
individuals
have
significant
past
criminal
records
but
the
data
focuses
on
future
criminal
risk
the
logic
being
that
past
instigators
of
criminal
activity
are
at
greater
risk
to
be
the
future
drivers
of
crime
this
database
of
approximately
nine
thousand
names
has
become
critical
to
several
major
prosecutions
n
in
essence
prosecutors
have
predicted
that
incapacitating
these
criminal
actors
will
lead
to
an
overall
reduction
in
crime
as
explained
by
david
o
keefe
the
past
head
of
the
manhattan
district
attorney
s
crime
strategies
unit
csu
working
with
our
partners
in
the
precincts
we
also
identified
hot
spots
and
the
names
of
the
people
committing
the
most
crimes
in
each
area
the
question
became
what
can
we
do
to
incapacitate
these
people
n
this
focus
on
incapacitating
primary
targets
has
significant
practical
effects
on
traditional
prosecution
practices
routinely
now
if
someone
listed
in
the
csu
arrest
alert
system
is
arrested
even
for
a
low
level
offense
the
full
power
of
the
prosecutors
office
is
directed
against
them
n
this
means
that
ordinary
arrests
may
result
in
extraordinary
outcomes
where
those
marked
as
predicted
troublemakers
are
punished
to
the
full
extent
of
the
law
n
the
investigator
model
of
predictive
prosecution
thus
influences
several
aspects
of
the
traditional
prosecution
process
first
the
targeting
system
impacts
bail
decisions
as
prosecutors
might
be
instructed
to
ask
for
higher
bail
for
those
identified
in
the
arrest
alert
system
n
before
the
arrest
occurs
csu
drafts
particularized
bail
applications
on
predicted
individuals
advocating
for
strict
bail
positions
n
second
targeted
individuals
could
face
enhanced
criminal
charges
in
order
to
maximize
prosecutorial
leverage
n
this
means
that
prosecutors
would
be
instructed
to
seek
the
maximum
charges
justified
under
law
n
these
initial
charging
decisions
obviously
impact
later
plea
deals
and
impede
plea
negotiations
as
defendants
face
much
harsher
potential
punishments
n
sentencing
decisions
can
also
be
ratcheted
up
as
prosecutors
seek
to
ensure
the
maximum
penalty
possible
n
maximum
sentences
on
minor
crimes
result
in
extended
incarceration
even
after
convictions
and
sentencing
prosecutors
have
been
known
to
weigh
in
on
parole
decisions
and
requirements
of
release
n
beyond
direct
prosecution
csu
also
impacts
how
uncooperative
witnesses
may
be
handled
n
whereas
in
the
ordinary
course
an
uncooperative
witness
might
enter
and
rapidly
leave
the
criminal
justice
system
on
a
minor
charge
now
prosecutors
will
be
alerted
to
the
witnesses
arrest
and
legal
predicament
n
as
one
of
the
chief
prosecutors
in
manhattan
explained
in
a
news
article
on
the
csu
every
morning
i
talk
to
my
five
a
d
a
s
who
are
experts
in
their
areas
we
decide
whom
we
should
try
to
pull
out
for
a
debriefing
we
pull
people
arrested
on
low
level
misdemeanor
charges
maybe
two
or
three
a
week
we
read
them
their
miranda
rights
about
percent
of
them
will
talk
n
these
debriefings
are
not
unusual
or
unethical
but
the
new
alert
system
makes
the
ability
of
prosecutors
to
locate
witnesses
much
easier
the
simple
truth
is
that
additional
leverage
can
make
initially
uncooperative
witnesses
more
cooperative
n
the
crime
strategies
unit
also
provides
additional
information
about
crime
patterns
and
criminal
activities
in
localized
geographic
areas
n
prosecutors
create
intelligence
reports
on
criminal
hotspots
develop
a
violence
timeline
of
crimes
and
identify
the
primary
violent
actors
gangs
and
community
stakeholders
in
each
location
n
police
have
begun
tracking
social
media
posts
of
some
of
the
targeted
individuals
n
this
social
media
focus
has
proven
quite
valuable
in
mapping
out
the
social
networks
of
gang
activity
in
new
york
n
detectives
and
prosecutors
can
now
visualize
the
social
relationships
of
gangs
and
communities
in
ways
that
explain
and
predict
tension
shootings
or
other
violence
n
threats
on
social
media
can
help
forecast
the
next
shooting
prosecutors
in
collaboration
with
the
police
have
begun
using
traditional
surveillance
techniques
such
as
video
cameras
to
augment
their
monitoring
of
predicted
criminals
n
facial
recognition
software
linked
to
social
media
has
led
to
the
identification
of
suspects
and
witnesses
n
targets
are
not
only
mapped
by
their
relationships
but
actually
tracked
as
they
go
through
the
criminal
justice
system
from
arrest
through
post
parole
release
n
prosecutors
not
just
police
have
gained
access
to
traditionally
investigative
as
opposed
to
adjudicatory
tools
n
the
result
is
a
new
type
of
prosecutor
police
relationship
that
blurs
traditional
lines
n
prosecutors
are
focusing
on
future
oriented
intelligence
driven
prosecutions
n
police
are
following
suit
as
reported
by
the
new
york
times
the
csu
prosecutorial
data
system
is
intended
to
augment
joint
police
prosecution
investigations
as
part
of
a
template
for
relations
between
the
two
agencies
the
district
attorney
s
office
will
provide
the
police
with
more
than
million
from
drug
forfeiture
cases
to
pay
for
new
technology
that
money
will
go
for
security
cameras
fiber
optic
information
systems
and
hand
held
tablets
that
will
feed
police
officers
data
about
suspects
mr
bratton
said
the
police
department
in
turn
will
provide
the
district
attorney
s
crime
strategies
unit
access
to
more
of
the
data
it
collects
not
only
on
reported
crimes
but
also
on
suspects
mr
bratton
said
he
called
the
new
approach
extreme
collaboration
and
illustrated
it
by
clasping
his
hands
together
n
this
process
signifies
a
realignment
to
a
more
proactive
method
of
prosecution
n
and
one
that
encourages
what
commissioner
bratton
called
a
seamless
web
of
information
between
prosecutors
and
the
police
n
before
moving
on
to
discuss
the
future
of
predictive
prosecution
it
must
be
made
clear
that
much
of
what
is
being
proposed
is
not
fundamentally
all
that
new
police
and
prosecutors
have
long
kept
detailed
dossiers
on
potential
suspects
n
as
wayne
logan
and
i
have
written
about
our
current
data
driven
criminal
justice
system
has
roots
in
th
century
innovations
n
data
in
the
form
of
arrest
logs
arrest
warrants
offender
registries
biometrics
and
a
host
of
court
and
community
supervision
records
has
long
been
available
to
police
n
further
police
have
recognized
the
need
to
identify
and
target
potential
bad
apples
since
before
there
were
police
forces
n
this
information
has
regularly
been
shared
with
prosecutors
who
have
built
similarly
extensive
investigative
files
on
potential
offenders
n
predictive
prosecution
is
merely
an
innovative
way
to
identify
and
predict
likely
targets
through
the
use
of
better
data
sharing
technologies
nevertheless
the
impact
of
predictive
analytics
and
social
network
technology
on
law
enforcement
and
prosecution
is
real
and
needs
to
be
examined
predictive
policing
has
gained
a
foothold
in
police
administration
predictive
prosecution
is
only
a
few
years
behind
and
so
the
promise
and
perils
need
to
be
addressed
as
the
technology
and
methodologies
develop
the
next
section
looks
at
three
big
questions
facing
predictive
prosecution
ii
preliminary
questions
about
predictive
prosecution
predictive
prosecution
holds
real
promise
for
prosecutors
offices
seeking
to
focus
resources
on
those
individuals
thought
to
present
the
greatest
risk
to
society
by
prioritizing
those
identified
to
be
most
at
risk
prosecutors
at
least
in
theory
can
utilize
existing
discretionary
power
in
a
manner
that
is
more
efficient
proactive
cheaper
and
smarter
as
this
is
a
symposium
devoted
to
implementing
de
incarceration
strategies
policies
and
practices
to
reduce
crime
and
mass
incarceration
such
an
innovation
deserves
a
serious
look
at
the
same
time
hard
questions
must
be
asked
of
this
new
method
of
prosecution
what
are
the
impacts
distortions
or
concerns
this
section
examines
three
big
questions
surrounding
predictive
prosecution
first
how
does
predictive
prosecution
impact
prosecutorial
decision
making
second
how
does
predictive
prosecution
impact
prosecutorial
role
and
third
how
will
predictive
prosecution
impact
crime
suppression
strategies
due
to
the
constraints
of
the
symposium
essay
format
the
ideas
discussed
are
initial
impressions
not
full
explorations
of
complex
and
important
topics
a
predictive
prosecution
and
prosecutorial
decision
making
predictive
prosecution
offers
potential
benefits
in
terms
of
prioritization
efficiency
and
more
informed
judgments
prosecutors
must
make
difficult
decisions
every
day
and
more
information
might
provide
for
better
choices
in
today
s
legal
system
prosecutors
possess
almost
unlimited
discretion
n
prosecutors
decide
whom
to
prosecute
n
prosecutors
decide
how
to
charge
and
how
to
structure
plea
bargains
n
and
prosecutors
decide
recommendations
for
sentences
n
adding
information
from
sources
such
as
the
predictive
policing
heat
list
or
organically
developed
intelligence
does
not
present
any
direct
ethical
or
constitutional
concerns
n
if
used
to
identify
and
proactively
target
actual
crime
drivers
in
a
community
a
predictive
prosecution
system
could
well
provide
an
overall
benefit
to
society
if
resources
could
be
redirected
toward
incapacitating
more
serious
offenders
through
bail
charging
and
sentencing
decisions
while
concomitantly
incapacitating
fewer
less
serious
offenders
such
a
process
could
mean
fewer
overall
people
in
jail
such
a
system
might
also
be
more
efficient
redirecting
scarce
prosecution
resources
of
course
the
current
system
of
mass
incarceration
that
has
developed
over
the
last
several
decades
has
not
lacked
for
efficiencies
in
prosecuting
and
convicting
defendants
n
mandatory
minimums
harsh
drug
sentences
plea
bargains
and
other
processing
efficiencies
have
created
an
overly
efficient
process
for
incarcerating
millions
of
people
n
but
the
web
of
people
caught
up
in
this
system
has
been
overbroad
lacking
a
commitment
to
prioritize
those
most
dangerous
to
society
n
millions
of
nonviolent
offenders
millions
of
misdemeanants
and
millions
of
low
level
figures
in
the
drug
world
are
serving
significant
time
in
jail
n
individually
those
persons
might
not
be
the
chosen
targets
of
our
criminal
justice
resources
but
systemically
prosecutors
have
had
few
mechanisms
to
evaluate
or
rank
relative
danger
or
risk
to
society
n
predictive
prosecution
offers
a
potential
smart
on
crime
counterweight
to
the
tough
on
crime
practices
of
over
incarceration
in
fact
taken
one
step
further
if
prosecutors
only
sought
to
target
those
predicted
to
be
of
high
risk
of
committing
crime
then
a
huge
majority
of
people
would
see
reduced
bail
better
pleas
and
more
lenient
sentencing
such
prioritization
might
significantly
reduce
pretrial
detention
costs
long
term
sentencing
costs
and
overall
criminal
justice
costs
the
danger
of
course
is
that
predictive
prosecution
might
not
reduce
prosecution
levels
but
might
in
fact
bring
more
people
into
the
criminal
justice
system
two
obvious
concerns
arise
within
the
enforcer
model
first
in
the
enforcer
model
individuals
are
being
linked
to
criminal
activity
by
proxies
for
criminal
activity
a
gang
member
who
has
a
friend
who
was
shot
may
be
added
to
the
system
because
statistically
the
associates
of
dead
gang
members
are
more
likely
to
themselves
be
involved
in
gun
violence
n
the
two
degrees
of
separation
analysis
may
both
be
accurate
n
and
yet
overbroad
when
it
comes
to
prosecutorial
decisions
the
particular
individual
might
not
have
done
anything
but
be
a
victim
of
violence
or
might
remain
a
small
time
criminal
actor
further
that
particular
individual
might
be
summoned
to
a
call
in
by
a
prosecutor
and
threatened
that
he
may
face
harsher
detention
charging
and
sentencing
decisions
should
he
get
in
trouble
in
the
future
so
that
individual
is
in
the
first
instance
added
to
a
prosecution
list
without
criminal
activity
of
his
own
and
in
the
second
instance
faced
with
the
potential
for
a
harsher
criminal
justice
outcome
because
of
that
designation
similarly
in
the
investigative
model
individuals
are
being
targeted
because
they
have
been
identified
as
the
primary
targets
for
removal
n
the
key
of
course
is
the
process
by
which
people
are
targeted
if
limited
to
only
those
individuals
with
multiple
convictions
for
violence
this
incapacitation
approach
can
be
defended
using
minor
crimes
to
incapacitate
major
criminal
actors
is
aggressive
but
defensible
however
if
other
factors
such
as
a
lack
of
cooperation
with
police
suspected
but
unproven
violence
or
low
level
non
violent
crimes
become
the
justification
for
being
a
target
then
justification
for
aggressive
incapacitation
weakens
using
minor
crimes
to
incapacitate
minor
criminal
actors
undercuts
the
value
of
targeting
only
the
serious
offenders
put
another
way
because
the
targeting
mechanism
of
identifying
the
primary
targets
rests
with
the
prosecution
in
collaboration
with
police
and
because
there
is
no
system
to
challenge
or
correct
a
targeting
error
a
risk
arises
about
the
data
populating
this
system
prosecutorial
decision
making
runs
a
real
risk
of
being
infected
by
bad
data
in
these
systems
n
personal
bias
could
influence
who
becomes
a
target
political
or
economic
pressure
could
shape
the
types
of
crimes
addressed
even
more
generally
any
data
driven
system
runs
into
concerns
with
data
quality
data
can
be
inaccurate
n
data
can
be
biased
n
data
can
reify
the
existing
socio
economic
inequalities
in
the
criminal
justice
system
n
data
can
also
be
overwhelming
with
little
practical
or
technological
checks
on
quality
or
accuracy
n
yet
every
day
police
and
prosecutors
collect
more
data
on
individuals
and
systems
are
being
designed
to
become
more
reliant
on
this
data
collection
n
in
prior
articles
i
have
laid
out
the
concern
of
data
error
in
the
criminal
justice
system
n
from
big
data
to
small
data
all
data
systems
generate
error
n
human
error
collection
error
processing
error
analytical
error
application
error
or
sharing
error
all
exist
and
cannot
be
minimized
when
this
same
data
is
used
to
determine
human
liberty
if
prosecutors
discretionary
power
involving
bail
charging
and
sentencing
is
informed
by
erroneous
or
merely
poorly
correlated
data
then
real
injustice
could
occur
the
issue
is
not
that
prosecutors
cannot
rely
on
this
data
within
their
existing
professional
and
ethical
mandate
but
whether
they
should
part
iii
of
this
essay
will
address
how
prosecutors
should
minimize
the
real
risk
of
using
bad
or
biased
data
b
predictive
prosecution
and
prosecutorial
role
predictive
prosecution
may
alter
the
prosecutor
s
role
a
predictive
prosecution
focus
redirects
power
away
from
a
reactive
model
of
prosecution
driven
by
police
arrests
to
a
more
proactive
model
of
prosecution
as
csu
chief
david
o
keefe
stated
it
used
to
be
we
only
went
where
the
cases
took
us
now
we
can
build
cases
around
specific
crime
problems
that
communities
are
grappling
with
n
while
many
cities
have
experimented
with
community
policing
strategies
for
years
n
and
certain
grand
jury
investigations
have
been
quite
proactive
traditionally
the
majority
of
state
criminal
cases
come
to
prosecutors
from
police
arrests
and
victim
complaints
n
at
least
in
one
version
of
the
prosecutorial
role
prosecutors
take
the
facts
and
cases
as
they
come
to
them
the
investigator
model
of
predictive
prosecution
potentially
alters
that
reality
by
broadening
the
aperture
of
prosecutorial
responsibility
to
focus
on
predictive
targeting
the
role
of
the
prosecutor
shifts
as
an
example
of
how
traditional
prosecution
practice
might
change

a

a
change
in

and
role
n
the

driven
and
directed
by
the
district

n
it
sent
a
message
of
prosecutorial

target
an
individual
for
incapacitation
and
use
the
tools
of
bail
charging
and
sentencing
to
do
it
police
execute
these
decisions
but
the
power
lies
with
the
prosecutors
office
in
the
first
instance
n
while
such
large
scale
prosecutorial
investigations
are
not
unusual
in
federal
court
or
against
large
scale
criminal
enterprises
n
predictive
prosecution
of
street
crime
might
well
shift
the
balance
of
power
away
from
police
to
prosecutors
and
even
to
smaller
units
within
those
prosecution
offices
beyond
street
crimes
a
move
to
proactive
prosecution
might
also
shape
the
types
of
crimes
pursued
by
prosecutors
it
is
not
accidental
that
most
state
criminal
courts
are
filled
with
lower
level
crimes
that
police
can
personally
observe
n
drug
sales
prostitution
theft
disorderly
conduct
and
assault
are
all
far
more
observable
than
domestic
violence
white
collar
fraud
or
sexual
assault
n
as
a
result
prosecution
resources
are
devoted
toward
reactive
policing
not
proactive
policing
n
a
shift
toward
predictive
prosecution
might
change
that
dynamic
with
prosecutors
taking
the
lead
to
prioritize
different
types
of
criminal
wrongdoing
prosecutors
can
choose
to
focus
more
attention
on
violence
rather
than
drug
possession
n
or
to
target
human
trafficking
more
than
drug
trafficking
n
at
the
same
time
this
new
role
threatens
a
longstanding
source
of
legitimacy
prosecutors
have
traditionally
been
expected
to
be
neutral
arbiters
in
the
pursuit
of
justice
n
as
professor
bruce
green
and
fred
zacharias
have
written
this
neutrality
connotes
independence
from
the
police
n
prosecutors
have
remained
independent
from
police
investigations
in
order
to
better
evaluate
the
constitutionality
legality
and
moral
worth
of
the
prosecution
n
much
of
the
judicial
deference
given
to
prosecutorial
discretion
depends
on
this
objective
evaluation
of
whether
the
case
should
go
forward
n
prosecutors
after
all
routinely
refuse
to
go
forward
with
cases
brought
to
them
by
police
n
the
investigator
model
of
predictive
prosecution
blurs
this
neutrality
as
information
sharing
strategy
and
even
execution
of
investigations
becomes
more
prosecutor
driven
while
prosecutors
can
still
be
objective
about
the
evidence
recovered
they
may
be
less
neutral
in
their
role
if
they
planned
and
implemented
the
collection
of
that
evidence
they
might
be
tempted
to
engage
in
the
competitive
enterprise
of
ferreting
out
crime
n
and
thus
lose
a
measure
of
objectivity
prosecutors
might
be
tempted
to
bring
weak
cases
simply
to
incapacitate
an
individual
identified
as
a
primary
target
even
though
in
every
other
situation
that
same
case
would
not
be
prosecuted
charges
might
be
ratcheted
up
from
a
misdemeanor
to
a
felony
not
because
the
facts
warrant
the
increase
but
because
the
individual
has
been
targeted
for
incapacitation
perhaps
just
as
damaging
the
image
of
prosecutor
will
be
tarnished
even
if
there
is
no
actual
difference
in
practice
or
outcome
n
this
is
not
to
say
that
prosecutors
have
not
led
significant
high
profile
prosecutorial
driven
investigations
for
many
years
but
they
would
now
have
a
different
role
for
low
level
street
crime
involving
repeated
thefts
non
homicide
shootings
and
drug
dealing
the
enforcer
model
of
predictive
policing
presents
a
slightly
different
distortion
of
role
as
enforcers
prosecutors
become
more
dependent
on
the
police
data
that
created
the
predictive
targets
if
the
algorithm
that
creates
the
heat
list
or
the
information
that
guides
the
gang
audit
is
wrong
then
the
accompanying
prosecutorial
judgments
about
whether
to
enforce
the
threats
may
also
be
wrong
in
some
ways
this
reduces
the
role
of
prosecutors
in
the
system
at
the
expense
of
the
data
collectors
at
the
police
department
one
can
imagine
that
in
high
volume
jurisdictions
with
aggressive
predictive
policing
models
prosecutors
will
not
be
in
a
position
to
judge
the
accuracy
or
reliability
of
the
person
focused
predictions
in
an
ideal
world
prosecutors
would
want
to
know
who
was
attending
the
call
in
meeting
and
the
appropriateness
of
their
official
threats
to
not
violate
the
law
in
practice
such
knowledge
might
be
improbable
to
expect
prosecutors
already
have
too
many
cases
and
responsibilities
n
and
adding
additional
responsibilities
to
understand
why
certain
people
were
summoned
to
a
call
in
meeting
may
not
be
feasible
as
enforcers
prosecutors
will
likely
simply
defer
to
the
police
driven
prediction
and
hope
that
the
sorting
mechanism
is
accurate
the
blurring
of
lines
also
has
an
impact
on
the
prosecutor
s
responsibility
to
provide
exculpatory
information
to
defendants
the
requirements
of
brady
disclosure
include
information
known
to
the
prosecutor
and
the
police
n
in
ordinary
cases
this
would
include
information
known
to
the
prosecutor
through
the
prosecutor
s
investigation
and
the
relevant
police
documents
or
witnesses
n
but
in
a
world
of
extreme
collaboration
and
within
a
seamless
web
of
shared
databases
those
pieces
of
information
become
far
more
interconnected
n
prosecutors
arguably
are
responsible
for
every
fact
listed
in
the
shared
searchable
database
almost
by
definition
intelligence
driven
policing
generates
more
scattered
bits
of
intelligence
about
the
players
involved
in
criminal
activity
nicknames
gang
affiliations
shared
addresses
and
cooperators
with
interlinked
crimes
suspects
and
witnesses
the
prosecution
s
data
systems
will
likely
have
more
information
that
could
be
exculpatory
to
defendants
for
example
notes
within
the
arrest
alert
system
could
suggest
other
gangs
or
gang
members
who
might
have
a
similar
motive
for
a
violent
act
or
could
include
witness
statements
that
discredit
the
prosecution
s
theory
of
the
case
the
line
prosecutor
may
not
personally
know
any
of
this
information
but
the
information
would
be
available
in
a
searchable
prosecution
controlled
database
is
the
failure
to
reveal
this
searchable
available
information
a
constitutional
violation
the
danger
of
integrated
databases
is
that
all
of
that
information
becomes
collectively
imputable
to
the
prosecutor
s
office
which
in
turn
means
that
the
prosecutor
is
responsible
for
providing
it
to
the
defense
similar
questions
exist
with
shared
surveillance
resources
information
not
directly
under
the
control
of
the
prosecutor
s
office
could
be
plausibly
denied
as
not
in
the
prosecutor
s
constructive
or
actual
possession
a
system
of
extreme
collaboration
undercuts
that
argument
a
prosecutor
who
has
access
to
more
information
because
of
more
efficient
data
sharing
systems
will
be
responsible
for
disclosing
more
because
of
that
collective
knowledge
this
leads
to
an
even
bigger
change
in
role
in
that
prosecutors
may
have
to
become
quasi
intelligence
analysts
in
this
intelligence
driven
system
in
the
traditional
criminal
case
a
prosecutor
is
given
thousands
of
facts
through
witnesses
police
officers
documents
photographs
investigations
and
other
sources
n
the
prosecutor
knows
what
she
is
told
by
police
and
what
the
evidence
shows
but
there
is
no
independent
obligation
or
ability
for
a
prosecutor
to
vet
the
information
n
the
facts
are
usually
collected
after
the
fact
by
police
not
prosecutors
and
with
an
eye
toward
what
can
be
proven
in
court
n
rumors
and
theories
are
useful
as
background
but
prosecutors
are
looking
for
facts
they
can
prove
in
court
a
natural
screening
process
occurs
because
the
rules
of
evidence
burdens
of
proof
and
realities
of
trial
practice
all
create
an
emphasis
on
credible
and
provable
facts
n
with
predictive
prosecution
technologies
the
information
assessment
is
slightly
different
at
the
investigation
stage
as
opposed
to
the
arrest
stage
the
information
is
more
fragmented
facts
that
could
not
be
proven
in
court
are
used
to
establish
the
primary
targets
n
intelligence
tips
are
not
always
provable
in
addition
they
are
not
always
accurate
prosecutors
thus
need
to
establish
systems
akin
to
intelligence
analysts
in
the
intelligence
community
to
vet
the
credibility
and
reliability
of
this
raw
data
in
both
the
national
security
context
and
the
police
context
sources
lie
deceive
err
and
of
course
get
things
right
n
and
only
by
establishing
a
process
to
evaluate
the
data
can
prosecutors
trust
the
data
this
change
may
require
modifications
in
how
prosecutors
offices
process
analyze
vet
and
use
data
which
will
be
discussed
in
part
iii
c
predictive
prosecution
and
crime
suppression
priorities
prosecutors
offices
do
not
just
enforce
criminal
violations
but
also
strategize
about
crime
suppression
n
especially
in
jurisdictions
with
elected
prosecutors
who
must
take
responsibility
for
increased
crime
rates
crime
reduction
is
a
top
priority
n
prosecutorial
control
of
criminal
justice
priorities
strengthens
democratic
accountability
and
connection
n
if
a
community
has
concerns
about
disproportionate
minority
arrests
for
drug
possession
the
normal
and
defensible
traditional
prosecutorial
response
is
that
prosecutors
merely
handle
the
cases
the
police
bring
them
while
they
have
the
power
to
decline
such
prosecutions
they
do
not
have
the
power
to
redirect
police
efforts
to
make
the
arrests
n
predictive
prosecution
changes
that
dynamic
communities
could
well
say
to
prosecutors
that
the
focus
should
not
be
on
drug
crimes
but
instead
gang
crimes
or
homicides
or
whatever
the
community
prioritized
predictive
prosecution
thus
gives
more
power
and
therefore
more
accountability
to
prosecutors
to
align
priorities
with
their
communities
this
reprioritization
can
also
include
a
shift
in
how
to
reduce
crime
while
predictive
prosecution
certainly
maintains
an
emphasis
on
incapacitation
and
threats
of
incarceration
it
is
also
built
upon
a
public
health
approach
to
crime
over
the
last
decade
many
policy
makers
have
been
pushing
a
public
health
approach
to
violence
drug
addiction
and
criminal
activity
n
person
based
predictive
policing
explicitly
adopted
a
public
health
model
of
identifying
risk
factors
in
the
same
way
that
certain
environmental
toxins
increase
the
risk
of
cancer
so
too
do
certain
environmental
factors
increase
the
risk
of
violence
for
youth
n
if
predictive
prosecution
techniques
are
used
to
identify
the
individual
human
risks
as
well
as
the
casualties
of
those
risks
then
certain
public
health
like
interventions
could
be
implemented
these
intervention
strategies
do
not
need
to
involve
police
or
prosecutors
or
the
threat
of
incarceration
in
fact
part
of
the
predictive
policing
model
in
chicago
and
other
cities
expressly
recognizes
that
social
services
and
community
pressure
may
be
more
effective
than
law
enforcement
n
as
just
one
example
the
chicago
vrs
intervention
system
structured
its
call
in
meetings
to
balance
any
law
enforcement
discussion
with
equal
parts
community
involvement
and
social
services
n
the
point
was
to
emphasize
that
the
solutions
to
criminal
activity
could
be
found
through
available
community
and
social
services
resources
n
the
question
of
course
is
whether
this
same
public
health
intervention
strategy
can
work
without
the
stick
of
prosecutorial
enforcement
analytically
the
identification
of
risk
and
the
remediating
of
risk
are
separate
problems
neither
has
to
be
led
by
police
or
prosecutors
but
due
to
practical
political
and
financial
reasons
they
appear
to
be
bound
together
for
the
near
future
predictive
prosecution
because
it
is
a
proactive
approach
can
also
shift
priorities
to
look
at
underlying
environmental
drivers
of
crime
rather
than
simply
responding
to
criminal
activity
predictive
analytics
can
isolate
places
that
attract
criminal
activities
n
environmental
criminologists
have
long
written
about
problematic
hot
spots
n
and
predictive
policing
techniques
are
now
policing
some
of
those
areas
n
but
prosecutors
might
be
able
to
intervene
at
a
more
elevated
political
or
policy
level
prosecutors
might
be
able
to
use
political
capital
to
alter
the
physical
landscape
in
a
community
engage
with
community
stakeholders
or
even
develop
social
services
programs
to
help
individuals
from
the
community
if
for
example
a
particular
area
is
known
for
car
thefts
because
the
environment
of
abandoned
buildings
dark
streets
and
easy
escape
routes
provides
a
tempting
opportunity
for
criminal
activity
then
prosecutors
could
work
with
communities
and
politicians
to
remedy
the
environmental
risks
or
prosecutors
could
as
the
manhattan
district
attorney
s
office
has
done
n
partner
with
community
groups
to
sponsor
youth
sports
and
academic
events
in
troubled
areas
finally
predictive
prosecution
encourages
a
shift
in
looking
at
crime
patterns
from
a
network
perspective
traditional
prosecution
tends
to
focus
on
individuals
we
think
of
crime
as
a
function
of
individual
choice
not
environmental
influences
n
while
many
prosecutors
offices
have
targeted
large
scale
crime
networks
the
majority
of
cases
involve
a
limited
number
of
suspects
targeted
for
particular
completed
crimes
n
predictive
prosecution
has
the
potential
to
shift
the
focus
of
attention
from
individuals
to
networks
and
from
individual
choices
to
social
group
influences
this
shift
is
not
a
wholesale
shift
clearly
predictive
prosecution
seeks
to
identify
specific
individuals
to
be
placed
in
databases
of
targeted
suspects
these
individuals
are
placed
there
because
of
their
choice
to
break
the
law
but
because
of
its
focus
on
gangs
neighborhoods
and
social
media
networks
predictive
prosecution
also
allows
for
broader
understanding
of
criminal
relationships
and
patterns
the
intelligence
of
intelligence
driven
policing
is
to
see
how
the
networks
of
violent
actors
interact
and
then
do
something
to
interrupt
those
cycles
of
violence
as
a
hypothetical
example
prosecutors
may
know
that
one
hundred
young
men
live
in
a
particular
housing
complex
and
ten
of
those
men
are
actively
involved
in
social
media
posts
that
boast
about
violence
criminal
activity
and
lawlessness
seeing
this
group
as
a
network
and
not
ten
individuals
does
several
helpful
things
first
it
allows
for
a
study
of
the
interrelation
between
the
ten
men
some
may
be
instigators
of
violence
some
might
be
followers
and
some
might
be
silent
non
participants
this
might
allow
prosecutors
to
prioritize
within
the
group
about
the
more
dangerous
of
the
group
in
addition
it
allows
prosecutors
to
see
how
the
network
extends
across
neighborhoods
and
generations
prosecutors
can
see
who
else
might
be
connected
to
this
group
and
thus
brought
into
its
ambit
most
criminal
networks
are
bounded
by
geography
and
family
n
so
one
could
almost
predict
who
might
be
the
next
individual
joining
the
group
studying
this
group
to
figure
out
why
certain
individuals
have
not
joined
the
group
might
also
be
valuable
is
it
friendship
finances
some
triggering
event
that
links
the
ten
together
and
doesn
t
include
the
other
ninety
is
there
a
new
group
that
has
arrived
in
an
area
are
there
correlations
that
can
be
drawn
to
explain
why
certain
people
remain
outside
the
network
of
potential
criminality
predictive
prosecution
thus
might
allow
a
study
of
why
certain
networks
form
about
connections
arising
from
neighborhoods
schools
or
environments
while
sociologists
have
been
studying
this
phenomenon
for
a
century
n
and
most
prosecutors
and
police
officers
could
tell
you
about
this
reality
from
experience
a
network
theory
of
criminal
justice
has
not
yet
been
operationalized
in
practice
in
most
prosecutors
offices
iii
principles
for
predictive
prosecution
predictive
technologies
are
not
new
to
the
criminal
justice
system
n
since
the
s
the
lure
of
predictive
insights
has
led
the
criminal
justice
system
to
try
to
forecast
the
future
n
predictors
for
recidivism
n
pretrial
detention
n
sex
offenders
n
juveniles
n
and
a
host
of
actuarial
solutions
have
been
proposed
n
predictive
policing
and
now
predictive
prosecution
fit
that
pattern
for
almost
as
long
as
their
creation
the
critiques
of
these
predictive
technologies
have
identified
the
same
concerns
over
and
over
again
predictive
correlations
become
mistaken
for
causation
n
validation
studies
fail
to
validate
n
analytical
mistakes
infect
the
legitimacy
of
the
conclusions
and
error
small
and
systemic
pervades
all
data
driven
systems
n
the
concept
of
predictive
prosecution
provides
the
same
promise
and
potential
critique
yet
because
of
the
prosecutor
s
special
role
in
the
criminal
justice
system
there
may
be
some
cause
for
optimism
if
designed
carefully
a
predictive
prosecution
system
might
provide
an
accountability
mechanism
to
police
data
error
and
moderate
blind
reliance
on
data
driven
predictions
while
a
full
descriptive
framework
is
beyond
the
scope
of
this
essay
any
predictive
prosecution
system
must
be
built
on
four
related
principles
ownership
accuracy
transparency
and
fairness
these
principles
are
explained
below
with
recognition
that
significant
additional
discussion
and
debate
is
needed
before
the
adoption
of
any
predictive
prosecution
program
first
prosecutors
must
accept
ownership
of
the
data
underlying
predictive
prosecution
systems
if
bail
determinations
charging
decisions
or
sentencing
is
impacted
at
all
by
data
correlations
being
on
the
ssl
list
or
being
identified
as
one
of
the
primary
targets
in
new
york
city
then
that
underlying
data
must
be
trustworthy
enough
to
withstand
scrutiny
of
judges
inquiring
about
the
bases
of
the
lists
or
reasons
for
the
decisions
whether
from
a
predictive
policing
system
or
organically
developed
by
prosecutors
once
used
in
court
prosecutors
must
take
responsibility
for
the
data
n
integrating
police
and
prosecutorial
systems
even
informally
means
that
prosecutors
must
take
on
a
data
management
duty
that
they
previously
did
not
have
to
accept
second
and
relatedly
prosecutors
must
ensure
the
accuracy
of
the
data
in
adopting
theories
of
intelligence
collection
to
augment
traditional
prosecution
roles
prosecutors
should
also
examine
how
intelligence
agencies
test
and
assess
the
data
collected
in
the
national
security
context
thousands
of
intelligence
analysts
work
for
the
united
states
government
because
of
a
healthy
distrust
of
the
raw
intelligence
coming
in
from
sources
n
intricate
internal
systems
exist
to
evaluate
the
reliability
of
data
n
recognizing
that
actionable
data
for
targeting
cannot
be
relied
upon
without
critical
analysis
so
too
with
intelligence
driven
prosecution
prosecutors
must
establish
systems
to
assess
the
value
of
the
data
coming
in
through
community
sources
detectives
social
media
and
other
sources
in
addition
this
push
for
accuracy
means
developing
systems
to
audit
existing
data
collection
systems
including
mechanisms
for
removal
and
alteration
of
bad
or
outdated
data
the
danger
of
a
high
volume
data
collection
enterprise
is
that
it
is
much
easier
to
simply
collect
everything
accurate
or
not
n
going
back
to
correct
errors
involves
time
money
and
technological
sophistication
n
but
without
such
checks
the
data
becomes
unworthy
of
use
in
criminal
courts
direct
connection
to
criminality
not
mere
correlation
should
be
required
when
an
individual
s
liberty
is
being
decided
processes
must
be
created
to
ensure
that
personal
bias
or
corruption
does
not
distort
the
targeting
further
the
data
collection
and
analysis
must
be
scrutinized
for
implicit
or
explicit
bias
n
disproportionate
minority
contacts
high
incarceration
rates
and
harsh
sentencing
have
been
clearly
demonstrated
throughout
the
criminal
justice
system
n
any
data
driven
system
built
on
top
of
that
inequality
will
likely
reify
the
inequality
unless
explicit
steps
are
taken
to
address
the
issue
third
any
data
system
must
be
transparent
n
this
involves
a
two
fold
transparency
both
to
the
prosecutor
using
the
data
and
the
community
legitimizing
the
use
of
the
data
prosecutors
are
lawyers
trained
in
law
not
technology
in
large
offices
the
data
will
be
compiled
by
colleagues
and
assistants
in
systems
of
extreme
collaboration
data
will
also
be
compiled
by
police
so
mechanisms
must
be
created
so
that
prosecutors
can
understand
the
source
of
the
data
prosecutors
need
to
be
able
to
not
only
trust
but
understand
and
defend
the
data
arguments
cannot
be
along
the
lines
of
judge
i
am
asking
for
a
no
bond
bail
determination
because
the
pre
printed
form
told
me
to
ask
for
it
but
because
of
particularized
verifiable
facts
that
can
be
obtained
through
a
data
driven
system
arguments
cannot
be
judge
the
defendant
is
on
the
ssl
so
we
ask
that
he
be
held
but
based
on
the
actual
underlying
facts
that
might
have
led
some
individual
to
be
on
that
list
prosecutorial
transparency
requires
understanding
why
individuals
have
been
chosen
to
be
marked
by
predictive
technologies
this
understanding
may
also
require
knowledge
of
the
provenance
of
the
data
the
currency
of
the
data
and
the
reliability
of
the
data
the
other
aspect
of
transparency
focuses
on
community
acceptance
of
predictive
prosecution
outcomes
the
orwellian
nature
of
government
lists
of
predicted
targets
rightly
causes
suspicion
n
any
predictive
prosecution
system
needs
to
be
able
to
explain
in
a
relatively
open
and
clear
way
how
people
are
placed
on
predictive
lists
and
why
the
criteria
is
legitimate
this
presents
a
challenge
in
that
most
prosecution
or
police
methods
also
need
to
be
relatively
opaque
in
order
to
avoid
undermining
ongoing
investigations
n
this
balance
between
transparency
and
operational
secrecy
presents
real
tensions
but
as
the
creation
of
custom
notification
letters
demonstrate
prosecutors
can
develop
a
process
to
show
and
explain
why
someone
is
targeted
custom
notification
letters
are
customized
and
include
the
target
s
specific
criminal
history
and
risk
factors
n
the
reasons
for
the
targeting
are
thus
particularized
and
individualized
and
open
for
inspection
n
similarly
in
call
ins
prosecutors
can
explain
in
specific
detail
why
the
particular
targets
have
been
contacted
this
process
provides
transparency
and
legitimacy
to
the
process
albeit
after
the
fact
this
type
of
customization
also
needs
to
be
applied
systemically
prosecutors
need
to
be
able
to
explain
why
certain
communities
have
been
targeted
and
how
they
have
attempted
to
avoid
class
or
race
based
impacts
using
crime
mapping
visual
displays
of
historic
criminal
activity
and
other
accessible
media
the
argument
can
be
made
for
why
certain
areas
were
chosen
and
not
others
discriminatory
impacts
need
to
be
monitored
and
studied
communities
may
accept
a
higher
prevalence
of
prosecutorial
interest
in
an
area
but
it
must
be
explained
and
defended
in
a
transparent
manner
finally
predictive
prosecution
systems
must
build
in
mechanisms
to
ensure
fair
process
an
emphasis
on
fairness
must
address
concerns
that
citizens
might
hold
in
being
targeted
by
predictive
techniques
a
process
will
need
to
be
developed
to
challenge
a
target
designation
on
a
police
list
n
a
method
to
account
for
possible
racial
or
class
discrimination
will
need
to
be
created
n
clear
procedures
to
use
and
validate
the
predictive
target
list
needs
to
be
developed
n
and
a
general
emphasis
on
procedural
justice
must
continue
due
to
the
influence
of
some
of
the
academics
who
provided
the
early
inspiration
for
the
chicago
projects
procedural
justice
has
been
a
key
organizing
principle
behind
the
intervention
strategy
but
such
an
emphasis
must
continue
to
be
prioritized
n
an
emphasis
on
fairness
must
include
a
focus
on
other
players
in
the
criminal
justice
system
fairness
includes
procedures
to
address
exculpatory
information
available
in
the
database
and
other
discovery
issues
that
will
necessarily
arise
n
in
an
interconnected
system
owned
and
operated
by
the
prosecutors
offices
brady
material
will
be
stored
in
the
shared
files
disclosure
of
this
shared
information
will
require
a
new
system
because
traditional
case
separations
and
information
barriers
will
no
longer
exist
finally
fairness
includes
the
ability
to
defend
the
data
collection
system
in
a
court
when
challenged
by
defendants
judges
or
internal
accountability
groups
these
fairness
principles
and
concerns
undergird
most
of
the
existing
criminal
justice
system
so
the
demand
should
be
neither
surprising
nor
objectionable
conclusion
predictive
prosecution
exists
in
an
experimental
phase
this
essay
seeks
to
raise
preliminary
questions
about
an
obviously
nascent
experiment
but
the
questions
are
real
and
will
need
to
be
answered
soon
the
hope
of
this
brief
essay
is
to
set
forth
the
possible
impacts
raise
questions
and
plan
for
the

text
introduction
the
criminal
justice
system
has
always
been
concerned
with
predictions
n
police
officers
on
patrol
predict
which
suspects
are
engaged
in
criminal
activity
in
order
to
determine
where
to
focus
their
investigative
efforts
magistrates
deciding
whether
to
grant
a
search
warrant
predict
the
odds
that
contraband
will
be
found
based
on
the
facts
presented
in
a
warrant
application
judges
conducting
bail
hearings
predict
the
chances
that
a
defendant
will
return
to
court
for
trial
and
sentencing
judges
try
to
determine
whether
a
convicted
defendant
is
likely
to
reoffend
if
he
is
given
a
nonincarceration
sentence
since
the
inception
of
our
criminal
justice
system
law
enforcement
officers
and
judges
have
relied
primarily
on
experience
training
intuition
and
common
sense
in
making
their
predictions
n
in
response
courts
have
crafted
broad
standards
to
accommodate
these
subjective
judgments
and
allow
for
flexibility
in
application
for
example
police
officers
may
briefly
detain
an
individual
if
they
reasonably
believe
that
criminal
activity
may
be
afoot
n
while
magistrates
should
issue
a
warrant
if
a
man
of
prudence
and
caution
believes
that
the
offense
has
been
committed
n
the
broad
flexible
nature
of
these
standards
is
no
accident
they
have
been
intentionally
left
imprecise
by
generations
of
courts
one
reason
is
the
nearly
infinite
number
of
different
facts
that
could
arise
in
any
criminal
case
which
make
hard
and
fast
rules
rather
impractical
n
but
the
main
reason
these
rules
have
been
kept
ambiguous
is
that
police
and
courts
have
historically
lacked
the
necessary
tools
to
evaluate
the
accuracy
of
their
predictions
with
any
precision
thus
state
actors
have
been
forced
to
rely
on
their
own
subjective
beliefs
and
anecdotal
evidence
in
making
their
predictions
n
all
of
that
is
now
changing
modern
methods
of
data
collection
and
analysis
commonly
known
as
big
data
are
providing
police
and
judges
with
tools
that
can
predict
future
behavior
with
greater
precision
than
ever
before
n
these
tools
hold
out
the
promise
of
increased
fairness
and
greater
objectivity
at
many
of
the
critical
decision
points
in
our
criminal
justice
system
but
despite
the
potential
of
big
data
tools
three
significant
obstacles
potentially
bar
their
effective
incorporation
into
the
criminal
justice
system
first
we
need
to
ensure
that
the
tools
of
big
data
are
not
hard
wired
to
produce
discriminatory
results
if
the
predictive
algorithms
consider
race
or
religion
as
a
factor
then
using
these
algorithms
to
predict
behavior
is
unacceptable
and
illegal
no
matter
how
much
they
may
increase
accuracy
similarly
if
the
algorithms
themselves
were
developed
based
on
past
discriminatory
practices
we
need
to
develop
new
algorithms
based
on
better
data
second
fourth
amendment
law
mandates
that
decisions
to
stop
or
search
a
suspect
be
based
at
least
in
part
on
individualized
suspicion
because
big
data
involves
processing
large
amounts
of
information
its
algorithms
frequently
generate
predictions
based
on
broad
generalizations
rather
than
specific
conduct
thus
in
their
current
form
these
algorithms
cannot
on
their
own
form
the
basis
for
reasonable
suspicion
or
probable
cause
and
finally
the
current
legal
standards
that
govern
police
officers
and
judges
are
imprecise
and
subjective
courts
have
deliberately
created
them
to
be
imprecise
and
seem
to
have
every
intention
of
keeping
them
that
way
unfortunately
these
nebulous
standards
are
a
poor
fit
for
big
data
s
highly
precise
and
quantitative
tools
these
obstacles
are
not
insurmountable
barriers
big
data
algorithms
can
be
structured
so
that
they
are
truly
race
neutral
and
take
into
account
individualized
conduct
when
making
their
calculations
but
in
order
to
ensure
that
they
meet
these
requirements
the
factors
they
apply
must
be
transparent
to
judges
in
other
words
it
is
not
sufficient
for
reviewing
courts
to
know
that
these
algorithms
are
working
the
courts
must
also
understand
exactly
how
the
methods
work
to
ensure
that
those
methods
meet
the
appropriate
legal
standards
n
and
although
courts
have
historically
been
reluctant
to
attach
specific
numbers
to
the
relevant
legal
standards
there
is
no
doctrinal
barrier
to
doing
so
courts
may
be
more
willing
to
take
this
step
as
they
come
to
realize
that
big
data
offers
highly
precise
and
quantitative
tools
that
can
create
not
only
better
accuracy
but
also
greater
transparency
in
our
criminal
system
this
article
seeks
to
harmonize
the
analytical
world
of
big
data
with
the
legal
world
of
criminal
justice
if
those
who
design
the
big
data
tools
can
ensure
the
transparency
of
their
algorithms
and
databases
not
only
will
these
tools
become
more
palatable
to
the
courts
but
the
transparency
of
these
calculations
will
simultaneously
improve
the
transparency
of
the
criminal
justice
system
moreover
if
courts
embrace
the
use
of
numerically
quantifiable
data
not
only
will
we
achieve
greater
accuracy
in
the
administration
of
justice
but
we
will
also
achieve
greater
clarity
of
the
process
part
i
of
this
article
discusses
the
ways
in
which
big
data
can
increase
the
accuracy
of
our
criminal
justice
system
n
part
ii
addresses
the
challenges
involved
in
the
use
of
big
data
n
part
iii
explains
how
these
challenges
can
be
overcome
by
requiring
heightened
transparency
of
big
data
s
algorithms
and
databases
and
by
introducing
quantifiable
standards
into
our
criminal
justice
system
n
the
article
concludes
by
positing
that
big
data
tools
if
properly
designed
and
used
can
dramatically
improve
both
the
accuracy
and
transparency
of
our
criminal
justice
system
i
the
promise
of
big
data
increased
accuracy
big
data
is
the
practice
of
accumulating
extraordinarily
large
amounts
of
information
from
a
variety
of
different
sources
and
then
processing
that
information
using
statistical
analysis
n
the
results
of
these
analyses
are
termed
mechanical
predictions
in
contrast
with
subjective
clinical
judgments
which
are
based
on
the
individual
decision
maker
s
past
experience
and
knowledge
n
private
companies
have
been
using
big
data
for
over
a
decade
to
predict
consumer
behavior
retailers
use
it
to
determine
and
change
shopping
habits
n
insurance
companies
rely
on
big
data
to
try
to
identify
the
safest
drivers
and
healthiest
people
in
their
customer
pool
n
banks
and
credit
agencies
use
big
data
to
determine
the
likelihood
that
a
potential
borrower
is
a
credit
risk
n
and
all
sorts
of
companies
buy
and
sell
this
data
to
each
other
seeking
to
mine
it
for
information
about
their
customers
that
they
can
use
for
economic
advantage
n
in
the
criminal
law
context
mechanical
predictions
can
be
used
to
assist
decision
makers
in
making
the
judgment
calls
that
are
integral
to
the
criminal
justice
system
the
extraordinary
promise
of
applying
big
data
to
the
criminal
justice
system
is
based
on
two
aspects
of
these
mechanical
predictions
first
the
underlying
data
is
usually
gathered
from
public
sources
and
therefore
the
use
of
such
data
does
not
constitute
a
search
under
the
fourth
amendment
n
thus
law
enforcement
officers
have
a
significant
amount
of
freedom
in
acquiring
this
information
which
means
that
they
can
obtain
the
predictions
from
big
data
without
needing
to
meet
any
legal
standard
such
as
reasonable
suspicion
or
probable
cause
essentially
big
data
algorithms
can
be
seen
as
a
force
multiplier
allowing
police
to
generate
more
predictive
power
from
the
same
public
information
that
has
always
been
available
to
them
the
second
enticing
aspect
of
big
data
s
mechanical
predictions
is
that
they
are
more
accurate
than
clinical
judgments
studies
have
shown
that
big
data
s
mechanical
predictions
are
on
average
more
accurate
than
clinical
predictions
n
police
officers
and
judges
who
have
adopted
these
methods
have
been
seeing
increased
accuracy
in
many
different
contexts
ranging
from
predicting
where
crime
is
likely
to
occur
to
determining
which
defendants
are
most
likely
to
succeed
if
released
on
parole
n
the
increased
accuracy
offered
by
big
data
will
lead
to
both
greater
efficiency
and
fairness
the
system
will
be
more
efficient
because
police
and
courts
will
be
able
to
focus
their
resources
more
effectively
it
will
be
fairer
because
innocent
people
will
be
less
likely
to
be
stopped
frisked
searched
or
arrested
if
big
data
can
successfully
narrow
the
field
of
legitimate
suspects
big
data
s
predictive
algorithms
could
be
used
in
a
number
of
different
ways
in
the
criminal
justice
system
first
law
enforcement
officers
could
use
these
tools
to
determine
where
crime
is
likely
to
occur
and
to
allocate
their
resources
accordingly
as
we
will
see
in
section
i
a
police
are
already
using
big
data
tools
for
this
purpose
with
notable
success
second
the
results
from
these
predictive
algorithms
could
informally
influence
police
officers
when
they
make
their
clinical
judgments
about
whether
reasonable
suspicion
or
probable
cause
exists
as
i
argue
in
section
i
b
this
is
probably
already
occurring
third
police
could
formally
cite
the
results
from
predictive
algorithms
in
court
when
justifying
their
stops
or
searches
or
when
applying
for
a
search
warrant
as
we
see
in
section
i
c
there
is
as
yet
no
evidence
that
law
enforcement
has
done
this
although
this
is
likely
to
happen
soon
finally
the
results
from
big
data
s
predictive
algorithms
could
be
outcome
determinative
meaning
that
a
police
officer
or
a
judge
would
only
consider
the
algorithm
s
output
and
ignore
all
other
evidence
we
are
a
long
way
from
this
point
in
the
context
of
reasonable
suspicion
or
probable
cause
but
section
i
d
notes
that
some
courts
are
coming
close
to
allowing
mechanical
predictions
to
be
outcome
determinative
for
bail
sentencing
and
parole
decisions
n
a
predictive
algorithms
and
policing
police
have
a
long
history
of
using
massive
amounts
of
data
to
help
decide
where
to
deploy
resources
n
in
the
s
law
enforcement
use
of
data
compilation
gained
national
attention
with
the
new
york
police
department
s
compstat
program
n
crime
mapping
algorithms
quickly
spread
to
other
cities
and
became
a
staple
of
big
city
policing
n
today
more
advanced
software
has
made
crime
predicting
software
available
in
smaller
jurisdictions
and
the
national
institute
of
justice
is
funding
research
into
the
efficacy
of
such
programs
n
these
crime
prediction
software
systems
vary
considerably
in
their
sophistication
one
program
known
as
predpol
short
for
predictive
policing
only
looks
at
past
reports
of
criminal
activity
and
then
highlights
areas
of
the
precinct
in
which
crime
has
been
most
prevalent
during
specific
time
periods
n
the
police
department
then
assigns
more
officers
to
the
high
crime
areas
in
order
to
detect
or
deter
crime
more
effectively
police
officers
using
the
software
in
a
suburb
of
los
angeles
saw
their
crime
rate
decrease
by
over
the
course
of
four
months
while
it
rose
by
in
surrounding
areas
n
a
more
sophisticated
program
called
hunchlab
also
uses
reports
of
past
criminal
activity
but
adds
in
additional
factors
n
some
of
these
extra
factors
such
as
the
proximity
to
subway
stations
or
bars
or
the
current
weather
conditions
have
an
obvious
correlation
to
particular
types
of
criminal
activity
other
factors
seem
unrelated
such
as
the
decrease
in
aggravated
assaults
on
windy
days
or
the
increase
in
car
thefts
near
schools
n
the
fresno
police
department
uses
crime
prediction
software
in
a
somewhat
different
way
employing
a
software
system
called
beware
to
warn
police
officers
of
the
threat
level
for
the
location
of
a
call
n
as
law
enforcement
officers
are
on
their
way
to
the
location
workers
in
police
headquarters
plug
the
address
into
the
beware
program
which
quickly
analyzes
countless
pieces
of
data
including
arrest
reports
commercial
databases
deep
web
searches
and
social
media
postings
that
are
associated
with
that
address
n
the
program
then
offers
a
rating
for
the
location
green
for
safe
yellow
for
caution
and
red
for
dangerous
n
police
officers
who
arrive
at
the
scene
can
take
appropriate
precautions
based
on
that
rating
chicago
takes
this
process
one
step
further
using
predictive
software
to
determine
which
individuals
are
most
likely
to
be
involved
in
a
crime
n
using
a
special
algorithm
designed
by
an
engineer
at
the
illinois
institute
of
technology
the
chicago
police
department
created
a
heat
list
of
people
who
are
most
likely
to
be
involved
in
a
shooting
or
homicide
n
police
will
then
deploy
resources
to
monitor
these
individuals
more
closely
than
other
individuals
n
in
an
attempt
to
deter
their
criminal
behavior
by
letting
them
know
they
are
under
increased
surveillance
or
to
swiftly
apprehend
them
if
they
do
commit
crimes
n
using
predictive
software
to
determine
how
to
allocate
scarce
law
enforcement
resources
is
not
limited
to
investigations
of
street
crime
the
internal
revenue
service
irs
uses
a
secret
algorithm
to
determine
which
of
the
over
one
hundred
million
tax
returns
should
be
audited
each
year
the
irs
algorithm
scans
through
every
tax
return
looking
for
outlying
levels
of
deductions
or
other
factors
that
indicate
a
higher
chance
of
fraud
and
then
it
assigns
a
risk
level
to
each
return
n
those
returns
with
high
risk
factors
are
then
personally
reviewed
by
irs
agents
to
see
if
an
audit
is
appropriate
n
some
critics
of
adapting
big
data
to
our
criminal
justice
system
argue
that
it
does
not
in
fact
make
more
accurate
decisions
professor
bernard
harcourt
has
argued
that
predictive
policing
may
actually
reduce
the
efficiency
of
stops
and
searches
because
when
police
focus
their
resources
on
certain
portions
of
the
population
they
necessarily
withdraw
resources
from
other
portions
of
the
population
n
according
to
his
model
crime
will
decrease
among
those
who
are
targeted
but
it
will
increase
among
those
who
are
not
targeted
thus
whether
the
overall
crime
rate
decreases
actually
depends
on
the
comparative
elasticity
of
the
crime
rate
in
each
of
the
two
groups
n
this
critique
is
persuasive
if
the
police
are
using
a
very
basic
predictive
policing
model
that
focuses
on
one
specific
neighborhood
or
as
in
harcourt
s
example
one
specific
race
but
the
critique
becomes
weaker
if
the
police
are
using
a
multi
factor
algorithm
to
direct
resources
and
it
becomes
weaker
still
if
it
is
merely
used
to
determine
whether
reasonable
suspicion
or
probable
cause
exist
however
harcourt
s
objection
does
highlight
the
need
to
ensure
that
the
data
used
by
the
predictive
algorithm
remains
current
that
is
if
there
is
a
feedback
effect
that
makes
certain
factors
less
likely
to
indicate
criminal
activity
the
algorithm
should
be
adjusted
to
ensure
that
those
factors
are
given
less
weight
or
eliminated
entirely
it
also
highlights
a
legitimate
concern
about
relying
on
data
which
itself
may
be
tainted
by
past
discrimination
or
inaccurate
decisions
a
topic
we
will
address
in
section
iii
a
below
b
predictive
algorithms
as
background
data
predpol
hunchlab
beware
chicago
s
heat
list
and
the
irs
algorithm
represent
what
we
could
call
the
first
stage
of
crime
prediction
algorithms
algorithms
used
to
help
police
decide
where
and
how
to
deploy
their
resources
but
not
used
at
least
formally
to
make
any
specific
legal
determination
n
but
as
the
amount
of
data
about
individuals
grows
and
becomes
more
accessible
police
will
use
big
data
at
later
stages
of
the
criminal
justice
system
it
is
likely
that
police
already
informally
use
these
tools
as
background
information
in
making
their
determination
as
to
whether
reasonable
suspicion
or
probable
cause
exists
assume
a
police
officer
observes
marginally
suspicious
activity
say
a
suspect
walking
slowly
down
the
street
at
night
peering
into
windows
and
constantly
looking
over
his
shoulder
if
the
officer
is
using
crime
prediction
software
and
the
software
informs
her
that
she
is
currently
in
a
low
crime
neighborhood
with
few
burglaries
she
may
simply
assume
that
the
suspect
is
engaged
in
innocent
conduct
and
merely
observe
the
suspect
for
a
few
minutes
until
he
leaves
the
area
but
if
the
software
informs
her
that
there
are
many
burglaries
that
occur
in
this
neighborhood
at
this
time
of
night
that
extra
factor
could
be
enough
to
change
her
response
and
lead
her
to
conduct
a
terry
stop
of
the
suspect
or
consider
a
police
officer
who
uses
risk
assessment
software
and
shows
up
at
a
home
in
response
to
a
call
to
find
two
individuals
engaged
in
a
heated
argument
one
with
a
bruise
on
his
cheek
the
injured
individual
refuses
to
tell
the
police
officer
whether
he
has
been
assaulted
if
the
risk
assessment
software
flashes
a
peaceful
green
the
responding
officer
might
simply
give
a
warning
to
the
two
individuals
or
ask
one
of
them
to
take
a
walk
to
cool
down
but
if
the
software
presented
a
red
light
indicating
the
presence
of
a
violent
individual
at
the
location
the
officer
might
decide
that
she
has
probable
cause
to
arrest
the
uninjured
individual
and
charge
him
with
assault
the
same
calculus
would
occur
consciously
or
unconsciously
when
an
officer
is
investigating
a
potential
crime
and
a
member
of
a
heat
list
is
a
suspect
or
when
an
irs
agent
is
reviewing
a
return
that
has
already
been
flagged
by
the
software
other
police
officers
have
mobile
applications
that
can
display
the
location
of
individuals
suspected
of
gang
activity
registered
sex
offenders
or
those
who
have
outstanding
warrants
thus
allowing
a
police
officer
to
quickly
generate
reasonable
suspicion
or
probable
cause
n
indeed
presence
in
a
high
crime
area
is
a
factor
that
is
frequently
cited
by
police
officers
who
are
explaining
why
they
believed
that
reasonable
suspicion
existed
n
and
the
fact
that
a
suspect
is
a
known
violent
felon
could
also
be
used
by
an
officer
in
deciding
whether
to
make
an
arrest
n
many
law
enforcement
agents
and
many
lay
people
would
say
that
it
would
be
foolish
to
ignore
these
signals
when
deciding
on
the
appropriate
course
of
action
although
police
probably
use
these
results
as
background
information
in
making
their
determination
so
far
no
law
enforcement
agent
or
prosecutor
has
formally
used
the
results
of
crime
prediction
software
in
court
as
a
factor
to
support
reasonable
suspicion
or
probable
cause
n
instead
courts
rely
on
the
testimony
of
the
law
enforcement
officers
to
establish
the
necessary
factors
even
in
situations
where
big
data
could
provide
more
accurate
information
n
c
predictive
algorithms
as
formal
factors
the
increasing
pervasiveness
of
predictive
algorithms
in
policing
means
that
police
officers
will
soon
be
using
these
predictions
as
part
of
their
arguments
justifying
reasonable
suspicion
or
probable
cause
moreover
as
police
officers
use
these
factors
more
often
judges
will
begin
to
expect
this
kind
of
hard
data
and
may
begin
to
reject
the
current
subjective
experiential
or
anecdotal
evidence
that
officers
currently
rely
upon
n
this
will
almost
certainly
result
in
more
accurate
determinations
overall
to
see
why
we
need
to
take
a
closer
look
at
the
current
system
that
is
used
to
determine
reasonable
suspicion
or
probable
cause
for
example
consider
the
high
crime
area
determination
that
is
frequently
cited
by
police
officers
as
a
factor
supporting
reasonable
suspicion
or
probable
cause
the
opinion
of
a
police
officer
about
how
much
crime
occurs
in
a
certain
area
is
likely
to
be
based
on
a
small
sample
of
cases
it
may
be
based
on
an
outdated
reputation
of
a
neighborhood
and
it
is
possibly
tainted
by
many
different
kinds
of
bias
n
even
if
accurate
it
is
inappropriately
comparative
if
the
neighborhood
in
question
has
three
times
the
number
of
drug
arrests
per
week
than
all
of
the
surrounding
neighborhoods
that
fact
in
itself
is
irrelevant
to
a
reasonable
suspicion
argument
n
instead
the
police
officer
and
the
judge
should
consider
the
absolute
number
of
criminal
activity
does
the
neighborhood
in
question
have
two
drug
arrests
per
week
or
ten
drug
arrests
per
week
or
fifty
drug
arrests
per
week
n
take
another
example
an
officer
is
only
allowed
to
frisk
a
suspect
during
a
terry
stop
if
the
officer
has
a
reason
to
believe
the
suspect
is
armed
up
until
now
that
reason
to
believe
like
the
reasonable
suspicion
underlying
the
stop
itself
has
been
based
on
the
opinion
and
past
experience
of
the
police
officer
and
evaluated
based
on
the
intuition
of
the
reviewing
court
police
officers
routinely
testify
for
example
that
individuals
suspected
of
engaging
in
narcotics
transactions
are
more
likely
to
have
weapons
on
their
person
in
practice
judges
have
credited
this
testimony
regularly
approving
terry
frisks
when
the
police
officer
had
reasonable
grounds
to
believe
a
suspect
was
engaged
in
narcotics
trafficking
n
but
what
is
the
actual
link
between
selling
narcotics
and
weapons
possession
if
the
former
actually
does
make
the
latter
more
likely
what
is
the
degree
of
increase
in
probability
is
it
the
same
for
every
city
and
every
neighborhood
of
every
city
and
every
type
of
narcotic
clinical
judgments
can
answer
none
of
these
questions
nor
can
they
answer
these
questions
for
any
other
factor
relied
upon
by
police
when
justifying
a
terry
frisk
thus
the
reason
to
believe
standard
has
become
a
legal
term
of
art
defined
not
by
actual
probability
but
by
years
of
precedents
in
which
certain
fact
patterns
have
been
approved
by
courts
based
solely
on
the
experience
and
expertise
of
police
officers
in
fact
the
bureau
of
justice
review
of
over
criminals
who
were
convicted
in
state
court
shows
that
only
of
those
who
were
convicted
of
drug
dealing
carried
a
firearm
at
the
time
of
the
offense
and
only
of
those
convicted
of
drug
possession
carried
a
firearm
at
the
time
of
the
offense
n
does
an
chance
give
officers
a
reason
to
believe
judges
have
never
answered
this
question
preferring
instead
to
rely
on
the
self
reported
intuition
and
experience
of
the
very
police
officers
who
are
trying
to
justify
their
own
actions
other
used
factors
for
clinical
judgments
also
may
comport
with
the
intuition
of
police
officers
and
with
the
intuition
of
the
judges
who
review
the
police
officers
actions
but
may
be
empirically
false
for
example
flight
from
police
has
long
been
held
to
be
a
significant
factor
in
determining
reasonable
suspicion
n
but
studies
have
shown
that
in
high
crime
urban
communities
where
the
population
is
disproportionately
minority
there
is
a
very
weak
link
between
flight
from
police
and
criminal
activity
n
courts
have
long
been
criticized
for
deferring
to
the
various
factors
police
officers
use
in
determining
that
they
have
the
authority
to
make
a
terry
stop
in
his
dissent
in
united
states
v
sokolow

of

as

of

apparently
almost
any
human
trait
can
be
a
basis
for
suspicion
and
nearly
everybody
exhibits
several
potentially
suspicious
factors
at
any
given
time
n
in
the
recent
case
of

n
a

challenging
the

policies

criticized
the
often
used
police
factors
such
as

high

and
suspicious

as
overly
vague
n
during
testimony
in
the
case
two
police
officers
testified
as
to
what
they
understood
furtive
movements
to
mean
one
officer
explained
that
furtive
movement
is
a
very
broad
concept
and
could
include
a
person
changing
direction
walking
in
a
certain
way
a
cting
a
little
suspicious
making
a
movement
that
is
not
regular

very
fidgety
going

out

pocket

out

something
at
their
waist

a
little
nervous
maybe
shaking
and
stutter
ing
another
officer
explained
that
usually
a
furtive
movement
is
someone
hanging
out
in
front
of
a
building
sitting
on
the
benches
or
something
like
that
and
then
making
a
quick
movement
such
as
bending
down
and
quickly
standing
back
up
going
inside
the
lobby

enforcement
officers
are
frequently
supported
only
by
the
officer
s
own
prior
experience
and
in
approving
or
disapproving
n
of
these
factors
as
probative
of
criminal
activity
courts
either
cite
the
expertise
of
the
officers
or
use
their
own
intuition
to
evaluate
the
probability
that
a
crime
will
occur
unsurprisingly
the
result
of
these
vague
standards
and
limited
data
sets
is
a
troublingly
low
hit
rate
for
police
officers
conducting
stop
and
frisks
the
recent
expansion
of
terry
stops
in
new
york
city
resulted
in
a
regime
in
which
only
of
all
terry
stops
in
new
york
city
resulted
in
an
arrest
or
a
summons
n
during
that
same
period
only
of
the
terry
frisks
produced
evidence
of
a
weapon
n
thus
for
that
time
period
the
police
officers
standard
for
reasonable
suspicion
was
in
fact
a
likelihood
that
criminal
activity
was
occurring
while
their
standard
for
a
reason
to
believe
that
a
suspect
was
armed
thus
justifying
a
frisk
was
although
courts
have
been
unwilling
to
explicitly
quantify
the
percentage
chance
for
reasonable
suspicion
it
is
probably
more
than
and
certainly
more
than
n
indeed
the
district
court
in
the
floyd
case
concluded
that
many
of
the
stops
by
the
police
officers
during
this
time
period
were
not
supported
by
reasonable
suspicion
n
this
implies
that
the
success
rate
over
that
time
period
was
insufficient
to
support
reasonable
suspicion
since
it
was
the
result
of
overly
aggressive
police
tactics
and
the
use
of
improper
factors
similarly
a
review
of
police
tactics
in
philadelphia
concluded
that
only
of
the
stops
resulted
in
recovery
of
contraband
the
review
also
concluded
that
reasonable
suspicion
was
lacking
for
somewhere
between
and
of
these
stops
n
thus
there
is
a
growing
dissonance
between
the
objective
data
driven
tools
used
by
police
officers
to
guide
their
conduct
and
the
intuitive
arguments
and
subjective
experience
used
by
police
officers
to
justify
that
conduct
in
court
given
the
success
of
the
data
driven
tools
in
everyday
police
work
it
seems
inevitable
that
they
will
soon
be
formally
used
by
police
officers
in
assessing
whether
reasonable
suspicion
or
probable
cause
exists
although
these
predictive
algorithms
have
not
yet
been
used
in
the
context
of
reasonable
suspicion
or
probable
cause
they
are
not
completely
foreign
to
the
criminal
justice
system
as
we
will
see
in
the
next
section
courts
have
been
using
these
predictive
algorithms
in
other
contexts
such
as
bail
hearings
and
parole
hearings
d
predictive
algorithms
elsewhere
in
the
criminal
justice
system
the
final
step
in
the
use
of
predictive
algorithms
is
for
the
police
officers
and
judges
to
make
their
decisions
based
solely
on
the
outputs
of
the
algorithms
without
exercising
any
of
their
own
independent
judgment
we
may
never
get
to
this
stage
for
reasonable
suspicion
and
probable
cause
determinations
and
we
may
not
want
to
as
discussed
below
n
but
we
have
come
close
to
such
a
world
in
other
contexts
such
as
bail
determinations
sentencing
decisions
and
parole
judgments
for
decades
judges
used
generalizations
based
on
risk
factors
in
making
these
decisions
but
in
recent
years
just
as
in
the
policing
context
big
data
has
slowly
been
infiltrating
these
procedures
using
vast
quantities
of
data
to
empirically
test
traditional
factors
and
experiment
with
new
factors
n
one
example
of
this
shift
in
the
bail
context
is
the
public
safety
assessment
psa
designed
by
the
arnold
foundation
which
has
been
adopted
by
about
two
dozen
jurisdictions
over
the
past
few
years
n
the
psa
which
is
based
on
an
analysis
of
one
and
a
half
million
criminal
cases
uses
up
to
ten
different
objective
factors
to
determine
whether
a
defendant
is
a
flight
risk
or
likely
to
commit
a
crime
during
pretrial
release
n
the
results
of
the
psa
have
been
nearly
uniformly
positive
after
pilot
projects
the
city
of
charlotte
lowered
its
pretrial
detention
by
with
no
increase
in
crime
or
bench
warrants
while
the
state
of
kentucky
has
saved
significant
money
and
increased
accuracy
of
its
pretrial
decisions
n
the
sentencing
process
is
also
undergoing
a
quiet
revolution
in
the
methods
that
judges
use
to
assess
risk
of
reoffending
some
states
now
use
formal
risk
assessment
instruments
to
determine
the
appropriate
sentence
after
conviction
n
these
risk
assessment
instruments
are
designed
using
an
algorithm
that
takes
into
account
decades
of
prior
cases
n
they
typically
use
around
ten
different
inputs
such
as
age
and
history
of
alcohol
abuse
and
then
assign
defendants
a
number
on
a
scale
which
translates
to
a
percentage
chance
that
the
defendant
will
reoffend
within
a
certain
period
of
time
n
for
example
virginia
developed
a
nine
factor
risk
assessment
instrument
based
on
past
evidence
and
uses
the
instrument
to
help
determine
whether
to
divert
a
defendant
away
from
a
prison
sentence
n
as
of
now
judges
use
these
risk
assessment
instruments
as
tools
to
help
them
make
their
decision
and
judges
still
maintain
the
discretion
to
depart
from
the
recommendations
made
by
the
instrument
n
but
the
influence
of
these
instruments
on
the
actual
sentencing
decision
is
growing
predictive
algorithms
have
also
gained
popularity
in
assessing
the
appropriateness
of
parole
mechanical
predictions
were
used
as
far
back
as
the
s
long
before
computers
and
large
databases
became
available
n
the
goal
of
these
early
predictions
was
to
assess
an
inmate
s
risk
of
recidivism
due
to
the
vast
number
of
individuals
who
were
paroled
even
in
the
early
years
there
was
a
large
pool
of
subjects
for
a
natural
experiment
sociologists
and
psychologists
utilized
this
pool
to
examine
the
characteristics
of
those
who
did
and
did
not
succeed
on
parole
n
by
over
of
states
that
maintained
an
active
parole
system
employed
some
form
of
mechanical
predictive
instrument
in
determining
whether
parole
was
appropriate
n
one
common
tool
the
level
of
services
inventory
revised
lsi
r
takes
into
account
fifty
four
separate
factors
ranging
from
criminal
history
and
education
level
to
alcohol
abuse
and
attitude
towards
sentencing
n
courts
correctional
facilities
and
parole
boards
routinely
use
these
instruments
in
determining
what
level
of
supervision
an
inmate
needs
in
prison
whether
he
should
be
paroled
and
what
conditions
are
necessary
if
parole
is
granted
n
like
police
officers
judges
who
make
clinical
judgments
about
bail
sentencing
or
parole
may
subconsciously
or
explicitly
use
stereotypes
or
intuitions
that
are
incorrect
n
in
creating
the
psa
the
arnold
foundation
determined
that
many
traditional
factors
used
in
bail
hearings
such
as
defendant
s
employment
status
community
ties
or
drug
and
alcohol
abuse
were
poor
predictors
of
flight
risk
n
they
also
concluded
that
a
face
to
face
interview
traditionally
a
staple
of
prearraignment
assessment
was
not
a
useful
tool
n
in
the
sentencing
context
many
judges
had
long
believed
that
mental
illness
was
a
strong
indicator
of
recidivism
actual
studies
of
mentally
ill
criminals
have
shown
that
not
to
be
the
case
n
there
are
two
obvious
differences
between
the
predictive
algorithms
used
by
police
during
their
investigations
and
those
used
by
courts
in
making
decisions
about
bail
sentencing
or
parole
the
first
seems
significant
but
in
fact
is
relatively
trivial
the
police
officers
are
making
predictions
about
past
or
current
behavior
i
e
whether
the
person
they
are
about
to
stop
is
currently
engaged
in
criminal
activity
or
whether
the
house
they
would
like
to
search
currently
contains
drugs
while
courts
are
making
predictions
about
future
behavior
i
e
whether
the
defendant
will
return
to
court
if
released
or
whether
the
defendant
will
commit
more
crimes
if
released
on
parole
in
truth
however
there
is
no
material
difference
between
these
two
types
of
predictions
both
involve
a
decision
maker
in
the
criminal
justice
system
trying
to
use
known
facts
to
determine
the
odds
that
an
unknown
fact
is
true
as
noted
by
professor
barbara
underwood
in
one
of
the
first
articles
regarding
prediction
and
the
law
some
past
or
present
facts
are
as
elusive
as
any
prediction
and
some
predictions
can
be
made
with
as
much
confidence
as
most
determinations
of
past
fact
n
the
second
more
significant
distinction
is
in
the
amount
of
time
available
to
conduct
the
prediction
police
officers
deciding
whether
to
stop
or
arrest
an
individual
on
the
street
are
reacting
to
an
ongoing
and
sometimes
rapidly
changing
situation
and
therefore
may
not
have
the
time
to
do
anything
but
rely
on
their
clinical
judgments
even
if
an
accurate
fast
processing
algorithm
is
available
to
the
police
they
may
not
have
time
to
make
the
necessary
observations
that
are
required
for
the
algorithm
to
deliver
an
accurate
prediction
judges
who
are
reviewing
these
judgments
at
a
later
suppression
hearing
as
well
as
judges
who
are
making
decisions
about
search
warrants
bail
sentencing
or
parole
have
the
time
to
gather
more
data
about
the
defendant
and
his
circumstances
and
then
make
use
of
a
predictive
algorithm
in
making
their
decision
in
other
words
predictive
software
may
be
less
accurate
when
used
by
law
enforcement
officers
than
when
used
by
judges
nevertheless
the
success
of
these
mechanical
predictions
in
the
context
of
bail
and
parole
hearings
shows
that
courts
may
be
receptive
to
applying
these
tools
on
the
front
end
of
the
criminal
justice
system
to
justify
stops
arrests
and
searches
data
driven
predictive
algorithms
represent
an
opportunity
to
dramatically
increase
the
accuracy
of
these
decisions
thus
ensuring
that
fewer
innocent
citizens
are
detained
or
searched
and
increasing
the
efficiency
of
our
law
enforcement
resources
n
however
a
number
of
obstacles
remain
both
in
the
design
of
the
algorithms
and
in
the
legal
standards
used
by
courts
we
will
discuss
these
obstacles
in
the
next
part
ii
challenges
to
using
predictive
algorithms
as
noted
in
part
i
crime
prediction
software
could
soon
be
used
by
police
officers
on
the
street
and
by
judges
in
criminal
courts
to
prove
reasonable
suspicion
or
probable
cause
this
development
could
potentially
result
in
more
accurate
and
consistent
determinations
of
whether
these
standards
have
indeed
been
met
but
only
if
certain
obstacles
can
be
overcome
first
there
is
a
concern
that
predictive
algorithms
would
use
factors
that
are
illegal
for
courts
to
consider
such
as
the
race
of
the
subject
n
similarly
the
underlying
data
that
the
algorithms
use
may
be
in
itself
biased
thus
using
these
algorithms
would
not
actually
increase
accuracy
but
merely
reinforce
decades
of
discriminatory
policing
also
the
law
requires
police
officers
and
judges
to
act
on
facts
that
are
specific
to
the
case
at
hand
the
general
probability
factors
used
by
big
data
may
not
be
able
to
provide
this
specificity
and
finally
the
hyper
quantified
world
of
big
data
is
currently
an
uncomfortable
fit
with
the
flexible
standards
used
by
courts
all
of
these
obstacles
are
surmountable
but
only
if
the
algorithms
and
databases
used
by
the
big
data
analyses
are
made
more
transparent
so
that
courts
can
evaluate
the
underlying
processes
and
the
standards
being
used
and
only
if
courts
are
willing
to
accept
the
quantified
world
of
predictive
software
a
detecting
the
racial
biases
in
the
predictive
algorithms
to
the
extent
that
human
beings
have
a
hand
in
creating
the
algorithms
and
compiling
the
data
that
the
algorithms
use
human
biases
will
infect
the
results
although
it
is
impossible
to
eliminate
these
biases
altogether
there
are
ways
to
minimize
the
problems
they
create
direct
and
indirect
use
of
forbidden
factors
mechanical
predictions
are
not
necessarily
color
blind
if
an
individual
s
race
is
a
significant
factor
in
determining
whether
a
certain
outcome
is
likely
to
occur
then
the
individuals
who
are
designing
and
using
the
algorithm
may
be
tempted
to
use
race
as
one
of
the
inputs
in
order
to
achieve
more
accurate
results
in
some
cases
outside
the
context
of
criminal
procedure
this
may
be
relatively
harmless
for
example
when
companies
use
big
data
to
decide
where
to
market
certain
products
or
when
political
campaigns
use
big
data
to
decide
which
voters
to
contact
with
a
certain
kind
of
outreach
in
other
cases
race
based
factors
can
be
quite
harmful
and
illegal
for
example
in
deciding
which
customers
are
a
good
credit
risk
for
a
home
loan
n
or
which
job
applicants
should
be
hired
n
in
the
context
of
criminal
procedure
race
based
factors
are
especially
problematic
both
legally
and
morally
for
the
purposes
of
this
discussion
let
s
assume
that
a
private
company
has
developed
an
algorithm
that
can
predict
with
great
accuracy
whether
drugs
will
be
found
inside
a
certain
house
the
algorithm
requires
the
user
to
enter
six
different
inputs
such
as
the
neighborhood
where
the
house
is
located
the
prior
criminal
convictions
of
the
house
s
owner
and
observations
made
by
police
officers
about
activity
outside
the
house
one
of
these
inputs
is
the
race
of
the
owner
of
the
home
assume
further
that
without
using
the
race
factor
the
algorithm
can
predict
the
presence
of
drugs
with
accuracy
but
with
the
race
factor
the
algorithm
can
predict
the
presence
of
drugs
with
accuracy
assume
the
police
have
purchased
this
algorithm
and
are
using
it
in
their
warrant
application
should
they
input
the
race
factor
in
order
to
enhance
the
algorithm
s
accuracy
in
other
words
would
it
be
illegal
for
the
state
to
use
race
as
a
factor
in
determining
probable
cause
or
reasonable
suspicion
if
it
could
be
definitively
proven
that
using
race
made
the
prediction
more
accurate
surprisingly
fourth
amendment
jurisprudence
has
little
to
say
about
whether
race
can
be
used
as
a
factor
in
determining
reasonable
suspicion
or
probable
cause
courts
are
unanimous
in
holding
that
race
alone
can
never
be
the
basis
for
a
stop
or
a
search
for
the
obvious
reason
that
a
person
s
race
alone
can
never
create
probable
cause
or
even
reasonable
suspicion
that
criminal
activity
is
occurring
n
however
some
courts
have
approved
cases
in
which
race
was
one
of
many
factors
in
deciding
whether
reasonable
suspicion
or
probable
cause
existed
for
example
when
searching
for
illegal
immigrants
near
the
mexican
border
n
other
courts
have
disagreed
arguing
that
a
person
s
race
is
of
such
little
probative
value
in
the
reasonable
suspicion
analysis
that
it
may
not
be
considered
as
a
relevant
factor
n
as
these
cases
make
clear
the
only
problem
with
using
race
under
fourth
amendment
jurisprudence
is
that
in
the
vast
majority
of
cases
the
race
of
a
subject
is
not
a
relevant
indicator
as
to
whether
the
suspect
is
more
or
less
likely
to
engage
in
criminal
activity
n
therefore
any
law
enforcement
official
who
does
consider
race
is
almost
certainly
doing
so
because
of
an
irrational
bias
against
that
particular
race
but
this
objection
is
not
entirely
valid
in
every
circumstance
as
noted
above
if
the
law
enforcement
officer
is
looking
for
illegal
immigrants
near
the
mexican
border
for
example
the
suspect
s
race
could
conceivably
be
one
factor
in
trying
to
predict
whether
the
suspect
was
illegally
in
the
country
likewise
if
a
person
seems
out
of
place
due
to
her
race
for
example
a
white
person
in
a
predominantly
black
neighborhood
her
race
could
be
one
factor
that
would
lead
to
reasonable
suspicion
that
she
was
engaging
in
criminal
activity
n
given
this
jurisprudence
there
is
no
valid
fourth
amendment
objection
to
using
race
as
a
factor
in
a
mechanical
prediction
algorithm
for
reasonable
suspicion
or
probable
cause
assuming
we
have
a
properly
designed
algorithm
n
race
would
only
be
used
as
a
factor
if
it
actually
was
a
useful
predictor
of
individualized
suspicion
in
other
words
there
would
be
empirical
statistical
proof
that
in
the
given
context
race
did
help
determine
whether
or
not
an
individual
was
guilty
of
a
crime
n
in
our
hypothetical
case
in
which
the
use
of
race
increased
the
accuracy
of
the
prediction
from
to
using
the
race
based
factor
would
not
be
prohibited
under
the
fourth
amendment
the
equal
protection
clause
is
another
matter
however
under
the
equal
protection
clause
race
can
only
be
used
as
a
factor
in
state
actions
if
the
use
of
race
is
necessary
and
if
it
is
narrowly
tailored
to
achieve
a
compelling
state
interest
n
this
is
a
difficult
if
not
impossible
burden
for
law
enforcement
to
meet
in
the
stop
and
search
context
some
courts
have
held
that
the
use
of
race
as
a
factor
does
not
require
exclusion
as
long
as
there
were
sufficient
other
factors
to
justify
the
stop
or
search
n
while
others
have
noted
that
law
enforcement
officers
violate
the
equal
protection
clause
if
they
incorporate
race
routinely
as
a
factor
in
their
drug
courier
profile
n
neither
of
these
principles
bodes
well
for
using
race
as
a
factor
in
mechanical
prediction
algorithms
regardless
of
how
accurate
it
might
be
as
further
evidence
that
racial
factors
are
forbidden
by
the
equal
protection
clause
nearly
all
the
civil
suits
alleging
racial
profiling
result
in
consent
decrees
that
forbid
the
use
of
race
as
a
factor
n
outside
the
fourth
amendment
context
the
seminal
case
on
racial
bias
in
the
criminal
justice
system
is
mccleskey
v
kemp
in
which
a
black
defendant
argued
that
the
state
of
georgia
engaged
in
racial
discrimination
when
administering
the
death
penalty
n
the
defendant
relied
on
a
study
that
showed
that
defendants
who
killed
white
victims
were
far
more
likely
to
be
sentenced
to
death
than
those
who
killed
black
victims
n
the
study
also
showed
that
black
defendants
were
more
likely
to
get
the
death
penalty
than
white
defendants
n
the
supreme
court
rejected
the
defendant
s
arguments
holding
that
in
order
to
prevail
on
an
equal
protection
claim
the
defendant
had
to
demonstrate
that
the
decision
makers
in
the
process
acted
with
a
discriminatory
purpose
n
the
justices
were
concerned
with
interfering
with
the
discretion
that
is
given
to
prosecutors
judges
and
juries
and
thus
said
it
required
exceptionally
clear
proof
before
the
court
would
infer
that
the
discretion
has
been
abused
n
based
on
this
jurisprudence
it
is
hard
to
see
our
hypothetical
algorithm
passing
constitutional
muster
even
assuming
that
the
interdiction
of
drugs
is
a
compelling
state
interest
law
enforcement
would
be
hard
pressed
to
argue
that
using
the
race
based
factor
was
necessary
and
narrowly
tailored
to
accomplish
that
purpose
the
use
of
the
algorithm
would
probably
be
seen
as
nothing
more
than
a
sophisticated
method
of
racial
profiling
an
institutionalization
of
using
race
as
a
factor
in
determining
probable
cause
the
only
plausible
defense
for
the
state
would
be
to
argue
that
although
race
is
clearly
a
factor
in
the
decision
made
by
the
algorithm
the
decision
is
not
made
with
a
discriminatory
purpose
as
forbidden
by
mccleskey
in
other
words
those
who
design
and
use
the
algorithm
are
arguably
not
acting
with
racial
animus
or
out
of
any
intent
to
treat
the
members
of
one
race
differently
than
another
this
narrower
definition
of
discriminatory
purpose
is
consistent
with
mccleskey
s
language
which
held
that
d
iscriminatory
purpose
implies
more
than
intent
as
volition
or
intent
as
awareness
of
consequences
it
implies
that
the
decisionmaker
selected
or
reaffirmed
a
particular
course
of
action
at
least
in
part
because
of
not
merely
in
spite
of
its
adverse
effects
upon
an
identifiable
group
n
this
does
not
really
fit
the
state
s
motivation
in
using
the
algorithm
the
police
are
not
choosing
to
use
the
algorithm
or
more
specifically
the
race
factor
because
of
its
adverse
effects
on
a
particular
race
they
are
using
it
to
increase
the
accuracy
of
their
predictions
however
the
narrow
definition
of
discriminatory
purpose
is
not
borne
out
in
other
areas
of
criminal
procedure
for
example
in
the
context
of
jury
selection
the
court
held
that
if
a
defendant
established
a
pattern
of
racial
discrimination
in
peremptory
jury
challenges
the
prosecutor
could
only
prevail
if
she
could
provide
a
racially
neutral
reason
for
making
those
challenges
n
the
court
further
noted
that
the
prosecutor
may
not
rebut
the
defendant
s
prima
facie
case
of
discrimination
by
stating
merely
that
he
challenged
jurors
of
the
defendant
s
race
on
the
assumption
or
his
intuitive
judgment
that
they
would
be
partial
to
the
defendant
because
of
their
shared
race
n
this
would
be
analogous
to
a
prosecutor
arguing
that
explicit
discrimination
should
be
allowed
in
the
probable
cause
algorithm
because
it
increases
the
accuracy
of
the
prediction
thus
our
hypothetical
algorithm
could
not
legally
use
race
as
a
factor
however
much
that
factor
could
be
proven
to
increase
accuracy
this
legal
conclusion
is
consistent
with
most
individuals
intuitive
moral
sense
and
relatedly
to
the
political
feasibility
of
using
predictive
algorithms
in
the
past
the
media
has
harshly
criticized
racial
profiling
n
and
it
is
unlikely
that
the
public
would
support
a
system
that
regularly
and
explicitly
used
race
as
a
significant
factor
to
determine
whether
to
stop
a
person
or
search
his
home
but
explicit
use
of
race
is
not
the
only
potential
problem
in
the
context
of
predictive
algorithms
and
this
is
where
the
need
for
transparency
becomes
significant
it
would
be
relatively
easy
for
courts
to
enforce
a
rule
that
prohibits
the
police
from
using
the
defendant
s
race
directly
as
a
factor
in
predictive
algorithms
but
this
may
not
prevent
the
algorithm
from
relying
on
factors
that
are
strongly
correlated
to
race
assume
we
change
our
hypothetical
algorithm
and
remove
the
race
factor
altogether
but
still
use
the
location
of
the
house
as
one
of
the
factors
as
has
been
established
by
decades
of
redlining
neighborhoods
n
location
can
be
an
effective
proxy
for
race
in
the
context
of
providing
insurance
banking
services
health
care
or
many
other
types
of
services
n
as
we
saw
earlier
current
software
used
by
police
to
predict
crime
patterns
is
highly
location
specific
and
it
is
certainly
possible
to
imagine
a
scenario
in
which
higher
crime
areas
track
the
racial
makeup
of
specific
neighborhoods
n
we
can
call
this
indirect
discrimination
as
opposed
to
the
unconstitutional
direct
discrimination
that
occurs
when
race
is
officially
used
as
a
factor
n
nearly
every
predictive
program
that
is
currently
in
use
has
given
rise
to
concerns
about
indirect
discrimination
n
thus
before
law
enforcement
agents
and
judges
officially
use
these
programs
to
formally
help
them
make
their
decisions
we
need
to
determine
whether
it
is
legally
or
ethically
permissible
to
use
these
nonracial
elements
that
are
correlated
to
race
one
way
of
answering
this
question
is
to
note
that
proxies
for
race
are
already
used
in
determinations
of
reasonable
suspicion
or
probable
cause
police
officers
routinely
testify
that
they
made
their
observations
in
a
high
crime
area
as
a
factor
that
led
to
their
reasonable
suspicion
or
probable
cause
n
no
doubt
in
many
instances
higher
crime
neighborhoods
will
tend
to
be
inner
city
neighborhoods
with
higher
proportions
of
certain
minority
groups
n
or
at
least
this
will
be
the
perspective
of
many
police
officers
and
judges
n
and
this
formal
use
of
proxies
for
race
under
the
current
system
is
likely
only
the
tip
of
the
iceberg
the
unconscious
or
conscious
racial
biases
of
police
officers
and
magistrates
permeate
every
aspect
of
the
front
end
of
the
criminal
justice
system
n
under
the
current
system
police
officers
disproportionately
stop
and
frisk
black
and
latino
suspects
and
they
are
more
likely
to
engage
in
violent
and
even
lethal
conduct
when
interacting
with
these
suspects
n
the
findings
from
the
class
action
lawsuit
challenging
the
expanded
police
stop
and
frisks
in
new
york
city
n
found
that
over
an
eight
and
a
half
year
period
of
all
the
citizens
subjected
to
terry
stops
were
black
even
though
black
citizens
made
up
only
of
the
population
n
studies
have
shown
similar
numbers
in
philadelphia
n
los
angeles
n
boston
n
and
on
the
new
jersey
turnpike
n
unlike
the
formal
factors
which
can
at
least
in
theory
be
proven
to
be
proxies
for
race
the
use
and
effect
of
these
informal
decisions
are
difficult
to
detect
and
even
more
difficult
to
prove
in
court
these
implicit
biases
on
the
part
of
police
officers
are
also
difficult
to
cure
even
in
the
long
run
since
they
exist
in
almost
every
individual
even
those
who
harbor
no
conscious
prejudices
n
in
other
words
the
current
system
relies
on
personal
subjective
clinical
judgments
that
are
based
on
some
known
factors
which
are
explicitly
described
by
the
police
officer
or
magistrate
when
requesting
a
warrant
or
justifying
their
decision
and
some
unknown
factors
such
as
unconscious
biases
even
for
the
explicitly
listed
known
factors
the
decision
makers
do
not
and
likely
could
not
quantify
the
degree
to
which
they
relied
on
each
individual
factor
for
example
assume
a
police
officer
is
driving
through
a
neighborhood
and
notices
a
young
black
man
standing
on
the
street
corner
the
young
man
is
dressed
in
a
way
that
is
common
to
the
neighborhood
but
that
the
police
officer
identifies
as
consistent
with
gang
affiliation
the
man
then
looks
over
at
the
officer
immediately
places
something
in
his
pocket
and
then
walks
briskly
away
from
the
officer
assume
at
this
point
the
officer
honestly
believes
that
there
is
a
reasonable
suspicion
that
the
man
is
engaging
in
criminal
activity
that
is
the
officer
is
not
out
to
hassle
the
young
man
and
is
not
simply
stopping
people
indiscriminately
in
the
hope
of
finding
contraband
the
officer
then
gets
out
of
her
car
and
orders
the
man
to
stop
later
on
the
officer
is
required
to
justify
her
stop
by
explaining
why
she
believed
she
had
reasonable
suspicion
to
believe
criminal
activity
was
afoot
she
lists
the
following
factors
the
action
took
place
in
a
high
crime
neighborhood
the
suspect
hid
an
item
after
noticing
a
police
officer
the
suspect
attempted
to
leave
the
scene
after
noticing
a
police
officer
the
police
officer
does
not
list
and
may
not
even
be
consciously
aware
of
other
factors
that
led
her
to
believe
the
suspect
may
have
been
engaged
in
criminal
activity
the
suspect
s
race
the
officer
subconsciously
believes
that
black
men
are
more
likely
to
possess
guns
or
drugs
than
white
men
the
suspect
s
age
the
officer
believes
that
men
in
their
twenties
are
more
likely
to
be
engaged
in
criminal
activity
than
children
or
men
over
forty
the
suspect
s
gender
the
officer
believes
that
men
are
more
likely
to
be
carrying
drugs
or
weapons
than
women
the
suspect
s
clothing
which
is
actually
common
to
the
neighborhood
but
which
the
police
officer
subconsciously
associates
with
criminals
the
way
the
suspect
looked
at
the
police
officer
which
the
officer
couldn
t
describe
in
testimony
but
which
she
associated
with
hostility
to
authority
and
to
police
specifically
racial
bias
played
a
role
in
the
officer
s
determination
that
the
defendant
was
likely
engaged
in
criminal
activity
but
it
is
impossible
to
know
to
what
degree
of
the
formal
elements
the
fact
that
the
encounter
took
place
in
a
high
crime
neighborhood
is
likely
correlated
to
race
but
neither
the
officer
nor
the
magistrate
reviewing
her
conduct
are
able
to
explain
exactly
how
important
that
factor
was
out
of
the
three
that
were
listed
and
the
fact
that
the
suspect
s
race
led
the
officer
to
focus
on
this
particular
individual
as
opposed
to
the
young
white
man
she
observed
standing
on
a
different
street
corner
two
minutes
before
this
interaction
may
have
played
a
significant
role
in
her
decision
or
a
very
minor
role
likewise
the
suspect
s
clothing
likely
another
proxy
for
race
may
have
been
a
strong
motivator
for
her
to
act
or
it
may
have
been
relatively
insignificant
there
is
simply
no
way
to
measure
much
less
prove
the
degree
to
which
race
or
proxies
for
race
influenced
her
decision
to
detain
the
suspect
over
the
course
of
many
years
and
tens
of
thousands
of
stops
a
clear
pattern
will
probably
emerge
that
shows
that
this
police
department
disproportionately
stops
people
of
color
but
effective
remedies
at
that
point
are
hard
to
come
by
it
is
against
this
backdrop
that
we
must
evaluate
any
potential
future
use
of
predictive
software
in
contrast
to
the
use
of
clinical
judgments
predictive
software
will
only
base
its
results
on
the
formal
factors
that
are
coded
into
its
system
thus
there
will
be
no
unconscious
or
hidden
human
biases
that
affect
its
decision
furthermore
we
can
precisely
quantify
the
degree
to
which
each
of
the
formal
factors
affects
the
result
so
a
judge
or
a
policymaker
can
make
an
informed
judgment
as
to
whether
certain
factors
that
are
proxies
for
race
are
dominating
the
calculation
in
other
words
under
the
current
system
of
clinical
judgments
the
only
way
to
infer
indirect
discrimination
is
by
reviewing
the
aggregate
results
after
many
months
or
years
have
passed
under
a
system
of
mechanical
predictions
the
level
of
indirect
discrimination
can
be
assessed
even
before
a
stop
or
a
search
occurs
by
examining
the
algorithm
the
police
intend
to
use
thus
the
mechanical
predictive
algorithms
can
be
designed
to
ignore
or
at
least
minimize
improper
factors
such
as
race
something
that
may
be
impossible
to
do
if
we
leave
these
determinations
to
the
subjective
determinations
of
police
officers
n
all
of
this
however
depends
on
a
high
level
of
transparency
in
the
algorithm
itself
so
that
judges
and
other
policymakers
including
the
police
department
that
is
considering
adoption
of
the
algorithm
can
review
the
factors
their
correlation
if
any
to
race
and
the
strength
of
any
specific
factor
in
reaching
the
result
we
will
examine
the
challenges
of
achieving
this
level
of
transparency
in
part
iii
preexisting
biases
in
the
underlying
data
a
related
concern
about
using
mechanical
predictions
involves
the
underlying
data
that
is
used
by
the
predictive
algorithms
put
simply
if
the
underlying
data
is
discriminatory
then
the
results
that
are
based
on
that
data
will
be
discriminatory
and
the
supposedly
color
blind
algorithms
will
be
doing
nothing
more
than
reinforcing
the
existing
racial
bias
in
the
criminal
justice
system
in
the
civil
context
commentators
are
beginning
to
pay
close
attention
to
these
potential
problems
noting
that
i
f
a
sample
includes
a
disproportionate
representation
of
a
particular
class
the
results
of
an
analysis
of
that
sample
may
skew
in
favor
of
or
against
the
overor
underrepresented
class
n
as
an
example
assume
that
for
the
past
twenty
years
a
metropolitan
police
department
has
been
disproportionately
stopping
searching
and
arresting
black
and
latino
citizens
this
disproportionate
treatment
does
not
stem
from
the
fact
that
citizens
from
these
groups
are
more
likely
to
commit
crimes
but
from
inherent
racial
biases
in
the
criminal
justice
system
such
as
the
tendency
of
police
to
engage
with
minorities
more
than
with
whites
and
the
increased
level
of
policing
in
minority
neighborhoods
n
assume
also
that
these
stops
searches
and
arrests
result
in
conviction
at
a
higher
rate
than
stops
searches
and
arrests
of
white
citizens
again
not
because
the
police
are
better
at
predicting
crime
for
the
minority
citizens
but
because
of
downstream
biases
in
the
criminal
justice
system
because
black
and
latino
defendants
tend
to
be
poorer
n
they
are
less
likely
to
be
able
to
afford
private
lawyers
and
less
likely
to
be
able
to
afford
bail
and
because
of
conscious
or
subconscious
prejudice
on
the
part
of
prosecutors
and
judges
black
and
latino
defendants
are
more
likely
to
be
overcharged
n
leading
to
higher
rates
of
plea
bargaining
and
more
likely
to
be
convicted
by
a
jury
if
the
case
goes
to
trial
n
these
discriminatory
stops
searches
arrests
and
convictions
will
become
the
underlying
data
for
the
city
s
predictive
algorithms
and
they
create
two
distinct
problems
for
mechanical
predictions
the
first
is
related
to
the
disproportionately
high
rate
of
encounters
between
the
police
and
members
of
the
minority
community
the
so
called
hassle
rate
n
this
will
create
large
amounts
of
data
about
certain
individuals
or
areas
of
a
city
and
disproportionately
small
amounts
of
data
about
other
individuals
or
areas
thus
when
an
algorithm
determines
whether
a
neighborhood
is
a
high
crime
area
it
will
have
a
skewed
interpretation
of
the
frequency
of
crimes
in
different
areas
this
in
turn
will
lead
to
more
frequent
searches
of
individuals
in
the
high
crime
areas
which
will
create
a
self
fulfilling
prophecy
as
more
individuals
are
stopped
searched
arrested
and
thus
convicted
in
those
areas
likewise
if
an
individual
is
determined
to
be
at
high
risk
for
committing
a
crime
it
could
merely
be
reflecting
the
prejudices
of
police
officers
who
have
had
previous
encounters
with
the
individual
n
professor
bernard
harcourt
refers
to
this
as
the
ratchet
effect
if
certain
factors
are
already
perceived
as
leading
to
higher
levels
of
criminal
activity
a
predictive
algorithm
will
lead
police
and
judges
to
conduct
and
authorize
more
searches
on
suspects
who
meet
these
factors
leading
to
more
arrests
that
are
linked
to
those
factors
n
the
second
problem
relates
to
the
disproportionately
high
ratio
of
convictions
to
arrests
for
minority
populations
what
is
usually
referred
to
as
the
hit
rate
n
the
primary
way
to
know
whether
a
stop
search
or
arrest
is
successful
is
a
hit
is
by
examining
conviction
rates
thus
even
if
in
fact
the
police
do
find
contraband
at
the
same
rate
for
every
ethnic
group
that
is
searched
if
certain
minority
groups
are
convicted
at
a
higher
rate
after
the
contraband
is
discovered
the
statistics
will
indicate
a
higher
hit
rate
for
those
minority
groups
than
for
others
in
other
words
because
these
citizens
are
unfairly
convicted
at
a
higher
rate
the
stops
and
searches
that
are
conducted
against
them
will
appear
to
be
more
effective
n
as
with
the
decision
making
process
itself
this
problem
is
not
new
to
mechanical
predictions
the
data
that
are
used
by
police
officers
and
judges
today
their
own
personal
experiences
is
similarly
flawed
n
the
danger
in
moving
towards
a
big
data
analysis
in
this
context
is
not
that
a
new
problem
will
be
created
but
that
despite
big
data
s
promise
of
being
color
blind
and
objective
the
old
problems
will
persist
even
worse
these
old
problems
will
become
institutionalized
and
thus
be
even
harder
to
successfully
challenge
and
expose
because
they
are
presented
as
part
of
the
hard
science
of
big
data
these
problems
with
underlying
data
are
not
insoluble
the
issue
is
common
to
many
uses
of
big
data
and
it
arises
when
statistics
that
are
kept
for
one
purpose
are
used
for
another
n
stop
and
frisk
statistics
and
criminal
conviction
numbers
are
not
recorded
for
the
purposes
of
sophisticated
statistical
study
thus
those
who
collect
them
generally
make
no
effort
to
correct
for
any
biases
inherent
in
the
process
n
part
of
the
solution
thus
involves
correcting
the
data
that
is
estimating
the
rate
of
over
representation
of
minorities
in
the
hassle
rates
and
hit
rates
and
then
adjusting
the
numbers
accordingly
n
another
solution
would
be
to
use
data
from
different
sources
not
just
from
information
that
results
from
police
citizen
encounters
for
example
algorithms
could
draw
their
underlying
data
from
the
bureau
of
justice
statistics
national
crime
victimization
survey
n
which
tracks
crimes
based
on
victim
reports
as
opposed
to
the
more
traditional
method
of
tracking
crime
through
police
reports
n
once
again
these
solutions
require
real
transparency
as
to
the
data
being
used
courts
and
policymakers
need
to
demand
to
see
the
source
of
the
data
used
by
the
predictive
algorithms
and
need
to
be
given
the
tools
to
evaluate
whether
the
data
is
representative
of
reality
or
the
product
of
discriminatory
decisions
or
unfair
processes
from
the
past
b
ensuring
the
computer
looks
for
individualized
suspicion
individualized
suspicion
is
a
bedrock
requirement
of
almost
any
police
action
that
implicates
the
fourth
amendment
n
if
police
officers
knew
that
statistically
speaking
of
everyone
living
in
a
certain
building
were
guilty
of
possessing
drugs
they
would
not
be
allowed
to
arrest
everyone
in
the
building
even
though
they
would
almost
certainly
have
probable
cause
to
believe
that
each
person
is
guilty
n
the
fourth
amendment
demands
a
certain
level
of
particularity
that
is
not
merely
a
statistical
likelihood
that
a
suspect
is
guilty
based
on
his
membership
in
a
certain
group
but
a
reference
to
particular
characteristics
or
actions
by
the
suspect
that
shows
that
he
specifically
is
likely
to
be
guilty
n
one
objection
to
using
mechanical
predictions
is
that
they
will
dilute
or
even
eliminate
the
individualization
requirement
by
focusing
on
broad
categories
instead
of
the
individual
s
particularized
conduct
n
even
if
big
data
s
mechanical
predictions
could
lead
to
more
accurate
results
it
would
be
legally
and
morally
wrong
to
punish
a
person
based
on
membership
in
a
specific
group
such
as
economic
class
or
age
instead
of
focusing
on
the
person
s
individual
actions
n
in
order
to
address
this
concern
we
first
have
to
define
what
we
mean
when
we
say
that
suspicion
must
be
individualized
n
in
general
we
mean
that
police
officers
must
look
at
the
specific
characteristics
and
actions
of
the
suspect
himself
and
not
determine
reasonable
suspicion
or
probable
cause
merely
because
the
suspect
is
a
member
of
a
certain
group
however
individualized
suspicion
does
not
preclude
inferring
facts
about
an
individual
based
on
his
membership
in
a
certain
group
it
simply
requires
the
presence
of
additional
factors
that
are
specific
to
the
suspect
even
in
the
analog
world
of
clinical
judgments
police
officers
and
judges
routinely
rely
on
assumptions
about
an
individual
based
in
part
on
the
characteristics
of
their
group
for
example
police
officers
will
give
some
weight
to
a
suspect
s
known
gang
affiliation
while
magistrates
making
bail
determinations
will
consider
whether
a
defendant
is
unemployed
or
has
a
criminal
record
however
it
would
be
inappropriate
to
stop
search
or
arrest
an
individual
solely
based
on
his
membership
in
a
specific
group
n
this
would
essentially
be
saying
that
the
group
characteristics
of
the
individual
are
so
suspicious
that
at
any
given
moment
there
is
reason
to
believe
that
he
is
likely
to
be
engaging
in
criminal
activity
in
order
to
avoid
this
problem
courts
have
held
that
the
police
officer
must
observe
conduct
that
gives
her
some
reason
to
believe
that
the
suspect
is
currently
engaging
in
criminal
activity
n
these
actions
may
be
legal
but
suspicious
conduct
such
as
running
from
the
police
exiting
a
location
where
drugs
are
known
to
be
sold
while
sticking
something
in
a
pocket
or
wearing
a
heavy
coat
on
a
summer
day
or
they
may
be
legal
and
innocuous
conduct
such
as
purchasing
a
one
way
ticket
or
traveling
with
no
luggage
but
the
reasonable
suspicion
or
probable
cause
cannot
be
based
only
on
who
the
person
is
it
must
also
be
based
on
what
the
person
does
n
the
supreme
court
has
repeatedly
reminded
us
of
the
need
to
consider
the
specific
actions
of
the
individual
being
searched
in
ybarra
v
illinois
law
enforcement
officers
with
a
warrant
to
search
a
tavern
decided
to
stop
and
frisk
every
individual
inside
the
tavern
under
the
theory
that
mere
presence
in
a
tavern
where
drugs
were
being
sold
generated
reasonable
suspicion
that
a
person
possessed
drugs
n
the
supreme
court
rejected
this
argument
explaining
that
the
terry
exception
does
not
permit
a
frisk
for
weapons
on
less
than
reasonable
belief
or
suspicion
directed
at
the
person
to
be
frisked
n
a
mechanical
prediction
that
is
used
to
demonstrate
reasonable
suspicion
or
probable
cause
must
meet
these
same
criteria
n
law
school
hypotheticals
aside
it
is
hard
to
imagine
a
situation
in
the
real
world
where
group
characteristics
alone
rise
to
the
level
of
reasonable
suspicion
but
it
is
theoretically
possible
that
a
mechanical
prediction
would
arrive
at
such
a
result
thus
any
predictive
software
used
to
calculate
whether
reasonable
suspicion
or
probable
cause
exists
must
require
the
observing
officer
to
input
the
specific
actions
of
the
suspect
as
well
as
his
general
characteristics
the
software
would
thus
use
these
specific
actions
as
part
of
its
analysis
and
it
would
be
designed
in
such
a
way
that
it
could
not
find
reasonable
suspicion
or
probable
cause
regardless
of
the
percentage
chance
of
criminal
activity
occurring
unless
the
specific
actions
were
a
significant
factor
in
the
determination
n
c
changing
the
legal
standards
so
far
in
evaluating
the
obstacles
to
adapting
big
data
to
criminal
law
we
have
looked
at
the
potential
problems
with
the
underlying
data
or
the
methods
used
to
process
that
data
in
other
words
we
have
been
concerned
with
shaping
the
way
that
mechanical
predictions
are
made
in
order
to
ensure
that
they
are
consistent
with
the
requirements
of
our
criminal
procedure
jurisprudence
but
even
if
these
problems
are
solved
we
face
a
potentially
even
greater
obstacle
reshaping
the
criminal
procedure
jurisprudence
so
that
it
can
use
the
information
provided
by
big
data
simply
stated
the
quantitative
results
from
mechanical
predictions
are
incompatible
with
the
broad
flexible
standards
used
by
police
and
judges
in
the
world
of
criminal
procedure
n
reasonable
suspicion
and
probable
cause
are
standards
that
have
been
intentionally
kept
vague
by
the
courts
the
supreme
court
has
long
resisted
setting
specific
probabilities
for
the
flexible
concepts
of
reasonable
suspicion
or
probable
cause
n
explaining
that
it
is
a
practical
nontechnical
conception
which
is
incapable
of
precise
definition
or
quantification
into
percentages
n
the
court
explains
to
us
that
the
concepts
are
not
readily
or
even
usefully
reduced
to
a
neat
set
of
legal
rules
n
and
then
follows
through
on
this
promise
by
providing
a
multitude
of
messy
rules
for
police
and
lower
courts
to
follow
probable
cause
is
defined
as
evidence
that
would
warrant
a
man
of
prudence
and
caution
in
believing
that
the
offense
has
been
committed
or
as
a
reasonable
ground
to
believe
that
the
accused
is
guilty
n
reasonable
suspicion
is
defined
as
obviously
less
demanding
than
probable
cause
n
requiring
merely
some
minimal
level
of
objective
justification
n
these
definitions
are
rather
unhelpful
in
providing
guidance
or
clarity
as
to
when
a
stop
or
a
search
is
appropriate
no
lay
person
would
possibly
know
what
these
terms
mean
in
the
real
world
police
officers
and
law
students
must
study
dozens
of
fact
patterns
from
case
law
to
get
a
sense
of
what
kinds
of
factors
will
create
reasonable
suspicion
or
probable
cause
forty
five
years
ago
one
law
professor
surveyed
federal
judges
to
ask
them
to
quantify
the
concept
of
probable
cause
and
the
results
ranged
from
ten
percent
to
ninety
percent
n
the
same
group
of
judges
was
asked
to
quantify
the
concept
of
reasonable
suspicion
and
most
judges
gave
responses
between
ten
percent
and
sixty
percent
n
this
imprecision
has
its
costs
it
creates
inconsistency
from
jurisdiction
to
jurisdiction
and
even
from
judge
to
judge
and
it
makes
it
harder
for
police
to
know
whether
their
actions
are
legal
at
the
time
they
take
those
actions
n
it
also
forces
magistrates
and
judges
to
rely
on
the
subjective
descriptions
and
personal
judgments
of
the
police
officers
since
these
vague
standards
breed
vague
descriptions
to
meet
those
standards
such
as
high
crime
neighborhood
acting
nervous
and
suspicious
hand
movements
police
officers
who
testify
to
these
factors
are
usually
not
acting
in
bad
faith
they
are
merely
trying
to
find
ways
to
satisfy
an
ambiguous
legal
standard
perhaps
worst
of
all
the
imprecise
standards
make
it
difficult
to
evaluate
the
constitutionality
of
law
enforcement
actions
on
a
larger
scale
assume
that
a
study
of
all
probable
cause
based
automobile
searches
in
a
jurisdiction
demonstrated
that
of
the
time
the
police
found
contraband
does
this
mean
that
the
police
in
this
jurisdiction
are
following
the
law
or
that
they
are
violating
people
s
rights
without
any
quantification
of
the
standard
it
is
impossible
to
tell
to
some
extent
the
imprecision
of
these
terms
was
a
necessary
evil
if
the
supreme
court
had
instructed
police
that
they
needed
to
be
at
least
certain
of
an
individual
s
guilt
before
conducting
a
terry
stop
the
precise
quantification
would
not
have
helped
individual
officers
in
making
their
on
the
spot
decisions
it
makes
more
sense
for
officers
to
be
given
some
broad
guidelines
e
g
more
than
a
mere
hunch
or
some
level
of
objective
justification
required
and
then
teach
them
through
training
and
trial
and
error
what
courts
will
approve
and
what
they
will
not
e
g
observing
a
suspect
leave
a
known
crack
house
and
then
run
from
a
uniformed
police
officer
constitutes
reasonable
suspicion
observing
a
suspect
leave
a
known
crack
house
with
no
other
suspicious
behavior
does
not
similarly
telling
a
magistrate
that
she
should
only
issue
the
warrant
if
there
is
a
chance
of
finding
contraband
would
be
unlikely
to
help
her
make
the
decision
in
a
world
of
clinical
judgments
the
magistrate
must
consider
the
myriad
of
subjective
factors
from
the
police
officer
s
affidavit
the
credibility
of
an
informant
the
reports
of
unusual
but
not
blatantly
illegal
activity
and
so
on
given
the
messiness
of
the
evidence
confronted
by
police
and
judges
a
messy
standard
makes
the
most
sense
such
a
standard
allows
the
decision
makers
to
follow
their
intuition
and
make
a
subjective
judgment
about
whether
something
seems
not
right
about
this
situation
reasonable
suspicion
or
i
believe
there
is
a
good
chance
that
a
crime
has
been
committed
probable
cause
n
indeed
many
judges
who
were
polled
about
percentages
for
probable
cause
and
reasonable
suspicion
in
the
survey
refused
to
answer
the
questions
arguing
that
using
percentages
would
be
misleading
because
burdens
of
proof
deal
with
qualitative
judgments
rather
than
quantitative
judgments
n
numerous
scholars
have
also
objected
to
creating
specific
quantifiable
standards
for
example
professor
orin
kerr
argues
that
quantification
of
probable
cause
would
lead
to
less
accurate
probable
cause
determinations
because
warrant
applications
only
provide
a
limited
amount
of
information
and
under
the
current
system
judges
are
able
to
use
their
intuition
to
account
for
the
missing
facts
n
professor
kerr
argues
that
when
a
judge
gets
a
warrant
application
she
only
sees
the
selective
facts
that
the
police
want
her
to
see
investigative
techniques
that
successfully
found
evidence
to
build
towards
probable
cause
n
but
the
application
will
not
describe
any
investigative
techniques
that
were
used
that
failed
to
find
evidence
nor
will
it
describe
any
possible
investigative
techniques
that
could
have
been
used
that
were
not
used
n
in
the
current
non
quantified
world
professor
kerr
argues
judges
can
use
their
intuition
about
what
might
be
missing
from
the
warrant
application
and
judges
will
instinctively
and
perhaps
subconsciously
factor
that
into
their
decision
n
if
the
probable
cause
standard
became
quantified
at
say
judges
would
merely
calculate
the
odds
incorrectly
based
on
the
selective
facts
in
the
affidavit
and
would
suppress
their
natural
intuition
to
be
suspicious
about
the
facts
that
might
not
have
been
included
although
professor
kerr
claims
his
argument
is
based
on
the
value
of
judicial
intuition
it
is
really
about
the
need
for
particularized
suspicion
he
uses
an
example
of
law
enforcement
who
have
a
well
documented
study
that
of
all
harvard
dorm
rooms
contain
illegal
drugs
and
he
posits
that
police
officers
attempt
to
use
that
study
to
get
a
warrant
to
search
a
specific
dorm
room
n
a
judge
would
rightfully
be
suspicious
of
this
request
he
argues
because
the
judge
s
intuition
would
make
her
wonder
why
the
police
have
chosen
this
room
in
particular
thus
leading
to
the
conclusion
that
she
is
not
getting
the
full
story
from
the
police
n
but
this
is
merely
a
restatement
of
the
requirement
that
suspicion
be
particularized
that
the
affidavit
must
contain
some
information
that
links
this
specific
suspect
to
the
illicit
activity
and
as
noted
above
n
this
is
an
important
consideration
in
designing
big
data
s
algorithms
for
criminal
law
application
we
need
to
either
ensure
that
the
inputs
contained
some
reference
to
the
individual
actions
or
behavior
of
the
suspect
himself
or
allow
for
police
and
judges
to
add
in
their
own
observations
of
individual
activity
n
a
more
troubling
critique
of
using
predictive
algorithms
is
the
supreme
court
s
requirement
that
the
decision
maker
use
a
totality
of
the
circumstances
test
in
determining
whether
reasonable
suspicion
or
probable
cause
exist
n
professor
michael
rich
argues
that
a
predictive
algorithm
can
never
determine
probable
cause
on
its
own
because
the
algorithm
is
by
definition
limited
in
the
factors
that
it
considers
in
making
its
determination
n
a
predictive
algorithm
might
be
programmed
to
consider
only
a
handful
of
factors
or
it
might
be
programmed
to
consider
hundreds
of
factors
but
it
can
never
consider
every
factor
that
could
possibly
be
relevant
to
a
probable
cause
analysis
n
a
human
being
at
least
has
the
potential
to
incorporate
new
observations
but
a
predictive
algorithm
is
limited
by
its
previous
programming
n
one
response
to
this
critique
is
that
it
somewhat
misrepresents
what
the
court
means
by
totality
of
the
circumstances
this
requirement
does
not
mean
that
the
decision
maker
must
consider
every
possible
factor
that
would
be
impossible
for
a
human
being
or
a
computer
indeed
courts
have
noted
that
once
a
police
officer
has
established
that
probable
cause
exists
the
officer
is
under
no
further
duty
to
investigate
or
gather
exculpatory
data
n
instead
totality
of
the
circumstances
means
two
things
first
courts
should
reject
a
formalistic
checklist
of
factors
such
as
the
pre
gates
two
pronged
test
n
and
be
willing
to
consider
many
different
factors
in
deciding
whether
probable
cause
exists
n
certainly
a
predictive
algorithm
can
be
designed
to
consider
hundreds
of
different
factors
far
more
than
the
average
police
officer
observing
the
scene
and
far
more
than
are
typically
included
in
an
affidavit
in
a
warrant
application
n
it
is
true
that
no
predictive
algorithm
will
ever
be
able
to
consider
every
relevant
factor
whether
inculpatory
or
exculpatory
but
of
course
this
is
also
true
for
police
officers
and
judges
in
fact
predictive
algorithms
could
conceivably
process
thousands
of
different
factors
many
more
than
a
human
being
could
it
is
easy
to
come
up
with
examples
of
cases
in
which
a
police
officer
makes
an
observation
that
is
not
programmed
into
the
predictive
algorithm
and
which
dramatically
increases
or
decreases
the
level
of
suspicion
in
a
situation
but
it
is
equally
easy
if
not
easier
to
think
of
examples
in
which
a
predictive
algorithm
considers
relevant
factors
that
an
average
police
officer
would
never
consider
many
of
the
factors
that
human
police
officers
consider
to
be
relevant
may
in
fact
be
irrelevant
or
may
be
given
insufficient
weight
or
too
much
weight
and
as
many
commentators
have
pointed
out
some
of
the
intuitions
of
police
officers
and
even
judges
are
grounded
in
implicit
racial
bias
making
their
conclusions
not
just
inaccurate
but
also
discriminatory
n
second
the
police
and
courts
must
also
consider
potential
exculpatory
evidence
as
part
of
the
totality
of
the
circumstances
since
certain
observations
or
background
facts
may
lower
the
level
of
suspicion
n
predictive
algorithms
can
and
should
be
programmed
to
consider
possible
exculpatory
evidence
as
well
and
to
weigh
that
evidence
in
reaching
their
conclusions
in
short
quantifying
these
standards
will
allow
police
and
judges
to
use
predictive
algorithms
bringing
a
number
of
benefits
the
opportunity
to
reduce
discriminatory
bias
in
the
system
greater
accountability
for
police
actions
and
a
higher
level
of
accuracy
that
is
fewer
searches
of
those
who
are
innocent
and
more
searches
of
those
who
are
in
fact
engaged
in
criminal
activity
there
is
nothing
inherent
about
these
tests
that
would
forbid
courts
from
adopting
quantitative
standards
but
courts
have
been
extremely
reluctant
to
do
so
n
in
the
next
part
we
will
talk
about
the
feasibility
of
such
a
shift
iii
making
big
data
work
in
the
criminal
justice
system
under
current
law
a
police
officer
seeking
a
search
warrant
states
that
she
believes
there
is
probable
cause
to
believe
that
contraband
will
be
found
in
the
suspect
s
house
and
a
judge
appraises
that
assertion
by
reviewing
and
evaluating
the
facts
that
the
police
officer
places
in
her
affidavit
including
the
credibility
of
any
informants
and
of
the
police
officer
herself
the
judge
then
reaches
her
own
conclusion
about
whether
a
person
of
reasonable
caution
would
believe
that
contraband
is
present
at
the
location
in
a
world
of
predictive
algorithms
the
police
officer
will
instead
present
the
magistrate
with
the
output
of
a
computer
program
which
states
that
there
is
a
chance
that
contraband
will
be
found
in
the
suspect
s
house
the
judge
will
then
examine
the
algorithm
that
was
used
to
ensure
that
it
meets
the
appropriate
legal
standards
and
will
then
make
a
ruling
as
to
whether
the
prediction
is
sufficient
to
establish
probable
cause
depending
on
the
circumstances
the
judge
may
make
a
decision
based
solely
on
the
output
of
the
algorithm
the
outcome
determinative
model
or
she
may
consider
the
output
of
the
algorithm
as
one
factor
to
combine
with
other
relevant
facts
the
formal
factor
model
as
we
have
seen
in
the
previous
parts
in
order
to
reach
this
world
we
must
overcome
a
number
of
obstacles
first
the
judge
needs
to
know
that
the
computer
is
not
using
discriminatory
factors
or
data
that
merely
reinforces
past
discrimination
second
the
judge
will
need
to
confirm
that
at
least
some
of
the
factors
used
by
the
computer
are
specific
to
this
particular
suspect
and
that
the
figure
is
not
merely
derived
from
aggregate
group
probability
figures
if
the
algorithm
has
no
factors
that
are
based
on
individualized
suspicion
a
judge
needs
to
combine
the
result
with
specific
facts
about
this
particular
suspect
in
order
to
arrive
at
her
own
prediction
and
finally
we
need
to
know
whether
the
chance
of
finding
contraband
or
whatever
number
the
judge
settles
on
after
factoring
in
other
information
is
sufficient
to
convince
a
judge
that
a
person
of
reasonable
caution
would
believe
that
contraband
is
present
in
order
to
overcome
this
final
problem
courts
must
overcome
their
hostility
to
quantifying
the
legal
standards
that
make
up
the
backbone
of
criminal
procedure
thus
in
order
to
create
a
system
where
police
officers
and
judges
use
data
centric
mechanical
predictions
in
making
their
decisions
two
major
changes
must
occur
first
the
predictive
algorithms
must
be
sufficiently
transparent
to
allow
judges
to
ensure
that
the
algorithm
is
not
relying
upon
unconstitutional
factors
either
directly
or
indirectly
in
reaching
its
conclusions
transparency
is
also
required
so
that
judges
can
ensure
that
at
least
some
of
the
factors
leading
to
this
number
are
specific
to
this
particular
suspect
and
as
we
will
see
transparency
is
also
necessary
so
that
judges
can
add
additional
factors
to
these
algorithms
in
order
to
adjust
their
results
to
the
facts
of
a
specific
case
second
courts
must
overcome
their
resistance
to
quantifying
these
legal
standards
so
that
the
numerical
results
from
mechanical
predictions
can
be
applied
to
these
legal
determinations
as
part
of
overcoming
that
reluctance
in
some
cases
judges
must
also
become
comfortable
with
manipulating
these
probabilities
and
combining
them
with
other
factors
in
order
to
reach
their
own
independent
conclusions
a
transparent
algorithms
and
data
sets
the
first
step
is
to
convince
companies
who
make
these
algorithms
to
share
the
details
of
their
operation
if
not
the
source
code
at
least
the
factors
that
their
predictive
models
consider
and
the
weight
that
the
models
assign
to
each
factor
the
transparency
requirement
is
necessary
not
only
for
the
algorithm
itself
but
also
for
the
underlying
data
sets
in
order
to
avoid
the
ratchet
effect
discussed
earlier
n
courts
need
to
be
able
to
examine
the
underlying
evidence
being
used
by
the
algorithm
to
ensure
that
they
are
not
already
tainted
by
race
or
by
proxies
for
race
and
if
they
are
the
data
sets
need
to
be
adjusted
in
order
to
remove
the
taint
greater
transparency
for
the
data
sets
will
also
help
with
another
growing
problem
with
our
increasing
reliance
on
big
data
erroneous
information
in
the
government
and
private
databases
upon
which
these
algorithms
rely
n
as
we
have
seen
earlier
police
are
already
relying
on
these
predictive
algorithms
to
direct
resources
and
place
certain
people
under
suspicion
so
cleansing
the
algorithms
of
discriminatory
factors
and
purging
inaccurate
information
is
already
long
overdue
another
reason
to
mandate
transparency
is
to
ensure
that
the
individualized
suspicion
requirement
is
met
as
noted
above
n
some
predictive
algorithms
may
base
their
conclusions
solely
on
group
membership
and
external
factors
thus
violating
the
legal
requirement
that
reasonable
suspicion
or
probable
cause
be
based
on
individualized
suspicion
if
the
inputs
used
by
the
algorithm
are
open
for
the
judge
to
examine
then
she
can
ensure
that
the
conclusion
is
based
on
the
appropriate
level
of
individual
activity
and
if
there
are
no
inputs
based
on
individualized
suspicion
the
judge
must
demand
additional
facts
from
the
law
enforcement
officer
in
order
to
establish
individualized
suspicion
that
is
she
will
be
forced
to
switch
from
an
outcome
determinative
use
of
predictive
algorithms
to
a
formal
factor
model
unfortunately
up
until
now
companies
have
been
extremely
secretive
about
the
details
of
their
predictive
algorithms
presumably
because
they
consider
these
details
to
be
valuable
proprietary
information
n
the
company
that
provides
the
beware
software
to
police
departments
does
not
even
allow
the
police
departments
to
know
the
details
of
the
algorithm
n
recently
the
american
civil
liberties
union
aclu
had
to
make
a
public
records
request
to
the
fresno
police
seeking
information
about
the
factors
used
by
its
predictive
software
the
results
still
did
not
provide
anything
like
the
kind
of
transparency
necessary
to
evaluate
the
constitutionality
of
the
program
n
this
secrecy
is
not
limited
to
private
corporations
even
private
individuals
who
design
these
algorithms
refuse
to
disclose
exactly
how
they
work
n
thus
far
this
secrecy
has
not
posed
significant
legal
problems
since
predictive
algorithms
are
only
being
used
to
direct
police
resources
but
this
is
likely
to
change
in
the
near
future
regardless
of
whether
police
and
courts
begin
to
use
predictive
algorithms
to
establish
legal
cause
to
stop
or
search
there
is
growing
concern
that
the
use
of
mechanical
predictions
is
merely
a
sophisticated
form
of
racial
profiling
n
and
if
police
want
to
continue
to
use
algorithms
in
any
capacity
they
will
need
to
reveal
or
require
their
client
companies
to
reveal
the
details
of
these
algorithms
this
greater
transparency
will
not
only
reassure
the
public
and
the
courts
that
the
determinative
factors
used
by
the
algorithm
are
not
related
to
race
but
it
will
also
lay
the
groundwork
for
adopting
these
algorithms
more
formally
into
the
legal
system
and
not
incidentally
it
may
reveal
that
some
algorithms
are
relying
on
forbidden
factors
in
reaching
their
conclusions
which
of
course
would
require
the
algorithm
to
be
redesigned
with
the
offending
factors
removed
the
aclu
s
recent
public
records
request
for
example
revealed
that
one
of
the
fresno
police
department
s
predictive
software
algorithms
used
the
social
media
hashtag
blacklivesmatter
as
a
risk
factor
for
police
hate
crimes
n
but
requiring
the
software
engineers
and
statisticians
who
design
mechanical
predictions
to
reveal
the
factors
being
used
and
the
weights
assigned
to
each
factor
is
only
the
first
step
modern
day
predictive
software
is
not
static
the
more
sophisticated
algorithms
will
adjust
the
factors
as
they
go
learning
from
past
experience
as
the
algorithm
makes
thousands
or
millions
of
predictions
it
will
be
told
which
of
those
predictions
ended
up
being
accurate
and
it
will
change
the
weight
assigned
to
each
of
its
factors
accordingly
to
improve
its
accuracy
this
process
known
as
machine
learning
n
ensures
that
the
algorithm
s
mechanical
predictions
improve
with
time
but
it
makes
it
even
more
difficult
for
the
courts
to
evaluate
the
degree
to
which
each
factor
is
relevant
to
the
machine
s
conclusions
n
as
one
scholar
has
noted
f
orecasting
becomes
a
distinct
activity
that
differs
from
explanation
what
matters
most
is
forecasting
accuracy
combining
explanation
with
forecasting
can
compromise
both
n
in
other
words
the
most
accurate
algorithms
those
that
use
machine
learning
to
sift
through
millions
of
different
data
points
may
be
the
least
transparent
n
however
as
we
have
seen
in
other
contexts
in
the
criminal
justice
system
it
is
possible
to
overcome
these
obstacles
a
judge
does
not
really
need
an
intricate
understanding
of
the
underlying
code
of
the
algorithm
she
only
needs
to
know
the
factors
that
the
algorithm
used
and
the
historical
accuracy
of
algorithm
s
results
n
although
the
experts
who
design
the
algorithm
need
to
consider
hundreds
or
thousands
of
data
points
in
order
to
determine
which
ones
are
the
most
predictive
for
practical
reasons
the
actual
algorithm
will
probably
only
use
eight
or
nine
factors
just
like
the
sentencing
risk
assessment
tools
n
thus
the
first
piece
of
information
should
be
easy
for
law
enforcement
to
provide
since
presumably
it
is
law
enforcement
officers
who
input
the
data
and
the
accuracy
of
the
results
should
easily
be
available
since
an
integral
part
of
developing
big
data
s
algorithms
is
to
calculate
and
then
improve
on
the
accuracy
of
the
predictions
that
are
being
made
once
the
judge
obtains
this
information
she
would
then
need
to
evaluate
whether
the
specific
inputs
are
proxies
for
a
forbidden
factor
such
as
race
n
and
whether
they
contain
sufficient
particularity
to
justify
the
stop
search
or
arrest
n
in
other
words
the
judge
does
not
need
to
know
exactly
how
the
algorithm
arrived
at
its
results
only
which
factors
it
considered
in
doing
so
the
judge
would
also
have
to
determine
whether
the
accuracy
of
the
algorithm
is
sufficient
to
meet
the
reasonable
suspicion
or
probable
cause
standard
a
question
we
turn
to
in
the
next
section
and
if
a
judge
did
want
to
understand
the
way
the
algorithm
processed
the
inputs
she
would
not
have
to
personally
decipher
the
meaning
of
the
underlying
source
code
much
less
understand
the
evolution
of
the
data
in
a
machine
learning
environment
just
as
judges
hear
from
experts
in
a
daubert
hearing
when
they
are
called
upon
to
determine
the
reliability
of
a
new
and
complex
scientific
process
a
judge
who
is
called
upon
to
evaluate
the
methodology
and
reliability
of
a
predictive
algorithm
could
also
listen
to
experts
testifying
from
both
sides
n
this
transparency
requirement
should
be
seen
not
as
a
weakness
of
adopting
mechanical
predictions
but
as
one
of
its
strengths
courts
currently
rely
on
a
combination
of
their
own
intuition
an
internal
subjective
algorithm
and
experience
an
internal
limited
database
when
reviewing
the
decisions
of
a
police
officer
decisions
that
are
made
based
on
a
combination
of
the
police
officer
s
intuition
and
experience
it
has
already
been
conclusively
demonstrated
that
these
intuitions
are
subject
to
significant
levels
of
racial
bias
n
but
it
is
difficult
for
a
magistrate
to
know
if
or
to
what
degree
her
own
intuition
may
be
suffering
from
this
problem
likewise
the
magistrate
s
personal
experiences
are
likely
based
in
part
on
problematic
data
these
hidden
biases
are
very
difficult
to
remove
from
a
person
s
decision
making
process
n
with
the
proper
transparency
requirements
however
these
biases
can
be
easily
detected
in
algorithms
and
data
sets
of
mechanical
predictions
b
quantifying
the
legal
standards
lack
of
transparency
is
not
only
a
problem
for
those
who
collect
and
process
the
data
but
also
for
those
who
use
the
data
that
is
the
judges
who
apply
the
legal
standards
if
the
quantified
results
from
the
world
of
big
data
are
going
to
be
used
effectively
in
the
courts
judges
will
need
to
update
the
legal
standards
that
they
use
setting
a
number
perhaps
the
most
challenging
aspect
of
adopting
predictive
algorithms
is
determining
the
quantified
percentage
to
match
up
with
reasonable
suspicion
or
probable
cause
n
the
vagueness
of
the
current
rules
obscures
any
attempt
to
determine
how
much
suspicion
is
actually
necessary
to
reach
these
standards
and
courts
have
routinely
stated
that
these
standards
should
not
or
even
cannot
be
reduced
to
mere
numerical
probabilities
n
but
if
the
criminal
justice
system
is
going
to
benefit
from
the
increased
accuracy
and
potential
reduction
of
unfair
bias
that
is
offered
by
predictive
algorithms
courts
will
need
to
overcome
their
hostility
to
quantification
quantifying
these
standards
may
lead
to
other
benefits
as
well
one
positive
side
effect
of
greater
quantification
is
the
possibility
of
creating
precise
standards
for
different
situations
what
professor
christopher
slobogin
refers
to
as
the
proportionality
principle
n
courts
or
legislatures
could
craft
specific
standards
for
the
most
intrusive
searches
such
as
wiretaps
or
bodily
intrusions
and
lower
standards
on
a
sliding
scale
as
searches
become
less
invasive
searches
of
homes
searches
of
cars
searches
of
offices
frisks
flyovers
surveilling
public
spaces
n
of
course
courts
and
legislatures
already
have
created
these
different
standards
to
some
degree
n
but
the
lack
of
quantification
has
made
this
process
confusing
and
limited
the
number
of
tiers
that
can
realistically
be
created
other
commentators
have
argued
that
quantifying
the
probable
cause
standard
would
enable
courts
to
adopt
a
sliding
scale
based
on
the
severity
of
the
crime
being
investigated
n
courts
have
so
far
been
reluctant
to
entertain
this
idea
generally
holding
that
one
standard
should
apply
across
the
board
to
every
criminal
investigation
n
but
as
professor
craig
lerner
has
pointed
out
courts
have
dropped
some
hints
that
the
probable
cause
standard
should
be
lower
for
police
investigating
a
mass
shooting
or
a
kidnapped
child
than
they
would
be
for
a
low
level
drug
possession
case
n
judge
richard
posner
for
example
writing
an
en
banc
decision
for
the
seventh
circuit
held
that
probable
cause
should
be
a
function
of
the
gravity
of
the
crime
in
the
context
of
exigent
circumstances
n
this
type
of
sliding
scale
would
be
all
but
impossible
to
administer
with
the
current
broad
standards
only
with
greater
precision
can
courts
make
meaningful
distinctions
in
different
contexts
professor
erica
goldberg
also
points
out
that
the
imprecise
nature
of
the
current
standards
for
probable
cause
tends
to
create
a
very
low
bar
in
practice
because
of
the
good
faith
exception
to
the
exclusionary
rule
n
under
this
exception
even
if
a
reviewing
court
finds
that
a
warrant
lacked
probable
cause
the
illegally
obtained
evidence
will
still
be
admissible
as
long
as
the
officer
acted
in
good
faith
that
is
as
long
as
the
warrant
was
not
so
lacking
in
probable
cause
as
to
render
official
belief
in
its
existence
entirely
unreasonable
n
a
vague
probable
cause
standard
means
that
many
warrants
that
fall
short
of
the
probable
cause
standard
will
in
practice
result
in
evidence
that
can
be
used
in
trial
as
long
as
the
lack
of
probable
cause
was
not
obvious
to
the
officer
n
if
the
probable
cause
standard
were
quantified
it
could
also
be
enforced
with
more
regularity
against
police
officers
who
would
be
much
less
able
to
claim
the
good
faith
exception
when
a
warrant
did
not
in
fact
meet
the
proper
standard
there
is
a
possibility
that
if
we
use
actual
data
to
run
these
analyses
we
will
learn
that
our
standards
for
stops
arrests
and
warrants
are
embarrassingly
low
for
example
we
may
learn
that
the
standard
hit
rate
for
terry
stops
is
and
the
average
hit
rate
for
search
warrants
is
that
is
that
police
officers
conduct
terry
stops
on
individuals
with
only
a
one
in
fifty
chance
that
the
suspect
is
engaged
in
criminal
activity
and
judges
are
issuing
search
warrants
even
though
there
is
only
a
one
in
ten
chance
of
finding
contraband
at
the
named
location
we
may
also
learn
that
these
rates
vary
wildly
depending
on
the
jurisdiction
n
the
suspected
crime
and
as
we
have
already
seen
the
race
of
the
suspect
n
this
information
will
be
yet
another
fringe
benefit
of
shifting
to
a
quantitative
model
if
courts
learn
that
they
are
in
fact
using
a
rate
for
reasonable
suspicion
we
can
have
a
real
debate
about
whether
this
number
is
too
low
and
if
so
what
the
number
ought
to
be
such
a
debate
is
nearly
impossible
to
have
now
because
the
current
standards
are
shrouded
in
intentionally
ambiguous
legalese
once
we
agree
on
a
number
that
number
can
be
imposed
consistently
throughout
the
country
no
longer
will
individuals
in
the
city
be
subjected
to
one
standard
while
individuals
in
the
suburb
receive
a
more
deferential
standard
similar
standards
will
apply
to
those
suspected
of
tax
fraud
as
to
those
suspected
of
possessing
heroin
this
type
of
equality
is
simply
not
feasible
under
our
current
system
yet
another
benefit
to
quantification
will
be
greater
transparency
in
the
factors
that
police
and
courts
use
to
make
these
decisions
n
for
example
consider
the
case
law
surrounding
terry
frisks
which
shows
courts
struggling
to
determine
when
there
is
reasonable
suspicion
to
believe
a
suspect
is
armed
one
commonly
cited
factor
is
the
type
of
crime
the
person
is
suspected
of
having
committed
courts
have
consistently
held
that
some
crimes
such
as
robbery
n
narcotics
trafficking
n
growing
large
amounts
of
marijuana
n
rape
n
or
burglary
n
all
involve
a
high
risk
of
the
suspect
carrying
a
weapon
and
are
thus
a
legitimate
factor
in
determining
whether
the
suspect
is
armed
n
but
is
the
nature
of
the
crime
enough
on
its
own
to
create
reasonable
suspicion
is
it
enough
when
combined
with
one
other
observation
by
the
police
officer
such
as
a
furtive
move
or
a
suspicious
bulge
generally
courts
will
find
that
if
the
officer
reasonably
believes
that
the
suspect
is
guilty
of
one
of
these
weapons
likely
crimes
then
that
belief
is
sufficient
to
create
reasonable
suspicion
that
a
suspect
is
armed
n
but
surely
the
risk
of
a
suspect
carrying
a
weapon
is
not
identical
for
all
five
of
those
crimes
so
in
theory
courts
should
require
some
corroboration
in
the
case
of
certain
suspected
crimes
and
less
or
none
in
the
case
of
others
this
is
not
what
happens
courts
merely
state
that
the
suspected
crime
is
likely
to
involve
the
use
of
weapons
n
and
then
generally
find
that
the
frisk
was
justified
meanwhile
other
suspected
crimes
such
as
passing
counterfeit
money
n
or
possession
of
illegal
drugs
n
are
held
to
not
be
a
legitimate
factor
that
is
an
individual
suspected
of
these
crimes
has
absolutely
no
greater
likelihood
than
anyone
else
to
be
carrying
a
weapon
in
reaching
these
conclusions
courts
generally
rely
on
their
intuition
rather
than
any
actual
evidence
that
indicates
the
prevalence
or
dearth
of
weapons
on
suspects
who
commit
these
crimes
and
in
the
absence
of
empirical
evidence
courts
create
a
false
binary
categorization
suspicion
of
certain
crimes
generates
reasonable
suspicion
on
its
own
while
suspicion
of
other
crimes
does
not
add
to
the
probability
of
a
weapon
being
present
occasionally
courts
do
venture
into
the
realm
of
data
when
deciding
whether
reasonable
suspicion
or
probable
cause
exist
with
decidedly
mixed
results
in
a
recent
case
the
ninth
circuit
attempted
to
determine
if
suspicion
of
domestic
violence
was
a
legitimate
factor
in
determining
whether
the
individual
was
armed
n
the
majority
held
that
suspicion
of
domestic
violence
did
not
increase
the
likelihood
of
the
suspect
possessing
a
weapon
to
support
its
conclusion
the
court
cited
studies
that
concluded
that
domestic
violence
calls
for
service
account
for
a
relatively
small
proportion
of
the
overall
rate
of
police
officers
murders
and
that
of
domestic
violence
victims
had
at
some
point
in
their
lives
been
threatened
or
harmed
by
a
weapon
during
a
domestic
violence
incident
n
the
dissent
cited
fbi
studies
demonstrating
that
of
assaults
on
police
officers
in
a
recent
year
were
committed
while
police
were
responding
to
disturbance
calls
which
is
a
category
which
includes
domestic
violence
calls
and
that
over
a
ten
year
period
three
times
more
police
officers
were
killed
responding
to
domestic
violence
calls
than
those
responding
to
burglary
calls
n
none
of
these
studies
establish
any
quantitative
probability
that
perpetrators
of
domestic
violence
use
or
carry
weapons
they
merely
establish
the
undeniable
fact
that
perpetrators
of
domestic
violence
sometimes
carry
weapons
and
sometimes
pose
a
risk
to
police
officers
n
the
court
did
cite
one
seemingly
useful
study
a
bureau
of
justice
report
covering
seven
years
which
concluded
that
of
domestic
violence
attacks
involved
a
weapon
n
but
this
statistic
is
almost
certainly
too
crude
to
be
useful
like
burglary
or
narcotics
trafficking
the
crime
of
domestic
violence
encompasses
many
different
kinds
of
behavior
some
of
them
probably
linked
to
a
high
likelihood
of
weapons
possession
and
some
linked
to
a
relatively
low
likelihood
n
in
order
to
effectively
use
statistics
courts
will
need
more
sophisticated
and
detailed
data
which
can
be
applied
to
the
facts
of
the
specific
case
did
the
alleged
domestic
violence
occur
at
home
or
in
a
public
place
what
percentage
of
individuals
living
in
the
neighborhood
possess
firearms
are
the
police
responding
at
night
or
during
the
daytime
this
type
of
detailed
data
needs
to
be
developed
so
that
it
can
be
used
by
the
courts
without
it
courts
may
identify
these
factors
as
relevant
but
then
apply
their
own
flawed
intuition
as
to
how
each
factor
affects
the
ultimate
question
of
reasonable
suspicion
of
course
even
if
better
data
were
available
the
data
would
be
insufficient
without
a
quantitative
standard
to
judge
it
against
assume
that
the
court
had
access
to
a
database
that
stated
that
of
all
the
domestic
violence
calls
in
this
neighborhood
during
this
time
of
day
in
the
past
five
years
of
the
suspects
were
armed
when
the
police
arrived
would
that
constitute
reasonable
suspicion
if
not
how
close
is
it
close
enough
that
a
suspicious
movement
by
the
suspect
is
enough
to
put
the
risk
across
the
line
n
without
a
quantified
definition
of
reasonable
suspicion
judges
are
unable
to
answer
these
questions
and
so
instead
they
create
an
inaccurate
binary
distinction
among
different
types
of
crimes
thus
we
need
to
set
a
quantified
percentage
chance
for
reasonable
suspicion
or
probable
cause
as
we
saw
earlier
judges
appear
to
have
widely
divergent
views
as
to
this
question
with
survey
results
varying
widely
but
averaging
at
for
reasonable
suspicion
and
for
probable
cause
n
the
supreme
court
has
implied
n
and
lower
courts
have
stated
n
that
the
probable
cause
standard
does
not
mean
more
probable
than
not
which
places
the
probable
cause
standard
at
less
than
most
commentators
also
agree
that
probable
cause
is
something
close
to
but
just
less
than
n
while
scattered
evidence
from
prosecutors
and
law
enforcement
point
to
numbers
between
and
n
one
way
to
derive
a
specific
number
for
these
standards
is
to
reverse
engineer
the
stops
and
searches
that
have
been
approved
under
the
current
law
in
other
words
we
can
measure
the
hit
rates
for
stops
and
searches
that
courts
have
approved
using
the
traditional
standards
this
should
provide
us
with
a
number
that
is
at
least
above
the
minimum
level
of
suspicion
that
is
required
for
example
if
across
the
country
courts
approve
of
probable
cause
searches
and
police
find
contraband
in
of
those
searches
we
can
know
that
generally
a
prediction
which
is
accurate
is
at
least
high
enough
to
satisfy
the
probable
cause
standard
unfortunately
there
are
not
many
statistics
available
but
we
do
have
some
actual
data
from
the
real
world
that
can
be
used
as
a
starting
point
for
example
the
district
court
in
the
floyd
case
held
that
the
terry
stops
in
new
york
city
in
the
early
s
were
often
conducted
without
reasonable
suspicion
these
stops
had
a
hit
rate
thus
the
floyd
judge
apparently
considers
a
rate
to
be
too
low
n
in
contrast
we
know
that
before
the
new
york
police
department
began
its
aggressive
stop
and
frisk
policy
its
hit
rate
for
terry
stops
was
a
more
respectable
n
reviewing
probable
cause
searches
of
automobiles
provides
some
real
world
data
as
to
the
percentage
chance
necessary
to
establish
probable
cause
an
independent
review
of
the
san
antonio
police
showed
that
their
probable
cause
automobile
searches
resulted
in
a
hit
rate
of
n
as
part
of
a
settlement
of
a
federal
civil
rights
action
in
maryland
state
troopers
were
required
to
report
every
stop
and
search
of
a
car
on
their
highways
n
which
showed
a
hit
rate
for
probable
cause
searches
n
and
a
review
of
the
florida
state
police
showed
a
success
rate
for
such
searches
n
another
way
to
estimate
the
number
is
to
look
at
cases
involving
alerts
by
drug
sniffing
dogs
which
can
constitute
probable
cause
as
long
as
the
dog
s
reliability
has
been
established
n
thus
when
a
court
needs
to
determine
whether
a
positive
alert
by
a
drug
dog
is
sufficient
to
establish
probable
cause
the
supreme
court
has
instructed
the
reviewing
judge
to
consider
the
training
and
past
performance
of
the
drug
dog
in
controlled
testing
environments
n
lower
courts
have
already
albeit
grudgingly
approved
specific
numerical
success
rates
for
drug
dogs
as
sufficient
to
establish
that
the
dog
s
positive
alert
creates
probable
cause
holding
that
accuracy
rates
of
n
n
n
and
n
were
all
sufficient
to
satisfy
the
probable
cause
standard
n
on
the
other
hand
professor
max
minzner
points
out
that
the
success
rate
for
search
warrants
which
allegedly
use
the
same
probable
cause
standard
are
much
higher
somewhere
between
and
n
although
this
dramatic
disparity
between
different
applications
of
the
probable
cause
standard
makes
it
more
challenging
to
determine
the
proper
number
through
reverse
engineering
it
provides
yet
another
compelling
reason
to
quantify
the
standard
are
courts
being
too
lenient
in
reviewing
probable
cause
for
warrantless
searches
or
are
they
requiring
too
high
a
showing
for
warrant
applications
or
perhaps
we
want
two
different
standards
one
for
the
on
the
spot
decisions
made
by
police
officers
and
one
for
the
greater
legitimacy
and
presumed
legality
of
search
warrants
none
of
these
questions
can
be
truly
addressed
until
the
probable
cause
standard
is
quantified
from
this
brief
review
of
the
available
data
we
can
see
that
hit
rates
for
stops
and
searches
vary
depending
on
the
jurisdiction
and
even
on
the
context
in
which
the
standard
is
applied
thus
if
we
want
to
reverse
engineer
percentages
for
reasonable
suspicion
and
probable
cause
from
the
existing
standards
we
will
need
data
from
a
much
broader
set
of
studies
however
even
the
small
amount
of
data
that
we
have
so
far
confirms
the
estimates
of
commentators
and
courts
that
the
number
for
probable
cause
is
somewhere
between
and
n
there
is
very
little
data
on
the
success
rate
for
stop
and
frisks
that
have
been
approved
by
courts
but
the
floyd
case
implies
that
is
too
low
n
and
we
know
that
the
number
has
to
be
significantly
less
than
the
to
range
for
probable
cause
in
one
sense
the
use
of
predictive
algorithms
to
establish
reasonable
suspicion
or
probable
cause
is
not
so
revolutionary
the
supreme
court
has
not
been
averse
to
using
statistical
data
in
other
fourth
amendment
contexts
for
example
when
the
court
was
determining
whether
a
drunk
driving
checkpoint
was
reasonable
under
the
special
needs
doctrine
it
noted
that
the
checkpoint
resulted
in
a
hit
rate
for
drunk
drivers
n
and
also
that
similar
checkpoints
around
the
country
had
a
hit
rate
n
and
as
noted
above
lower
courts
already
routinely
evaluate
the
reliability
of
certain
tools
such
as
drug
dogs
that
are
used
to
demonstrate
probable
cause
n
the
need
for
courts
to
use
success
rates
to
evaluate
probable
cause
will
only
increase
as
sophisticated
investigative
technologies
such
as
facial
recognition
software
or
gun
detectors
become
more
widely
used
in
a
sense
predictive
algorithms
will
be
doctrinally
no
different
from
these
other
tools
that
are
already
being
used
to
establish
probable
cause
using
the
number
once
a
number
is
set
for
reasonable
suspicion
and
probable
cause
the
next
step
is
to
decide
whether
the
results
from
the
predictive
algorithms
will
be
determinative
of
the
outcome
or
whether
they
will
merely
be
one
of
a
number
of
factors
used
by
officers
and
judges
as
an
example
take
professor
andrew
ferguson
s
modern
day
recreation
of
detective
mcfadden
observing
john
terry
on
the
streets
of
cleveland
mcfadden
observes
john
terry
and
using
facial
recognition
technology
identifies
him
and
begins
to
investigate
using
big
data
detective
mcfadden
learns
through
a
database
search
that
terry
has
a
prior
criminal
record
including
a
couple
of
convictions
and
a
number
of
arrests
mcfadden
learns
through
pattern
matching
links
that
terry
is
an
associate
a
hanger
on
of
a
notorious
violent
local
gangster
billy
cox
who
had
been
charged
with
several
murders
mcfadden
also
learns
that
terry
has
a
substance
abuse
problem
and
is
addicted
to
drugs
n
now
let
us
take
the
next
step
and
assume
that
the
detective
plugs
all
of
john
terry
s
background
information
into
a
predictive
algorithm
which
tells
him
that
john
terry
has
a
chance
of
being
involved
in
criminal
activity
at
any
given
time
during
the
day
this
result
would
certainly
not
be
sufficient
to
create
reasonable
suspicion
then
our
modern
detective
mcfadden
could
do
some
more
quick
research
through
the
police
database
and
add
in
some
other
factors
for
example
that
terry
has
multiple
prior
convictions
for
armed
robbery
of
commercial
establishments
and
license
plate
data
connects
terry
to
prior
commercial
robberies
in
this
area
n
this
combined
with
the
earlier
information
about
terry
tells
the
detective
that
terry
has
a
chance
of
being
armed
with
an
illegal
weapon
at
any
given
time
we
still
do
not
have
anything
like
reasonable
suspicion
indeed
it
is
unlikely
that
mere
background
information
on
a
suspect
could
ever
rise
to
the
level
of
reasonable
suspicion
this
is
akin
to
saying
there
are
certain
people
who
are
so
suspicious
that
there
is
always
reasonable
grounds
to
believe
they
are
engaging
in
criminal
activity
anytime
they
are
seen
in
public
n
regardless
of
how
high
the
prediction
is
based
on
the
background
information
alone
detective
mcfadden
cannot
legally
have
reasonable
suspicion
at
this
point
because
he
has
not
yet
considered
any
individualized
conduct
on
the
part
of
terry
so
detective
mcfadden
must
incorporate
terry
s
individualized
conduct
into
the
calculus
as
it
turns
out
the
detective
sees
terry
pacing
back
and
forth
outside
a
commercial
establishment
multiple
times
looking
in
the
window
and
then
conferring
with
another
individual
n
however
the
modern
day
detective
mcfadden
has
two
options
he
can
take
the
chance
that
terry
is
carrying
an
illegal
weapon
and
then
incorporate
that
into
his
own
subjective
calculation
combining
that
factor
with
his
own
observations
of
terry
pacing
looking
and
conferring
n
or
he
can
simply
input
these
observations
into
the
algorithm
which
would
then
automatically
combine
these
observations
along
with
other
data
in
order
to
give
a
percentage
chance
that
the
suspect
was
in
fact
involved
in
criminal
activity
the
first
is
an
example
of
using
the
predictive
algorithm
as
a
factor
the
second
is
an
example
of
the
outcome
determinative
model
from
this
basic
example
we
can
see
that
the
outcome
determinative
option
has
a
number
of
advantages
first
it
will
be
simpler
for
officers
and
judges
to
apply
since
it
will
not
require
individual
officers
and
judges
to
process
numerical
probabilities
the
algorithm
will
literally
do
all
the
processing
itself
and
give
the
decision
maker
an
exact
number
the
predictive
algorithm
will
presumably
use
statistics
from
thousands
of
previous
cases
in
order
to
establish
whether
the
relevant
facts
create
the
level
of
suspicion
necessary
to
reach
reasonable
suspicion
or
probable
cause
these
results
and
thus
the
algorithm
itself
can
be
periodically
tested
every
few
months
to
ensure
they
are
still
reliable
and
as
part
of
that
testing
the
algorithm
can
be
adjusted
to
give
different
weights
to
different
types
of
data
or
even
to
add
or
remove
certain
types
of
data
altogether
second
the
outcome
determinative
model
will
minimize
the
potentially
biased
factors
that
human
decision
makers
apply
in
making
these
determinations
both
reasonable
suspicion
and
probable
cause
require
the
officer
to
show
specific
objective
facts
to
support
their
conclusion
n
and
forcing
police
officers
to
input
these
specific
facts
into
the
algorithm
will
make
it
harder
for
them
to
consciously
or
subconsciously
use
factors
based
on
race
the
purely
determinative
model
could
even
work
in
cases
where
the
police
officers
and
judges
need
to
evaluate
an
informant
s
reliability
to
make
a
probable
cause
determination
for
example
assume
that
a
reliable
algorithm
is
created
to
predict
the
chance
that
drugs
will
be
found
at
a
certain
location
it
requires
five
different
variables
in
order
to
produce
a
result
and
three
of
these
data
points
are
particularized
with
respect
to
the
suspect
s
observed
behavior
none
of
these
data
points
are
related
either
directly
or
indirectly
to
race
religion
or
any
other
protected
class
assume
that
a
police
officer
has
personal
knowledge
of
all
of
these
factors
and
inputs
them
into
the
software
which
predicts
a
chance
that
drugs
will
be
found
at
the
location
given
these
facts
a
court
will
almost
certainly
find
that
probable
cause
exists
and
a
search
warrant
should
be
issued
how
would
the
model
work
if
the
police
officer
does
not
have
any
personal
knowledge
about
the
case
and
instead
her
affidavit
quotes
an
informant
who
provides
the
information
about
all
five
variables
once
again
all
five
variables
are
entered
into
the
software
and
the
algorithm
predicts
a
chance
that
drugs
will
be
found
at
the
location
assuming
that
the
information
is
correct
how
can
the
algorithm
and
thus
the
judge
take
into
account
the
inevitable
reliability
questions
that
accompany
the
use
of
informants
in
order
to
preserve
the
purely
determinative
model
the
software
must
be
designed
so
that
the
credibility
of
the
informant
can
be
taken
into
account
as
part
of
the
algorithm
in
many
cases
this
would
be
feasible
generally
search
warrant
applications
only
have
a
few
different
categories
of
informants
known
informants
who
have
provided
accurate
information
in
the
past
known
informants
who
have
never
provided
information
before
anonymous
informants
etc
thus
these
specific
categories
could
be
inputs
into
the
software
so
that
after
each
relevant
factor
is
entered
the
algorithm
would
ask
about
the
source
of
the
fact
did
it
come
from
personal
observation
by
the
affiant
police
officer
or
from
an
informant
and
if
from
an
informant
how
much
is
known
about
the
informant
and
his
prior
track
record
n
these
categories
would
be
at
least
as
specific
as
the
descriptions
currently
used
by
police
officers
in
search
warrant
affidavits
any
outcome
determinative
model
in
this
context
will
require
a
far
more
sophisticated
algorithm
with
many
more
potential
inputs
for
the
different
behaviors
that
might
be
observed
and
in
designing
these
algorithms
the
programmers
will
need
to
stay
away
from
the
vague
factors
that
currently
cause
so
much
unreliability
and
are
open
to
abuse
such
as
furtive
movements
or
acting
suspiciously
n
other
inputs
such
as
suspicious
bulge
or
nervous
behavior
which
could
conceivably
refer
to
specific
facts
that
indicate
the
presence
of
criminal
activity
may
need
to
be
defined
with
more
specific
language
and
the
inputs
need
to
include
potentially
exculpatory
information
as
well
in
order
to
ensure
that
the
algorithm
complies
with
the
totality
of
the
circumstances
requirement
of
the
probable
cause
determination
n
given
these
practical
problems
it
is
unlikely
that
any
predictive
algorithm
could
ever
be
designed
that
contains
every
possible
type
of
specific
behavior
that
a
police
officer
might
use
in
making
a
reasonable
suspicion
or
probable
cause
determination
some
predictive
algorithms
could
be
designed
in
certain
basic
often
repeated
scenarios
observations
made
of
individuals
exiting
buildings
where
drugs
are
being
sold
observations
made
during
routine
traffic
stops
etc
n
but
the
potential
range
of
observed
activity
is
simply
too
broad
to
conceive
of
a
world
in
which
every
possible
relevant
factor
is
accounted
for
in
the
computer
programming
and
in
some
cases
the
police
officer
or
judge
may
have
her
own
opinion
about
the
reliability
of
an
informant
that
is
not
accurately
captured
by
the
five
or
six
traditional
categories
that
are
part
of
the
algorithm
s
inputs
furthermore
it
may
be
politically
unacceptable
to
take
human
beings
completely
out
of
the
loop
since
this
would
require
police
officers
and
judges
to
ignore
information
whether
inculpatory
or
exculpatory
that
is
highly
probative
to
the
reasonable
suspicion
probable
cause
determination
thus
there
will
be
some
situations
in
which
the
predictive
algorithm
is
merely
one
of
the
factors
that
the
judge
considers
in
these
cases
the
judge
will
need
to
incorporate
the
conclusions
of
the
predictive
algorithm
alongside
other
factors
we
will
call
these
independent
factors
to
indicate
that
they
are
above
and
beyond
the
factors
used
by
the
algorithm
for
example
assume
that
the
algorithm
uses
five
different
inputs
and
predicts
a
likelihood
that
drugs
will
be
found
at
a
given
location
the
judge
also
knows
about
three
independent
factors
that
on
their
own
do
not
quite
rise
to
the
level
of
probable
cause
the
judge
will
be
provided
with
the
prediction
by
the
software
if
the
predictive
algorithm
is
meant
to
be
one
of
the
many
factors
that
she
considers
she
would
then
need
to
combine
the
from
the
algorithm
and
the
unquantified
almost
but
not
quite
factors
from
her
own
judgment
how
does
she
balance
the
specific
number
from
the
algorithm
with
her
own
intuitive
conclusion
does
she
have
to
quantify
her
almost
but
not
quite
conclusion
assume
she
can
do
this
and
presumably
judges
would
get
better
at
this
task
with
practice
and
she
quantifies
her
subjective
conclusion
at
a
likelihood
how
much
weight
does
she
give
to
her
compared
to
the
from
the
algorithm
in
order
to
accurately
combine
the
results
from
the
predictive
algorithm
with
other
factors
we
need
to
take
two
steps
first
in
order
to
avoid
double
counting
we
need
to
separate
the
factors
that
have
already
been
considered
by
the
algorithm
from
the
factors
that
have
not
n
the
transparency
that
we
already
require
from
these
algorithms
should
make
this
task
easier
the
decision
maker
will
be
able
to
review
the
factors
that
have
already
been
considered
by
the
algorithm
and
then
remove
those
from
her
own
independent
analysis
second
the
decision
maker
must
use
the
predictive
algorithm
as
the
starting
point
and
then
adjust
the
percentage
chance
up
or
down
as
she
adds
in
the
independent
factors
one
method
of
doing
this
is
to
apply
bayes
theorem
which
is
a
process
of
combining
known
probabilities
with
new
evidence
in
order
to
create
a
new
updated
probability
n
the
predictive
algorithm
would
provide
the
decision
maker
with
a
base
rate
or
prior
probability
that
criminal
activity
is
present
and
then
the
decision
maker
would
apply
the
probability
of
criminal
activity
based
on
the
relevant
evidence
that
was
not
considered
by
the
predictive
algorithm
known
as
the
current
probability
n
this
extra
evidence
could
include
personal
observations
on
the
part
of
the
police
officer
assuming
those
observations
were
not
taken
into
account
by
the
algorithm
already
or
extra
information
about
the
reliability
of
the
informant
that
was
not
accounted
for
by
the
algorithm
as
an
example
let
s
return
to
the
modern
day
version
of
detective
mcfadden
and
john
terry
n
we
know
from
our
algorithm
based
only
on
background
information
about
john
terry
that
there
is
a
chance
that
terry
is
carrying
an
illegal
weapon
at
any
given
time
detective
mcfadden
then
observes
him
pacing
looking
and
conferring
and
realizes
this
is
exactly
the
kind
of
behavior
that
he
would
expect
a
potential
robber
to
engage
in
before
committing
the
crime
n
thus
detective
mcfadden
estimates
that
a
person
who
is
planning
a
robbery
is
likely
to
engage
in
the
kind
of
behavior
that
terry
is
currently
engaging
in
and
although
the
detective
realizes
that
there
are
some
innocent
explanations
for
this
kind
of
behavior
perhaps
terry
is
window
shopping
and
then
conferring
with
his
friend
about
what
to
buy
the
fact
that
terry
has
repeated
this
behavior
multiple
times
means
that
the
odds
of
him
not
planning
a
robbery
are
only
about
given
these
estimates
the
detective
can
complete
a
bayesian
calculation
or
more
likely
input
these
estimates
into
a
simple
calculator
that
will
then
conduct
the
bayesian
calculation
and
determine
that
the
chances
that
terry
is
engaged
in
criminal
activity
are
n
assuming
that
courts
set
the
standard
for
reasonable
suspicion
at
around
to
this
would
be
sufficient
to
establish
reasonable
suspicion
in
contrast
assume
that
our
modern
detective
mcfadden
like
the
real
life
detective
mcfadden
did
not
have
any
information
about
john
terry
s
background
instead
he
merely
observed
terry
s
suspicious
behavior
under
bayes
theorem
our
base
rate
would
be
much
lower
perhaps
we
recognize
that
this
is
a
high
crime
neighborhood
so
we
know
that
of
the
population
is
carrying
an
illegal
weapon
at
any
given
time
if
detective
mcfadden
makes
the
same
observations
as
before
and
he
calculates
the
same
odds
of
criminal
activity
based
on
those
observations
the
chances
that
terry
is
engaged
in
criminal
activity
drops
to
only
n
in
other
words
the
lower
base
rate
from
the
lack
of
big
data
makes
the
detective
s
prediction
of
criminal
activity
much
less
accurate
thus
even
if
predictive
algorithms
are
not
outcome
determinative
using
a
more
statistical
approach
to
determine
reasonable
suspicion
or
probable
cause
will
allow
police
officers
and
judges
to
incorporate
more
reliable
base
rates
into
their
calculations
predictive
algorithms
will
also
help
these
decision
makers
avoid
a
common
problem
when
making
predictions
ignoring
or
undervaluing
the
base
rate
as
can
be
seen
from
our
above
example
a
very
low
base
rate
or
prior
probability
for
potential
criminal
activity
means
that
even
very
suspicious
independent
factors
might
not
result
in
a
very
high
resulting
probability
studies
have
shown
that
individuals
who
make
predictions
frequently
undervalue
or
even
ignore
base
rates
and
give
too
much
weight
to
the
independent
factors
that
they
are
presented
with
n
forcing
police
officers
and
judges
to
incorporate
the
base
rate
in
making
their
calculations
would
be
another
benefit
of
using
a
quantified
system
of
criminal
procedure
of
course
the
more
we
allow
the
decision
makers
to
use
independent
factors
the
more
we
lose
the
benefits
of
predictive
algorithms
such
as
the
increased
accuracy
and
the
mitigation
of
subjective
and
potentially
biased
human
input
for
example
when
detective
mcfadden
enters
in
his
own
probability
estimates
into
the
bayesian
calculation
he
may
underestimate
the
chance
that
terry
has
an
innocent
explanation
for
his
conduct
because
terry
is
african
american
and
the
detective
has
an
irrational
implicit
bias
against
african
americans
this
would
result
in
a
higher
prediction
of
criminal
activity
for
terry
than
it
would
for
a
white
person
with
the
same
background
engaging
in
the
same
activity
thus
we
should
design
our
algorithms
to
avoid
the
need
for
independent
factors
as
much
as
possible
since
the
biases
in
the
algorithms
can
be
detected
and
minimized
conclusion
big
data
s
predictive
algorithms
have
the
potential
to
revolutionize
the
way
police
investigate
crime
and
the
way
the
courts
regulate
the
police
for
centuries
courts
have
been
crafting
legal
standards
for
police
officers
who
were
making
clinical
judgments
based
on
experience
and
intuition
the
imprecision
and
subjectivity
of
these
legal
standards
were
a
necessary
evil
they
were
required
given
the
subjective
factors
that
were
used
by
the
police
but
their
accuracy
could
not
be
tested
they
made
the
system
less
transparent
and
they
opened
the
door
to
vastly
inconsistent
and
frequently
discriminatory
results
with
the
rise
of
big
data
s
predictive
algorithms
we
have
an
opportunity
to
increase
the
accuracy
and
the
transparency
of
the
way
we
apply
the
standards
and
of
the
standards
themselves
making
the
system
more
efficient
more
fair
and
more
open
in
order
to
reap
these
benefits
we
need
to
ensure
that
the
predictive
algorithms
are
race
neutral
and
that
they
take
into
account
individual
suspicion
this
may
require
new
types
of
algorithms
that
are
specifically
designed
for
determining
reasonable
suspicion
and
probable
cause
it
will
certainly
require
that
the
algorithms
be
transparent
so
that
reviewing
courts
can
understand
what
factors
the
algorithm
is
using
more
controversially
we
need
to
update
the
definition
of
reasonable
suspicion
and
probable
cause
to
include
quantifiable
standards
although
courts
have
shown
a
strong
aversion
quantifying
standards
in
the
past
the
benefits
to
such
a
change
far
outweigh
the
costs
we
have
seen
that
some
courts
recognizing
this
fact
have
already
started
to
experiment
with
using
quantified
standards
when
evaluating
some
of
the
factors
put
forward
by
law
enforcement
officers
or
when
evaluating
the
tools
that
these
officers
use
in
determining
probable
cause
to
be
sure
a
system
of
mechanical
predictive
algorithms
and
quantified
legal
standards
will
not
be
perfect
it
will
probably
be
impossible
to
scrub
all
residue
of
racial
discrimination
from
the
existing
databases
and
police
officers
and
judges
will
almost
certainly
make
mistakes
when
trying
to
use
the
predictive
algorithms
as
base
rates
and
then
adding
their
own
independent
observations
and
the
predictive
algorithms
themselves
will
still
make
mistakes
and
thus
will
not
always
be
as
accurate
as
we
would
like
but
the
current
system
includes
the
implicit
and
sometimes
explicit
biases
of
police
officers
and
judges
vague
standards
that
can
be
manipulated
by
police
officers
which
are
more
or
less
incomprehensible
to
lay
people
and
accuracy
rates
when
they
can
be
measured
that
vary
wildly
from
jurisdiction
to
jurisdiction
the
time
has
come
for
courts
to
embrace
the
enhanced
precision
and
transparency
that
big
data
has
to
offer
footnotes

the
need

at
using

algorithms
to
determine
reasonable
suspicion

probable
cause
is
not
compatible
with
all
of
these
definitions
for
example
it
downplays
or
eliminates
the
use
of
human
intuition
and
will
frequently
start
with
an
analysis
of
a
suspect
rather
than
with
a
crime
but
these
algorithms
will
be
particularly
useful
if
one
adopts
professor
bambauer
s
concept
of
hassle
rates
since
they
focus
on
specific
hit
rates

miss
rates
that

easily

ferguson
further
argues
that
there
needs
to
be
a
link
between
the
suspect
s
suspicious
background
information
and
his
current
actions
courts
analyzing
big
data
suspicion
should
thus
be
careful
to
require
a
direct
link
between
the
past
data
about
a
suspect
and
the
observed
suspicion
id
otherwise
professor
ferguson
argues
that
the
background
information
is
irrelevant
to
the
reasonable
suspicion
analysis
id
it
is
not
clear
how
direct
the
link
would
have
to
be
however
many
different
types
of
criminal
activity
may
be
linked
together
in
an
officer
s
mind
such
as
prior
convictions
of
illegal
weapons
possession
combined
with
a
current
observation
indicating
possible
drug
dealing
id
the
linkage
could
be
even
more
indirect
and
yet
statistically
significant
when
big
data
is
used
for
example
assume
that
a
statistical
analysis
of
thousands
of
burglars
shows
that
individuals
who
have
prior
convictions
for
child
abuse
are
more
likely
to
commit
burglary
than
those
without
such
a
conviction
even
though
there
is
no
logical
link
between
the
two
crimes
this
fact
could
be
considered
as
one
factor
among
many
others
by
an
algorithm
determining
whether
probable
cause
exists
to
believe
a

introduction
in
july
dallas
police
chief
david
brown
decided
to
end
a
violent
standoff
n
with
micah
johnson
n
who
had
fatally
shot
five
officers
and
wounded
several
more
in
an
unusual
way
n
as
a
makeshift
solution
the
police
attached
a
pound
of
the
plastic
explosive
c
to
a
remotec
f
n
a
robot
designed
for
bomb
disposal
n
the
intentional
detonation
of
the
explosive
killed
johnson
and
was
the
first
deliberate
use
by
american
police
of
a
robot
armed
with
deadly
force
n
keep
in
mind
that
this
improvised
solution
was
a
remotely
controlled
robot
the
robot
was
not
designed
to
harm
people
and
it
lacked
any
ability
to
make
independent
decisions
n
nevertheless
the
use
of
the
robot
in
dallas
comes
at
a
time
when
many
people
are
predicting
that
sophisticated
police
robots
will
one
day
become
useful
cheap
and
ubiquitous
n
hundreds
of
robots
most
of
them
made
for
bomb
disposal
are
already
in
the
possession
of
local
police
departments
n
many
such
robots
will
soon
employ
artificial
intelligence
and
will
be
expected
to
operate
with
a
degree
of
independence
n
the
near
certain
use
of
these
robots
by
the
police
n
raises
questions
about
what
sorts
of
limits
and
regulations
should
be
imposed
on
their
use
n
consider
a
future
in
which
robots
could
supplement
or
replace
some
basic
police
functions
an
autonomous
police
vehicle
patrols
a
neighborhood
and
briefly
detains
a
person
deemed
suspicious
so
that
an
officer
miles
away
can
subject
him
to
questioning
n
during
the
detention
the
vehicle
dispatches
a
micro
drone
to
obtain
a
dna
identification
sample
n
or
consider
the
possibility
of
thousands
of
autonomous
police
drones
the
size
of
insects
flying
through
a
city
without
detection
to
conduct
surveillance
and
carrying
nano
chemicals
to
disable
dangerous
suspects
n
or
imagine
social
patrol
robots
that
dispense
advice
to
the
lost
record
surveillance
data
and
call
in
other
robots
to
assist
in
unexpectedly
hostile
situations
rapid
changes
in
technology
have
significantly
shifted
how
police
perform
their
jobs
the
squad
car
and
the
two
way
radio
provided
the
police
with
a
geographic
range

superior

new
powers

challenges
to
the

n
police

raise
special
questions
because
of
the
powers
we
entrust
to
the
police
if
the
development
of
military
robots
provides
any
guidance
then
we
can
expect
some
police
robots
to
be
artificially
intelligent

capable
of
using
legitimate
coercive

against

n

will
also
possess
these
powers

important
difference
we
will

to
exercise
deadly

already
spending
significant

we

the
kinds
of
regulatory
challenges
we
will
face
with
the
future
of

robots
i
putting
police
robots
in
context
a
what
is
a
robot
the
definition
of
a
police
robot
depends
on
the
definition
of
the
term
robot
itself
popular
depictions
of
robots
going
back
to
the
s
suggest
robots
are
machines
in
humanoid
form
think
of
the
maschinemensch
in
fritz

n
or
rosie
the
maid
robot
in
the
jetsons
n
yet
robots
neither
have
to
look
like
people
nor
behave
in
any
specific
way
robots
can
look
like
humans
animals
or
insects
they
can
provide
information
fire
upon
an
enemy
or
engage
in
financial
trades
indeed
there
is
no
single
definition
of
a
robot
n
an
emerging
consensus
has
suggested
however
that
a
robot
be
defined
as
any
machine
that
can
collect
information
process
it
and
use
it
to
act
upon
the
world
n
these
qualities
vary
widely
from
one
robot
to
another
this
sense
think
act
model
might
describe
anything
from
a
bot
that
makes
independent
online
purchases
n
to
an
eldercare
robot
that
provides
emotional
comfort
or
assists
with
lifting
objects
n
in
appearance
robots
could
take
any
form
some
military
robots
for
instance
may
assume
the
shape
of
four
legged
centaurs
to
enhance
stability
n
thus
if
a
robot
processes
information
it
senses
and
acts
upon
it
a
police
robot
does
so
in
order
to
perform
a
task
traditionally
assumed
by
human
police
officers
that
robots
might
look
alive
and
act
in
unpredictable
ways
also
distinguishes
them
from
other
technologies
those
special
attributes
of
robots
might
counsel
robot
specific
policies
robotics
law
scholar
ryan
calo
has
identified
these
qualities
as
embodiment
emergence
and
social
valence
n
first
the
physicality
of
robots
enables
them
to
translate
their
data
analysis
into
action
robots
act
upon
the
world
they
can
lift
objects
transport
people
create
art
and
engage
in
commerce
and
unlike
other
robots
that
may
cause
real
world
harm
through
accident
n
police
robots
at
least
some
of
them
will
be
designed
with
the
capacity
to
exercise
deliberate
coercive
force
that
physicality
creates
new
operational
possibilities
for
the
police
but
it
also
raises
new
types
of
concerns
when
autonomous
machines
may
be
able
to
harm
people
by
design
second
robots
with
artificial
intelligence
will
behave
in
ways
that
are
not
necessarily
predictable
to
their
human
creators
n
some
robots
may
just
replace
human
labor
in
jobs
that
are
repetitive
and
dull
but
others
will
be
capable
of
adapting
to
their
environment
learning
from
mistakes
and
become
increasingly
skilled
in
their
assigned
tasks
at
one
end
of
the
spectrum
a
robot
may
be
a
glorified
vacuum
cleaner
designed
to
address
the
drudgery
of
housecleaning
at
the
other
end
a
robot
s
artificial
intelligence
may
be
designed
not
only
to
act
upon
processed
information
but
also
to
improve
its
performance
over
time
by
learning
from
past
mistakes
n
not
all
of
this
learning
will
be
welcome
microsoft

disabled
its
social
chatbot
tay
after
it
incorporated

responses
and

speech
and

online
n
since
artificial
intelligence
would
drive
the
behavior
of
robots
robots
may
behave
in
ways
that
we
cannot
predict
or
even
explain
afterwards
n
artificial
intelligence
by
itself
is
not
unique
to
robotics
we
can
already
feel
the
impact
of
big
data
applying
complex
computer
algorithms
to
massive
sets
of
digitized
data
in
fields
like
finance
healthcare
and
even
policing
a
number
of
police
departments
already
use
artificial
intelligence
in
software
that
tries
to
identify
future
geographic
locations
where
crime
will
occur
to
predict
which
individuals
may
be
at
highest
risk
for
violent
crime
commission
or
victimization
and
to
identify
which
among
the
billions
of
daily
internet
posts
amount
to
suspicious
behavior
n
the
police
employ
these
big
data
tools
however
as
guidance
for
human
decisionmaking
robots
with
artificial
intelligence
are
distinct
because
they
would
be
able
to
translate
their
analysis
of
data
into
physical
action
third
robots
are
different
from
other
technologies
because
they
are
in
appearance
somewhere
between
inanimate
objects
and
humans
n
no
robot
today
will
fool
a
person
into
believing
that
it
is
alive
but
many
robots
do
not
seem
completely
inert
either
research
suggests
that
we
tend
to
approach
robots
as
if
they
had
human
characteristics
n
exploiting
the
human
like
nature
of
some
robots
could
be
useful
we
could
deliberately
design
caretaking
robots
to
be
physically
cute
such
as
rounded
shapes
humanoid
faces
to
maximize
their
benefits
whether
for
children
or
the
elderly
the
ambivalence
we
feel
toward
robots
might
also
counsel
new
legal
characterizations
particular
to
them
we
may
think
that
a
person
smashing
his
lawn
mower
merely
has
an
ill
temper
but
that
a
person
abusing
a
social
robot
is
cruel
n
if
robots
are
designed
to
serve
as
pets
caregivers
or
friends
could
robots
be
the
victims
of
criminal
assault
abuse
or
even
rape
and
murder
n
in
this
way
the
law
may
need
to
extend
some
legal
protections
to
robots
for
some
of
the
same
reasons
we
criminalize
animal
cruelty
n
we
prohibit
the
infliction
of
needless
violence
against
some
animals
because
such
behavior
reflects
something
depraved
about
the
perpetrator
though
we
may
not
mistake
robots
for
humans
yet
we
may
soon
reach
a
point
where
machines
endowed
with
artificial
intelligence
may
need
protection
from
human
abuse
b
military
robots
the
future
of
robotic
policing
can
now
be
found
in
developments
within
the
military
n
the
military
has
used
remote
controlled
robots
for
more
than
a
decade
n
the
department
of
defense
is
preparing
for
a
future
in
which
nearly
autonomous
robots
will
play
a
central
role
in
warfare
n
consequently
the
military
is
spending
the
most
money
and
attention
on
robotics
n
peter
w
singer
has
chronicled
these
changes
in
great
detail
and
argues
that
military
robots
will
change
not
just
the
tools
we
use
to
fight
wars
but
the
very
nature
of
war
itself
robots
are
in
use
in
active
conflicts
around
the
world
predators
global
hawks
and
ravens
have
flown
over
afghanistan
and
marcbots
have
aided
soldiers
on
the
ground
in
iraq
n
a
clear
advantage
of
robots
is
their
ability
to
act
as
force
multipliers
n
future
armies
may
assemble
attachments
that
include
as
few
as
human
soldiers
and
as
many
as
robots
n
more
importantly
however
autonomous
machines
capable
of
deadly
force
are
also
likely
to
change
military
tactics
and
strategy
unlike
people
robots
can
go
places
without
compromising
the
safety
of
soldiers

direct

n
robots
can
look
for
land
mines
and
protect
the
lives
of
soldiers

would
have
had

unmanned

the
future
may
find
wounded
soldiers
retrieve
them
and
autonomously

and
treat
them
while
retreating
from
the
battlefield
n
robots
can
also
behave
in
ways
that
humans
cannot
easily
mimic

looking
to
enhance

can
operate

and
weeks

that
relentless
attention
to

may
have
other
strategic
benefits
as
well
although
how
exactly
remains
unclear
how
will
human
combatants
facing
tireless
robotic
soldiers
feel
enemy
forces
may
buckle
in
the
face
of
robotic
soldiers
that
cannot
die
and
do
not
retreat
n
or
the
opposite
may
come
true
the
presence
of
robotic
soldiers
may
galvanize
enemy
forces
in
a
war
against
the
machines
n
alternatively
enemy
forces
may
simply
fight
back
with
their
own
robots
the
unique
characteristics
of
robots
will
also
shape
fundamental
military
tactics
one
application
of
robotics
imagines
swarms
of
small
robots
that
move
in
the
same
way
birds
and
insects
do
in
unison
though
without
a
defined
leader
n
in
nature
individual
bees
or
birds
do
not
rely
on
high
degrees
of
intelligence
to
avoid
crashing
into
each
other
rather
each
member
follows
simple
rules
robotic
swarms
can
work
this
way
without
sophisticated
programming
in
a
swarm
robots
could
assemble
together
rapidly
as
a
unit
and
then
just
as
quickly
disperse
to
continue
with
surveillance
missions
what
develops
first
in
the
military
often
finds
its
way
to
domestic
policing
there
has
long
been
a
close
relationship
between
both
the
culture
and
institutions
of
the
military
and
law
enforcement
the
bureaucratic
hierarchy
in
policing
adopting
titles
like
sergeant
lieutenant
and
captain
reflects
the
military
s
influence
n
not
only
are
many
rank
and
file
officers
former
members
of
the
military
many
police
departments
actively
recruit
from
their
ranks
as
well
n
we
even
use
war
metaphors
to
describe
our
domestic
policing
strategies
n
this
military
influence
extends
to
specific
tactics
and
technologies
used
by
the
police
while
the
federal
posse
comitatus
law
n
forbids
the
use
of
the
military
for
civilian
policing
military
equipment
and
training
has
trickled
down
to
police
departments
through
other
means
for
instance
the
so
called
program
part
of
the
national
defense
authorization
security
act
of
n
is
the
federal
initiative
that
has
transferred
surplus
military
equipment
such
as
mraps
mine
resistant
ambush
protected
vehicles
grenade
launchers
and
amphibious
tanks
to
local
police
departments
n
vvhile
the
public
may
have
been
shocked
at
images
of
police
officers
wearing
combat
fatigues
and
carrying
m
s
during
protests
in
ferguson
missouri
in
n
these
police
officers
were
little
different
from
the
hundreds
of
other
police
departments
who
had
been
recipients
of
military
equipment
transfers
under
the
program
n
similarly
police
swat
teams
now
common
in
police
departments
around
the
country
were
created
as
specialized
paramilitary
groups
former
lapd
chief
daryl
gates
credited
with
establishing
the
first
swat
teams
brought
in
ex
marines
to
help
train
these
small
groups
of
officers
to
act
and
dress
like
soldiers
in
volatile
situations
n
ii
the
challenges
posed
by
police
robots
imagine
police
robots
that
could
surround
a
suspicious
person
or
even
halt
a
speeding
car
n
this
might
take
the
form
of
a
swarm
of
small
robots
each
less
than
a
pound
designed
to
incapacitate
a
person
by
surrounding
him
and
by
using
nonlethal
force
consider
further
that
such
a
swarm
would
be
capable
of
using
some
form
of
coercive
force
to
prevent
an
unwillingly
detained
person
from
flight
a
multi
robot
pursuit
system
that
guides
packs
of
robots
to
search
for
and
detect
a
non
cooperative
human
part
of
a
pentagon
request
for
contractors
would
surely
be
useful
to
the
police
n
even
if
this
use
of
robots
is
still
just
a
concept
we
can
anticipate
the
kinds
of
legal
and
policy
challenges
that
might
arise
first
how
much
should
humans
remain
in
the
loop
maintain
some
degree
of
involvement
in
other
words
in
the
use
of
robot
police
n
second
how
much
coercive
force
should
we
permit
police
robots
to
exercise
third
how
might
the
use
of
police
robots
affect
legal
determinations
like
reasonable
force
fourth
will
police
robot
use
further
reinforce
the
social
inequities
in
policing
finally
how
can
we
develop
a
uniform
approach
to
policing
police
robots
a
how
much
control
should
humans
have
over
police
robots
how
much
should
police
delegate
decisions
about
force
and
coercion
to
their
own
robots
n
take
a
look
at
the
robotics
currently
on
the
market
the
idea
that
we
might
lose
control
over
them
seems
almost
laughable
no
consumer
today
fears
their
housekeeping
roomba
and
even
the
most
advanced
private
security
robot
available
now
could
be
disabled
by
a
swift
kick
but
technology
changes
fast
n
the
pentagon
s
autonomous
research
pilot
initiative
funds
research
for
algorithms
that
will
increase
a
system
s
level
of
autonomy
n
artificial
intelligence
experts
hint
that
we
might
see
humanlike
artificial
intelligence
within
a
few
decades
not
a
century
n
within
our
lifetime
robots
might
not
only
seem
human
in
their
basic
intelligence
but
emotional
perhaps
even
superhuman
n
not
every
robot
will
display
such
capabilities
today
some
machines
the
military
deems
robots
like
the
widely
used
talon
are
controlled
completely
by
remote
human
operators
n
other
robots
use
artificial
intelligence
to
operate
independently
for
limited
tasks
the
remote
operator
of
a
global
hawk
for
instance
just
clicks
a
computer
mouse
to
tell
the
robot
to
taxi
and
take
off
n
a
fully
autonomous
robot
would
need
no
human
input
at
all
once
someone
has
defined
the
robot
s
mission
n
greater
degrees
of
autonomy
in
military
robotics
seem
inevitable
one
of
the
efficiencies
gained
by
military
robots
is
that
large
numbers
of
them
will
be
capable
of
independent
action
with
one
human
actor
s
oversight
imagine
a
phalanx
of
military
robots
controlled
by
one
human
operator
perhaps
thousands
of
miles
away
as
a
result
fewer
human
lives
are
placed
at
risk
such
robots
would
not
increase
efficiency
if
each
required
an
independent
human
operator
n
on
the
battlefield
some
decisions
must
be
made
within
fractions
of
a
second
waiting
for
human
approval
or
veto
may
be
critical
time
wasted
particularly
if
a
robot
must
calculate
how
and
whether
to
launch
a
counterattack
n
not
only
might
there
be
insufficient
time
to
oversee
a
single
robotic
decision
but
there
may
be
little
opportunity
for
a
human
operator
to
closely
supervise
the
split
second
decisions
of
the
dozens
of
robots
over
which
he
has
control
human
involvement
in
such
a
case
might
take
the
form
of
a
veto
power
if
at
all
current
military
research
already
supports
the
development
of
robots
with
greater
degrees
of
autonomy
one
research
goal
of
the
pentagon
is
to
establish
linked
autonomous
systems
so
that
robots
can
communicate
to
one
another
in
a
rapidly
changing
environment
in
the
military
autonomous
drones
could
scan
a
combat
area
and
communicate
with
ground
robots
to
find
suspicious
places
or
people
n
the
possibility
that
some
robots
capable
of
hurting
or
killing
people
will
be
capable
of
complex
independent
action
raises
concerns
however
in
the
near
future
robots
could
make
decisions
in
ways
that
we
cannot
easily
control
or
understand
the
question
of
human
involvement
is
itself
complicated
because
artificial
intelligence
itself
is
becoming
more
complicated
assume
we
require
that
a
human
must
assess
a
robot
s
determination
to
use
coercive
force
deciding
whether
a
machine
with
artificial
intelligence
has
made
a
good
decision
may
not
be
easy
since
the
algorithm
s
processes
may
not
be
totally
intelligible
to
a
human
operator
even
if
we
have
access
to
an
algorithm
s
source
code
we
still
might
not
know
how
or
why
it
reached
its
decision
n
engineers
at
google
for
instance
recently
conceded
that
they
do
not
fully
understand
how
google
s
successful
rank
brain
ai
works
only
that
it
works
well
n
requiring
a
human
in
the
loop
may
mean
little
if
how
the
robot
came
to
its
conclusion
remains
opaque
to
the
human
being
in
charge
armed
robots
with
some
degree
of
autonomy
are
also
likely
to
be
vulnerable
to
criminal
interference
hacking
as
well
as
malfunction
our
current
experience
with
the
security
of
electronic
devices
provides
little
assurance
otherwise
security
researchers
have
discovered
vulnerabilities
that
make
possible
the
hacking
of
smart
cars
insulin
monitors
thermometers
refrigerators
and
locks
n
for
now
armed
and
independent
military
robots
are
not
a
reality
in
the
military
but
they
are
a
concern
current
military
policy
requires
human
involvement
in
any
potentially
lethal
action
as
deputy
defense
secretary
robert
o
work
commented
in
march
the
military
will
not
delegate
lethal
authority
to
a
machine
to
make
a
decision
n
retaining
some
human
involvement
in
armed
military
robots
remains
a
line
in
the
sand
n
but
this
is
a
policy
restraint
not
a
technological
one
that
restraint
may
give
way
easily
if
another
hostile
nation
or
terrorist
group
decides
to
use
lethal
autonomous
robots
against
american
soldiers
n
translating
these
developments
in
military
robotics
to
domestic
policing
requires
little
effort
the
companies
developing
and
producing
robots
can
and
do
adapt
them
for
military
or
law
enforcement
uses
robots
used
for
surveillance
investigation
and
coercive
force
in
iraq
and
afghanistan
could
easily
be
adapted
to
new
york
chicago
and
los
angeles
should
a
taser
or
firearm
enabled
police
robot
require
human
input
before
using
force
against
a
suspect
while
a
vice
president
at
irobot
which
partnered
with
taser
once
stated
there
is
no
way
we
are
giving
the
robot
the
capability
to
use
force
on
its
own
n
that
decision
like
the
pentagon
s
is
dictated
by
policy
not
technology
instead
we
should
ask
whether
a
robot
capable
of
assessing
a
dangerous
situation
and
enabled
to
use
a
taser
or
other
weapon
should
be
able
to
decide
to
do
so
without
human
input
as
with
the
military
a
ban
on
such
police
robots
makes
sense
until
policies
are
developed
to
address
matters
of
control
security
and
accountability
b
how
much
force
should
be
used
by
police
robots
not
only
do
we
need
to
decide
how
much
human
beings
should
be
involved
in
police
robot
decisionmaking
we
also
need
to
decide
how
heavily
robots
should
be
armed
from
their
beginnings
in
the
nineteenth
century
american
police
have
acquired
ever
more
sophisticated
tools
first
truncheons
then
firearms
and
now
stun
guns
pepper
balls
tear
gas
and
long
range
acoustic
device
lrad
sound
cannons
n
police
injure
and
sometimes
kill
people
during
their
stops
arrests
and
pursuits
when
the
circumstances
warrant
it
these
are
legally
justifiable
uses
of
force
if
police
authority
rests
in
part
on
the
authority
to
use
coercive
force
how
much
should
coercive
even
lethal
force
should
a
police
robot
possess
should
a
robot
be
able
to
exercise
the
same
deadly
force
as
a
police
officer
does
now
in
irobot
announced
a
strategic
alliance
with
taser
international
to
develop
a
taser
equipped
version
of
its
popular
packbot
n
electric
stun
guns
capable
of
transmitting
a
shock
of
up
to
volts
can
temporarily
disable
suspects
deemed
dangerous
and
noncompliant
n
tasers
are
considered
less
than
lethal
substitutes
for
guns
indeed
police
departments
often
view
taser
adoption
as
a
measure
of
reform
n
if
police
robots
can
carry
tasers
can
they
also
carry
firearms
or
other
lethal
weapons
any
proposal
to
adopt
the
regular
use
of
lethally
armed
robots
whether
semiautonomous
or
remotely
controlled
is
likely
to
meet
initial
public
resistance
there
is
already
a
public
campaign
against
killer
robots
in
the
military
n
and
the
discomfort
many
people
feel
about
lethal
robotic
soldiers
will
probably
be
more
pronounced
in
local
policing
uncertainty
about
partially
or
fully
autonomous
lethal
robots
will
likely
be
more
pronounced
if
that
possibility
is
introduced
for
police
within
the
united
states
there
are
at
least
two
reasons
to
be
skeptical
that
a
prohibition
against
lethal
police
robots
would
persist
first
the
line
between
lethal
and
nonlethal
arms
is
not
always
clear
even
a
taser
enabled
robot
is
one
capable
of
lethal
force
while
relatively
uncommon
people
have
died
in
incidents
in
which
police
use
tasers
at
least
forty
eight
people
in
n
some
cases
involve
improper
taser
use
others
involve
unknown
physical
vulnerabilities
of
the
victims
once
we
authorize
police
robots
to
use
some
degree
of
coercive
force
we
implicitly
acknowledge
some
uses
of
even
less
than
lethal
force
will
be
lethal
in
practice
a
second
reason
to
be
skeptical
about
any
prohibition
on
the
regular
use
of
lethally
armed
police
robots
is
the
future
role
of
robots
more
generally
in
the
future
we
will
be
surrounded
by
robots
of
all
kinds
at
work
as
coworkers
at
home
as
caregivers
and
in
leisure
as
social
or
sexual
companions
that
world
will
also
include
robots
involved
in
crime
just
as
robots
in
the
military
reduce
the
need
for
soldiers
to
put
themselves
at
risk
robots
can
provide
the
same
safety
and
anonymity
for
someone
interested
in
committing
crime
an
armed
robot
drug
dealer
could
act
as
an
autonomous
vending
machine
able
to
defend
itself
against
attack
and
destroy
evidence
in
the
event
of
discovery
n
once
the
first
crimes
are
committed
by
robots
armed
with
lethal
force
police
in
the
united
states
will
almost
certainly
balk
at
any
prohibitions
on
lethally
armed
police
robots
n
such
prohibitions
may
find
police
support
in
countries
like
new
zealand
and
britain
where
most
police
are
unarmed
as
are
most
civilians
n
in
the
united
states
however
lethally
armed
robots
may
become
just
another
point
in
the
development
of
weapons
that
the
police
will
want
to
use
c
what
is
robotic
reasonable
force
the
kinds
of
weapons
police
robots
might
adopt
are
matters
of
technology
and
policy
but
the
circumstances
in
which
robots
could
use
force
against
human
suspects
are
legal
ones
imagine
that
a
suspect
temporarily
detained
by
a
police
robot
decides
to
start
shooting
at
the
robot
if
the
robot
shoots
back
and
injures
or
kills
the
suspect
would
that
be
legally
defensible
n
the
answer
will
depend
in
part
on
how
we
classify
robots
under
the
law
human
police
may
legally
resort
to
force
even
deadly
force
in
the
appropriate
circumstances
claims
of
excessive
force
against
the
police
whether
in
the
context
of
an
arrest
stop
or
other
detention
are
judged
by
a
standard
of
objective
reasonableness
under
the
fourth
amendment
n
deadly
force
may
be
used
in
situations
where
a
suspect
poses
a
threat
of
serious
physical
harm
either
to
the
officer
or
to
others
n
distinguishing
between
legally
permissible
and
impermissible
uses
of
force
by
the
police
is
not
always
easy
the
u
s
supreme
court
has
avoided
requiring
any
exclusive
list
of
factors
in
assessing
reasonableness
rather
the
court
has
emphasized
that
the
use
of
force
analysis
requires
courts
to
slosh
through
the
factbound
morass
of
reasonableness
n
moreover
considerable
deference
is
accorded
to
the
police
as
the
calculus
of
reasonableness
must
embody
allowance
for
the
fact
that
police
officers
are
often
forced
to
make
split
second
judgments
in
circumstances
that
are
tense
uncertain
and
rapidly
evolving
n
that
reasonableness
must
be
judged
from
the
perspective
of
a
reasonable
officer
on
the
scene
rather
than
with
the
vision
of
hindsight
n
finally
that
assessment
asks
whether
the
officers
actions
are
objectively
reasonable
in
light
of
the
facts
and
circumstances
confronting
them
without
regard
to
their
underlying
intent
or
motivation
n
the
result
is
a
notoriously
opaque
and
fact
dependent
doctrine
that
has
become
difficult
for
courts
to
articulate
and
police
to
incorporate
into
their
training
n
even
if
the
fourth
amendment
s
use
of
force
doctrine
were
clearer
it
still
would
not
translate
easily
to
the
world
of
robotics
first
the
high
degree
of
deference
given
to
police
in
the
use
of
force
context
takes
into
account
the
fallible
nature
of
human
judgment
in
volatile
situations
with
high
degrees
of
stress
and
emotion
as
a
result
police
decisions
to
use
force
even
deadly
force
do
not
have
to
be
correct
only
objectively
reasonable
artificially
intelligent
machines
capable
of
coercive
force
do
not
feel
fear
disgust
anger
or
take
offense
in
this
respect
robots
might
be
more
reliable
than
human
beings
in
making
split
second
decisions
about
whether
to
draw
a
weapon
or
use
a
stun
gun
does
that
mean
we
should
expect
a
narrower
set
of
circumstances
for
robotic
reasonableness
than
we
do
for
humans
second
and
perhaps
more
importantly
the
usual
legal
standards
governing
the
use
of
force
by
the
police
assume
the
perspective
of
officers
who
fear
for
their
lives
or
safety
too
little
deference
to
the
police
may
inhibit
their
decisions
and
result
in
more
injuries
to
the
police
too
much
deference
and
the
police
may
injure
or
kill
people
when
such
deaths
could
be
avoided
n
in
practice
courts
have
given
considerable
deference
to
officers
stated
beliefs
that
they
felt
their
lives
were
in
danger
even
if
those
fears
turn
out
to
be
mistaken
after
deadly
force
has
been
used
n
what
do
these
legal
standards
mean
when
a
police
robot
confronts
a
person
who
appears
to
intend
it
harm
the
law
values
life
over
property
yet
robots
might
occupy
a
legal
category
that
is
neither
purely
property
nor
human
how
we
think
of
robots
in
these
situations
may
depend
on
whatever
analogies
courts
will
adopt
to
characterize
them
are
robots
like
wild
animals
slaves
n
children
or
something
else
if
robots
are
treated
merely
as
property
then
police
robots
should
not
be
permitted
to
defend
themselves
against
human
attack
even
when
acting
in
a
policing
role
n
but
that
conclusion
is
not
obvious
an
animated
debate
already
exists
as
to
whether
cruelty
to
robots
might
be
criminalized
in
the
same
way
we
criminalize
cruelty
to
animals
n
the
dismemberment
of
the
hitchhiking
hitchbot
in
prompted
new
concerns
about
a
future
of
unchecked
robot
abuse
n
while
we
might
have
many
reasons
to
criminalize
animal
abuse
one
reason
may
be
to
promote
social
values
and
to
deter
antisocial
violence
we
disavow
deliberate
unjustified
violence
to
animals
in
part
because
to
do
otherwise
would
condone
the
human
infliction
of
pain
and
suffering
against
other
beings
but
permitting
a
robot
to
launch
a
counterpunch
against
an
armed
human
poses
its
own
tricky
questions
perhaps
a
robot
could
exert
proportional
nonlethal
force
to
defend
itself
from
destruction
let
us
further
assume
that
a
human
must
authorize
such
a
use
of
force
in
an
optimal
case
the
suspect
posing
a
threat
might
be
temporarily
disabled
by
nonlethal
force
until
in
handcuffs
or
their
future
equivalent
consider
too
that
one
day
police
robots
might
be
sent
to
confront
criminal
robots
what
amount
of
force
is
permissible
then
can
a
police
robot
kill
another
robot
because
the
robot
s
actions
would
be
attributable
to
the
government
the
permanent
disabling
of
a
threatening
civilian
robot
would
be
a
fourth
amendment
seizure
but
what
would
a
reasonable
robotic
seizure
of
another
robot
look
like
to
be
sure
police
robots
might
remove
some
of
the
problems
raised
in
confrontations
between
the
police
and
the
public
the
use
of
robots
in
these
situations
may
reduce
the
risk
of
harm
to
the
police
if
they
can
safely
subdue
a
dangerous
suspect
at
a
distance
and
if
police
lives
are
not
at
immediate
risk
it
may
be
that
detentions
and
arrests
could
be
conducted
with
less
risk
to
individuals
robots
have
the
potential
to
make
policing
safer
that
possibility
however
must
be
balanced
against
the
mistakes
hacks
and
malfunctions
that
will
inevitably
occur
who
will
bear
the
responsibility
for
these
mistakes
either
because
the
threat
was
misjudged
or
the
force
disproportionate
should
we
blame
the
robot
the
manufacturer
the
software
engineer
or
the
human
operator
assuming
there
is
one
d
will
robotic
police
reinforce
social
inequality
whether
or
not
police
robots
use
coercive
force
and
do
so
with
some
degree
of
autonomy
the
manner
of
their
deployment
raises
a
separate
policy
question
robots
may
decrease
dangers
for
the
police
and
those
detained
by
the
police
but
will
they
increase
perceptions
of
policing
unfairness
if
arming
robots
is
already
becoming
an
active
topic
of
debate
an
equally
important
but
less
visible
one
is
whether
police
robots
will
worsen
ties
to
communities
where
relationships
with
the
police
are
already
strained
we
can
see
these
questions
of
technology
and
policing
already
being
put
to
the
test
with
predictive
policing
software
defined
broadly
predictive
policing
applies
artificial
intelligence
to
data
in
order
to
detect
patterns
of
crime
n
using
the
vast
amount
of
digitized
information
today
predictive
policing
programs
try
to
predict
criminal
risks
in
individuals
or
in
geographic
locations
in
the
case
of
locational
prediction
predictive
policing
programs
using
historical
crime
data
and
other
factors
identify
geographic
locations
where
crime
is
more
likely
to
occur
in
the
future
n
police
departments
can
use
that
information
to
redistribute
patrol
resources
cities
including
los
angeles
new
york
and
seattle
have
purchased
predictive
software
programs
of
this
type
n
in
the
future
predictive
policing
programs
may
further
guide
the
allocation
of
police
resources
and
hiring
these
predictive
policing
programs
may
appear
neutral
but
in
fact
hide
biases
consider
the
data
used
by
predictive
policing
algorithms
if
arrests
are
a
significant
factor
then
we
cannot
discount
the
fact
that
many
arrests
are
the
product
of
highly
discretionary
decisions
by
police
officers
n
if
high
arrest
rates
influence
the
algorithm
to
direct
the
geographic
focus
of
police
then
we
should
not
be
surprised
if
more
arrests
occur
in
those
places
as
a
result
similarly
if
reported
crimes
constitute
another
factor
taken
into
account
by
a
predictive
policing
algorithm
then
crimes
not
usually
reported
or
not
always
reported
will
be
omitted
from
the
decision
about
where
to
direct
police
attention
n
robbery
will
make
the
cut
but
domestic
violence
and
financial
crime
may
not
n
these
hidden
sources
of
bias
have
prompted
concerns
that
predictive
policing
programs
will
justify
a
heavy
police
presence
in
poor
minority
communities
that
have
historically
been
targets
of
over
policing
n
predictive
policing
programs
only
provide
guidance
not
action
what
would
happen
though
if
patrol
robots
use
this
predictive
analysis
if
predictive
policing
programs
fail
to
address
issues
of
human
bias
some
communities
would
be
flooded
with
police
robots
while
others
would
not
be
imagine
further
that
police
robots
would
be
afforded
less
enforcement
discretion
than
human
officers
we
worry
about
human
police
discretion
because
it
is
difficult
if
not
impossible
to
know
if
impermissible
factors
influence
enforcement
but
would
we
live
in
a
better
world
if
police
patrol
robots
enforced
minor
offenses
much
more
frequently
than
human
officers
would
in
neighborhoods
accustomed
to
aggressive
policing
because
they
were
directed
to
do
so
by
their
own
artificial
intelligence
the
future
may
be
one
in
which
robots
of
all
kinds
are
so
ubiquitous
that
even
the
heavy
presence
of
police
robots
in
some
places
would
be
unnoticeable
that
seems
unlikely
instead
it
seems
plausible
that
the
introduction
of
an
all
seeing
interconnected
and
tireless
army
of
police
robots
into
a
neighborhood
could
feel
like
an
occupation
or
virtual
imprisonment
e
who
will
decide
these
questions
the
regulation
of
police
robots
will
prove
to
be
especially
difficult
because
robots
will
likely
be
adopted
and
regulated
much
like
other
recent
police
technologies
in
an
ad
hoc
and
decentralized
manner
most
of
this
can
be
attributed
to
the
structure
of
policing
in
the
united
states
which
is
largely
a
matter
for
state
and
local
agencies
consider
the
immense
interest
in
body
camera
adoption
after
a
string
of
highly
publicized
and
controversial
deaths
of
african
americans
in
police
custody
beginning
with
the
fatal
shooting
of
michael
brown
in
ferguson
before
body
cameras
had
been
adopted
by
a
handful
of
police
departments
today
it
seems
all
but
inevitable
that
body
cameras
will
become
a
standard
patrol
tool
the
federal
government
has
encouraged
that
adoption
in
its
discussion
of
new
police
technologies
the
president
s
task
force
on
st
century
policing
acknowledged
in
its
report
that
body
cameras
could
build
community
trust
and
legitimacy
with
appropriate
regulations
n
that
same
year
the
department
of
justice
made
more
than
million
available
to
local
police
departments
to
purchase
body
cameras
n
eager
to
present
them
as
tools
of
accountability
police
departments
around
the
country
have
embraced
the
adoption
of
body
cameras
yet
many
police
departments
have
adopted
body
cameras
without
detailed
policies
on
their
use
public
access
and
data
storage
those
body
camera
policies
that
do
exist
can
vary
considerably
n
seattle
posted
all
of
its
pilot
project
body
camera
footage
on
youtube
n
while
other
departments
have
declined
to
release
footage
unless
required
by
court
order
n
the
story
of
police
body
camera
adoption
thus
far
has
been
use
first
regulate
later
without
planning
the
use
of
police
robots
will
develop
in
the
same
way
with
more
serious
consequences
should
the
arming
of
police
robots
for
example
be
left
to
local
departments
should
the
type
of
artificial
intelligence
used
by
police
robots
depend
on
the
access
of
private
vendors
to
police
departments
machines
that
may
be
equipped
with
artificial
intelligence
and
capable
of
coercive
force
are
poor
candidates
for
highly
variable
local
control
instead
uniform
national
policies
should
dictate
the
regulation
of
robotic
policing
even
if
robots
of
the
sort
described
here
have
yet
to
arrive
we
can
anticipate
the
sorts
of
questions
that
robotics
will
bring
to
policing
the
degree
of
human
involvement
in
robotic
decisionmaking
whether
and
how
to
arm
police
robots
and
how
to
evaluate
the
legal
responsibility
of
a
police
robot
these
are
all
normative
judgments
about
law
and
policy
in
the
absence
of
uniform
policies
we
are
likely
to
address
these
questions
in
a
piecemeal
fashion
a
mix
of
unenforceable
internal
policies
hesitant
state
legislatures
possibly
conflicting
federal
agency
decisions
and
court
cases
in
which
judges
cannot
agree
as
to
the
appropriate
characterization
of
robots
n
we
could
begin
with
a
national
body
to
develop
robotics
expertise
that
could
advise
federal
state
and
local
lawmakers
a
federal
robotics
commission
for
instance
could
identify
important
legal
and
policy
questions
raised
by
robotics
in
a
variety
of
areas
including
policing
with
specific
substantive
recommendations
n
more
concretely
the
federal
government
can
wield
its
considerable
resources
to
influence
how
local
police
departments
use
robots
while
the
federal
government
cannot
force
state
and
local
police
to
adopt
particular
policies
n
the
department
of
justice
can
and
has
influenced
the
adoption
of
new
strategies
and
technologies
through
the
use
of
federal
funding
for
example
the
widespread
interest
in
and
adoption
of
body
worn
cameras
by
local
police
departments
in
has
been
prompted
in
part
by
the
availability
of
federal
funding
for
body
camera
purchases
likewise
the
department
of
justice
offers
funding
to
local
police
departments
in
order
to
purchase
predictive
policing
systems
n
the
federal
government
could
condition
the
receipt
of
federal
funds
upon
the
adoption
of
regulations
by
grantees
n
police
departments
could
receive
funding
for
robots
so
long
as
they
for
instance
did
not
enable
the
robots
to
use
deadly
force
without
specific
guidelines
already
in
place
no
police
department
would
be
forced
to
accept
a
robot
under
these
conditions
but
every
department
that
sought
federal
funding
would
be
obliged
to
follow
these
conditions
a
top
down
form
of
strong
encouragement
by
the
federal
government
could
be
effective
in
setting
uniform
policies
for
police
robots
conclusion
the
future
introduction
of
artificially
intelligent
robots
capable
of
conducting
human
like
tasks
is
likely
to
change
policing
in
the
same
way
it
will
change
other
fields
assuming
even
some
of
the
traditional
tasks
of
policing
by
robots
however
will
pose
special
problems
we
will
have
to
address
how
much
coercive
force
police
robots
should
possess
and
to
what
degree
they
should
be
permitted
to
operate
independently
in
some
cases
the
use
of
police
robots
may
increase
the
safety
of
policing
for
both
officers
and
the
public
in
other
cases
however
the
use
of
police
robots
to
detain
or
subdue
a
suspect
may
raise
challenges
to
the
conventional
ways
in
which
we
have
regulated
the
police
while
we
cannot
anticipate
every
issue
that
this
technology
raises
we
can
address
many
of
them
now
well

ohio
seven
months
earlier
tamir
rice
an
unarmed
twelve
year
old
black
boy
was
shot
and
killed
by
the
cleveland
division
of
police
cdp
in
an
incident
that
quickly
came
to
symbolize
the
tension
between
the
cdp
and
its
community
n
the
settlement
was
not
designed
to
address
the
actions
taken
by
officers
involved
in
the
rice
killing
but
to
address
the
wider
problem
of
excessive
force
within
the
cdp
n
gupta
assured
the
people
of
cleveland
that
the
agreement
would
transform
this
police
agency
into
a
model
of
community
oriented
policing
that
will
make
both
police
officers
and
the
people
they
serve
safer
n
the
investigation
of
the
cdp
occurred
pursuant
to
of
the
violent
crime
control
and
law
enforcement
act
of
which
vests
the
doj
with
authority
to
initiate
legal
action
against
law
enforcement
agencies
found
in
systematic
violation
of
constitutional
or
statutory
law
n
this
provision
has
been
instrumental
in
identifying
unlawful
behavior
in
many
of
the
country
s
most
prominent
police
departments
and
has
generated
settlement
agreements
that
articulate
deep
reforms
to
the
offending
department
s
organizational
model
and
accountability
systems
the
initiative
continues
to
serve
as
the
primary
means
of
addressing
systemic
police
misconduct
in
the
united
states
in
fact
in
the
last
eighteen
months
the
doj
has
used
its
pattern
or
practice
authority
to
investigate
allegations
of
systemic
misconduct
in
several
cities
experiencing
recent
police
involved
violence
including
ferguson
missouri
n
baltimore
maryland
n
and
chicago
illinois
n
among
others
though
perhaps
this
recent
wave
of
litigation
is
unprecedented
in
its
speed
and
aggression
the
use
of
federal
power
to
address
police
misconduct
is
nothing
new
since
the
doj
has
investigated
allegations
in
some
sixty
eight
jurisdictions
taking
formal
legal
action
against
thirty
eight
departments
found
to
have
engaged
in
a
pattern
or
practice
of
misconduct
n
rather
than
litigate
these
claims
most
jurisdictions
opt
for
settlement
n
the
resultant
agreements
which
are
enforceable
in
federal
court
typically
require
the
affected
department
to
update
relevant
policy
revamp
training
requirements
and
develop
an
infrastructure
designed
to
promote
internal
and
external
officer
accountability
n
in
many
cases
including
those
reviewed
here
an
independent
monitor
is
hired
to
oversee
implementation
and
establish
the
terms
of
compliance
these
agreements
remain
in
place
until
the
police
are
determined
to
have
been
in
substantial
compliance
with
the
terms
of
the
agreement
typically
defined
as
percent
compliant
for
at
least
two
full
years
n
the
emerging
department
is
stamped
with
the
imprimatur
of
lawfulness
and
designated
as
a
model
for
other
departments
in
terms
of
lawfulness
accountability
and
transparency
n
the
pattern
or
practice
initiative
as
it
has
become
known
has
been
a
useful
tool
for
police
chiefs
and
elected
officials
seeking
change
n
as
well
as
reform
minded
community
members
n
anecdotal
evidence
suggests
that
many
affected
department
leaders
have
found
the
process
worthwhile
as
well
n
the
response
has
not
all
been
positive
however
some
have
claimed
that
the
doj
s
enforcement
of
is
overly
political
n
with
decisions
on
which
jurisdictions
to
investigate
made
for
partisan
rather
than
policy
reasons
n
others
have
argued
that
the
process
is
anti
democratic
and
unnecessarily
exclusive
of
perspectives
brought
to
bear
by
citizen
groups
and
labor
organizations
n
some
have
also
questioned
whether
this
process
which
often
lasts
for
several
years
and
costs
cities
tens
of
millions
of
dollars
n
is
capable
of
producing
meaningful
durable
organizational
change
n
the
record
of
police
department
efforts
to
achieve
and
sustain
organizational
reform
is
at
best
mixed
n
many
of
policing
s
most
promising
innovations
including
high
profile
efforts
like
community
policing
and
problem
oriented
policing
have
not
lived
up
to
their
initial
promise
n
despite
this
pattern
those
who
study
the
police
have
largely
overlooked
the
issue
in
general
scholars
know
relatively
little
about
the
bureaucratic
response
to
reform
and
thus
remain
somewhat
ignorant
about
how
and
why
innovations
in
policing
continue
to
erode
n
this
is
not
entirely
surprising
given
the
complexity
of
the
issue
comprehensive
reform
efforts
resist
the
kinds
of
clear
simple
terms
that
facilitate
ex
post
evaluation
the
process
is
defined
by
multiple
goals
varying
perspectives
and
competing
political
administrative
and
legal
motivations
all
conspiring
to
form
a
confusing
and
contradictory
picture
of
change
n
the
complexity
of
the
process
is
only
magnified
by
the
intensity
of
the
current
political
and
social
context
and
the
contentiousness
with
which
police
officers
confront
changes
to
the
organizational
status
quo
n
opposition
among
front
line
officers
to
pattern
or
practice
reform
is
one
of
several
reasons
to
study
the
process
the
significance
of
the
initiative
the
issue
that
precipitates
it
and
the
vehemence
of
arguments
on
both
sides
is
belied
by
how
little
we
actually
know
about
the
effectiveness
and
sustainability
of
these
reforms
despite
its
relevance
to
legal
administrative
and
policy
scholarship
to
date
there
has
been
relatively
little
social
science
research
on
the
reform
process
with
a
particularly
glaring
lack
of
empirical
analysis

gap

a
the

of

mandated

the
need
for
closer
attention
to
this
issue
is
highlighted
by
the
impermanent
nature
of
reforms
brought
about
in
other
policy
contexts
through
similar
means

like

judicially

orders
attempt
to
structure

reform
of
public
bureaucracies
found

process
has
been
used
to
facilitate
the
desegregation
of

unconstitutionally
abusive
prison
systems
n
and
assert
the

n
among
others
again
as
with
pattern
or
practice
reform
formal
oversight
is
terminated
upon
a
determination
typically
made
by
the
presiding
judge
that
the
underlying
constitutional
violation
has
been
redressed
as
a
result
many
see
the
process
as
inherently
fragile
at
the
heart
of
these
arguments
is
the
contention
that
the
sustainability
of
reform
is
undermined
by
the
use
of
a
transitory
policy
solution
external
oversight
to
remedy
what
in
many
cases
is
a
chronic
organizational
problem
n
in
the
absence
of
persistent
external
oversight
and
accountability
the
argument
goes
the
affected
bureaucracy
can
and
perhaps
must
revert
to
ex
ante
operating
procedures
two
examples
illustrate
the
point
despite
the
significant
gains
made
following
the
brown
decision
n
over
the
last
twenty
years
or
so
scholars
have
documented
the
increased
segregation
of
primary
and
secondary
school
children
along
racial
economic
and
linguistic
lines
n
some
contend
that
resegregation
has
occurred
as
a
direct
result
of
limitations
placed
on
the
ability
of
federal
district
court
judges
to
continue
to
manage
local
school
districts
n
rights
based
reforms
achieved
through
litigation
against
state
prison
systems
have
eroded
under
similar
circumstances
a
recent
examination
of
the
arizona
department
of
juvenile
corrections
which
operated
under
federal
control
between
and
documented
post
termination
slippage
in
two
areas
critical
to
the
initial
reform
effort
suicide
prevention
and
inmate
education
n
in
each
case
the
absence
of
external
pressure
to
adhere
to
new
operational
protocols
corresponded
with
a
reversion
to
pre
intervention
practices
b
evaluating
organizational
reform
the
term
institutionalization
is
used
to
define
the
process
of
converting
a
reform
effort
into
an
established
part
of
the
organization
s
normal
functioning
n
and
a
way
of
regularly
conducting
business
n
according
to
oliver
n
once
organizational
activities
are
institutionalized
they
are
assumed
to
become
relatively
stable
enduring
reproducible
and
sustainable
over
long
periods
of
time
without
continuing
justification
in
this
sense
institutionalized
reforms
are
synonymous
with
sustainable
enduring
and
lasting
changes
n
identifying
the
point
in
time
when
a
reform
implementation
effort
ends
and
institutionalization
begins
is
a
complex
task
this
determination
is
particularly
difficult
in
part
as
a
result
of
the
fact
that
the
complex
and
perpetual
nature
of
many
implementation
efforts
makes
a
fixed
end
point
difficult
to
identify
it
is
similarly
difficult
to
identify
the
point
at
which
assessment
of
a
program
s
sustainability
should
begin
here
too
the
nature
of
the
analysis
resists
a
definitive
dichotomous
answer
and
what
little
research
does
exist
provides
conflicting
guidance
some
scholars
believe
that
analysis
should
begin
after
one
year
n
others
say
institutionalization
takes
somewhere
between
five
and
ten
years
to
manifest
n
previous
scholarship
has
employed
various
approaches
to
examine
the
institutionalization
of
organizational
reform
beginning
with
an
assessment
of
staff
response
this
can
be
accomplished
by
measuring
both
the
extent
to
which
organizational
actors
are
aware
of
and
understand
changes
to
policy
and
agency
priorities
brought
on
by
the
reform
n
as
well
as
the
degree
to
which
intervention
behaviors
are
actually
performed
n
staff
willingness
to
adopt
new
operational
protocols
is
often
couched
in
terms
of
organizational
culture
policing
scholars
have
consistently
found
cultural
change
measured
in
terms
of
individual
officer
preferences
norms
and
values
predictive
of
institutionalized
reform
n
the
sustainability
of
pattern
or
practice
reform
is
at
least
in
part
likely
to
be
a
function
of
the
degree
to
which
street
and
mid
level
officers
as
well
as
department
leadership
have
come
to
view
both
the
letter
and
the
spirit
of
the
settlement
as
central
to
the
department
s
mission
and
reflective
of
the
department
s
broader
approach
to
policing
yet
organizational
reform
is
rarely
pursued
for
these
ends
cultural
and
or
behavioral
change
is
typically
instrumental
sought
as
a
means
to
improving
certain
measurable
outcomes
n
since
the
early
s
public
management
scholars
have
advocated
the
use
of
outcomes
to
measure
the
performance
of
public
agencies
and
individual
bureaucrats
rather
than
intangibles
like
attitudes
or
culture
n
the
notion
of
measuring
what
matters
is
a
strong
current
in
policing
research
as
well
n
police
practitioners
are
also
heavily
dependent
on
these
data
arrest
rates
use
of
force
statistics
demographic
and
geographic
data
etc
to
drive
officer
behavior
and
evaluate
policy
change
the
compstat
movement
is
one
such
example
predictive
policing
and
crime
mapping
are
others
part
of
the
challenge
in
evaluating
the
durability
of
organizational
reform
is
identifying
performance
measures
that
accurately
identify
sustainable
change
two
types
of
outcome
measures
are
relevant
beginning
with
systematic
metrics
that
establish
broad
agency
wide
performance
first
in
terms
of
pattern
or
practice
reform
several
such
indicators
are
relevant
including
frequency
of
officer
use
of
force
incidents
citizen
complaints
and
civil
suits
filed
against
the
department
in
fact
nearly
every
key
stakeholder
interviewed
as
a
part
of
this
research
stated
that
trend
data
is
the
most
useful
way
to
gauge
the
effectiveness
of
a
reform
effort
and
a
department
s
progress
toward
institutionalization
second
an
organization
s
ability
to
sustain
change
can
also
be
evaluated
in
terms
of
its
ability
to
avoid
large
scale
performance
crises
these
events
can
take
the
form
of
isolated
high
profile
incidents
like
a
police
shooting
or
a
particularly
vicious
use
of
force
caught
on
tape
think
rodney
king
even
one
such
episode
can
shake
the
public
s
confidence
in
the
agency
negatively
affect
employee
morale
and
weaken
organizational
support
for
departmental
leadership
to
illustrate
the
magnitude
of
such
a
crisis
oliver
argues
that
the
space
shuttle
challenger
disaster
undercut
the
agency
s
reputation
and
provoked
serious
doubts
within
the
organization
about
a
range
of
long
standing
practices
and
procedures
n
along
the
same
lines
cincinnati

acknowledged
t
he
only
thing
that
could
undo
the
good
that

for

to
have
a
number
of
questionable

in

cases

are
however

insights
from
several
stakeholders
including
independent
monitors
police

leadership
and
relevant
political
and
community
leaders
were
gathered
from
several
in
depth
interviews

are

iv
findings
before
presenting
the
results
of
this
analysis
it
should
be
noted
that
in
most
cases
neither
the
effects
of
reform
nor
institutionalization
should
be
measured
dichotomously
n
organizational
change
is
something
that
proceeds
incrementally
and
thus
is
most
effectively
measured
in
degrees
with
that
in
mind
the
analysis
proceeds
chronologically
beginning
with
pittsburgh
a
pittsburgh
pennsylvania
in
april
the
city
of
pittsburgh
agreed
to
settle
doj
claims
that
the
bureau
of
police
pbp
had
engaged
in
a
pattern
or
practice
of
unlawful
activity
including
the
use
of
excessive
force
and
a
failure
to
discipline
officers
adequately
n
the
consent
decree
was
in
place
until
september
n
shortly
after
the
decree
was
lifted
the
vera
institute
of
justice
attempted
to
gauge
the
degree
to
which
local
officials
can
maintain
consent
decree
reforms
after
the
federal
government
and
its
monitor
withdraw
n
drawing
on
survey
data
and
interviews
with
pbp
officers
and
leaders
from
key
civil
society
groups
gathered
between
march
and
march
vera
evaluated
the
sustainability
of
changes
to
police
behavior
officer
morale
and
public
opinion
brought
on
by
federal
oversight
n
three
themes
emerge
from
this
research
first
pbp
officers
seemed
to
understand
and
respect
the
goals
of
the
reform
but
were
strongly
resentful
of
the
process
n
in
fact
only
a
tiny
percentage
of
those
surveyed
felt
the
reforms
had
improved
performance
or
produced
more
professional
encounters
with
citizens
n
second
despite
this
opposition
the
first
year
or
so
after
federal
oversight
was
lifted
pbp
maintained
operation
of
various
reform
initiatives
including
their
early
intervention
system
new
officer
training
protocols
and
regular
oversight
inspections
n
third
a
majority
of
community
leaders
and
members
of
the
public
saw
the
pbp
as
effective
in
stopping
crime
helping
victims
of
crime
and
working
together
with
city
residents
to
solve
local
problems
n
based
on
these
findings
the
authors
conclude
that
the
implementation
of
the
consent
decree
requirements
in
pittsburgh
dramatically
changed
the
culture
of
the
bureau
of
police
and
that
key
departmental
changes
survive
d
the
life
of
the
decree
intact
n
much
has
happened
in
pittsburgh
since
the
study
was
published
including
three
mayoral
transitions
the
installation
of
four
new
police
chiefs
and
a
protracted

even

be

a

surely
have

has
increased
since
just
as

suggests
a
curious
and
potentially
troubling
finding
there
are
several
possible
explanations
the
rise
in

incidence
could
be
a
reflection
of
a
department
wide
emphasis
on
more
accurate
reporting
with
officers
mandated
to
document
all
use
of
force
regardless
of
its
nature
or
perceived
insignificance
the
decline
in
use
of
force
related
citizen
complaints
is
in
line
with
the
idea
that
documentation
not
actual
use
of
force
has
increased
it
is
possible
too
that
the
reduction
in
disciplinary
actions
is
consistent
with
this
narrative
it
is
also
quite
possible
that
the
combination
of
these
trends
is
evidence
of
a
department
whose
officers
have
become
more
violent
and
less
accountable
though
certainly
not
definitive
the
broader
context
including
a
recent
history
of
political
and
departmental
corruption
and
several
high
profile
incidents
of
police
use
of
force
lends
some
credibility
to
the
latter
interpretation
robert

in

mcneilly
remains
an
outspoken
proponent

believes
that
the
consent

process
helped
to
transform
the
pbp
n
despite
his
reputation
as
a
micromanager
and
a
disciplinarian
many
believe
the

more
lawful

be

whether

averaged
use

similarly
the
average
number
of
assaults
committed
against
pbp

in
the
years
after
mcneilly

fired
was
some
percent
higher

beyond

the

reflexively

we

interpreting
these

is
tricky
particularly
in
the

larger
sample

the

simply
indicate

also
signal
that
reform

changes
including
those
designed
to
make
the

a

easier
were
having
the
desired
effect
but
even
if
a
simplified
complaint
process
can
account
for
the
upward
trend
while
the
new

were
being

it
is
unlikely
that
the

of
such

would
stretch

even

that
there

never
going

another

it

it

enough
to
say

pgpd
chief
mark
magaw
denied
that
this

was
at
all
worrisome
instead
pointing
to
the
county
s
increased
population
size
and
a
newly
expanded
definition
of

the
way
i
read
these
numbers
is
we
re
doing
a
better
job
we
re
holding
our
officers
more
accountable
and
we
re
being
more
transparent
n
magaw
s
sentiment
is
belied
by
several
media
reports
of
excessive
force
and
corruption
involving
pgpg
officers
in
march
several
prince
george
s
county
police
officers
were
videotaped
beating
a
university
of
maryland
student
during
a
wild
celebration
of
a
victory
by
the
school
s
basketball
team
according
to
the
washington
post
pgpd
officers
falsely
accused
the
victims
of
aggressive
behavior
in
an
attempt
to
justify
the
use
of
force
police
charging
documents
initially
alleged
that
two
students
jointly
assaulted
police
officers
and
their
horses
the
video
contradicted
that
and
the
charges
against
the
students
were
dropped
n
the
incident
which
cost
county
taxpayers
a
total
of
million
in
legal
fees
n
led
the
washington
post
editorial
board
to
conclude
that
if
no
video
had
surfaced
of
mr
mckenna
s
beating
that
too
would
have
been
swept
under
the
rug
of
police
impunity
and
official
indifference
this
cannot
be
allowed
to
stand
it
sends
a
terrible
message
to
the
prince
george
s
police
who
now
know
that
consequences
for
their
misconduct
if
any
will
be
slight

in

pgpd
officer

santiago

convicted

incident
where
he
held
a

to

in
addition
to
these
allegations
of

up
the
pgpd
in

embroiled
in
a
wide
ranging
federal
investigation
into
illegal
and
corrupt
practices

the

according
to
the
washington
post
at
least
prince
george
s
officers
are
either
suspended
or
assigned
to
administrative
duties
for
misconduct
or
violations
in
at
least
of
those
cases
investigators
have
reason
to
think
the
officers
committed
a
crime
n
in
late
a
separate
federal
investigation
into
allegations
of
corruption
among
prince
george
s
county
government
officials
led
to
the
arrest
of
then
prince
george
s
county
executive
jack
johnson
under
suspicion
of
bribery
and
corruption
n
the
conspiracy
alleged
to
have
started
in
is
thought
to
have
involved
a

johnson
is
accused

accepting

things
cash
trips
and
tickets

misconduct

and
theft

records
n
in

was
also
marred
by
allegations
of
cheating
on
police
academy
exams
the
cheating
scandal
which
implicated
approximately
cadets
and
at
least
one
instructor
was
not
only
highly
embarrassing
for
the
department
but
threatened
several
ongoing
criminal
investigations
the
county
s
state
s
attorney
glenn
ivey
admitted
that
his
office
was
forced
to
review
all
cases
involving
the
alleged
cheaters
we
assembled
a
team
of
prosecutors
in
the
office
to
start
finding
out
which
cases
they
were
on
and
make
a
case
by
case
determination
whether
these
cases
should
stand
or
not
n
an
audit
conducted
by
the
state
of
maryland
in
determined
without
examining
the
allegations
of
cheating
that
the
affected
officers
did
not
need
to
be
removed
from
the
streets
because
there
were
no
substantive
issues
with
their
training
n
despite
this
pattern
of
unlawful
and
corrupt
behavior
among
pgpd
officers
and
a
continued
absence
of
respect
for
the
rule
of
law
among
certain
county
officials
it
is
hard
to
draw
any
definitive
conclusions
about
the
effectiveness
or
long
term
viability
of
the
reform
effort
there
is
simply
not
enough
known
about
the
department
to
make
a
legitimate
assessment
of
efforts
to
change
the
department
s
approach
to
the
use
of
force
and
external
accountability
further
the
lack
of
available
information
on
the
pgpd
reform
effort
seems
to
support
the
notion
that
the
prince
george
s
county
government
is
either
unwilling
or
unable
to
make
police
accountability
and
department
transparency
a
priority
despite
claims
to
the
contrary
n
the
widespread
unwillingness
among
stakeholders
to
speak
with
me
either
on
or
off
the
record
about
the
process
adds
weight
to
this
conclusion
these
impressions
become
stronger
still
after
even
the
most
cursory
examination
of
incidents
involving
the
county
and
its
police
department
since
the
first
full
year
after
the
moa
was
terminated
taken
together
the
existing
quantitative
and
qualitative
information
seems
to
suggest
a
wide
gulf
between
where
prince
george
s
county
appears
to
be
and
where
the
justice

would
have
wanted
them

be

of
police
abuse
is
more
variable
than
case
filings
though
the
trend
lines
for
each
variable
appear
to
slope
downward
there
are
three
clear
spikes
and
in
and
these
payout
spikes
occurred
without
significant
corresponding
spikes
in
either
the
volume
of
cases
filed
or
recorded
use
of
force
events
which
suggests
that
they
can
reasonably
be
attributed
to
a
particularly
severe
incident
or
series
of
incidents
like
the
may
confrontation
between
immigration
protestors
and
lapd
officers
in
macarthur
park
n
uses
of
force
incidents
such
as
these
are
unavoidable
in
a
city
as
large
and
as
diverse
as
los
angeles
that
two
such
high
profile
and
significant
events
occurred
in
a
three
year
period
is
most
likely
an
indication
of
this
inevitability
though
something
that
should
be
monitored
fairly
closely
tellingly
the
cd
process
has
been
credited
with
minimizing
the
effects
of
these
types
of
violent
incidents
los
angeles
has
had
its
fair
share
of
officer
involved
shootings
recently
and
they
still
generate
protests
but
things
haven
t
really
gotten
out
of
hand
police
reform
groups
and
many
lapd
officials
say
this
is
a
testament
to
all
the
work
that
s
been
done
to
repair
relations
with
communities
over
the
year
n
the
harvard
report
concludes
with
a
note
about
the
sustainability
of
the
changes
found
it
is
not
that
policing
in
los
angeles
is
all
that
it
can
ever
be
but
the
balance
of
local
leadership
and
local
oversight
is
healthy
enough
to
carry
the
process
of
continuous
improvement
forward
in
the
absence
of
doj
oversight
n
the
strongest
argument
to
be
made
along
these
lines
will
surely
include
discussion
of
the
relatively
strong
external
accountability
mechanisms
in
los
angeles
pre
existing
institutions
like
the
police
commission
and
the
city
s
inspector
general
s
office
were
empowered
by
the
consent
decree
and
appear
as
of
this
writing
to
remain
active
in
their
oversight
of
the
lapd
n
moreover
the
city
has
a
strong
network
of
civil
rights
organizations
to
buttress
these
formal
institutions
as
well
as
an
active
local
media
one
manifestation
of
this
external
oversight
is
the
extent
to
which
the
department
has
committed
to
sharing
performance
data
and
other
information
with
the
public
according
to
a
recent
analysis
of
police
department
websites
the
lapd
ranked
third
in
terms
of
web
based
transparency
n
to
some
including
author
and
attorney
tom
hayden
the
current
regulatory
infrastructure
is
insufficient
w
ithout
the
oversight
of
a
federal
judge
and
a
consent
decree
road
map
the
system
of
police
reform
in
los
angeles
will
remain
ad
hoc
ineffective
and
even
broken
beneath
the
layers
of
reform
added
to
the
department
over
three
decades
it
remains
the
fact
that
the
police
predominate
in
policing
the
police
n
this
skepticism
is
surely
a
function
of
the
department
s
long
history
of
violence
racial
injustice
and
impunity
the
view
of
earl
ofari
hutchinson
president
of
the
los
angeles
urban
policy
roundtable
is
instructive
there
are
still
some
of
the
old
troubling
signs
officers
that
overuse
deadly
force
or
commit
acts
of
misconduct
must
be
punished
without
it
it
reinforces
the
notion
that
officers
can
administer
street
corner
justice
this
is
the
practice
that
got
the
lapd
into
so
much
hot
water
in
years
past
n
v
analysis
a
variations
in
outcomes
organizational
response
to
the
termination
of
pattern
or
practice
reform
varied
considerably
between
police
departments
in
pittsburgh
cincinnati
washington
d
c
prince
george
s
county
and
los
angeles
the
pbp
was
not
able
to
sustain
organizational
changes
made
under
federal
oversight
key
outcomes
that
remained
flat
during
implementation
including
use
of
force
incidence
and
allegations
of
misconduct
now
trend
upward
though
there
is
new
leadership
in
place
the
pbp
is
less
than
two
years
removed
from
the
corruption
scandal
and
several
high
profile
force
related
incidents
that
prompted
pittsburgh
mayor
bill
peduto
to
declare
the
department
on
the
verge
of
another
consent
decree
n
by
contrast
the
process
seems
to
have
had
a
sustained
positive
effect
in
both
cincinnati
and
washington
d
c
numbers
of
post
reform
citizen
complaints
against
cpd
officers
continue
to
decline
as
does
use
of
force
incidence
and
the
number
of
injuries
sustained
by
cpd
officers
such
progress
has
contributed
to
strengthening
the
relationship
between
the
department
and
minority
community
members
n
and
a
sterling
national
reputation
n
in
washington
d
c
declines
in
both
deadly
force
incidence
and
force
based
civil
litigation
suggest
that
the
consent
decree
brought
with
it
significant
improvements
in
department
use
of
force
policy
training
and
oversight
inconsistencies
in
citizen
complaint
volume
complicate
the
picture
somewhat
as
does
the
startling
number
of
officers
that
have
faced
criminal
charges
in
the
post
reform
years
though
on
balance
the
department
appears
to
have
made
and
sustained
considerable
progress
similar
positive
trends
are
evident
in
los
angeles
though
there
has
been
less
time
to
evaluate
post
reform
progress
there
objective
evaluation
of
prince
george
s
county
is
rather
difficult
given
the
limited
amount
of
data
made
available
but
it
seems
apparent
that
the
department
continues
to
struggle
with
officer
misconduct
and
has
quite
a
ways
to
go
to
reach
the
kind
of
accountability
infrastructure
developed
in
other
jurisdictions
even
in
light
of
certain
methodological
limitations
these
findings
highlight
the
challenge
jurisdictions
face
in
working
to
institutionalize
pattern
or
practice
reform
they
also
demonstrate
how
little
we
actually
know
about
the
effectiveness
and
sustainability
of
pattern
or
practice
reform
b
the
need
for
more
consistent
data
owing
largely
to
the
absence
of
consistent
outcome
data
and
a
lack
of
cooperation
among
potential
subject
jurisdictions
it
is
rather
difficult
to
generalize
beyond
the
included
cities
further
without
the
data
needed
to
properly
establish
benchmarks
formal
consideration
of
causal
hypotheses
was
all
but
impossible
in
the
absence
of
a
deeper
quantitative
analysis
there
remains
the
possibility
that
some
of
the
trends
discussed
occurred
as
a
result
of
factors
other
than
reform
implementation
or
termination
the
need
to
evaluate
the
effectiveness
and
long
term
sustainability
of
these
initiatives
is
clear
yet
we
lack
the
basic
data
needed
to
do
so
this
need
not
be
the
case
in
some
jurisdictions
including
los
angeles
the
doj
has
insisted
on
the
capture
and
publication
of
relevant
outcome
measures
n
mandating
the
dissemination
of
use
of
force
statistics
officer
disciplinary
decisions
and
civil
litigation
results
would
be
a
solid
step
toward
facilitating
evaluation
of
future
settlement
agreements
as
would
requiring
independent
monitors
to
set
and
report
on
outcome
related
goals
rather
than
continuing
to
perform
what
amounts
to
an
exclusively
process
driven
assessment
c
the
need
for
more
thorough
nuanced
analysis
the
field
would
also
benefit
from
future
research
that
moves
beyond
the
use
of
outcome
data
to
evaluate
sustainability
beginning
with
an
assessment
of
officer
attitudes
and
organizational
culture
more
broadly
in
addition
to
contributing
to
more
thorough
descriptive
knowledge
examining
the
relationship
between
outcomes
officer
behavior
and
department
culture
would
help
to
broaden
understanding
of
those
factors
that
explain
institutionalization
success
and
failure
to
what
extent
do
these
elements
show
a
consistent
picture
of
agency
efforts
to
pursue
and
institutionalize
reform
can
a
department
achieve
and
sustain
desirable
levels
of
key
outcomes
for
example
in
spite
of
a
culture
that
may
not
reflect
core
reform
values
a
closer
look
at
the
inner
workings
of
affected
departments
would
allow
for
a
much
more
nuanced
assessment
of
change
by
necessity
the
current
research
framed
pattern
or
practice
reform
as
a
monolithic
initiative
rather
than
as
a
series
of
individual
components
in
fact
development
and
implementation
of
each
component
from
new
policies
and
training
to
community
outreach
efforts
are
unique
distinguishable
efforts
each
worthy
of
a
separate
evaluation
as
it
stands
today
it
is
all
but
impossible
to
tease
out
the
value
of
specific
components
either
in
terms
of
their
effectiveness
or
sustainability
does
a
department
s
use
of
an
early
intervention
system
actually
lead
to
fewer
incidents
of
misconduct
and
lower
civil
litigation
costs
to
what
extent
does
the
system
s
effectiveness
change
over
time
is
there
an
interaction
between
system
usage
and
officer
training
in
terms
of
both
short
and
long
term
outcomes
answers
to
these
and
other
similar
questions
would
improve
the
efficiency
of
future
settlement
agreements
and
aid
departments
in
institutionalizing
change
finally
future
research
should
continue
to
monitor
these
and
other
pattern
or
practice
jurisdictions
paying
particular
attention
to
identifying
those
factors
that
distinguish
reforms
that
endure
from
those
that
erode
explaining
the
success
in
cincinnati
would
be
a
useful
point
of
departure
to
what
extent
did
support
for
reform
among
city
leaders
and
community
residents
contribute
to
the
durability
of
that
department
s
turn
around
the
strength
of
officer
accountability
mechanisms
both
internal
to
the
cpd
and
in
agencies
like
the
citizen
complaint
authority
strategic
efforts
to
coopt
potentially
hostile
groups
like
the
officers
union
was
support
from
middle
management
as
critical
in
cincinnati
as
it
was
to
sustaining
problem
oriented
policing
strategies
in
charlotte
north
carolina
n
perhaps
sustainability
is
a
function
of
robust
efforts
to
educate
officers
to
nature
goals
and
benefits
of
such
reforms
as
some
contend
n
vi
conclusion
the
best
evidence
on
the
doj
s
pattern
or
practice
initiative
suggests
that
after
implementing
mandated
reforms
affected
departments
will
likely
possess
a
stronger
more
capable
accountability
infrastructure
more
robust
training
and
a
set
of
policies
that
reflect
national
best
practices
n
these
changes
occur
as
a
result
of
the
agreements
substantive
requirements
and
the
close
external
oversight
that
tends
to
accompany
their
implementation
but
as
the
current
research
shows
the
reform
process
is
more
complex
than
the
pursuit
of
substantial
compliance
with
settlement
terms
the
resultant
organizational
changes
are
not
self
sustaining
implementation
does
not
in
and
of
itself
guarantee
meaningful
institutionalized
change
in
fact
the
assumption
that
it
does
may
undermine
efforts
to
promote
lasting
reform
the
typical
settlement
agreement
binds
affected
departments
to
a
five
year
period
of
federal
oversight
upon
a
declaration
of
substantial
compliance
which
usually
occurs
on
or
around
the
end
of
the
contractual
term
the
doj
announces
that
department
has
been
reformed
promptly
terminates
the
agreement
and
moves
on
to
other
initiatives
n
this
abrupt
stoppage
signals
to
the
department
that
sufficient
change
has
been
made
and
that
no
further
attention
to
the
reform
is
necessary
given
how
tenuous
these
reforms
appear
to
be
and
how
unpopular
they
remain
among
the
rank
and
file
the
goals
of
the
initiative
would
likely
be
better
served
by
ongoing
external
oversight
of
the
affected
department
periodic
external
check
ups
designed
to
promote
independent
post
termination
oversight
whether
conducted
by
doj
attorneys
or
a
public
agency
similar
to
the
one
created
by
the
state
of
new
jersey
n
would
be
a
worthwhile
investment
the
absence
of
sufficient
monitoring
and
oversight
can
be
tragic
the
city
of
cleveland
knows
this
well
in
august
the
doj
opened
a
pattern
or
practice
investigation
into
claims
of
excessive
force
by
cleveland
division
of
police
cdp
officers
n
in
july
the
year
tamir
rice
was
born
and
twelve
years
before
his
fatal
encounter
with
the
cleveland
police
department
doj
attorneys
recommended
that
the
cdp
clarify
its
use
of
deadly
force
policy
n
while
raising
questions
about
the
competency
thoroughness
and
impartiality
of
cdp
use
of
force
investigations
n
nearly
identical
to
language
drawn
from
the
investigative
findings
letter
sent
to
cleveland
mayor
frank
jackson
in
december
n
though
the
case
of
police
reform
in
cleveland
is
certainly
unique
the
overarching
point
remains
organizational
change
is
a
long
and
fragile
process
effectiveness
is
not
guaranteed
and
early
gains
do
not
necessarily
equate
to
institutionalized
change
this
lesson
is
a
critical
one
for
doj
staff
and
stakeholders
in
jurisdictions
currently
under
federal
oversight
for
police
leaders
and
other
public
actors
contemplating
reform
and
for
policing
scholars
and
other
students
of
the
administrative
process
the
sooner
it
takes
hold
the
more
likely
it
is
that
changes
brought
about
through
the
pattern
or
practice
initiative
will
not
suffer
the
fate
of
other
recent

the
air
support
division
of
the
los
angeles
police
department
operates
out
of
a
labyrinthine
building
on
ramirez
street
in
the
city
s
downtown
near
the
los
angeles
river
a
looming
mass
of
utilitarian
architecture
tucked
beside
the
freeway
the
complex
appears
to
have
no
real
public
face
here
the
view
from
the
street
matters
little
instead
like
much
of
the
city
around
it
the
air
support
division
makes
more
sense
when
seen
from
above
on
the
first
of
several
flights
i
would
take
with
the
division
over
the
course
of
the
last
three
years
our
helicopter
lifted
off
into
the
haze
of
a
july
afternoon
the
true
bulk
of
the
structure
below
us
finally
revealed
itself
the
building
s
landing
deck
alone
seemed
nearly
the
size
of
an
aircraft
carrier
s
and
from
this
new
elevated
perspective
the
headquarters
indeed
resembled
a
landlocked
warship
in
the
heart
of
the
city
a
half
dozen
other
helicopters
were
waiting
there
on
the
tarmac
the
division
began
with
a
single
helicopter
in
and
it
now
has
in
all
augmented
by
a
king
air
fixed
wing
plane
the
aircrews
operate
in
a
state
of
constant
readiness
with
at
least
two
helicopters
in
flight
at
any
given
time
for
hours
of
every
day
a
ground
crew
is
suited
up
and
on
call
for
the
remaining
three
between
a
m
and
a
m
on
weekends
considered
peak
hours
the
number
of
airborne
helicopters
goes
up
to
three
although
in
a
crisis
the
division
might
send
as
many
as
four
or
five
ships
up
at
once
the
police
had
allowed
me
to
fly
with
them
so
that
i
could
see
the
world
from
their
perspective
through
its
aerial
patrols
the
division
has
uniquely
unfettered
access
to
a
fundamentally
different
experience
of
los
angeles
one
in
which
the
city
must
constantly
be
reinterpreted
from
above
in
real
time
with
the
intention
of
locating
tracking
and
interrupting
criminal
activity
this
also
means
that
the
police
are
not
only
thinking
about
los
angeles
as
it
currently
exists
their
job
is
to
anticipate
things
that
have
yet
to
occur
not
just
where
criminals
are
but
where
and
when
they
might
arrive
next
they
patrol
time
as
well
as
space
in
this
sense
although
it
has
been
in
continual
operation
for
the
past
years
the
division
has
much
to
tell
us
about
policing
the
cities
of
the
future
soon
after
we
were
airborne
a
call
came
in
for
helicopter
support
and
we
diverted
north
flying
nearly
to
the
mountains
that
separate
los
angeles
from
the
deserts
beyond
a
woman
had
reportedly
barricaded
herself
inside
a
house
with
a
loaded
millimeter
handgun
why
she
had
done
this
was
not
at
all
clear
and
it
would
remain
unexplained
to
us
but
the
police
needed
to
set
up
a
perimeter
they
needed
someone
looking
down
from
above
a
standard
two
person
helicopter
crew
consists
of
a
pilot
and
a
tactical
flight
officer
or
t
f
o
the
pilot
steers
but
the
course
is
set
by
the
t
f
o
who
monitors
as
many
as
six
simultaneous
radio
frequencies
including
emergency
calls
from
the
ground
as
well
as
chatter
from
other
police
helicopters
and
even
passenger
aircraft
landing
at
los
angeles
international
airport
the
constant
buzz
of
layered
voices
police
codes
and
call
signs
was
indecipherable
to
me
but
the
t
f
o
can
decide
in
an
instant
if
a
given
call
is
worth
responding
to
the
pilot
can
change
speed
and
direction
significantly
accelerating
up
to
miles
an
hour
turning
so
sharply
that
the
crew
will
sometimes
arrive
above
a
crime
scene
flying
sideways
their
bodies
parallel
to
the
ground
if
none
of
the
calls
are
worth
answering
however
the
crew
might
wander
some
t
f
o
s
have
a
working
knowledge
of
los
angeles
arcana
to
match
that
of
the
most
veteran
hollywood
tour
guide
from
the
address
of
charlie
chaplin
s
old
mansion
to
the
location
of
the
house
used
for
exterior
shots
in
the
brady
bunch
my
t
f
o
that
day
was
ren
e
muro
now
a
year
veteran
of
the
air
support
division
who
had
a
got
altitude
sticker
on
the
back
of
her
flight
helmet
as
we
circled
the
location
she
set
about
identifying
assessing
and
describing
the
streets
including
a
quick
scan
of
nearby
properties
where
if
the
barricaded
woman
were
to
flee
she
would
most
likely
end
up
for
minutes
muro
suggested
placements
for
officers
such
that
they
could
prevent
any
possible
escape
route
naming
specific
corners
and
clarifying
locations
even
occasionally
directing
police
officers
to
neighbors
who
were
milling
about
so
they
could
warn
them
to
head
back
inside
this
seemed
like
a
particularly
difficult
case
however
because
the
street
grid
here
was
out
of
sync
muro
explained
with
the
rest
of
the
city
the
normally
orderly
numbering
system
didn
t
apply
perhaps
because
the
neighborhood
was
punctuated
by
strange
l
shaped
streets
and
cul
de
sacs
this
presented
a
unique
narrative
challenge
for
her
in
relaying
which
bend
in
a
particular
street
she
wanted
a
patrol
car
to
head
toward
muro
persevered
flying
in
an
endless
gyre
over
parking
lots
freeway
on
ramps
and
a
confused
tangle
of
empty
streets
and
i
watched
as
a
growing
armada
of
patrol
cars
circled
below
she
patiently
arranged
them
like
chess
pieces
forming
a
tactical
geometry
that
locked
down
the
entire
neighborhood
it
was

by

before
we
could
learn
the
fate
of
the

however
we
had
moved
on
with
the
title
of
a
book
published
years
ago

we
still
use
today
for
describing

and

with
its
vigilant
top
down
views
of
a
megacity
divided
into
districts
with
clearly
defined
canals
streets
and
squares
reads
at
times
like
a
literary
helicopter
shot
as
if
we
are
passing
over
the
roofs
of
an
idyllic
metropolis
we
see
forests
and
rivers
busy
markets
and
residential
neighborhoods
a
well
ordered
geography
that
more

by
a
nearly
omnipotent

he
was
undersheriff
of
the
city
of
london
for
the
last
half
millennium
when
we
refer
to
the
ideal
city
we
have
been
invoking
an
urban
blueprint
as
imagined
by
a
cop

shapes
cities
even
paris
the
city
of
light
takes
its
nickname
according
to
one
story
from
streetlights
first
instituted
as
part
of
a
th
century
police
operation
but
the
reverse
is
also
true
cities
get
the
types
of
crime
their
design
calls
for
this
logic
extends
even
down
to
their
bedrock
tunnel
jobs
are
almost
unimaginable
in
granite
based
manhattan
for
example
but
the
soft
sedimentary
rocks
of
los
angeles
a
former
seabed
make
it
more
susceptible
to
subterranean
crime
infrastructure
also
plays
a
major
role
in
permitting
or
preventing
entire
classes
of
criminal
activity
the
construction
of
the
city
s
freeway
system
in
the
s
helped
to
instigate
a
later
spike
in
bank
crime
activity
by
offering
easy
getaways
from
financial
institutions
constructed
at
the
confluence
of
on
ramps
and
offramps
this
is
a
convenient
location
for
busy
commuters
but
also
for
prospective
bandits
who
can
pull
off
the
freeway
rob
a
bank
and
get
back
on
the
freeway
practically
before
the
police
have
been
alerted
the
maneuver
became
so
common
in
the
s
that
the
los

police
have
a
name
for
it
a
stop
and
rob
the
built
environment
may
inadvertently
catalyze
new
forms
of
illegal
activity
but
this
also
means
that
the
los
angeles
police
department
is
constantly
responding
to
criminal
innovation
with
new
forms
of
police
work
often
before
the
rest
of
the
world
even
knows
they
might
be
necessary
with
its
campaign
of
ubiquitous
aerial
surveillance
los
angeles
is
a
kind
of
real
time
r
d
site
for
the
world
s
sprawling
megacities
as
they
too
try
to
manage
the
extralegal
consequences
of
their
newfound
expansion
after
my
first
flight
cole
burdette
the
chief
tactical
flight
officer
who
supervises
the
training
of
all
the
other
t
f
o
s
walked
me
through
a
quick
tour
of
the
headquarters
a
dense
warren
of
small
corridors
and
stairways
our
final
destination
was
a
classroomlike
space
lined
with
whiteboards
where
we
sat
down
to
talk
about
crime
and
the
city
with
his
olive
green
flight
suit
and
a
military
style
haircut
burdette
could
have
passed
for
an
air
force
officer
he
was
observant
and
detailed
oriented
he
would
frequently
restart
entire
paragraphs
of
explanation
until
he
arrived
at
the
correct
narrative
sequence
and
only
then
would
he
move
on
to
his
next
point
or
answer
those
answers
were
also
astonishingly
precise
in
their
geographic
reference
points
he
would
bring
up
exact
intersections
and
even
business
addresses
somewhere
out
there
in
the
greater
maze
of
los
angeles
never
once
relying
on
a
map
each
location
would
then
serve
a
specific
role
in
burdette
s
ensuing
narrative
sometimes
even
five
or
minutes
later
as
he
tried
to
make
clear
why
a
certain
crime
or
event
had
unfolded
in
one
way
and
not
another
los
angeles
is
a
fundamentally
different
kind
of
place
from
new
york
or
chicago
he
explained
with
their
skyscrapers
and
deep
canyonlike
streets
those
dense
clusters
of
high
rises
and
towers
make
thorough
aerial
patrols
nearly
impossible
not
to
mention
potentially
dangerous
in
l
a
by
contrast
you
simply
cannot
see
the
whole
city
if
you
rely
solely
on
ground
patrols
limiting
yourself
to
roads
is
not
going
to
work
the
aerial
perspective
is
crucial
you
have
to
think
in
a
distinctly
volumetric
way
about
how
neighborhoods
are
actually
linked
and
what
the
most
efficient
routes
might
be
between
them
after
all
this
is
how
criminals
think
burdette
said
and
this
is
how
they
pioneer
new
ways
to
escape
from
you
even
the
region
s
flight
paths
have
come
to
influence
how
criminals
use
the
city
the
heavily
restricted
airspace
around
los
angeles
international
airport
burdette
pointed
out
has
transformed
the
surrounding
area
into
a
well
known
hiding
spot
for
criminals
trying
to
flee
by
car
los
angeles
police
helicopters
cannot
always
approach
the
airport
because
of
air
traffic
control
safety
concerns
indeed
all
those
planes
with
their
otherwise
invisible
approach
patterns
across
the
southern
california
sky
have
come
to
exert
a
kind
of
sculptural
effect
on
local
crimes
across
the
city
their
lines
of
flight
limit
the
effectiveness
of
police
helicopter
patrols
and
thus
alter
the
preferred
getaway
routes
burdette
s
own
spatial
understanding
of
los
angeles
easily
rivals
that
of
any
urban
historian
city
planner
or
local
architect
his
knowledge
of
the
terrain
is
the
product
of
thousands
of
hours
of
flight
time
during
which
he
has
had
to
constantly
reconcile
the
moving
map
of
the
city
displayed
on
his
helicopter
s
monitor
with
the
actual
streets
below
but
of
course
burdette
has
also
had
the
help
of
advanced
technology
over
several
more
flights
each
with
a
different
combination
of
pilot
and
tactical
flight
officer
i
was
able
to
see
this
array
of
technical
devices
firsthand
each
helicopter
for
example
contains
a
unit
that
picks
up
signals
from
lojack
tracking
systems
which
are
used
commercially
as
a
tool
for
recovering
stolen
vehicles
during
a
slow
spell
one
night
we
drifted
above
a
stretch
of
the
freeway
linking
the
streets
of
hollywood
with
the
san
fernando
valley
looking
for
stolen
cars
in
transit
the
t
f
o
intently
watched
the
craft
s
dashboard
display
fishing
for
signals
in
the
darkness
to
his
apparent
disappointment
we
found
none
later
we
tracked
a
possible
stolen
sedan
one
not
equipped
with
lojack
using
the
next
best
technological
assist
the
helicopter
s
spotlight
a
blinding
million
candlepower
inferno
justifiably
known
as
the
nightsun
it
has
the
effect
of
a
colossal
stage
lighting
rig
implying
high
drama
with
its
focused
glow
he
s
going
into
the
buildings
the
t
f
o
exclaimed
this
meant
the
car
was
heading
downtown
where
the
city
s
dense
core
of
skyscrapers
would
prevent
us
from
following
it
the
driver
wasn
t
nearly
as
savvy
as
the
pilot
and
t
f
o
thought
however
he
soon
exited
the
freeway
to
drive
straight
home
we
saw
followed
by
two
squad
cars
and
six
motorcycle
units
that
we
had
been
directing
all
along
the
driver
was
arrested
in
the
street
after
we
flew
away
we
learned
from
radio
chatter
that
it
was
simply
a
d
u
i
on
another
flight
i
was
shown
the
flir
or
forward
looking
infrared
camera
to
demonstrate
how
it
operated
my
t
f
o
that
night
instructed
his
pilot
to
head
for
the
beaches
of
santa
monica
almost
at
once
the
flir
monitor
mounted
in
the
cockpit
lit
up
with
the
strangely
beautiful
thermal
flare
of
human
life
white
glowing
forms
walking
along
the
beach
or
lying
on
dark
blankets
next
to
one
another
we
flew
quite
low
to
the
water
now
as
the
t
f
o
explained
some
basics
of
infrared
visualization
and
i
watched
as
apparently
sleeping
forms
white
hot
came
into
sharp
focus
curled
up
beneath
lifeguard
structures
there
was
nowhere
to
hide
i
saw
you
could
be
concealed
behind
the
trunk
of
a
tree
yet
an
eerie
aura
would
still
surround
you
shining
like
a
halo
looking
out
the
helicopter
window
i
saw
nothing
but
blackness
silky
and
absolute
up
and
down
the
beach
in
both
directions
but
when
i
peered
back
at
the
monitor
lights
were
moving
everywhere
like
fireflies
those
who
want
to
stay
hidden
from
flirs
are
developing
countermeasures
of
course
back
on
the
ground
i
asked
burdette
about
some
of
their
preferred
techniques
people
are
definitely
catching
on
he
said
they
ll
rub
mud
all
over
themselves
like
that
movie
predator
or
they
ll
wrap
themselves
up
in
pool
covers
to
mask
their
heat
signature
i
laughed
does
that
work
i
was
expecting
him
to
laugh
along
with
me
but
after
a
slight
hesitation
he
said
it
does
work
except
a
little
bit
of
light
starts
to
shine
out
of
each
end
once
they
ve
been
in
there
for
a
while
the
temperature
builds
up
like
it
starts
to
cook
a
little
that
s
how
we
find
them
in
city
of
quartz
his
apocalyptic
portrait
of
los
angeles
circa
mike
davis
described
the
air
support
division
as
an
invasive
space
police
a
darkly
futuristic
force
of
winged
overlords
scanning
the
metropolis
from
above
and
buzz
bombing
whole
neighborhoods
at
a
time
one
of
the
most
memorable
moments
in
his
book
is
when
he
describes
how
police
pilots
navigate
the
city
to
facilitate
ground
air
synchronization
he
writes
thousands
of
residential
rooftops
have
been
painted
with
identifying
street
numbers
transforming
the
aerial
view
of
the
city
into
a
huge
police
grid
with
this
incredible
image
davis
implies
that
the
police
have
stealthily
redesigned
urban
space
to
suit
their
own
needs
even
painting
our
addresses
onto
our
roofs
without
us
noticing
all
so
that
we
can
be
more
easily
corralled
for
davis
the
city
itself
is
a
police
tool
an
instrument
of
authority
we
can
no
longer
fully
see
and
thus
cannot
effectively
critique
or
oppose
davis
is
right
of
course
that
aerial
command
is
an
instrument
of
control
and
a
potentially
sinister
one
at
that
but
he
was
wrong
about
the
degree
to
which
the
los
angeles
police
have
been
able
to
mold
the
landscape
in
reality
those
police
branded
rooftop
numbers
are
all
but
nonexistent
at
least
for
now
when
i
asked
burdette
what
he
would
change
if
he
could
redesign
the
city
from
the
perspective
of
a
tactical
flight
officer
he
mentioned
exactly
that
idea
painting
large
identifying
numbers
on
the
roofs
of
building
complexes
like
schools
and
hospitals
if
those
sorts
of
facilities
could
be
numbered
in
a
clockwise
direction
starting
with
the
entry
building
he
explained
directing
officers
to
a
structure
deep
within
the
sprawl
would
be
far
easier
thus
far
however
such
an
ambitious
project
has
been
beyond
the
police
department
s
institutional
reach
throughout
the
history
of
aerial
surveillance
in
los
angeles
the
urban
landscape
has
largely
been
an
inheritance
beyond
the
control
of
any
single
authority
the
air
support
division
s
real
ingenuity
has
been
in
how
it
responds
to
a
world
that
it
did
not
in
fact
design
precisely
as
a
way
of
making
up
for
the
absence
of
rooftop
numbering
for
instance
the
air
support
division
has
deployed
something
burdette
called
the
rules
of
four
as
guidelines
they
fall
somewhere
between
a
rule
of
thumb
and
an
algorithm
and
they
allow
for
nearly
instantaneous
yet
accurate
aerial
navigation
the
way
the
parcels
work
in
the
city
of
los
angeles
he
began
is
that
main
street
and
first
street
are
the
hub
of
the
city
the
street
numbers
radiate
outward
by
quadrant
east
west
north
south
with
blocks
advancing
by
hundreds
the
block
below
th
street
and
building
numbers
advancing
by
fours
etc
the
rest
is
arithmetic
if
it
s
the
fourth
house
south
of
the
corner
on
the
west
side
of
the
street
burdette
explained
then
the
address
is
going
to
be
an
odd
number
the
rules
of
four
mean
that
i
can
do
four
times
four
it
s
the
fourth
house
times
four
which
is
but
because
the
numbers
on
that
side
of
the
street
are
odd
we
know
we
re
going
to
be
looking
at
either
or
so
if
the
address
is
south
of
th
street
and
it
s
the
fourth
house
on
the
west
side
of
the
street
then
it
s
going
to
be
or
it
is
going
to
be
that
address
with
the
rules
of
four
an
otherwise
intimidating
and
uncontrollable
knot
of
streets
takes
on
newfound
clarity
it
is
no
coincidence
that
the
los
angeles
police
department
built
its
main
headquarters
at
the
center
of
it
all
at
the
intersection
of
first
and
main
it
placed
the
department
at
the
numerological
heart
of
the
metropolis
the
zero
point
from
which
everything
else
emanates
as
thomas
more
proposed
a
well
ordered
metropolis
is
a
fundamental
prerequisite
for
any
visionary
act
of
urban
governance
the
air
support
division
has
simply
extended
that
observation
into
its
understanding
of
the
existing
order
in
this
case
of
the
city
s
numbered
houses
and
streets
but
if
the
promise
of
aerial
policing
is
to
make
the
city
more
legible
to
help
officers
read
events
more
clearly
the
obvious
temptation
is
to
somehow
turn
the
page
to
anticipate
future
events
as
well
and
here
we
confront
a
final
dimension
time
and
another
police
technique
called
predictive
policing
pioneered
by
the
u
c
l
a
anthropologist
jeffrey
brantingham
predictive
policing
relies
upon
an
interpretive
combination
of
machine
learning
algorithms
and
deep
pools
of
police
data
to
estimate
where
certain
types
of
crime
like
car
thefts
or
burglaries
are
most
likely
to
happen
next
brantingham
has
compared
the
technique
to
a
netflix
recommendation
algorithm
in
that
it
makes
suggestions
about
the
future
based
on
what
has
occurred
in
the
recent
past
predictive
policing
does
not
try
to
predict
specific
events
but
it
can
help
the
police
identify
surprisingly
precise
areas
of
high
crime
and
then
direct
officers
to
those
areas
casting
what
they
hope
will
be
a
pre
emptive
shadow
with
predictive
policing
cops
will
no
longer
be
describing
and
reacting
to
the
landscape
but
writing
it
in
real
time
and
with
a
far
greater
impact
on
individual
neighborhoods
than
the
simple
arrangement
of
police
cars
on
a
stakeout
or
even
numbers
on
a
roof
in
their
quest
to
establish
an
all
seeing
utopian
gaze
looking
down
upon
the
rooftops
of
an
unsuspecting
metropolis
the
police
may
have
stumbled
upon
their
most
powerful
and
perhaps
most
worrying
means
of
reshaping
the
city

preparing

by

the

are
at
the
center
of
an
increasingly
heated
debate
about
their
effectiveness
potential
impact
on
poor
and
minority
communities
and
implications
for
civil
liberties
some
police
departments
have
hailed
predpol
and
other
systems
as
instrumental
in
reducing
crime
focusing
scarce
resources
on
trouble
spots
and
individuals
and
replacing
officers
hunches
and
potential
biases
with
hard
data
but
privacy
and
racial
justice
groups
say
there
is
little
evidence
the
technologies
work
and
note
the
formulas
powering
the
systems
are
largely
a
secret
they
are
concerned
the
practice
could
unfairly
concentrate
enforcement
in
communities
of
color
by
relying
on
racially
skewed
policing
data
and
they
worry
that
officers
who
expect
a
theft
or
burglary
is
about
to
happen
may
be
more
likely
to
treat
the
people
they
encounter
as
potential
criminals
the
experiments
are
one
of
the
most
consequential
tests
of
algorithms
that
are
increasingly
powerful
forces
in
our
lives
determining
credit
scores
measuring
job
performance
and
flagging
children
who
might
be
abused
the
white

has
been
studying
how
to
balance
the
benefits
and
risks
they
pose
the
technical
capabilities
of
big

have
reached
a
level
of
sophistication
and
pervasiveness
that
demands
consideration
of
how
best
to
balance
the
opportunities
afforded
by
big
data
against
the
social
and
ethical
questions
these
technologies
raise
the
white
house
wrote
in
a
recent
report
a
seismic
shift
in
policing
it
was
a
m
on
a
monday
but
the
sheet
of
paper
coleman
held
in
his
hands
offered
a
glimpse
of
how
oct
might
go
an
auto
theft
near
van
nuys
and
glenoaks
a
burglary
at
laurel
canyon
and
roscoe
and
so
on
the
crime
forecast
is
produced
by
predpol
at
the
beginning
of
each
shift
red
boxes
spread
across
google
maps
of
the
san
fernando
valley
highlighting
by
square
foot
locations
where
predpol
concluded
property
crimes
were
likely
the
forecast
is
cutting
edge
but
it
is
used
in
the
service
of
an
old
fashioned
policing
philosophy
deterrence
between
calls
that
day
coleman
and
other
officers
were
expected
to
spend
time
and
engage
with
people
in
the
roughly
boxes
predpol
identified
around
the
foothill
division
coleman
sat
behind
the
wheel
of
his
suv
plotting
which
boxes
to
hit
the
way
someone
consulting
a
weather
map
might
weigh
whether
to
bring
an
umbrella
it
s
not
always
that
we
are
going
to
catch
someone
in
the
box
but
by
being
there
we
prevent
crime
said
capt
elaine
morales
who
oversees
the
foothill
division
foothill
is
far
from
the
glitz
of
hollywood
on
the
northern
edge
of
l
a
but
it
has
been
at
the
center
of
the
transformation
going
on
in
policing
the
division
was
one
of
the
first
in
the
nation
to
adopt
predictive
policing
five
years
ago
and
has
helped
refine
predpol
the
technology
has
spread
to
other
lapd
divisions
and
more
than
other
departments
across
the
country
making
it
the
nation
s
most
popular
predictive
policing
system
predpol
often
draws
comparisons
to
the
movie
minority
report
in
which
a
government
unit
rounds
up
future
criminals
who
have
not
yet
committed
crimes
but
one
of
the
software
s
developers
said
it
is
not
a
crystal
ball
jeff
brantingham
a
professor
at
ucla
said
crime
often
seems
random
but
it
follows
patterns
the
question
becomes
can
we
build
mathematical
structures
to
understand
these
patterns
the
answer
is
yes
absolutely
brantingham
said
the
best
way
to
capture
the
way
we
think
about
crime
patterns
is
to
think
about
earthquakes
that
s
not
just
an
analogy
brantingham
said
a
breakthrough
moment
in
predpol
s
development
came
when
one
of
his
partners
realized
an
algorithm
that
described
seismic
activity
could
be
used
to
predict
crime
just
as
earthquakes
happen
along
fault
lines
brantingham
explained
research
has
shown
crime
is
often
generated
by
structures
in
the
environment
like
a
high
school
mall
parking
lot
or
bar
additional
crimes
tend
to
follow
the
initial
event
near
in
time
and
space
like
an
aftershock
predpol
uses
years
of
crime
data
to
establish
these
patterns
and
then
the
algorithm
uses
near
real
time
crime
data
to
predict
the
next
property
crime
other
systems
use
even
more
esoteric
data
from
the
weather
to
phases
of
the
moon
to
arrive
at
their
crime
forecasts
but
does
it
work

circulating
that
morning
in
the

a
square

area
that
has
a
population
of
more

it
s
easy
to
see
why
any
system
that
could
accurately
pinpoint
crime
would
be
a
major
boon
to
the
lapd
for
decades
police
departments
have
mapped
crimes
using
pushpins
on
paper
maps
and
more
recently
blotchy
hot

maps
on
computers
the
maps
always
lagged
behind
crime
on

and
could
offer
only
general
areas

coleman
a
strapping
and
gregarious
year
veteran
of
the
lapd
said
he
and
other
officers
were
initially
skeptical
that
predpol
could
anticipate
a
crime
better
than
a
seasoned
officer
and
do
it
in
a
box
the
size
of
a

block
but
he
quickly
became
a
believer
if
you
spend
three
hours
in
that
box

after
you
had

how
two
of
his

found
a

in

in
an
area
where
predpol
predicted
an
auto
theft
the
person
escaped
but
the
officers
found
him
again
in
another
stolen
vehicle
in
another
box
where
predpol
forecast
a
theft
but
the

on
the

presents
a
murkier

crept
back

in
the
past

years
as

a
study
by
brantingham

roughly
twice

in
the
discussion
over

has
roiled
the
nation

malinowski
and
police
officials
elsewhere
see
predpol
and
similar
systems
as
a
way
to
combat
bias
among
officers
by
using
data
to
guide
patrols
through
the
use
of

it
s
less
subjective
malinowski
said
it
s
objective
but
the
aclu
and
other
groups
issued
a
statement
in
august
outlining
a
variety
of
concerns
about
predictive
policing
saying
such
systems
give
a
technological
sheen
to
old
patterns
of
policing
david
robinson
a
founder
of
the
upturn
think
tank
wrote
in
a
report
that
accompanies
the
statement
that
predictive
policing
could
increase
police
presence
in
poor
and
minority
communities
by
creating
a
ratchet
effect
the
basic
problem
is
those
forecasts
are
only
as
good
as
the
data
they
are
based
on
robinson
said
people
in
heavily
policed
communities
have
a
tendency
to
get
in
trouble
these
systems
are
apt
to
continue
those
patterns
by
relying
on
that
biased
data
brantingham
said
it
is
a
valid
concern
but
predpol
uses
only
data
from
crimes
reported
to
the
police
and
that
have
been
verified
he
said
drug
arrests
and
other
offenses
that
rely
on
the
discretion
of
officers
are
not
used
because
they
are
often
more
heavily
enforced
in
poor
and
minority
communities
robinson
also
pointed
out
that
the
public
and
even
the
police
who
use
the
software
often
do
not
know
exactly
how
the
systems
are
flagging
particular
locations
or
individuals
he
said
that
makes
accountability
impossible
ferguson
the
udc
law
professor
said
predictive
policing
raises
a
host
of
fundamental
concerns
and
questions
he
questioned
how
police
will
ensure
the
accuracy
of
the
vast
reams

the

ferguson
also
wonders
how
predictive
systems
will
affect

anticipates

will
be
used
as
a
factor
in
officers

there
is
no
question
that
this
version

is
on
the
cusp
of
wider
adoption
n
and
it
raises
key
questions
about
fundamental
issues
of
police
discretion
and
accountability
whether
the
police
identify
a
person
and
choose
to
investigate
him
for
suspected
criminal
activity
is
a
decision
largely
left
up
to
the
police
the
decisional
freedom
n
to
focus
police
attention
on
a
particular
person
or
persons
rather
than
others
what
i
ll
call
surveillance
discretion
n
is
a
widely
accepted
means
of
investigation
law
enforcement
would
be
unimaginable
without
it
this
task
of
filtering
identifying
suspects
from
the
general
population
exemplifies
traditional
police
work
police
officers
usually
generate
leads
by
focusing
their
attention
on
particular
suspects
through
observation
questioning
and
information
conveyed
by
witnesses
victims
or
other
third
parties
new
technologies
have
altered
surveillance
discretion
by
lowering
its
costs
and
increasing
the
capabilities
of
the
police
to
identify
suspicious
persons
furthermore
soon
it
will
be
feasible
and
affordable
for
the
government
to
record
store
and
analyze
nearly
everything
people
do
n
the
police
will
rely
on
alerts
generated
by
computer
programs
that
sift
through
the
massive
quantities
of
available
information
for
patterns
of
suspicious
activity
the
selection
of
investigative
targets
that
emerge
from
big
data
rather
than
from
traditional
human
investigation
represents
an
important
expansion
in
the
powers
of
the
police
that
expansion
in
turn
calls
out
for
new
tools
of
police
accountability
these
big
data
tools
produce
dramatically
different
ways
of
identifying
suspects
by
applying
computer
analytics
to
very
large
collections
of
digitized
data
n
law
enforcement
agencies
can
identify
suspicious
persons
and
activities
on
a
massive
scale
n
while
these
tools
are
useful
in
tracking
down
evidence
of
past
crimes
big
data
also
provides
the
police
with
new
capabilities
to
identify
ongoing
and
future
threats
the

of

security
uses

n
police
departments
in
santa
cruz
ca
seattle
and
new
york
city
are
experimenting
with
predictive
policing
software
to
identify
geographic
places
where
crime
is
likely
to
take
place
n
one
day
the
police
nationwide
may
use
location
based
tweets
to
inform
those
same
predictions
n
the
chicago
police
department
already
uses
big
data
tools
to
identify
high
risk
persons
based
on
the
strength
of
a
person
s
social
networks
a
technique
borrowed
from
the
military
s
analysis
of
insurgent
groups
n
these
are
not
investigations
about
already
identified
suspects
or
crimes
n
but
rather
the
identification
of
potentially
suspicious
persons
places
and
events
the
exercise
of
surveillance
discretion
in
traditional
policing
attracts
little
attention
from
judges
or
legal
scholars
why
the
answer
is
likely
because
we
assume
that
the
police
should
possess
such
powers
and
even
if
theoretically
worrisome
surveillance
discretion
is
a
power
greatly
limited
in
practice
after
all
police
investigations
typically
only
focus
on
a
limited
number
of
persons
because
of
practical
limitations
imposed
by
resources
and
technology
but
those
assumptions
will
become
outdated
when
the
police
possess
the
tools
to
exercise
automated
surveillance
discretion
on
a
massive
scale
while
the
details
leaked
by
edward
snowden
about
the
mass
surveillance
programs
of
the
nsa
are
widely
known
less
familiar
are
the
growing
technological
capabilities
of
local
police
departments
yet
these
emerging
technologies
raise
important
questions
about
the
expanded
surveillance
discretion
of
the
more
than
state
and
local
police
departments
that
assume
primary
responsibility
for
law
enforcement
in
the
united
states
n
this
expansion
of
surveillance
discretion
raises
important
legal
and
policy
questions
with
regard
to
police
oversight
in
the
traditional
model
of
police
investigation
the
police
may
decide
after
some
initial
investigation
to
target
a
specific
person
or
persons
for
further
scrutiny
the
supreme
court
s
decisions
make
clear
that
the
fourth
amendment
has
little
regulatory
power
over
this
discretionary
process
n
unlike
arrests
or
wiretaps
the
decision
to
focus
police
attention
on
a
particular
person
without
more
is
unlikely
to
be
considered
a
fourth
amendment
event
thus
the
police
are
not
required
to
demonstrate
probable
cause
or
reasonable
suspicion
the
usual
standards
of
individualized
suspicion
to
decide
whether
to
conduct
surveillance
on
an
individual
n
surprisingly
there
is
little
discussion
of
these
decisions
that
the
police
make
about
individuals
before
any
search
detention
or
arrest
takes
place
n
rather
current
unresolved
issues
of
police
technology
have
focused
on
whether
a
particular
use
is
a
fourth
amendment
search
requiring
a
warrant
and
probable
cause
whether
such
constitutional
requirements
apply
to
the
collection
of
historical
cell
site
data
is
one
such
example
n
courts
around
the
country
have
disagreed
about
whether
these
situations
implicate
fourth
amendment
protections
and
it
may
take
years
for
the
united
states
supreme
court
to
resolve
these
disputes
and
while
the
enforcement
discretion
of
police
and
prosecutors
whether
to
enforce
the
law
against
a
particular
defendant
or
not
is
a
familiar
topic
in
legal
scholarship
n
surveillance
discretion
when
how
and
whether
the
police
may
target
a
person
or
persons
in
the
initial
phases
of
governmental
investigation
does
not
attract
the
same
attention
little
scholarship
has
addressed
when
and
how
people
should
be
considered
targets
for
police
surveillance
in
the
first
place
even
if
the
police
do
nothing
but
watch
closely
some
attention
has
already
been
paid
to
the
use
of
big
data
by
the
police
such
as
with
predictive
policing
software
but
it
addresses
an
important
but
familiar
line
drawing
problem
whether
decisions
made
by
software
can
help
justify
conventional
fourth
amendment
activities
like
stop
and
frisks
n
surveillance
discretion
addresses
the
power
of
the
police
at
an
earlier
stage
when
the
police
focus
on
persons
suspected
of
ongoing
or
future
criminal
activity
but
before
any
intervention
takes
place
n
this
preliminary
investigative
power
is
essential
since
police
need
to
possess
some
legal
means
to
develop
the
required
fourth
amendment
standard
of
individualized
suspicion
for
a
later
search
or
seizure
n
this
preliminary
stage
of
police
investigation
usually
receives
little
attention
because
it
is
not
typically
considered
activity
reached
by
the
fourth
amendment
at
all
n
yet
this
new
expansion
of
surveillance
discretion
by
big
data
presents
an
underappreciated
challenge
to
our
usual
thinking
about
police
regulation
n
how
the
police
will
use
big
data
tools
particularly
in
future
oriented
ways
is
as
pressing
an
issue
of
police
accountability
as
individual
officer
bias
excessive
force
and
other
pressing
issues
currently
the
topic
of
public
debate
unlike
a
police
brutality
case
captured
on
a
cellphone
video
however
expanded
police
power
by
means
of
big
data
is
difficult
for
most
of
the
public
to
see
and
understand
such
secrecy
and
opacity
calls
for
new
tools
of
accountability
ii
how
big
data
expands
surveillance
discretion
big
data
will
revolutionize
the
surveillance
discretion
of
the
police
n
by
allowing
the
identification
of
large
numbers
of
suspicious
activities
and
people
by
sifting
through
large
quantities
of
digitized
data
big
data
expands
the
surveillance
discretion
of
the
police
of
course
the
use
of
big
data
is
not
the
first
time
the
police
have
focused
on
numbers
information
or
record
keeping
accurate
documentation
of
crime
and
criminals
has
been
a
concern
that
reaches
back
to
the
nineteenth
century
and
the
invention
of
the
bertillonage
system
n
as
they
became
more
professional
and
bureaucratic
police
of
the
twentieth
century
have
sometimes
been
described
as
knowledge
workers
for
whom
information
processing
rather
than
crime
control
is
a
primary
focus
n
even
in
their
crime
control
capacities
large
urban
police
departments
in
the
s
had
already
turned
toward
data
driven
or
intelligence
based
policing
styles
of
which
the
most
famous
is
the
n
y
p
d
s
compstat
system
n
the
use
of
big
data
then
accelerates
and
magnifies
trends
that
until
now
had
been
slowly
moving
toward
a
heavier
reliance
on
information
and
computers
with
a
specific
emphasis
on
data
analytics
understanding
how
expanded
surveillance
discretion
should
be
regulated
requires
both
an
understanding
of
the
big
data
phenomenon
and
how
it
has
begun
to
influence
policing
a
what
is
big
data
the
amount
of
data
in
big
data
almost
defies
comprehension
nearly
all
of
the
world
s
stored
information
today
is
digital
n
and
we
are
surpassing
existing
mathematical
terms
to
quantify
it
n
the
types
of
information
that
are
now
digitized
include
ones
that
once
existed
in
analog
format
books
phone
call
logs
retail
purchases
as
well
as
new
kinds
of
information
made
possible
by
today
s
technologies
internet
searches
social
media
posts
data
from
the
internet
of
things
n
the
library
of
congress
which
has
archived
every
twitter
tweet
since
receives
about
half
a
billion
per
day
n
every
day
some
of
facebook
s
billion
users
upload
more
than
million
photos
to
its
website
n
and
digitization
alters
the
nature
of
the
information
itself
information
that
can
be
digitized
can
also
be
collected
searched
quantified
compared
assessed
and
endlessly
repurposed
n
most
people
know
this
is
true
from
the
automated
suggestions
they
have
encountered
on
services
like
facebook
netflix
and
amazon
n
apart
from
its
quantity
big
data
provides
a
very
different
way
of
understanding
and
probing
the
world
of
information
n
consider
how
big
data
has
altered
conventional
research
if
traditional
scientific
research
begins
with
a
question
and
then
uses
that
hypothesis
to
identify
and
collect
the
appropriate
data
big
data
upends
that
practice
n
because
data
is
being
generated
all
of
the
time
researchers
working
with
big
data
do
not
have
to
shape
or
limit
their
data
collection
nor
do
they
need
to
begin
with
a
question
indeed
the
question
can
arise
from
the
data
itself
this
is
why
for
example
the
constant
stream
of
posted
tweets
on
twitter
can
generate
data
and
insights
for
meteorologists
advertisers
and
epidemiologists
n
that
insight
has
implications
for
the
surveillance
discretion
of
the
police
as
well
just
as
questions
may
emerge
from
the
data
for
the
purposes
of
research
suspects
can
emerge
from
the
data
for
purposes
of
investigation
these
suspicious
persons
and
activities
can
appear
even
if
police
do
not
seek
a
particular
person
for
a
particular
crime
nor
do
they
need
to
begin
the
collection
of
data
if
data
is
already
being
collected
all
of
the
time
moreover
the
search
for
causality
a
primary
objective
in
scientific
research
is
rendered
unnecessary
by
big
data
since
correlations
found
on
a
mass
scale
can
be
just
as
if
not
more
useful
than
attempts
to
find
causes
n
that
is
why
for
example
google
s
identification
of
the
forty
five
search
terms
most
strongly
correlated
with
historical
flu
data
held
the
promise
of
predicting
future
outbreaks
even
if
they
provided
correlations
rather
than
causes
n
in
the
big
data
world
knowing
what
is
often
good
enough
rather
than
why
n
in
criminal
investigations
it
may
not
be
necessary
to
know
why
certain
patterns
of
driving
purchasing
or
movement
are
associated
with
crime
if
the
police
can
claim
a
high
correlation
between
the
two
a
high
degree
of
correlation
itself
might
provide
justification
for
heightened
police
attention
b
how
big
data
expands
surveillance
discretion
like
marketers
health
care
professionals
and
traffic
controllers
police
departments
have
begun
to
test
and
adopt
the
tools
of
big
data
these
approaches
hold
the
potential
to
change
many
aspects
of
traditional
policing
including
surveillance
discretion
three
examples
illustrate
the
range
of
big
data
tools
already
in
preliminary
use
or
under
consideration
by
police
departments
the
first
is
the
use
of
automatic
license
plate
readers
sometimes
also
referred
to
as
alpr
or
anpr
by
the
police
while
the
police
have
used
cameras
to
take
pictures
of
car
license
plates
since
the
s
n
alpr
technology
is
especially
notable
today
because
it
has
become
inexpensive
sophisticated
and
increasingly
pervasive
n
alpr
systems
use
cameras
mounted
on
patrol
cars
or
at
fixed
locations
and
data
analytics
to
identify
license
plate
numbers
n
these
devices
can
read
up
to
fifty
license
plates
per
second
and
typically
record
the
date
time
and
gps
location
of
every
scanned
plate
n
alpr
systems
then
read
the
scans
and
compare
them
against
a
hot
list
which
contains
license
plate
data
for
information
such
as
stolen
cars
parking
violations
and
terrorist
watch
lists
n
one
city
even
has
used
alpr
scans
to
detect
those
with
delinquent
property
taxes
n
the
use
of
multiple
cameras
at
multiple
times
makes
it
possible
to
see
where
and
when
one
car
and
presumably
the
person
registered
as
the
owner
moves
around
in
time
and
space
far
from
a
specialized
surveillance
technique
alpr
cameras
are
used
by
the
vast
majority
of
police
departments
around
the
country
n
a
recent
investigation
by
the
news
outlet
ars
technica
shows
the
extent
of
information
that
can
be
captured
by
a
single
police
department
s
alpr
system
n
responding
to
a
public
records
request
the
police
department
of
oakland
california
released
million
scans
of
million
unique
plates
representing
three
years
worth
of
alpr
data
n
while
most
vehicles
in
the
data
set
only
appeared
a
few
times
some
notable
exceptions
illustrate
how
much
information
alpr
scans
can
reveal
one
car
was
recorded
times
over
two
years
n
ars
technica
with
the
help
of
a
data
analyst
was
able
to
make
educated
guesses
about
the
habits
and
addresses
of
those
identified
through
their
locational
data
n
in
addition
to
the
scans
taken
directly
by
cameras
operated
by
the
police
themselves
private
databases
of
billions
of
alpr
scans
provide
the
police
with
another
source
of
surveillance
data
private
alpr
cameras
are
now
a
routine
tool
of
repo
men
repossession
agents
with
truck
mounted
alpr
cameras
that
can
scan
up
to
plates
a
day
and
compare
them
against
bank
default
lists
n
these
alpr
databases
are
available
both
for
private
and
public
customers
including
law
enforcement
agencies
in
march
the
new
york
police
department
announced
a
proposed
contract
with
vigilant
solutions
one
of
the
largest
alpr
companies
in
the
united
states
with
a
reported
database
of
billion
scans
n
these
alpr
readers
can
function
as
time
machines
to
investigate
already
completed
crimes
for
instance
vigilant
solutions
demonstrates
in
a
youtube
video
how
the
police
in
a
hypothetical
homicide
investigation
can
identify
alpr
scans
with
a
specified
set
of
spatial
and
temporal
parameters
to
see
which
cars
and
registered
drivers
have
passed
through
the
area
and
may
serve
as
potential
suspects
n
similarly
alpr
data
can
be
used
to
track
an
individual
person
through
time
and
space
to
determine
his
whereabouts
to
check
an
alibi
to
investigate
a
lead
etc
but
alpr
data
can
expand
surveillance
discretion
further
to
identify
as
yet
unknown
patterns
of
suspicious
activity
geo
fencing
involves
the
designation
of
a
specific
geographical
area
that
can
be
circumscribed
with
an
alpr
virtual
fence
that
identifies
every
car
that
enters
that
zone
n
consider
for
example
a
program
that
would
identify
suspicious
patterns
of
activity
such
as
repeated
visits
by
individual
drivers
to
a
location
associated
with
drug
trafficking
a
second
use
of
big
data
is
the
collection
and
analysis
of
social
media
data
while
many
police
departments
polled
state
they
monitor
social
media
these
uses
usually
take
the
form
of
individual
officers
personally
searching
or
using
social
media
sites
n
the
los
angeles
police
department
for
instance
reportedly
directs
forty
officers
for
this
purpose
n
human
monitoring
of
social
media
can
include
discrete
searches
for
threatening
words
suspects
and
gangs
in
other
cases
the
police
might
find
information
through
social
media
by
friending
suspected
criminals
and
learning
information
through
online
posts
n
but
such
uses
of
social
media
are
limited
individual
officers
cannot
search
for
every
conceivable
variation
of
suspicious
language
and
social
connections
with
suspects
online
require
identifying
them
in
the
first
place
instead
of
relying
on
human
beings
a
big
data
approach
looks
through
all
or
nearly
all
of
the
available
data
and
uses
computer
algorithms
to
identify
suspicious
patterns
of
activity
or
to
reveal
previously
unknown
links
among
criminal
suspects
that
is
the
premise
of
a
number
of
commercial
software
products
now
marketed
to
police
departments
n
social
media
monitor
is
a
cloud
based
service
that
will
watch
social
networks
for
suspicious
activities
n
applying
language
analytics
and
sentiment
analysis
to
services
like
twitter
and
facebook
social
media
monitor
claims
to
warn
law
enforcement
clients
of
ongoing
or
potential
threats
of
violence
another
software
product
intrado
s
beware
promotes
itself
as
a
tool
to
help
first
responders
understand
the
nature
of
the
environment
they
may
encounter
during
the
window
of
a
event
n
beware
does
so
by
assigning
a
threat
rating
to
a
person
based
on
an
analysis
of
billions
of
commercial
and
public
records
n
the
beware
algorithm
sorts
through
both
information
already
familiar
to
the
police
like
registered
cars
and
rap
sheets
and
novel
like
residents
online
comments
social
media
and
recent
purchases
for
warning
signs
n
a
third
example
of
expanded
surveillance
discretion
is
the
use
of
social
network
analysis
by
police
to
identify
suspicious
or
vulnerable
individuals
n
social
networks
refer
to
a
set
of
personal
connections
among
a
group
of
people
the
basic
unit
of
analysis
in
social
network
analysis
consists
of
the
link
between
two
people
n
the
ties
relationships
between
nodes
people
can
take
many
forms
drug
transactions
phone
calls
or
physical
contacts
between
victims
and
offenders
based
on
mathematical
modeling
social
network
analysis
maps
a
particular
groups
of
relationships
most
importantly
the
approach
identifies
the
relative
importance
or
centrality
of
nodes
individuals
their
importance
to
the
criminal
system
role
level
of
activity
control
over
the
flow
of
information
and
relationships
n
social
network
algorithms
developed
for
law
enforcement
purposes
by
private
companies
promise
to
identify
non
obvious
relationships
in
known
criminal
associations
while
the
police
might
know
the
leadership
of
a
criminal
gang
they
may
not
know
others
who
ha
ve
the
most
influence
in
a
gang
or
who
transmit
the
most
information
in
the
fastest
amount
of
time
n
this
information
can
then
be
used
by
the
police
to
focus
their
attentions
on
particular
individuals
that
may
have
escaped
police
attention
through
conventional
surveillance
the
aggressive
use
of
social
network
analysis
by
the
chicago
police
department
is
illustrative
n
beginning
in
the
chicago
police
have
relied
upon
the
use
of
network
analysis
to
direct
preventive
policing
measures
n
beginning
with
the
identification
of
the
sixty
known
gangs
and
factions
within
the
city
the
chicago
police
then
map
out
these
relationships
to
identify
both
positive
and
negative
connections
among
groups
and
individual
members
n
the
name
of
a
shooting
victim
for
instance
might
trigger
a
computer
warning
to
the
police
that
four
individuals
should
be
treated
with
suspicion
not
because
of
anything
they
did
but
because
they
are
known
gang
members
feuding
with
the
victim
s
gang
n
in
addition
another
notification
might
alert
the
police
of
eight
potential
members
of
the
victim
s
own
gang
who
might
be
at
risk
of
turning
to
violence
in
retaliation
n
no
traditional
physical
evidence
links
these
persons
to
the
actual
shooting
but
social
network
analysis
predicts
future
violence
associated
with
them
and
thus
directs
police
resources
and
attention
the
chicago
police
department
uses
a
heat
list
to
focus
its
preventive
policing
efforts
this
heat
list
is
based
upon
research
that
found
that
those
with
close
social
ties
to
a
homicide
victim
were
times
more
likely
to
be
involved
as
a
future
victim
or
perpetrator
of
violence
in
response
the
chicago
police
piloted
a
program
in
to
identify
these
persons
at
high
risk
for
future
violence
n
a
computer
analysis
weighs
risk
factors
some
that
are
not
especially
surprising
such
as
a
person
s
rap
sheet
his
warrant
or
parole
status
weapons
or
drug
arrests
but
also
some
that
are
including
a
person
s
acquaintances
and
the
arrest
records
and
possible
violent
victimization
of
those
socially
connected
to
the
person
n
the
approximately
people
who
emerge
from
the
analysis
with
the
highest
scores
constitute
the
heat
list
a
group
targeted
for
the
chicago
police
department
s
custom
notifications
program
n
being
on
the
heat
list
results
in
a
personal
home
visit
from
a
chicago
police
officer
who
warns
the
person
of
the
legal
consequences
that
will
result
if
he
engages
in
criminal
activity
n
those
on
the
list
are
also
told
that
they
are
also
at
a
high
risk
for
becoming
victims
not
just
perpetrators
of
future
violence
n
those
who
receive
these
custom
notifications
are

its
potential

big

to
sift
through
vast
amounts
of
data
that
have
no
obvious

to

but
through
computer

may
suggest
criminally
suspicious
activity
this
is
similar
to
traditional
surveillance
discretion
courts
have
permitted
police
to
conduct
stops
based
on
facts
that
would
not
seem
suspicious
to
us
at

it
is

mining

whether
social
connections
can
be
plotted
on

big

tools
allow
law
enforcement
agencies
to
collect
aggregate
and
analyze
social
connections
using
tailored
algorithms
rather
than
a
specialized
human
skill
n
mining
social
connections
might
one
day
be
an
ordinary
aspect
of
local
police
departments
from
active
investigations
to
passive
alerts
the
traditional
methods
the
police
use
to
identify
or
predict
ongoing
or
future
crimes
require
time
and
effort
the
process
is
by
necessity
inefficient
by
deciding
to

on
some
individuals

because

part
of

big
data
might
also
bring
new
and
unexpected
insights
about
criminal
behavior
n
the
scale
of
automation
also
widens
the
scope
of
surveillance
over
many
more
potentially
suspicious
persons
potential
benefits
diminishing
troubling
uses
of
discretion
big
data
tools
at
least
in
theory
promise
to
introduce
more
fairness
into
surveillance
discretion
traditional
policing
relies
upon
an
officer
s
ability
to
identify
suspicious
behavior
but
because
nothing
is
inherently
suspicious
n
conventional
police
decisions
are
normative
judgments
that
are
highly
dependent
on
subjective
considerations
and
sometimes
improper
ones
n
how
police
identify
suspicious
people
thus
sometimes
reflects
stereotypes
about
race
and
class
particularly
about
young
african
american
men
in
economically
depressed
neighborhoods
after
all
the
police
like
the
rest
of
us
are
cognitive
misers
who
rely
upon
shortcuts
to
process
the
world
around
most
efficiently
n
discretion
also
plays
a
role
in
departmental
as
well
as
individual
decisions
departments
set
priorities
on
whether
to
focus
on
prostitution
and
drugs
sales
on
the
streets
for
instance
rather
than
within
private
spaces
n
big
data
tools
could
curb
police
discretion
in
two
ways
first
algorithms
that
search
for
suspicious
activity
could
greatly
reduce
or
eliminate
race
or
class
based
biases
for
which
the
police
are
often
criticized
although
this
too
may
hide
hidden
problems
n
second
certain
crimes
that
may
be
especially
amenable
to
big
data
policing
particularly
white
collar
financial
fraud
may
lead
to
more
equitable
distribution
of
law
enforcement
resources
n
alternatives
to
flawed
investigative
tools
increasing
reliance
on
big
data
tools
might
one
day
eclipse
the
use
of
traditional
surveillance
and
investigation
methods
that
have
received
significant
criticism
consider
police
reliance
on
informants
n
when
police
rely
on
one
or
a
few
people
to
identify
suspects
the
results
are
necessarily
skewed
informants
only
identify
people
they
know
from
the
neighborhoods
they
know
informant
culture
then
plays
a
key
role
in
reproducing
racial
disparities
within
the
criminal
justice
system
n
rather
than
rely
on
the
usual
suspects
or
the
usual
neighborhoods
big
data
programs
search
through
all
available
information
for
future
or
ongoing
crimes
n
big
data
tools
might
also
supplant
some
needs
for
covert
policing
in
the
physical
world
undercover
operations
are
justified
as
a
dirty
but
necessary
business
because
without
them
many
types
of
crimes
could
not
otherwise
be
investigated
n
big
data
tools
may
provide
an
alternative
white
collar
crime
for
instance
is
now
difficult
to
identify
without
undercover
investigations
and
informants
however
with
a
computer
program
that
can
scan
the
enormous
quantities
of
securities
trading
data
for
patterns
of
potential
insider
trading
n
law
enforcement
officials
may
be
able
to
rely
less
on
covert
operations
often
criticized
for
their
secrecy
and
implementation
alternatively
though
the

may
simply
use
big

tools
in

to
covert
tactics
they
adopt

of

will
produce
information
capable
of

and
third
party
examination
a
stark
contrast
from
conventional
surveillance
fourth
amendment
law
requires
police
to
provide
specific
articulable
facts
to
justify
stops
and
arrests
n
these
reasons
are
usually
a
mix
of
experience
and
observation
to
make
matters
more
difficult
the
police
feel
pressure
to
conform
their
justifications
to
requirements
about
legally
sufficient
reasons
that
will
hold
up
in
court
if
challenged
yet
the
complete
explanation
for
what
motivates
a
stop
is
likely
unknowable
even
to
the
officer
himself
what
stands
out
in
an
officer
s
mind
as
suspicious
is
the
product
of
an
idiosyncratic
unaccountable
unknowable
personal
algorithm
n
moreover
in
its
fourth
amendment
decisions
the
supreme
court
has
shown
little
interest
in
subjecting
the
internal
decision
making
processes
of
police
officers
to
any
real
scrutiny
n
potential
concerns
old
problems
in
new
packages
how
whether
and
when
the
police

their
legal
authority

poses
a
basic
challenge
for
democratic
policing
law
enforcement
is
impossible
without
giving
the
police
choices
yet
delegating
the
police
discretion
raises
questions
about
fair
minded
law
enforcement
in
a
democratic
society
n
compounding
our
discomfort
with
police
discretion
is
the
fact
that
police
are
notoriously
secretive
not
just
about
their
discretion
but
about
nearly
everything
n
in
theory
the
increasing
use
of
computers
and
numbers
might
force

practices
to
be
more
transparent

accountable

to
provide

discretionary
human
decisions
can
play
an
important
role
in
big

in
ways
that
may
not
be
obvious
first
very
basic
decisions
about

involve
discretion

mathematical
model
to
adopt
what
data
to
use
and
how
to
display
that
data
among
other
considerations
n
second
police
departments
will
make
choices
about
how
and
where
to
apply
big
data
tools
these
are
discretionary
decisions
similar
to
how
departments
deploy
human
resources
predictive
policing
software
already
in
use
by
some
police
departments
focuses
heavily
on
property
crimes
because
its
predictions
about
other
crimes
are
not
as
accurate
n
the
information
used
by
big
data
tools
may
also
be
products
of
hidden
police
discretion
n
arrest
information
at
least
for
minor
offenses
reflects
highly
discretionary
decisions
if
arrest
records
are
used
in
an
analysis
to
focus
police
resources
this
can
lead
to

even
though
they
are
the

moreover
these

discretionary

can
be
further
influenced
by

ones

the
potential

means
many
things
including
giving
an
otherwise
technically
eligible
person
a
break
on
behavior
which
would
otherwise
warrant
a
summons
a
citation
or
an

good
discretion
also
includes
what
police
might
know
about
a
neighborhood
and
its
community
local
knowledge
that
might
not
be
amenable
to
data

knowledge

help

distinguish

ones

determination
about

perceived
in

may
lead
to
a
conclusion

accountability
for
expanded
surveillance
discretion
when
the
police
can
watch
many
more
people
and
activities
with
increasing
sophistication
and
at
lower
cost
we
need
new
transparency
and
accountability
mechanisms
this
section
considers
what
issues
will
be
raised
by
the
development
of
new
accountability
mechanisms
as
well
as
some
suggestions
for
what
form
those
mechanisms
might
take
a
why
the
fourth
amendment
does
not
apply
traditionally
surveillance
discretion
is
a
power
enjoyed
by
the
police
with
few
legal
constraints
when
the
police
investigate
a
crime
they
might
decide
to
focus
their
attention
on
one
particular
person
or
group
of
people
to
confirm
or
dispel
suspicions
that
arise
after
their
preliminary
investigation
the
police
may
watch
or
follow
the
suspect
on
the
street
talk
to
his
associates
or
comb
through
publicly
available
information
n
so
long
as
the
police
confine
the
targets
of
their
investigation
to
areas
that
are
not
private
even
if
their
methods
are
secretive
or
covert
the
police
are
not
required
to
have
any
particular
individualized
suspicion
about
the
suspect
to
focus
their
attention
on
him
n
how
long
the
police
watch
a
person
why
the
police
decide
to
investigate
one
person
rather
than
another
and
why
they
decide
to
investigate
a
crime
at
all
are
matters
for
police
discretion
largely
because
the
fourth
amendment
does
not
usually
apply
to
these
activities
n
that
the
fourth
amendment
does
not
regulate
these
early
stages
of
investigation
draws
on
well
established
supreme
court
case
law
ever
since
the
supreme
court
formulated
the
reasonable
expectation
of
privacy
test
nearly
fifty
years
ago
in
katz
v
united
states
n
it
is
generally
understood
that
the
police
are
free
to
investigate
public
places
speak
with
people
consensually
n
and
access
information
that
has
already
been
given
to
third
parties
n
none
of
these
areas
are
searches
for
fourth
amendment
purposes
all
of
these
areas
are
those
in
which
people
knowingly
expose
information
to
the
public
and
thus
also
to
the
police
n
fourth
amendment
requirements
apply
then
after
the
police
have
decided
to
use
any
information
they
have
collected
as
a
basis
to
interfere
with
a
person
s
legally
recognized
interests
if
the
police
subject
a
person
to
a
temporary
investigative
detention
they
are
required
to
have
reasonable
suspicion
before
doing
so
n
an
arrest
or
full
search
requires
probable
cause
and
in
some
cases
prior
judicial
approval
in
the
form
of
a
warrant
n
before
that
point
of
intervention
however
the
police
can
select
a
person
or
group
of
persons
for
particular
attention
without
having
to
provide
a
justification
for
doing
so
the
police
are
not
restricted
by
being
required
to
have
a
reasonable
suspicion
to
observe
or
investigate
persons
in
public
and
public
data
to
detect
those
persons
who
commit
crime
n
in
other
words
surveillance
that
does
not
intrude
upon
recognized
fourth
amendment
interests
requires
no
prior
justification
by
the
police
n
the
who
how
and
why
of
police
decisions
to
single
out
persons
for
attention
is
a
matter
of
police
discretion
and
because
the
fourth
amendment
does
not
regulate
surveillance
discretion
courts
have
had
little
to
say
about
it
in
response
to
claims
that
police
surveillance
is
overly
intrusive
or
controlling
courts
have
been
generally
unsympathetic
lawful
surveillance
in
the
form
of
officers
walking
their
beat
or
riding
in
prowl
cars
has
been
described
as
proper
police
function
even
if
the
surveillance
might
influence
the
targeted
person
s
actions
in
public
n
as
the
eighth
circuit
observed
in
one
case
judicial
review
of
investigative
decisions
like
oversight
of
prosecutions
tends
to
chill
law
enforcement
by
subjecting
the
investigator
s
motives
and
decisionmaking
to
outside
inquiry
n
in
rejecting
claims
regarding
surveillance
discretion
some
courts
have
simply
stated
that
there
is
no
constitutional
right
to
be
free
of
investigation
n
the
only
caveat
that
courts
raise
is
that
surveillance
discretion
cannot
be
exercised
in
a
discriminatory
fashion
n
the
view
that
no
individual
has
a
right
to
be
free
of
investigation
has
also
been
the
premise
of
a
related
legal
question
whether
the
police
must
have
at
least
reasonable
suspicion
before
beginning
an
undercover
operation
targeting
a
particular
person
the
answer
from
courts
has
been
a
resounding
no
n
consider
the
abscam
scandal
of
the
s
which
began
with
an
fbi
undercover
operation
that
focused
first
on
the
trafficking
of
stolen
property
but
eventually
turned
to
political
corruption
evidence
from
abscam
eventually
led
to
the
convictions
of
several
government
officials
including
a
u
s
senator
and
six
members
of
the
house
of
representatives
once
abscam
was
brought
to
public
attention
n
members
of
congress
considered
whether
individualized
suspicion
requirements
should
apply
at
this
earlier
investigative
stage
but
proposed
legislation
imposing
a
warrant
requirement
for
undercover
investigations
never
came
to
pass
n
in
some
rare
instances
police
surveillance
by
itself
can
give
rise
to
constitutional
claims
otherwise
lawful
surveillance
by
the
police
can
be
the
basis
of
a
civil
rights
claim
if
the
surveillance
interferes
with
other
constitutional
rights
n
for
example
in
october
the
third
circuit
reinstated
a
federal
civil
rights
lawsuit
alleging
that
the
nypd
violated
first
amendment
and
equal
protection
rights
by
engaging
in
a
surveillance
program
of
newark
s
muslim
community
n
the
supreme
court
s
decision
in
laird
v
tatum
n
however
makes
it
difficult
for
plaintiffs
to
win
cases
simply
because
they
are
concerned
about
the
effects
of
lawfully
collected
surveillance
in
laird
the
plaintiffs
claimed
that
army
surveillance
of
civilian
political
activity
infringed
upon
their
first
amendment
rights
n
the
supreme
court
held
however
that
the
laird
plaintiffs
lacked
standing
to
bring
their
claims
because
they
lacked
any
justiciable
injury
absent
a
specific
present
objective
harm
due
to
the
surveillance
or
threat
of
a
specific
future
harm
the
mere
existence
without
more
of
a
governmental
investigative
and
data
gathering
activity
could
not
form
the
basis
of
a
federal
lawsuit
n
as
a
result
of
this
standard
lawsuits
complaining
only
about
intrusive
but
otherwise
lawful
surveillance
often
fail
n
because
so
few
cases
state
much
about
surveillance
discretion
other
than
to
acknowledge
the
wide
latitude
given
to
police
to
exercise
their
powers
we
might
look
to
other
analogous
areas
of
the
law
where
courts
have
considered
challenges
to
the
preliminary
exercises
of
governmental
power
for
instance
many
defendants
have
challenged
the
discretion
of
police
and
prosecutors
for
singling
them
out
for
arrest
or
prosecution
many
cases
have
considered
defendants
claims
that
the
police
or
prosecutors
have
unfairly
or
arbitrarily
focused
on
them
but
here
too
courts
have
yielded
considerable
discretion
to
law
enforcement
officials
in
deciding
how
whether
and
when
to
exercise
their
powers
n
claims
of
discriminatory
enforcement
in
violation
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
are
available
in
theory
but
in
practice
most
fail
because
of
the
difficulty
of
proving
the
necessary
elements
n
moreover
the
supreme
court
s
decisions
in
whren
v
united
states
n
and
atwater
v
city
of
lago
vista
n
foreclose
the
ability
of
defendants
to
complain
of
arbitrary
or
pretextual
enforcement
in
fourth
amendment
claims
n
what
serves
as
a
check
on
traditional
surveillance
discretion
of
the
police
then
if
not
fourth
amendment
law
the
answer
lies
in
practical
rather
than
legal
restraints
first
surveillance
has
been
naturally
limited
by
the
expense
and
limits
of
available
technology
while
the
police
have
adopted
many
new
technological
advances
over
time
in
the
first
years
of
policing
local
police
departments
were
simply
not
capable
of
constant
and
pervasive
surveillance
employing
armies
of
officers
to
watch
any
particular
person
or
persons
all
of
the
time
is
impracticable
for
ordinary
police
departments
n
and
the
use
of
high
tech
surveillance
methods
until
recently
has
been
limited
what
means
existed
have
been
prohibitively
expensive
for
most
local
police
departments
thus
as
a
practical
matter
investigative
agencies
will
rarely
expend
their
limited
manpower
and
resources
on
a
mere
whim
n
second
the
mere
visibility
of
most
traditional
police
practices
provides
a
check
on
police
behavior
because
an
objecting
public
can
monitor
and
sometimes
call
for
change
n
most
routine
street
policing
is
visible
indeed
as
recent
national
attention
to
several
cases
of
people
who
have
died
in
encounters
with
the
police
has
shown
bystander
videos
have
led
to
protests
and
calls
for
action
with
regard
to
excessive
force
n
thus
the
fourth
amendment
is
unlikely
to
be
a
useful
choice
to
curb
surveillance
discretion
to
be
sure
judges
and
law
professors
have
raised
concerns
that
the
supreme
court
s
fourth
amendment
cases
decided
in
the
s
give
insufficient
protections
to
those
whose
movements
and
actions
in
public
have
been
monitored
by
the
police
particularly
since
that
information
in
the
aggregate
can
provide
highly
revealing
information
about
one
s
religious
beliefs
health
conditions
political
affiliations
and
vices
n
thus
some
have
argued
that
police
collection
of
large
amounts
of
a
person
s
public
data
should
constitute
a
fourth
amendment
search
even
if
the
collection
of
each
data
point
in
isolation
would
not
likely
be
considered
a
search
this
mosaic
theory
of
the
fourth
amendment
may
be
helpful
to
defendants
when
the
police
single
them
out
for
particularized
data
collection
n
as
to
whether
big
data
analysis
might
provide
a
basis
for
individualized
suspicion
some
commentators
have
already
raised
doubts
as
to
whether
the
fourth
amendment
alone
should
regulate
these
determinations
n
but
the
fourth
amendment
s
focus
on
individualized
suspicion
and
its
conceptualization
of
rights
that
better
describe
a
physical
rather
than
a
digital
world
is
likely
a
poor
fit
for
expanded
surveillance
discretion
certainly
those
at
the
receiving
end
of
the
increased
scrutiny
made
possible
by
big
data
may
complain
that
the
police
have
insufficient
justification
yet
when
the
police
are
sifting
through
the
data
of
hundreds
thousands
or
millions
of
people
at
the
same
time
we
cannot
expect
the
police
to
provide
individualized
suspicion
before
looking
at
a
lone
online
post
if
big
data
is
changing
the
structure
of
police
discretion
then
commensurate
tools
of
accountability
should
focus
on
reining
in
these
practices
as
a
whole
because
all
big
data
tools
pose
similar
concerns
accountability
measures
should
focus
on
policy
outcomes
rather
than
technology
specific
measures
n
b
the
secrecy
problem
secrecy
often
accompanies
the
new
surveillance
discretion
some
of
this
secrecy
can
be
attributed
to
the
private
companies
providing
the
police
with
the
software
or
data
they
use
moreover
the
police
themselves
tend
to
be
secretive
and
insular
in
ways
that
inhibit
external
oversight
for
these
reasons
we
often
know
little
about
the
adoption
or
development
of
surveillance
discretion
first
big
data
tools
are
often
private
market
products
police
departments
are
just
another
group
of
customers
in
a
number
of
recent
instances
private
companies
providing
surveillance
technology
have
required
agreements
from
police
departments
that
prevent
disclosure
of
information
about
the
technology
itself
for
example
civil
liberties
organizations
and
journalists
have
discovered
the
police
use
of
cell
site
simulators
a
surveillance
technology
that
tricks
nearby
cell
phones
into
providing
data
by
behaving
as
a
fake
mobile
cell
tower
n
detailed
information
about
the
use
of
these
devices
sometimes
referred
to
as
stingrays
or
imsi
catchers
is
difficult
to
find
however
because
the
dominant
manufacturer
of
these
devices
the
harris
corporation
has
required
participating
law
enforcement
agencies
to
sign
nondisclosure
agreements
n
nondisclosure
agreements
bar
police
departments
adopting
the
technology
from
disclosing
any
information
n
relating
to
the
surveillance
equipment
to
any
third
parties
private
and
public
n
some
prosecutors
have
even
chosen
to
withdraw
evidence
in
cases
rather
than
be
forced
to
disclose
details
about
any
possible
use
of
this
cellphone
surveillance
technology
n
after
several
investigative
reports
on
stingray
use
the
department
of
justice
announced
in
september
new
rules
that
would
apply
to
the
use
of
cellphone
surveillance
technology
by
the
department
of
justice
including
a
warrant
requirement
n
similarly
vigilant
one
of
the
country
s
largest
alpr
companies
includes
in
its
terms
and
conditions
a
requirement
of
its
licensees
i
e
police
departments
that
they
agree
not
to
voluntarily
provide
any
information
including
interviews
related
to
vigilant
products
or
its
services
to
any
member
of
the
media
without
express
written
consent
of
vigilant
n
little
prevents
other
companies
from
imposing
similar
requirements
as
a
condition
of
sale
or
use
by
police
departments
even
without
explicit
nondisclosure
agreements
big
data
tools
can
remain
secret
because
they
contain
proprietary
information
that
companies
may
be
unwilling
to
release
nor
are
private
companies
producing
these
tools
subject
to
public
records
laws
that
would
require
them
to
divulge
relevant
and
useful
information
second
police
departments
have
varied
widely
in
their
willingness
to
provide
public
access
to
their
big
data
tools
the
variation
in
alpr
policies
is
illustrative
as
we
saw
with
the
police
department
of
oakland
california
the
police
agreed
to
provide
journalists
with
their
alpr
data
other
police
departments
however
have
resisted
public
records
requests
for
alpr
data
on
the
ground
that
all
collected
scans
may
be
useful
for
investigations
n
c
big
data
accountability
transparency
and
accountability
measures
should
be
a
first
step
to
address
some
of
the
concerns
raised
by
expanded
surveillance
discretion
this
includes
not
only
independent
oversight
measures
familiar
in
traditional
policing
but
also
forms
of
algorithmic
accountability
n
what
should
such
accountability
measures
address
does
it
exist
sometimes
the
most
important
question
is
whether
the
police
have
adopted
a
new
surveillance
technology
at
all
local
governments
could
require
police
departments
to
seek
approval
before
the
purchase
of
new
technologies
that
expand
surveillance
capabilities
for
instance
a
surveillance
notification
ordinance
passed
in
seattle
washington
n
requires
city
council
approval
before
any
city
department
acquires
surveillance
equipment
n
the
ordinance
requires
not
only
notification
about
a
planned
purchase
of
any
surveillance
equipment
but
also
a
mitigation
plan
describing
how
the
department
s
use
of
the
equipment
will
be
regulated
to
protect
privacy
anonymity
and
limit
the
risk
of
potential
abuse
n
public
approval
for
new
surveillance
technology
purchases
could
also
include
approval
for
third
parties
with
whom
police
departments
might
contract
for
such
services
n
without
such
required
disclosures
local
governmental
bodies
may
find
out
about
technologies
that
significantly
expand
surveillance
discretion
only
by
accident
or
happenstance
in
the
city
council
of
bellingham
washington
held
a
formal
public
hearing
expressing
alarm
after
news
that
its
police
department
planned
to
purchase
intrado
s
beware
social
media
analysis
software
with
a
federal
grant
n
the
council
urged
its
police
department
not
to
purchase
beware
n
the
police
department
withdrew
its
grant
request
after
the
city
council
voted
to
ask
the
department
to
do
so
n
how
is
it
being
used
securing
public
approval
is
only
a
first
step
local
governments
can
take
additional
measures
to
ensure
continuing
public
oversight
of
big
data
technologies
that
expand
surveillance
discretion
for
example
local
governments
can
require
police
departments
to
adopt
surveillance
use
policies
that
specify
how
and
when
surveillance
technologies
might
be
used
n
logging
requirements
can
enable
accountability
by
ensuring
third
parties
can
access
and
review
how
big
data
policing
tools
work
local
governments
can
provide
independent
third
parties
with
responsibilities
and
powers
to
review
how
such
programs
work
n
auditors
should
be
given
access
to
both
the
technology
and
the
data
produced
by
it
e
g
access
controls
and
audit
logs
n
how
accurate
is
it
with
that
knowledge
we
can
assess
the
nature
of
the
raw
information
used
by
these
computer
algorithms
as
we
have
seen
some
kinds
of
information
reflect
highly
discretionary
decisions
arrests
are
often
the
outcome
of
decision
making
about
enforcement
priorities
law
enforcement
resources
and
other
contingencies
that
a
person
is
a
known
gang
member
is
a
contestable
designation
yet
these
factors
may
be
used
to
justify
further
law
enforcement
attention
if
not
eventual
detention
or
arrest
how
effective
is
it
when
we
know
whether
and
how
the
police
have
adopted
a
big
data
tool
to
expand
their
surveillance
discretion
we
can
assess
whether
such
technologies
are
worth
their
financial
institutional
and
social
costs
for
example
alpr
surveillance
is
touted
as
a
quick
efficient
and
cost
effective
policing
technology
but
we
often
know
little
about
how
well
the
technology
reduces
crime
the
available
evidence
suggests
that
comparatively
few
crimes
are
identified
through
mass
plate
collection
in
oakland
california
journalists
reported
that
the
hit
rate
of
its
alpr
use
when
compared
to
the
number
of
license
plate
scans
captured
was
a
mere
n
iv
conclusion
the
police
have
always
possessed
surveillance
discretion
big
data
promises
to
expand
and
accelerate
their
ability
to
discover
crime
and
identify
suspects
one
day
the
ability
to
sort
score
and
predict
social
activity
will
be
an
ordinary
aspect
of
policing
in
the
same
way
we
now
experience
entertainment
dating
and
shopping
yet
the
use
of
big
data
in
policing
will
be
different
because
of
its
consequences
to
be
sure
big
data
policing
may
remedy
some
entrenched
policing
inequities
and
it
may
heighten
expectations
about
accountability
but
enhancing
the
scope
and
power
of
the
police
to
designate
people
as
suspects
will
also
further
complicate
longstanding
concerns
about
discretion
secrecy
about
these
processes
moreover
can
further
alienate
the
public
from
the
police
because
policing
is
a
democratic
institution
and
not
just
a
technological
enterprise

highlight
advocates
of
algorithmic
techniques

that

eliminate

but
an

is
only
as
good
as
the

frequently
imperfect
in
ways
that
allow
these

useful

that
are

unthinking
reliance
on
data
mining
can
deny
historically
disadvantaged
and
vulnerable
groups
full

in

worse
still
because
the
resulting
discrimination
is
almost
always
an
unintentional
emergent
property
of
the

rather
than
a

it

this

examines
these

through
the

of
american

particularly
through

there
are
a
number
of
practical
limits
to
what

be
accomplished
computationally
for

when
discrimination
occurs
because
the
data

is
itself
a

there
is

no

major

anticlassification

text
introduction
big
data
is
the
buzzword
of
the
decade
n
advertisers
want
data
to
reach
profitable
consumers
n
medical
professionals
to
find
side
effects
of
prescription
drugs
n
supply
chain
operators
to
optimize
their
delivery
routes
n
police
to
determine
where
to
focus
resources
n
and
social
scientists
to
study
human
interactions
n
though
useful
however
data
is
not
a
panacea
where
data
is
used
predictively
to
assist
decision
making
it
can
affect
the
fortunes
of
whole
classes
of
people
in
consistently
unfavorable
ways
sorting
and
selecting
for
the
best
or
most
profitable
candidates
means
generating
a
model
with
winners
and
losers
if
data
miners
are
not
careful
the
process
can
result
in
disproportionately
adverse
outcomes
concentrated
within
historically
disadvantaged
groups
in
ways
that
look
a
lot
like
discrimination
although
we
live
in
the
post
civil
rights
era
discrimination
persists
in
american
society
and
is
stubbornly
pervasive
in
employment
housing
credit
and
consumer
markets
n
while
discrimination
certainly
endures
in
part
due
to
decision
makers
prejudices
a
great
deal
of
modern
day
inequality
can
be
attributed
to
what
sociologists
call
institutional
discrimination
n
unconscious
implicit
biases
and
inertia
within
society
s
institutions
rather
than
intentional
choices
account
for
a
large
part
of
the
disparate
effects
observed
n
approached
without
care
data
mining
can
reproduce
existing
patterns
of
discrimination
inherit
the
prejudice
of
prior
decision
makers
or
simply
reflect
the
widespread
biases
that
persist
in
society
it
can
even
have
the
perverse
result
of
exacerbating
existing
inequalities
by
suggesting
that
historically
disadvantaged
groups
actually
deserve
less
favorable
treatment
algorithms
n
could
exhibit
these
tendencies
even
if
they
have
not
been
manually
programmed
to
do
so
whether
on
purpose
or
by
accident
discrimination
may
be
an
artifact
of
the
data
mining
process
itself
rather
than
a
result
of
programmers
assigning
certain
factors
inappropriate
weight
such
a
possibility
has
gone
unrecognized
by
most
scholars
and
policy
makers
who
tend
to
fear
concealed
nefarious
intentions
or
the
overlooked
effects
of
human
bias
or
error
in
hand
coding
algorithms
n
because
the
discrimination
at
issue
is
unintentional
even
honest
attempts
to
certify
the
absence
of
prejudice
on
the
part
of
those
involved
in
the
data
mining
process
may
wrongly
confer
the
imprimatur
of
impartiality
on
the
resulting
decisions
furthermore
because
the
mechanism
through
which
data
mining
may
disadvantage
protected
classes
is
less
obvious
in
cases
of
unintentional
discrimination
the
injustice
may
be
harder
to
identify
and
address
in
may
the
white
house
released
a
report
titled
big
data
seizing
opportunities
preserving
values
podesta
report
which
hinted
at
the
discriminatory
potential
of
big
data
n
the
report
finds
that
big
data
analytics
have
the
potential
to
eclipse
longstanding
civil
rights
protections
in
how
personal
information
is
used
in
housing
credit
employment
health
education
and
the
marketplace
n
it
suggests
that
there
may
be
unintended
discriminatory
effects
from
data
mining
but
does
not
detail
how
they
might
come
about
n
because
the
origin
of
the
discriminatory
effects
remains
unexplored
the
report
s
approach
does
not
address
the
full
scope
of
the
problem
the
podesta
report
as
one
might
expect
from
the
executive
branch
seeks
to
address
these
effects
primarily
by
finding
new
ways
to
enforce
existing
law
regarding
discrimination
the
report
primarily
recommends
that
enforcement
agencies
such
as
the
department
of
justice
federal
trade
commission
consumer
financial
protection
bureau
and
equal
employment
opportunity
commission
eeoc
increase
their
technical
expertise
and
develop
a
plan
for
investigating
and
resolving
violations
of
law
in
such
cases
n
as
this
essay
demonstrates
however
existing
law
largely
fails
to
address
the
discrimination
that
can
result
from
data
mining
the
argument
is
grounded
in
title
vii
because
of
all
american
antidiscrimination
jurisprudence
title
vii
has
a
particularly
well
developed
set
of
case
law
and
scholarship
further
there
exists
a
rapidly
emerging
field
of
work
force
science
n
for
which
title
vii
will
be
the
primary
vehicle
for
regulation
under
title
vii
it
turns
out
that
some
if
not
most
instances
of
discriminatory
data
mining
will
not
generate
liability
while
the
essay
does
not
show
this
to
be
true
outside
of
title
vii
itself
the
problem
is
likely
not
particular
to
title
vii
rather
it
is
a
feature
of
our
current
approach
to
antidiscrimination
jurisprudence
with
its
focus
on
procedural
fairness
the
analysis
will
likely
apply
to
other
traditional
areas
of
discrimination
such
as
housing
or
disability
discrimination
similar
tendencies
to
disadvantage
the
disadvantaged
will
likely
arise
in
areas
that
regulate
legitimate
economic
discrimination
such
as
credit
and
insurance
this
essay
proceeds
in
three
parts
part
i
introduces
the
computer
science
literature
and
proceeds
through
the
various
steps
of
solving
a
problem
with
data
mining
defining
the
target
variable
labeling
and
collecting
the
training
data
using
feature
selection
and
making
decisions
on
the
basis
of
the
resulting
model
each
of
these
steps
creates
possibilities
for
a
final
result
that
has
a
disproportionately
adverse
impact
on
protected
classes
whether
by
specifying
the
problem
to
be
solved
in
ways
that
affect
classes
differently
failing
to
recognize
or
address
statistical
biases
reproducing
past
prejudice
or
considering
an
insufficiently
rich
set
of
factors
even
in
situations
where
data
miners
are
extremely
careful
they
can
still
effect
discriminatory
results
with
models
that
quite
unintentionally
pick
out
proxy
variables
for
protected
classes
finally
part
i
notes
that
data
mining
poses
the
additional
problem
of
giving
data
miners
the
ability
to
disguise
intentional
discrimination
as
accidental
in
part
ii
the
essay
reviews
title
vii
jurisprudence
as
it
applies
to
data
mining
part
ii
discusses
both
disparate
treatment
and
disparate
impact
examining
which
of
the
various
data
mining
mechanisms
identified
in
part
i
will
trigger
liability
under
either
title
vii
theory
at
first
blush
either
theory
is
viable
disparate
treatment
is
viable
because
data
mining
systems
treat
everyone
differently
that
is
their
purpose
disparate
impact
is
also
viable
because
data
mining
can
have
various
discriminatory
effects
even
without
intent
but
as
part
ii
demonstrates
data
mining
combines
some
well
known
problems
in
discrimination
doctrines
with
new
challenges
particular
to
data
mining
systems
such
that
liability
for
discriminatory
data
mining
will
be
hard
to
find
part
ii
concludes
with
a
discussion
of
the
new
problems
of
proof
that
arise
for
intentional
discrimination
in
this
context
finally
part
iii
addresses
the
difficulties
reformers
would
face
in
addressing
the
deficiencies
found
in
part
ii
these
difficulties
take
two
forms
complications
internal
to
the
logic
of
data
mining
and
political
and
constitutional
difficulties
external
to
the
problem
internally
the
different
steps
in
a
data
mining
problem
require
constant
subjective
and
fact
bound
judgments
which
do
not
lend
themselves
to
general
legislative
resolution
worse
many
of
these
are
normative
judgments
in
disguise
about
which
there
is
not
likely
to
be
consensus
externally
data
mining
will
force
society
to
explicitly
rebalance
the
two
justifications
for
antidiscrimination
law
rooting
out
intentional
discrimination
and
equalizing
the
status
of
historically
disadvantaged
communities
this
is
because
methods
of
proof
and
corrective
measures
will
often
require
an
explicit
commitment
to
substantive
remediation
rather
than
merely
procedural
remedies
in
certain
cases
data
mining
will
make
it
simply
impossible
to
rectify
discriminatory
results
without
engaging
with
the
question
of
what
level
of
substantive
inequality
is
proper
or
acceptable
in
a
given
context
given
current
political
realities
and
trends
in
constitutional
doctrines
legislation
enacting
a
remedy
that
results
from
these
discussions
faces
an
uphill
battle
to
be
sure
data
mining
also
has
the
potential
to
help
reduce
discrimination
by
forcing
decisions
onto
a
more
reliable
empirical
foundation
and
by
formalizing
decision
making
processes
thus
limiting
the
opportunity
for
individual
bias
to
affect
important
assessments
n
in
many
situations
the
introduction
of
data
mining
will
be
a
boon
to
civil
rights
even
where
it
fails
to
root
out
discrimination
altogether
and
such
efforts
should
be
encouraged
yet
understanding
when
and
why
discrimination
persists
in
cases
of
data
driven
decision
making
reveals
important
and
sometimes
troubling
limits
to
the
promise
of
big
data
for
which
there
are
no
ready
solutions
i
how
data
mining
discriminates
although
commentators
have
ascribed
myriad
forms
of
discrimination
to
data
mining
n
there
remains
significant
confusion
over
the
precise
mechanisms
that
render
data
mining
discriminatory
this
part
develops
a
taxonomy
that
isolates
and
explicates
the
specific
technical
issues
that
can
give
rise
to
models
whose
use
in
decision
making
may
have
a
disproportionately
adverse
impact
on
protected
classes
by
definition
data
mining
is
always
a
form
of
statistical
and
therefore
seemingly
rational
discrimination
indeed
the
very
point
of
data
mining
is
to
provide
a
rational
basis
upon
which
to
distinguish
between
individuals
and
to
reliably
confer
to
the
individual
the
qualities
possessed
by
those
who
seem
statistically
similar
nevertheless
data
mining
holds
the
potential
to
unduly
discount
members
of
legally
protected
classes
and
to
place
them
at
systematic
relative
disadvantage
unlike
more
subjective
forms
of
decision
making
data
mining
s
ill
effects
are
often
not
traceable
to
human
bias
conscious
or
unconscious
this
part
describes
five
mechanisms
by
which
these
disproportionately
adverse
outcomes
might
occur
walking
through
a
sequence
of
key
steps
in
the
overall
data
mining
process
a
defining
the
target
variable
and
class
labels
in
contrast
to
those
traditional
forms
of
data
analysis
that
simply
return
records
or
summary
statistics
in
response
to
a
specific
query
data
mining
attempts
to
locate
statistical
relationships
in
a
dataset
n
in
particular
it
automates
the
process
of
discovering
useful
patterns
revealing
regularities
upon
which
subsequent
decision
making
can
rely
the
accumulated
set
of
discovered
relationships
is
commonly
called
a
model
and
these
models
can
be
employed
to
automate
the
process
of
classifying
entities
or
activities
of
interest
estimating
the
value
of
unobserved
variables
or
predicting
future
outcomes
n
familiar
examples
of
such
applications
include
spam
or
fraud
detection
credit
scoring
and
insurance
pricing
these
examples
all
involve
attempts
to
determine
the
status
or
likely
outcome
of
cases
under
consideration
based
solely
on
access
to
correlated
data
n
data
mining
helps
identify
cases
of
spam
and
fraud
and
anticipate
default
and
poor
health
by
treating
these
states
and
outcomes
as
a
function
of
some
other
set
of
observed
characteristics
n
in
particular
by
exposing
so
called
machine
learning
algorithms
to
examples
of
the
cases
of
interest
previously
identified
instances
of
fraud
spam
default
and
poor
health
the
algorithm
learns
which
related
attributes
or
activities
can
serve
as
potential
proxies
for
those
qualities
or
outcomes
of
interest
n
two
concepts
from
the
machine
learning
and
data
mining
literature
are
important
here
target
variables
and
class
labels
the
outcomes
of
interest
discussed
above
are
known
as
target
variables
n
while
the
target
variable
defines
what
data
miners
are
looking
for
class
labels
divide
all
possible
values
of
the
target
variable
into
mutually
exclusive
categories
the
proper
specification
of
the
target
variable
is
frequently
not
obvious
and
the
data
miner
s
task
is
to
define
it
to
start
data
miners
must
translate
some
amorphous
problem
into
a
question
that
can
be
expressed
in
more
formal
terms
that
computers
can
parse
in
particular
data
miners
must
determine
how
to
solve
the
problem
at
hand
by
translating
it
into
a
question
about
the
value
of
some
target
variable
the
open
endedness
that
characterizes
this
part
of
the
process
is
often
described
as
the
art
of
data
mining
this
initial
step
requires
a
data
miner
to
understand
the
project
objectives
and
requirements
from
a
business
perspective
and
then
convert
this
knowledge
into
a
data
mining
problem
definition
n
through
this
necessarily
subjective
process
of
translation
data
miners
may
unintentionally
parse
the
problem
in
such
a
way
that
happens
to
systematically
disadvantage
protected
classes
problem
specification
is
not
a
wholly
arbitrary
process
however
data
mining
can
only
address
problems
that
lend
themselves
to
formalization
as
questions
about
the
state
or
value
of
the
target
variable
data
mining
works
exceedingly
well
for
dealing
with
fraud
and
spam
because
these
cases
rely
on
extant
binary
categories
a
given
instance
either
is
or
is
not
fraud
or
spam
and
the
definitions
of
fraud
or
spam
are
for
the
most
part
uncontroversial
n
a
computer
can
then
flag
or
refuse
transactions
or
redirect
emails
according
to
well
understood
distinctions
n
in
these
cases
data
miners
can
simply
rely
on
these
simple
preexisting
categories
to
define
the
class
labels
sometimes
though
defining
the
target
variable
involves
the
creation
of
new
classes
consider
credit
scoring
for
instance
although
now
taken
for
granted
the
predicted
likelihood
of
missing
a
certain
number
of
loan
repayments
is
not
a
self
evident
answer
to
the
question
of
how
to
successfully
extend
credit
to
consumers
n
unlike
fraud
or
spam
creditworthiness
is
an
artifact
of
the
problem
definition
itself
there
is
no
way
to
directly
measure
creditworthiness
because
the
very
notion
of
creditworthiness
is
a
function
of
the
particular
way
the
credit
industry
has
constructed
the
credit
issuing
and
repayment
system
that
is
an
individual
s
ability
to
repay
some
minimum
amount
of
an
outstanding
debt
on
a
monthly
basis
is
taken
to
be
a
nonarbitrary
standard
by
which
to
determine
in
advance
and
all
at
once
whether
he
is
worthy
of
credit
n
data
mining
has
many
uses
beyond
spam
detection
fraud
detection
credit
scoring
and
insurance
pricing
as
discussed
in
the
introduction
this
essay
will
focus
on
the
use
of
data
mining
in
employment
decisions
extending
this
discussion
to
employment
then
where
employers
turn
to
data
mining
to
develop
ways
of
improving
and
automating
their
search
for
good
employees
they
face
a
number
of
crucial
choices
like
creditworthiness
the
definition
of
a
good
employee
is
not
a
given
good
must
be
defined
in
ways
that
correspond
to
measurable
outcomes
relatively
higher
sales
shorter
production
time
or
longer
tenure
for
example
when
employers
mine
data
for
good
employees
they
are
in
fact
looking
for
employees
whose
observable
characteristics
suggest
that
they
would
meet
or
exceed
some
monthly
sales
threshold
perform
some
task
in
less
than
a
certain
amount
of
time
or
remain
in
their
positions
for
more
than
a
set
number
of
weeks
or
months
rather
than
drawing
categorical
distinctions
along
these
lines
data
mining
could
also
estimate
or
predict
the
specific
numerical
value
of
sales
production
time
or
tenure
period
enabling
employers
to
rank
rather
than
simply
sort
employees
these
may
seem
like
eminently
reasonable
things
for
employers
to
want
to
predict
but
they
are
by
necessity
only
part
of
an
array
of
possible
definitions
of
good
an
employer
may
instead
attempt
to
define
the
target
variable
in
a
more
holistic
way
by
for
example
relying
on
the
grades
that
prior
employees
have
received
in
annual
reviews
which
are
supposed
to
reflect
an
overall
assessment
of
performance
these
target
variable
definitions
simply
inherit
the
formalizations
involved
in
preexisting
assessment
mechanisms
which
in
the
case
of
human
graded
performance
reviews
may
be
far
less
consistent
n
thus
the
definition
of
the
target
variable
and
its
associated
class
labels
will
determine
what
data
mining
happens
to
find
while
critics
of
data
mining
have
tended
to
focus
on
inaccurate
classifications
false
positives
and
false
negatives
n
as
much
if
not
more
danger
resides
in
the
definition
of
the
class
label
itself
and
the
subsequent
labeling
of
examples
from
which
rules
are
inferred
n
while
different
choices
for
the
target
variable
and
class
labels
can
seem
more
or
less
reasonable
valid
concerns
with
discrimination
enter
at
this
stage
because
the
different
choices
may
have
a
greater
or
lesser
adverse
impact
on
protected
classes
for
example
as
later
parts
will
explain
in
detail
hiring
decisions
made
on
the
basis
of
predicted
tenure
are
much
more
likely
to
have
a
disparate
impact
on
certain
protected
classes
than
hiring
decisions
that
turn
on
some
estimate
of
worker
productivity
if
the
turnover
rate
happens
to
be
systematically
higher
among
members
of
certain
protected
classes
hiring
decisions
based
on
predicted
length
of
employment
will
result
in
fewer
job
opportunities
for
members
of
these
groups
even
if
they
would
have
performed
as
well
as
or
better
than
the
other
applicants
the
company
chooses
to
hire
b
training
data
as
described
above
data
mining
learns
by
example
accordingly
what
a
model
learns
depends
on
the
examples
to
which
it
has
been
exposed
the
data
that
function
as
examples
are
known
as
training
data
quite
literally
the
data
that
train
the
model
to
behave
in
a
certain
way
the
character
of
the
training
data
can
have
meaningful
consequences
for
the
lessons
that
data
mining
happens
to
learn
as
computer
science
scholars
explain
biased
training
data
leads
to
discriminatory
models
n
this
can
mean
two
rather
different
things
though
if
data
mining
treats
cases
in
which
prejudice
has
played
some
role
as
valid
examples
to
learn
from
that
rule
may
simply
reproduce
the
prejudice
involved
in
these
earlier
cases
or
if
data
mining
draws
inferences
from
a
biased
sample
of
the
population
any
decision
that
rests
on
these
inferences
may
systematically
disadvantage
those
who
are
under
or
overrepresented
in
the
dataset
both
can
affect
the
training
data
in
ways
that
lead
to
discrimination
but
the
mechanisms
improper
labeling
of
examples
and
biased
data
collections
are
sufficiently
distinct
that
they
warrant
separate
treatment
labeling
examples
labeling
examples
is
the
process
by
which
the
training
data
is
manually
assigned
class
labels
in
cases
of
fraud
or
spam
the
data
miners
draw
from
examples
that
come
prelabeled
when
individual
customers
report
fraudulent
charges
or
mark
a
message
as
spam
they
are
actually
labeling
transactions
and
email
for
the
providers
of
credit
and
webmail
likewise
an
employer
using
grades
previously
given
at
performance
reviews
is
also
using
prelabeled
examples
in
certain
cases
however
there
may
not
be
any
labeled
data
and
data
miners
may
have
to
figure
out
a
way
to
label
examples
themselves
this
can
be
a
laborious
process
and
it
is
frequently
fraught
with
peril
n
often
the
best
labels
for
different
classifications
will
be
open
to
debate
on
which
side
of
the
creditworthy
line
does
someone
who
has
missed
four
credit
card
payments
fall
for
example
n
the
answer
is
not
obvious
even
where
the
class
labels
are
uncontested
or
uncontroversial
they
may
present
a
problem
because
analysts
will
often
face
difficult
choices
in
deciding
which
of
the
available
labels
best
applies
to
a
particular
example
certain
cases
may
present
some
but
not
all
criteria
for
inclusion
in
a
particular
class
n
the
situation
might
also
work
in
reverse
where
the
class
labels
are
insufficiently
precise
to
capture
meaningful
differences
between
cases
such
imperfect
matches
will
demand
that
data
miners
exercise
judgment
the
unavoidably
subjective
labeling
of
examples
will
skew
the
resulting
findings
such
that
any
decisions
taken
on
the
basis
of
those
findings
will
characterize
all
future
cases
along
the
same
lines
this
is
true
even
if
such
characterizations
would
seem
plainly
erroneous
to
analysts
who
looked
more
closely
at
the
individual
cases
for
all
their
potential
problems
though
the
labels
applied
to
the
training
data
must
serve
as
ground
truth
n
thus
decisions
based
on
discoveries
that
rest
on
haphazardly
labeled
data
or
data
labeled
in
a
systematically
though
unintentionally
biased
manner
will
seem
valid
according
to
the
customary
validation
methods
employed
by
data
miners
so
long
as
prior
decisions
affected
by
some
form
of
prejudice
serve
as
examples
of
correctly
rendered
determinations
data
mining
will
necessarily
infer
rules
that
exhibit
the
same
prejudice
consider
a
real
world
example
from
a
different
context
as
to
how
biased
data
labeling
can
skew
results
st
george
s
hospital
in
the
united
kingdom
developed
a
computer
program
to
help
sort
medical
school
applicants
based
on
its
previous
admissions
decisions
n
those
admissions
decisions
it
turns
out
had
systematically
disfavored
racial
minorities
and
women
with
credentials
otherwise
equal
to
other
applicants
n
in
drawing
rules
from
biased
prior
decisions
st
george
s
hospital
unknowingly
devised
an
automated
process
that
possessed
these
very
same
prejudices
as
editors
at
the
british
medical
journal
noted
at
the
time
t
he
program
was
not
introducing
new
bias
but
merely
reflecting
that
already
in
the
system
n
were
an
employer
to
undertake
a
similar
plan
to
automate
its
hiring
decisions
by
inferring
a
rule
from
past
decisions
swayed
by
prejudice
the
employer
would
likewise
arrive
at
a
decision
procedure
that
simply
reproduces
the
prejudice
of
prior
decision
makers
indeed
automating
the
process
in
this
way
would
turn
the
conscious
prejudice
or
implicit
bias
of
individuals
involved
in
previous
decision
making
into
a
formalized
rule
that
would
systematically
alter
the
prospects
of
all
future
applicants
for
example
the
computer
may
learn
to
discriminate
against
certain
female
or
black
applicants
if
trained
on
prior
hiring
decisions
in
which
an
employer
has
consistently
rejected
jobseekers
with
degrees
from
women
s
or
historically
black
colleges
not
only
can
data
mining
inherit
prior
prejudice
through
the
mislabeling
of
examples
it
can
also
reflect
current
prejudice
through
the
ongoing
behavior
of
users
taken
as
inputs
to
data
mining
this
is
what
professor
latanya
sweeney
discovered
in
a
study
that
found
that
google
queries
for
black
sounding
names
were
more
likely
to
return
contextual
i
e
key
word
triggered
advertisements
for
arrest
records
than
those
for
white
sounding
names
n
sweeney
confirmed
that
the
companies
paying
for
these
advertisements
had
not
set
out
to
focus
on
black
sounding
names
rather
the
fact
that
black
sounding
names
were
more
likely
to
trigger
such
advertisements
seemed
to
be
an
artifact
of
the
algorithmic
process
that
google
employs
to
determine
which
advertisements
to
display
alongside
certain
queries
n
although
it
is
not
fully
known
how
google
computes
the
so
called
quality
score
according
to
which
it
ranks
advertisers
bids
one
important
factor
is
the
predicted
likelihood
based
on
historical
trends
that
users
will
click
on
an
advertisement
n
as
sweeney
points
out
the
process
learns
over
time
which
advertisement
text
gets
the
most
clicks
from
viewers
of
the
advertisement
and
promotes
that
advertisement
in
its
rankings
accordingly
n
sweeney
posits
that
this
aspect
of
the
process
could
result
in
the
differential
delivery
of
advertisements
that
reflect
the
kinds
of
prejudice
held
by
those
exposed
to
the
advertisements
n
in
attempting
to
cater
to
users
preferences
google
will
unintentionally
reproduce
the
existing
prejudices
that
inform
users
choices
a
similar
situation
could
conceivably
arise
on
websites
that
recommend
potential
employees
to
employers
as
linkedin
does
through
its
talent
match
feature
n
if
linkedin
determines
which
candidates
to
recommend
based
on
the
demonstrated
interest
of
employers
in
certain
types
of
candidates
talent
match
will
offer
recommendations
that
reflect
whatever
biases
employers
happen
to
exhibit
in
particular
if
linkedin
s
algorithm
observes
that
employers
disfavor
certain
candidates
who
are
members
of
a
protected
class
talent
match
may
decrease
the
rate
at
which
it
recommends
these
candidates
to
employers
the
recommendation
engine
would
learn
to
cater
to
the
prejudicial
preferences
of
employers
there
is
an
old
adage
in
computer
science
garbage
in
garbage
out
because
data
mining
relies
on
training
data
as
ground
truth
when
those
inputs
are
themselves
skewed
by
bias
or
inattention
the
resulting
system
will
produce
results
that
are
at
best
unreliable
and
at
worst
discriminatory
data
collection
decisions
that
depend
on
conclusions
drawn
from
incorrect
partial
or
nonrepresentative
data
may
discriminate
against
protected
classes
the
individual
records
that
a
company
maintains
about
a
person
might
have
serious
mistakes
n
the
records
of
the
entire
protected
class
of
which
this
person
is
a
member
might
also
have
similar
mistakes
at
a
higher
rate
than
other
groups
and
the
entire
set
of
records
may
fail
to
reflect
members
of
protected
classes
in
accurate
proportion
to
others
n
in
other
words
the
quality
and
representativeness
of
records
might
vary
in
ways
that
correlate
with
class
membership
e
g
institutions
might
maintain
systematically
less
accurate
precise
timely
and
complete
records
for
certain
classes
of
people
even
a
dataset
with
individual
records
of
consistently
high
quality
can
suffer
from
statistical
biases
that
fail
to
represent
different
groups
in
accurate
proportions
much
attention
has
focused
on
the
harms
that
might
befall
individuals
whose
records
in
various
commercial
databases
are
error
ridden
n
far
less
consideration
however
has
been
paid
to
the
systematic
disadvantage
that
members
of
protected
classes
may
suffer
from
being
miscounted
and
as
a
result
misrepresented
in
the
evidence
base
recent
scholarship
has
begun
to
stress
this
point
jonas
lerman
for
example
worries
about
the
nonrandom
systemic
omission
of
people
who
live
on
big
data
s
margins
whether
due
to
poverty
geography
or
lifestyle
and
whose
lives
are
less
datafied
than
the
general
population
s
n
professor
kate
crawford
has
likewise
warned
that
b
ecause
not
all
data
is
created
or
even
collected
equally
there
are
signal
problems
in
big
data
sets
dark
zones
or
shadows
where
some
citizens
and
communities
are
overlooked
or
underrepresented
n
errors
of
this
sort
may
befall
historically
disadvantaged
groups
at
higher
rates
because
they
are
less
involved
in
the
formal
economy
and
its
data
generating
activities
have
unequal
access
to
and
relatively
less
fluency
in
the
technology
necessary
to
engage
online
or
are
less
profitable
customers
or
important
constituents
and
therefore
less
interesting
as
targets
of
observation
n
not
only
will
the
quality
of
individual
records
of
members
of
these
groups
be
poorer
as
a
consequence
but
these
groups
as
a
whole
will
also
be
less
well
represented
in
datasets
skewing
conclusions
that
may
be
drawn
from
an
analysis
of
the
data
as
an
illustrative
example
crawford
points
to
street
bump
an
application
for
boston
residents
that
takes
advantage
of
accelerometers
built
into
smart
phones
to
detect
when
drivers
ride
over
potholes
n
while
crawford
praises
the
cleverness
and
cost
effectiveness
of
this
passive
approach
to
reporting
road
problems
she
rightly
warns
that
whatever
information
the
city
receives
from
street
bump
will
be
biased
by
the
uneven
distribution
of
smartphones
across
populations
in
different
parts
of
the
city
n
in
particular
systematic
differences
in
smartphone
ownership
will
very
likely
result
in
the
underreporting
of
road
problems
in
the
poorer
communities
where
protected
groups
disproportionately
congregate
n
if
the
city
were
to
rely
on
this
data
to
determine
where
it
should
direct
its
resources
it
would
only
further
underserve
these
communities
indeed
the
city
would
discriminate
against
those
who
lack
the
capability
to
report
problems
as
effectively
as
wealthier
residents
with
smartphones
n
a
similar
dynamic
could
easily
apply
in
an
employment
context
if
members
of
protected
classes
are
unable
to
report
their
interest
in
and
qualification
for
jobs
listed
online
as
easily
or
effectively
as
others
due
to
systematic
differences
in
internet
access
the
eeoc
has
established
a
program
called
eradicating
racism
colorism
from
employment
e
race
that
aims
at
least
in
part
to
prevent
this
sort
of
discrimination
from
occurring
due
to
an
employer
s
desire
for
high
tech
hiring
such
as
video
r
sum
s
n
e
race
not
only
attempts
to
lower
the
barriers
that
would
disproportionately
burden
applicants
who
belong
to
a
protected
class
but
also
ensures
that
employers
do
not
develop
an
inaccurate
impression
of
the
incidence
of
qualified
and
interested
candidates
from
these
communities
if
employers
were
to
rely
on
tallies
of
high
tech
candidates
to
direct
their
recruiting
efforts
for
example
any
count
affected
by
a
reporting
bias
could
have
adverse
consequences
for
specific
populations
systematically
underrepresented
in
the
dataset
employers
would
deny
equal
attention
to
those
who
reside
in
areas
incorrectly
pegged
as
having
a
relatively
lower
concentration
of
qualified
candidates
additional
and
even
more
severe
risks
may
reside
in
the
systematic
omission
of
members
of
protected
classes
from
such
datasets
the
street
bump
and
internet
job
application
examples
only
discuss
decisions
that
depend
on

accurate

reside
at

level
of

coverage

this

arises

professor
frederick
schauer
explains
decision

that

nonuniversal
generalizations
are
being
simultaneously
rational
and
unfair
because
certain

are
actuarially
saddled
by
statistically
sound
inferences
that
are
nevertheless
inaccurate
n
obtaining
information
that
is
sufficiently
rich
to
permit
precise
distinctions
can
be
expensive
even
marginal
improvements
in
accuracy
may
come
at
significant
practical
costs
and
may
justify
a
less
granular
and
encompassing
analysis
n
to
take
an
obvious
example
from
the
employment
context
hiring
decisions
that
consider
academic
credentials
tend
to
assign
enormous
weight
to
the
reputation
of
the
college
or
university
from
which
an
applicant
has
graduated
even
though
such
reputations
may
communicate
very
little
about
the
applicant
s
job
related
skills
and
competencies
n
if
equally
competent
members
of
protected
classes
happen
to
graduate
from
these
colleges
or
universities
at
disproportionately
low
rates
decisions
that
turn
on
the
credentials
conferred
by
these
schools
rather
than
some
set
of
more
specific
qualities
that
more
accurately
sort
individuals
will
incorrectly
and
systematically
discount
these
individuals
even
if
employers
have
a
rational
incentive
to
look
beyond
credentials
and
focus
on
criteria
that
allow
for
more
precise
and
more
accurate
determinations
they
may
continue
to
favor
credentials
because
they
communicate
pertinent
information
at
no
cost
to
the
employer
n
similar
dynamics
seem
to
account
for
the
practice
known
as
redlining
n
in
which
financial
institutions
employ
especially
general
criteria
to
draw
distinctions
between
subpopulations
i
e
the
neighborhood
in
which
individuals
happen
to
reside
despite
the
fact
that
such
distinctions
fail
to
capture
significant
variation
within
each
subpopulation
that
would
result
in
a
different
assessment
for
certain
members
of
these
groups
while
redlining
in
america
is
well
known
to
have
had
its
basis
in
racial
animus
and
prejudice
n
decision
makers
operating
in
this
manner
may
attempt
to
justify
their
behavior
by
pointing
to
the
cost
efficiency
of
relying
on
easily
accessible
information
in
other
words
decision
makers
can
argue
that
they
are
willing
to
tolerate
higher
rates
of
erroneous
determinations
for
certain
groups
because
the
benefits
derived
from
more
granular
data
and
thus
better
accuracy
do
not
justify
the
costs
of
course
it
may
be
no
coincidence
that
such
cost
benefit
analyses
seem
to
justify
treating
groups
composed
disproportionately
of
members
of
protected
classes
to
systematically
less
accurate
determinations
n
redlining
is
illegal
because
it
can
systematically
discount
entire
areas
composed
primarily
of
members
of
a
protected
class
despite
the
presence
of
some
qualified
candidates
n
cases
of
so
called
rational
racism
are
really
just
a
special
instance
of
this
more
general
phenomenon
one
in
which
race
happens
to
be
taken
into
consideration
explicitly
in
such
cases
decision
makers
take
membership
in
a
protected
class
into
account
even
if
they
hold
no
prejudicial
views
because
such
membership
seems
to
communicate
relevant
information
that
would
be
difficult
or
impossible
to
obtain
otherwise
accordingly
the
persistence
of
distasteful
forms
of
discrimination
may
be
the
result
of
a
lack
of
information
rather
than
a
continued
taste
for
discrimination
n
professor
lior
strahilevitz
has
argued
for
instance
that
when
employers
lack
access
to
criminal
records
they
may
consider
race
in
assessing
an
applicant
s
likelihood
of
having
a
criminal
record
because
there
are
statistical
differences
in
the
rates
at
which
members
of
different
racial
groups
have
been
convicted
of
crimes
n
in
other
words
employers
fall
back
on
more
immediately
available
and
coarse
features
when
they
cannot
access
more
specific
or
verified
information
n
of
course
as
strahilevitz
points
out
race
is
a
highly
imperfect
basis
upon
which
to
predict
an
individual
s
criminal
record
despite
whatever
differences
may
exist
in
the
rates
at
which
members
of
different
racial
groups
have
been
convicted
of
crimes
because
it
is
too
coarse
as
an
indicator
n
d
proxies
cases
of
decision
making
that
do
not
artificially
introduce
discriminatory
effects
into
the
data
mining
process
may
nevertheless
result
in
systematically
less
favorable
determinations
for
members
of
protected
classes
this
is
possible
when
the
criteria
that
are
genuinely
relevant
in
making
rational
and
well
informed
decisions
also
happen
to
serve
as
reliable
proxies
for
class
membership
in
other
words
the
very
same
criteria
that
correctly
sort
individuals
according
to
their
predicted
likelihood
of
excelling
at
a
job
as
formalized
in
some
fashion
may
also
sort
individuals
according
to
class
membership
in
certain
cases
there
may
be
an
obvious
reason
for
this
just
as
mining
from
historical
data
may
discover
traditional
prejudices
that
are
endemic
in
reality
i
e
taste
based
discrimination
so
too
may
data
mining
discover
patterns
of
lower
performances
skills
or
capacities
of
protected
by
law
groups
n
these
discoveries
not
only
reveal
the
simple
fact
of
inequality
but
they
also
reveal
that
these
are
inequalities
in
which
members
of
protected
classes
are
frequently
in
the
relatively
less
favorable
position
this
has
rather
obvious
implications
if
features
held
at
a
lower
rate
by
members
of
protected
groups
nevertheless
possess
relevance
in
rendering
legitimate
decisions
such
decisions
will
necessarily
result
in
systematically
less
favorable
determinations
for
these
individuals
for
example
by
conferring
greater
attention
and
opportunities
to
employees
that
they
predict
will
prove
most
competent
at
some
task
employers
may
find
that
they
subject
members
of
protected
groups
to
consistently
disadvantageous
treatment
because
the
criteria
that
determine
the
attractiveness
of
employees
happen
to
be
held
at
systematically
lower
rates
by
members
of
these
groups
n
decision
makers
do
not
necessarily
intend
this
disparate
impact
because
they
hold
prejudicial
beliefs
rather
their
reasonable
priorities
as
profit
seekers
unintentionally
recapitulate
the
inequality
that
happens
to
exist
in
society
furthermore
this
may
occur
even
if
proscribed
criteria
have
been
removed
from
the
dataset
the
data
are
free
from
latent
prejudice
or
bias
the
features
are
especially
granular
and
diverse
and
the
only
goal
is
to
maximize
classificatory
or
predictive
accuracy
the
problem
stems
from
what
researchers
call
redundant
encodings
cases
in
which
membership
in
a
protected
class
happens
to
be
encoded
in
other
data
n
this
occurs
when
a
particular
piece
of
data
or
certain
values
for
that
piece
of
data
are
highly
correlated
with
membership
in
specific
protected
classes
data
s
significant
statistical
relevance
to
the
decision
at
hand
helps
explain
why
data
mining
can
result
in
seemingly
discriminatory
models
even
when
its
only
objective
is
to
ensure
the
greatest
possible
accuracy
for
its
determinations
if
there
is
a
disparate
distribution
of
an
attribute
a
more
precise
form
of
data
mining
will
be
more
likely
to
capture
that
distribution
better
data
and
more
features
will
simply
come
closer
to
exposing
the
exact
extent
of
inequality
e
masking
data
mining
could
also
breathe
new
life
into
traditional
forms
of
intentional
discrimination
because
decision
makers
with
prejudicial
views
can
mask
their
intentions
by
exploiting
each
of
the
mechanisms
enumerated
above
stated
simply
any
form
of
discrimination
that
happens
unintentionally
can
also
be
orchestrated
intentionally
for
instance
decision
makers
could
knowingly
and
purposefully
bias
the
collection
of
data
to
ensure
that
mining
suggests
rules
that
are
less
favorable
to
members
of
protected
classes
n
they
could
likewise
attempt
to
preserve
the
known
effects
of
prejudice
in
prior
decision
making
by
insisting
that
such
decisions
constitute
a
reliable
and
impartial
set
of
examples
from
which
to
induce
a
decision
making
rule
and
decision
makers
could
intentionally
rely
on
features
that
only
permit
coarse
grained
distinction
making
distinctions
that
result
in
avoidably
higher
rates
of
erroneous
determinations
for
members
of
a
protected
class
in
denying
themselves
finer
grained
detail
decision
makers
would
be
able
to
justify
writing
off
entire
groups
composed
disproportionately
of
members
of
protected
classes
a
form
of
digital
redlining
this
decision
masks
efforts
to
engage
in
intentional
discrimination
by
abstracting
to
a
level
of
analysis
that
fails
to
capture
lower
level
variations
as
a
result
certain
members
of
protected
classes
might
not
be
seen
as
attractive
candidates
here
prejudice
rather
than
some
legitimate
business
reason
such
as
cost
motivates
decision
makers
to
intentionally
restrict
the
particularity
of
their
decision
making
to
a
level
that
can
only
paint
in
avoidably
broad
strokes
this
condemns
entire
groups
composed
disproportionately
of
members
of
protected
classes
to
systematically
less
favorable
treatment
because
data
mining
holds
the
potential
to
infer
otherwise
unseen
attributes
including
those
traditionally
deemed
sensitive
n
it
can
indirectly
determine
individuals
membership
in
protected

and
unduly
discount
penalize
or
exclude
such
people
accordingly
in
other
words
data
mining
could
grant
decision
makers
the
ability
to
distinguish
and
disadvantage
members
of
protected

even
if
those
decision
makers
do
not
have
access
to
explicit
information
about
individuals
class
membership
data
mining
could
instead
help
to
pinpoint
reliable
proxies
for
such
membership
and
thus
place
institutions
in
the
position
to
automatically
sort
individuals
into
their
respective
class
without
ever
having
to
learn
these
facts
directly
n
the
most
immediate
implication
is
that
institutions
could
employ
data
mining
to
circumvent
the
barriers
both
practical
and
legal
that
have
helped
to
withhold
individuals
protected
class
membership
from
consideration
additionally
data
mining
could
provide
cover
for
intentional
discrimination
of
this
sort
because
the
process
conceals
the
fact
that
decision
makers
determined
and
considered
the
individual
s
class
membership
the
worry
then
is
not
simply
that
data
mining
introduces
novel
ways
for
decision
makers
to
satisfy
their
taste
for
illegal
discrimination
rather
the
worry
is
that
it
may
mask
actual
cases
of
such
discrimination
n
although
scholars
policy
makers
and
lawyers
have
long
been
aware
of
the
dangers
of
masking

enhances
the
ability
to
conceal
acts
of
intentional
discrimination
by
finding
ever
more
remote
and
complex
proxies
for
proscribed
criteria
n
intentional
discrimination
and
its
masking
have
so
far
garnered
disproportionate
attention
in
discussions
of
data
mining
n
often
to
the
exclusion
of
issues
arising
from
the
many
forms
of
unintentional
discrimination
described
above
while
data
mining
certainly
introduces
novel
ways
to
discriminate
intentionally
and
to
conceal
those
intentions
most
cases
of
employment
discrimination
are
already
sufficiently
difficult
to
prove

motivated
by
conscious
prejudice
would
have
little
to
gain
by
pursuing
these
complex
and
costly
mechanisms
to
further
mask
their
intentions
n
when
it
comes
to
data
mining

is
the
more
pressing
concern

of
two
theories
of

disparate

n
disparate
treatment
comprises
two
different
strains
of
discrimination
formal
disparate
treatment
of
similarly
situated
people
and
intent
to
discriminate
n
disparate
impact
refers
to
policies
or
practices
that
are
facially
neutral
but
have
a
disproportionately
adverse
impact
on
protected
classes
n
disparate
impact
is
not
concerned
with
the
intent
or
motive
for
a
policy
where
it
applies
the
doctrine
first
asks
whether
there
is
a
disparate
impact
on
members
of
a
protected
class
then
whether
there
is
some
business
justification
for
that
impact
and
finally
whether
there
were
less
discriminatory
means
of
achieving
the
same
result
n
liability
under
title
vii
for
discriminatory
data
mining
will
depend
on
the
particular
mechanism
by
which
the
inequitable
outcomes
are
generated
this
part
explores
the
disparate
treatment
and
disparate
impact
doctrines
and
analyzes
which
mechanisms
could
generate
liability
under
each
theory
a
disparate
treatment
disparate
treatment
recognizes
liability
for
both
explicit
formal
classification
and
intentional
discrimination
n
formal
discrimination
in
which
membership
in
a
protected
class
is
used
as
an
input
to
the
model
corresponds
to
an
employer
classifying
employees
or
potential
hires
according
to
membership
in
a
protected
class
and
differentiating
them
on
that
basis
formal
discrimination
covers
both
the
straightforward
denial
of
opportunities
based
on
protected
class
membership
and
the
use
of
rational
racism
n
in
traditional
contexts
rational
racism
is
considered
rational
because
there
are
cases
in
which
its
users
believe
it
is
an
accurate
if
coarse
grained
proxy
or
at
least
the
best
available
one
in
a
given
situation
n
in
the
world
of
data
mining
though
that
need
not
be
the
case
even
if
membership
in
a
protected
class
were
specified
as
an
input
the
eventual
model
that
emerges
could
see
it
as
the
least
significant
feature
in
that
case
there
would
be
no
discriminatory
effect
but
there
would
be
a
disparate
treatment
violation
because
considering
membership
in
a
protected
class
as
a
potential
proxy
is
a
legal
classificatory
harm
in
itself
n
formal
liability
does
not
correspond
to
any
particular
discrimination
mechanism
within
data
mining
it
can
occur
equally
well
in
any
of
them
because
classification
itself
can
be
a
legal
harm
irrespective
of
the
effect
n
the
same
should
be
true
of
using
protected
class
as
an
input
to
a
system
for
which
the
entire
purpose
is
to
build
a
classificatory
model
n
the
irony
is
that
the
use
of
protected
class
as
an
input
is
usually
irrelevant
to
the
outcome
in
terms
of
discriminatory
effect
at
least
given
a
large
enough
number
of
input
features
the
target
variable
will
in
reality
be
correlated
to
the
membership
in
a
protected
class
somewhere
between
percent
and
percent
if
the
trait
is
perfectly
uncorrelated
including
membership
in
the
protected
class
as
an
input
will
not
change
the
output
and
there
will
be
no
discriminatory
effect
n
on
the
other
end
of
the
spectrum
where
membership
in
the
protected
class
is
perfectly
predictive
of
the
target
variable
the
fact
will
be
redundantly
encoded
in
the
other
data
the
only
way
using
membership
in
the
protected
class
as
an
explicit
feature
will
change
the
outcome
is
if
the
information
is
otherwise
not
rich
enough
to
detect
such
membership
membership
in
the
protected
class
will
prove
relevant
to
the
exact
extent
it
is
already
redundantly
encoded
given
a
rich
enough
set
of
features
the
chance
that
such
membership
is
redundantly
encoded
approaches
certainty
thus
a
data
mining
model
with
a
large
number
of
variables
will
determine
the
extent
to
which
membership
in
a
protected
class
is
relevant
to
the
sought
after
trait
whether
or
not
that
information
is
an
input
formal
discrimination
therefore
should
have
no
bearing
whatsoever
on
the
outcome
of
the
model
additionally
by
analyzing
the
data
an
employer
could
probabilistically
determine
an
employee
s
membership
in
that
same
protected
class
if
the
employer
did
indeed
want
to
know
to
analyze
intentional
discrimination
other
than
mere
formal
discrimination
a
brief
description
of
disparate
treatment
doctrine
is
necessary

title
vii
disparate
treatment
case
will
generally
proceed
under
either
the
mcdonnell
douglas
burden
shifting
scheme
or
the
price
waterhouse
mixed
motive
regime
n
under
the
mcdonnell
douglas
framework
the
plaintiff
who
has
suffered
an
adverse
employment
action
has
the
initial
responsibility
to
establish
a
prima
facie
case
of
discrimination
by
demonstrating
that
a
similarly
situated
person
who
is
not
a
member
of
a
protected
class
would
not
have
suffered
the
same
fate
n
this
can
be
shown
with
circumstantial
evidence
of
discriminatory
intent
such
as
disparaging
remarks
made
by
the
employer
or
procedural
irregularities
in
promotion
or
hiring
only
very
rarely
will
an
employer
openly
admit
to
discriminatory
conduct
if
the
plaintiff
successfully
demonstrates
that
the
adverse
action
treated
protected
class
members
differently
then
the
burden
shifts
to
the
defendant
employer
to
offer
a
legitimate
nondiscriminatory
basis
for
the
decision
the
defendant
need
not
prove
the
reason
is
true
his
is
only
a
burden
of
production
n
once
the
defendant
has
offered
a
nondiscriminatory
alternative
the
ultimate
burden
of
persuasion
falls
to
the
plaintiff
to
demonstrate
that
the
proffered
reason
is
pretextual
n
in
the
data
mining
context
liability
for
masking
is
clear
as
a
theoretical
matter
no
matter
which
mechanism
for
discrimination
is
employed
the
fact
that
it
is
accomplished
algorithmically
does
not
make
it
less
of
a
disparate
treatment
violation
as
the
entire
idea
of
masking
is
pretextual
in
fact
in
the
traditional
non
data
mining
context
the
word
masking
has
occasionally
been
used
to
refer
to
pretext
n
like
in
any
disparate
treatment
case
however
proof
will
be
difficult
to
come
by
something
even
truer
for
masking
n
the
mcdonnell
douglas
framework
operates
on
a
presumption
that
if
the
rationale
that
the
employer
has
given
is
found
to
be
untrue
the
employer
must
be
hiding
his
true
discriminatory
motive
n
because
the
focus
of
the
mcdonnell
douglas
framework
is
on
pretext
and
cover
up
it
can
only
address
conscious
willful
discrimination
n
under
the
mcdonnell
douglas
framework
a
court
must
find
either
that
the
employer
intended
to
discriminate
or
did
not
discriminate
at
all
n
thus
unintentional
discrimination
will
not
lead
to
liability
a
title
vii
disparate
treatment
case
can
also
be
tried
under
the
mixed
motive
framework
first
recognized
in
price
waterhouse
v
hopkins
n
and
most
recently
modified
by
desert
palace
inc
v
costa
n
in
the
mixed
motive
framework
a
plaintiff
need
not
demonstrate
that
the
employer
s
nondiscriminatory
rationale
was
pretextual
but
merely
that
discrimination
was
a
motivating
factor
in
the
adverse
employment
action
n
as
a
practical
matter
this
means
that
the
plaintiff
must
show
that
the
same
action
would
not
have
been
taken
absent
the
discriminatory
motive
n
as
several
commentators
have
pointed
out
motive
and
intent
are
not
necessarily
synonymous
n
motive
can
be
read
more
broadly
to
include
unconscious
discrimination
including
anything
that
influences
a
person
to
act
such
as
emotions
or
desires
n
nonetheless
courts
have
conflated
the
meanings
of
motive
and
intent
such
that
the
phrase
motive
or
intent
has
come
to
refer
only
to
conscious
choices
n
thus
while
most
individual
decision
making
probably
belongs
in
a
mixed
motive
framework
as
each
decision
a
person
makes
comprises
a
complicated
mix
of
motivations
n
the
mixed
motive
framework
will
be
no
better
than
the
pretext
framework
at
addressing
bias
that
occurs
absent
conscious
intent
n
except
for
masking
discriminatory
data
mining
is
by
stipulation
unintentional
unintentional
disparate
treatment
is
not
a
problem
that
is
new
to
data
mining
a
vast
scholarly
literature
has
developed
regarding
the
law
s
treatment
of
unconscious
implicit
bias
n
such
treatment
can
occur
when
an
employer
has
internalized
some
racial
stereotype
and
applies
it
or
without
realizing
it
monitors
an
employee
more
closely
until
the
employer
finds
a
violation
n
the
employee
is
clearly
treated
differently
but
it
is
not
intentional
and
the
employer
is
unaware
of
it
as
professor
samuel
bagenstos
summarized
at
this
point
it
may
be
difficult
if
not
impossible
for
a
court
to
go
back
and
reconstruct
the
numerous
biased
evaluations
and
perceptions
that
ultimately
resulted
in
an
adverse
employment
decision
n
within
the
scholarly
literature
there
is
s
urprising
unanimity
that
the
law
does
not
adequately
address
unconscious
disparate
treatment
n
there
are
a
few
possible
ways
to
analogize
discriminatory
data
mining
to
unintentional
disparate
treatment
in
the
traditional
context
based
on
where
one
believes
the
treatment
lies
either
the
disparate
treatment
occurs
at
the
decision
to
apply
a
predictive
model
that
will
treat
members
of
a
protected
class
differently
or
it
occurs
when
the
disparate
result
of
the
model
is
used
in
the
ultimate
hiring
decision
in
the
first
scenario
the
intent
at
issue
is
the
decision
to
apply
a
predictive
model
with
known
disproportionate
impact
on
protected
classes
in
the
second
the
disparate
treatment
occurs
if
after
the
employer
sees
the
disparate
result
he
proceeds
anyway
if
the
employer
continues
because
he
liked
the
discrimination
produced
in
either
scenario
then
intent
is
clear
if
not
then
this
just
devolves
into
a
standard
disparate
impact
scenario
with
liability
based
on
effect
under
disparate
impact
theory
deciding
to
follow
through
on
a
test
with
discriminatory
effect
does
not
suddenly
render
it
disparate
treatment
n
another
option
is
to
imagine
the
model
as
the
decision
maker
exhibiting
implicit
bias
that
is
because
of
biases
hidden
to
the
predictive
model
such
as
nonrepresentative
data
or
mislabeled
examples
the
model
reaches
a
discriminatory
result
this
analogy
turns
every
mechanism
except
proxy
discrimination
into
the
equivalent
of
implicit
bias
exhibited
by
individual
decision
makers
the
effect
of
bias
is
one
factor
among
the
many
different
factors
that
go
into
the
model
driven
decision
just
like
in
an
individual
s
adverse
employment
decision
n
would
a
more
expansive
definition
of
motive
fix
this
scenario
because
the
doctrine
focuses
on
human
decision
makers
as
discriminators
the
answer
is
no
even
if
disparate
treatment
doctrine
could
capture
unintentional
discrimination
it
would
only
address
such
discrimination
stemming
from
human
bias
for
example
the
person
who
came
up
with
the
idea
for
street
bump
ultimately
devised
a
system
that
suffers
from
reporting
bias
n
but
it
was
not
because
he
or
she
was
implicitly
employing
some
racial
stereotype
rather
it
was
simply
inattentiveness
to
problems
with
the
sampling
frame
this
is
not
to
say
that
his
or
her
own
bias
had
nothing
to
do
with
it
the
person
likely
owned
a
smartphone
and
thus
did
not
think
about
the
people
who
do
not
but
no
one
would
say
that
it
was
even
implicit
bias
against
protected
classes
that
motivated
the
decision
even
under
the
expansive
definition
of
the
word
motive
n
the
only
possible
analogy
relevant
to
disparate
treatment
then
is
to
those
data
mining
mechanisms
of
unintentional
discrimination
that
reflect
a
real
person
s
bias
something
like
linkedin
s
talent
match
recommendation
engine
which
relies
on
potentially
prejudiced
human
assessments
of
employees
n
as
a
general
rule
an
employer
may
not
avoid
disparate
treatment
liability
by
encoding
third
party
preferences
as
a
rationale
for
a
hiring
decision
n
but
once
again
to
be
found
liable
under
current
doctrine
the
employer
would
likely
both
have
to
know
that
this
is
the
specific
failure
mechanism
of
the
model
and
choose
it
based
on
this
fact
there
is
one
other
interesting
question
regarding
disparate
treatment
doctrine
whether
the
intent
standard
includes
knowledge
this
is
not
a
problem
that
arises
often
when
a
human
is
making
a
single
employment
determination
assuming
disparate
treatment
occurs
in
a
given
case
it
is
generally
either
intended
or
unconscious
what
would
it
mean
to
have
an
employer
know
that
he
was
treating
an
employee
differently
but
still
take
the
action
he
had
always
planned
to
take
without
intent
to
treat
the
employee
differently
it
seems
like
an
impossible
line
to
draw
n
with
data
mining
though
unlike
unconscious
bias
it
is
possible
to
audit
the
resulting
model
and
inform
an
employer
that
she
will
be
treating
individuals
differently
before
she
does
so
if
an
employer
intends
to
employ
the
model
but
knows
it
will
produce
a
disparate
impact
does
she
intend
to
discriminate
this
is
a
more
realistic
parsing
of
intent
and
knowledge
than
in
the
case
of
an
individual
nonsystematic
employment
decision
neither
pretext
nor
motive
exists
here
and
throughout
civil
and
criminal
law
knowledge
and
intent
are
considered
distinct
states
of
mind
so
there
would
likely
be
no
liability
on
the
other
hand
courts
may
use
knowledge
of
discrimination
as
evidence
to
find
intent
n
and
while
the
statute
s
language
only
covers
intentional
discrimination
n
a
broad
definition
of
intent
could
include
knowledge
or
substantial
certainty
of
the
result
n
because
the
situation
has
not
come
up
often
the
extent
of
the
intent
required
is
as
yet
unknown
n
in
sum
aside
from
rational
racism
and
masking
with
some
difficulties
disparate
treatment
doctrine
does
not
appear
to
do
much
to
regulate
discriminatory
data
mining
b
disparate
impact
where
there
is
no
discriminatory
intent
disparate
impact
doctrine
should
be
better
suited
to
finding
liability
for
discrimination
in
data
mining
in
a
disparate
impact
case
a
plaintiff
must
show
that
a
particular
facially
neutral
employment
practice
causes
a
disparate
impact
with
respect
to
a
protected
class
n
if
shown
the
defendant
employer
may
demonstrate
that
the
challenged
practice
is
job
related
for
the
position
in
question
and
consistent
with
business
necessity
n
if
the
defendant
makes
a
successful
showing
to
that
effect
the
plaintiff
may
still
win
by
showing
that
the
employer
could
have
used
an
alternative
employment
practice
with
less
discriminatory
results
n
the
statute
is
unclear
as
to
the
required
showing
for
essentially
every
single
element
of
a
disparate
impact
claim
first
it
is
unclear
how
much
disparate
impact
is
needed
to
make
out
a
prima
facie
case
n
the
eeoc
charged
with
enforcing
title
vii
s
mandate
has
created
the
so
called
four
fifths
rule
as
a
presumption
of
adverse
impact
a
selection
rate
for
any
race
sex
or
ethnic
group
which
is
less
than
four
fifths
of
the
rate
for
the
group
with
the
highest
rate
will
generally
be
regarded
as
evidence
of
adverse
impact
n
the
uniform
guidelines
on
employment
selection
procedures
guidelines
also
state
however
that
smaller
differences
can
constitute
adverse
impact
and
greater
differences
may
not
depending
on
circumstances
thus
the
four
fifths
rule
is
truly
just
a
guideline
n
for
the
purposes
of
this
part
it
is
worthwhile
to
just
assume
that
the
discriminatory
effects
are
prominent
enough
to
establish
disparate
impact
as
an
initial
matter
n
the
next
step
in
the
litigation
is
the
business
necessity
defense
this
defense
is
in
a
very
real
sense
the
crux
of
disparate

analysis
weighing

not
clear
on
what
if

difference
existed
between
job
relatedness
and
business
necessity
at
one
point
seeming
to
use
the
terms

touchstone
is
business
necessity
if
an
employment
practice
which
operates
to
exclude
negroes
cannot
be
shown
to
be
related

performance
the

is
prohibited

the
focus
of
the

clearly
on

job
performance

the
term

come
to

a
practice
that
is
predictive
of
job
performance

the
definitions

have
never
been
clear

defer

in
divisions
where
it
had
previously
hired
black
employees
n
the
court
ruled
that
the
new
requirements
were
not
a
business
necessity
because
employees
who
have
not
completed
high
school
or
taken
the
tests
have
continued
to
perform
satisfactorily
and
make
progress
in
departments
for
which
the
high
school
and
test
criteria
are
now
used
n
furthermore
the
requirements
were
implemented
without
any
study
of
their
future
effect
n
the
court
also
rejected
the
argument
that
the
requirements
would
improve
the
overall
quality
of
the
workforce
n
by
the
court
began
treating
business
necessity
as
a
much
looser
standard
n
in
new
york
city
transit
authority
v
beazer
n
the
transit
authority
had
implemented
a
rule
barring
drug
users
from
employment
including
current
users
of
methadone
otherwise
known
as
recovering
heroin
addicts
in
dicta
the
court
stated
that
a
narcotics
rule
which
significantly
serves
the
legitimate
employment
goals
of
safety
and
efficiency
was
assuredly
job
related
n
this
was
the
entire
analysis
of
the
business
necessity
defense
in
the
case
moreover
the
rationale
was
acceptable
as
applied
to
the
entire
transit
authority
even
where
only
percent
of
the
jobs
were
labeled
as
safety
sensitive
n
ten
years
later
the
court
made
the
business
necessity
doctrine
even
more
defendant
friendly
in
wards
cove
packing
co
v
atonio
n
after
wards
cove
the
business
necessity
defense
required
a
court
to
engage
in
a
reasoned
review
of
the
employer
s
justification
for
his
use
of
the
challenged
practice
t
here
is
no
requirement
that
the
challenged
practice
be
essential
or
indispensable
to
the
employer
s
business
for
it
to
pass
muster
n
the
court
also
reallocated
the
burden
to
plaintiffs
to
prove
that
business
necessity
was
lacking
and
even
referred
to
the
defense
as
a
business
justification
rather
than
a
business
necessity
n
the
wards
cove
court
went
so
far
that
congress
directly
addressed
the
decision
in
the
civil
rights
act
of
act
which
codified
disparate
impact
and
reset
the
standards
to
the
day
before
wards
cove
was
decided
n
because
the
substantive
standards
for
job
relatedness
or
business
necessity
were
uncertain
before
wards
cove
however
the
confusion
persisted
even
after
the
act
was
passed
n
at
the
time
both
sides
civil
rights
groups
and
the
bush
administration
proponents
of
a
rigorous
and
more
lenient
business
necessity
defense
respectively
declared
victory
n
since
then
courts
have
recognized
that
business
necessity
lies
somewhere
in
the
middle
of
two
extremes
n
some
courts
require
that
the
hiring
criteria
bear
a
manifest
relationship
n
to
the
employment
in
question
or
that
they
be
significantly
correlated
to
job
performance
n
the
third
circuit
was
briefly
an
outlier
holding
that
hiring
criteria
must
effectively
measure
the
minimum
qualifications
for
successful
performance
of
the
job
in
order
to
meet
the
strict
business
necessity
standard
n
this
tougher
standard
would
as
a
practical
matter
ban
general
aptitude
tests
with
any
disparate
impact
because
a
particular
cutoff
score
cannot
be
shown
to
distinguish
between
those
able
and
completely
unable
to
do
the
work
n
for
example
other
unmeasured
skills
and
abilities
could
theoretically
compensate
for
the
lower
score
on
an
aptitude
test
rendering
a
certain
minimum
score
not
necessary
if
it
does
not
measure
minimum
qualifications
n
in
a
subsequent
case
however
the
third
circuit
recognized
that
title
vii
does
not
require
an
employer
to
choose
someone
less
qualified
as
opposed
to
unqualified
in
the
name
of
nondiscrimination
and
noted
that
aptitude
tests
can
be
legitimate
hiring
tools
if
they
accurately
measure
a
person
s
qualifications
n
the
court
concluded
putting
these
standards
together
then
we
require
that
employers
show
that
a
discriminatory
hiring
policy
accurately
but
not
perfectly
ascertains
an
applicant
s
ability
to
perform
successfully
the
job
in
question
in
addition
title
vii
allows
the
employer
to
hire
the
applicant
most
likely
to
perform
the
job
successfully
over
others
less
likely
to
do
so
n
thus
all
circuits
seem
to
accept
varying
levels
of
job
relatedness
rather
than
strict
business
necessity
n
the
last
piece
of
the
disparate
impact
test
is
the
alternative
employment
practice
prong
shortly
after
griggs
the
supreme
court
decided
albemarle
paper
co
v
moody
holding
in
part
that
i
f
an
employer
does
then
meet
the
burden
of
proving
that
its
tests
are
job
related
it
remains
open
to
the
complaining
party
to
show
that
other
tests
or
selection
devices
without
a
similarly
undesirable
racial
effect
would
also
serve
the
employer
s
legitimate
interest
in
efficient
and
trustworthy
workmanship
n
this
burden
shifting
scheme
was
codified
in
the
act
as
the
alternative
employment
practice
requirement
n
congress
did
not
define
the
phrase
and
its
substantive
meaning
remains
uncertain
wards
cove
was
the
first
case
to
use
the
specific
phrase
so
congress
s
instruction
to
reset
the
law
to
the
pre
wards
cove
standard
is
particularly
perplexing
n
the
best
interpretation
is
most
likely
albemarle
s
reference
to
other
tests
or
selection
devices
without
a
similarly
undesirable
racial
effect
n
but
this
interpretation
is
slightly
odd
because
in
albemarle
business
necessity
was
still
somewhat
strict
and
it
is
hard
to
imagine
a
business
practice
that
is
necessary
while
there
exists
a
less
discriminatory
alternative
that
is
just
as
effective
n
if
business
necessity
or
job
relatedness
is
a
less
stringent
requirement
though
then
the
presence
of
the
alternative
employment
practice
requirement
does
at
least
give
it
some
teeth
now
return
to
data
mining
for
now
assume
a
court
does
not
apply
the
strict
business
necessity
standard
but
has
some
variation
of
job
related
in
mind
as
all
federal
appellate
courts
do
today
n
the
threshold
issue
is
clearly
whether
the
sought
after
trait
the
target
variable
is
job
related
regardless
of
the
machinery
used
to
predict
it
if
the
target
variable
is
not
sufficiently
job
related
a
business
necessity
defense
would
fail
regardless
of
the
fact
that
the
decision
was
made
by
algorithm
thus
disparate
impact
liability
can
be
found
for
improper
care
in
target
variable
definition
for
example
it
would
be
difficult
for
an
employer
to
justify
an
adverse
determination
based
on
the
appearance
of
an
advertisement
suggesting
a
criminal
record
alongside
the
search
results
for
a
candidate
s
name
sweeney
found
such
a
search
to
have
a
disparate
impact
n
and
the
eeoc
and
several
federal
courts
have
interpreted
title
vii
to
prohibit
discrimination
on
the
sole
basis
of
criminal
record
unless
there
is
a
specific
reason
the
particular
conviction
is
related
to
the
job
n
this
is
true
independent
of
the
fact
that
the
disparity
is
an
artifact
of
third
party
bias
all
that
matters
is
whether
the
target
variable
is
job
related
in
the
end
though
because
determining
that
a
business
practice
is
not
job
related
actually
requires
a
normative
determination
that
it
is
instead
discriminatory
courts
tend
to
accept
most
common
business
practices
for
which
an
employer
has
a
plausible
story
n
once
a
target
variable
is
established
as
job
related
the
first
question
is
whether
the
model
is
predictive
of
that
trait
the
nature
of
data
mining
suggests
that
this
will
be
the
case
data
mining
is
designed
entirely
to
predict
future
outcomes
and
if
seeking
a
job
related
trait
future
job
performance
one
commentator
lamented
that
f
ederal
case
law
has
shifted
from
a
prospective
view
of
meritocracy
to
a
retrospective
view
thereby
weakening
disparate
impact
law
n
the
author
meant
that
in
griggs
the
court
recognized
that
education
and
other
external
factors
were
unequal
and
therefore
discounted
a
measure
of
meritocracy
that
looked
to
past
achievements
in
favor
of
comparing
the
likelihood
of
future
ones
but
by
the
time
the
court
had
decided
wards
cove
it
had
shifted
to
a
model
of
retrospective
meritocracy
that
presumed
the
legitimacy
of
past
credentials
thus
upholding
the
status
quo
n
while
data
mining
must
take
the
past
represented
by
the
training
data
as
given
it
generates
predictions
about
workplace
success
that
are
much
more
accurate
than
predictions
based
on
those
past
credentials
that
disparate
impact
doctrine
has
come
to
accept
n
in
a
hypothetical
perfect
case
of
data
mining
the
available
information
would
be
rich
enough
that
reliance
on
the
past
information
would
fully
predict
future
performance
thus
robust
data
mining
would
likely
satisfy
even
the
griggs
court
s
standard
that
the
models
are
looking
toward
future
job
performance
not
merely
past
credentials
the
second
question
asks
whether
the
model
adequately
predicts
what
it
is
supposed
to
predict
in
the
traditional
context
this
question
arises
in
the
case
of
general
aptitude
tests
that
might
end
up
measuring
unrelated
elements
of
cultural
awareness
rather
than
intelligence
n
this
is
where
the
different
data
mining
mechanisms
for
discriminatory
effects
matter
part
i
posited
that
proxy
discrimination
optimizes
correctly
so
if
it
evidences
a
disparate
impact
it
reflects
unequal
distribution
of
relevant
traits
in
the
real
world
therefore
proxy
discrimination
will
be
as
good
a
job
predictor
as
possible
given
the
current
shape
of
society
models
trained
on
biased
samples
and
mislabeled
examples
on
the
other
hand
will
result
in
correspondingly
skewed
assessments
rather
than
reflect
real
world
disparities
the
same
effect
may
be
present
in
models
that
rely
on
insufficiently
rich
or
insufficiently
granular
datasets
by
designation
they
do
not
reflect
reality
these
models
might
or
might
not
be
considered
job
related
depending
on
whether
the
errors
distort
the
outcomes
enough
that
the
models
are
no
longer
good
predictors
of
job
performance
the
guidelines
have
set
forth
validation
procedures
intended
to
create
a
job
relatedness
standard
quantifiable
tests
that
have
a
disparate
impact
must
be
validated
according
to
the
procedures
in
the
guidelines
if
possible
otherwise
a
presumption
arises
that
they
are
not
job
related
n
under
the
guidelines
a
showing
of
validity
takes
one
of
three
forms
criterion
related
content
or
construct
n
criterion
related
validity
consist
s
of
empirical
data
demonstrating
that
the
selection
procedure
is
predictive
of
or
significantly
correlated
with
important
elements
of
job
performance
n
the
relationship
between
performance
on
the
procedure
and
performance
on
the
criterion
measure
is
statistically
significant
at
the
level
of
significance
n
content
validity
refers
to
testing
skills
or
abilities
that
generally
are
or
have
been
learned
on
the
job
though
not
those
that
could
be
acquired
in
a
brief
orientation
n
construct
validity
refers
to
a
test
designed
to
measure
some
innate
human
trait
such
as
honesty
a
user
of
a
construct
should
show
by
empirical
evidence
that
the
selection
procedure
is
validly
related
to
the
construct
and
that
the
construct
is
validly
related
to
the
performance
of
critical
or
important
work
behavior
s
n
as
a
statistical
predictive
measure
a
data
mining
model
could
be
validated
by
either
criterion
related
or
construct
validity
depending
on
the
trait
being
sought
either
way
there
must
be
statistical
significance
showing
that
the
result
of
the
model
correlates
to
the
trait
which
was
already
determined
to
be
an
important
element
of
job
performance
this
is
an
exceedingly
low
bar
for
data
mining
because
data
mining
s
predictions
necessarily
rest
on
demonstrated
statistical
relationships
data
mining
will
likely
only
be
used
if
it
is
actually
predictive
of
something
so
the
business
necessity
defense
solely
comes
down
to
whether
the
trait
sought
is
important
enough
to
job
performance
to
justify
its
use
in
any
context
even
assuming
the
guidelines
validation
requirement
is
a
hurdle
for
data
mining
some
courts
ignore
the
guidelines
recommendation
that
an
unvalidated
procedure
be
rejected
preferring
to
rely
on
common
sense
or
finding
a
manifest
relationship
between
the
criteria
and
successful
job
performance
n
moreover
it
is
possible
that
the
supreme
court
inadvertently
overruled
the
guidelines
in
in
ricci
v
destefano
a
case
that
will
be
discussed
in
greater
detail
in
part
iii
b
the
court
found
no
genuine
dispute
that
the
tests
at
issue
met
the
job
related
and
business
necessity
standards
n
despite
not
having
been
validated
under
the
guidelines
and
despite
the
employer
actively
denying
that
they
could
be
validated
n
while
the
business
necessity
defense
was
not
directly
at
issue
in
ricci
o
n
the
spectrum
between
heavier
and
lighter
burdens
of
justification
the
court
came
down
decidedly
in
favor
of
a
lighter
burden
n
thus
there
is
good
reason
to
believe
that
any
or
all
of
the
data
mining
models
predicated
on
legitimately
job
related
traits
pass
muster
under
the
business
necessity
defense
models
trained
on
biased
samples
mislabeled
examples
and
limited
features
however
might
trigger
liability
under
the
alternative
employment
practice
prong
if
a
plaintiff
can
show
that
an
alternative
less
discriminatory
practice
that
accomplishes
the
same
goals
exists
and
that
the
employer
refuses
to
use
it
the
employer
can
be
found
liable
in
this
case
a
plaintiff
could
argue
that
the
obvious
alternative
employment
practice
would
be
to
fix
the
problems
with
the
models
fixing
the
models
however
is
not
a
trivial
task
for
example
in
the
linkedin
hypothetical
where
the
demonstrated
interest
in
different
kinds
of
employees
reflects
employers
prejudice
linkedin
is
the
party
that
determines
the
algorithm
by
which
the
discrimination
occurs
in
this
case
based
on
reacting
to
third
party
preferences
if
an
employer
were
to
act
on
the
recommendations
suggested
by
the
linkedin
recommendation
engine
there
would
not
be
much
he
could
do
to
make
it
less
reflective
of
third
party
prejudice
aside
from
calling
linkedin
and
asking
nicely
thus
it
could
not
really
be
said
that
the
employer
refuses
to
use
an
alternative
employment
practice
the
employer
could
either
use
the
third
party
tool
or
not
similarly
it
might
be
possible
to
fix
an
app
like
street
bump
that
suffers
from
reporting
bias
but
the
employer
would
need
access
to
the
raw
input
data
in
order
to
do
so
n
in
the
case
of
insufficiently
rich
or
granular
features
the
employer
would
need
to
collect
more
data
in
order
to
make
the
model
more
discerning
but
collecting
more
data
can
be
time
consuming
and
costly
n
if
not
impossible
for
legal
or
technical
reasons
moreover
the
under
and
overrepresentation
of
members
of
protected
classes
in
data
is
not
always
evident
nor
is
the
mechanism
by
which
such
under
or
overrepresentation
occurs
the
idea
that
the
representation
of
different
social
groups
in
the
dataset
can
be
brought
into
proportions
that
better
match
those
in
the
real
world
presumes
that
analysts
have
some
independent
mechanism
for
determining
these
proportions
thus
there
are
several
hurdles
to
finding
disparate
impact
liability
for
models
employing
data
that
under
or
overrepresents
members
of
protected
classes
the
plaintiff
must
prove
that
the
employer
created
or
has
access
to
the
model
can
discover
that
there
is
discriminatory
effect
and
can
discover
the
particular
mechanism
by
which
that
effect
operates
the
same
can
be
said
for
models
with
insufficiently
rich
feature
sets
clearly
there
are
times
when
more
features
would
improve
an
otherwise
discriminatory
outcome
but
it
is
almost
by
definition
hard
to
know
which
features
are
going
to
make
the
model
more
or
less
discriminatory
indeed
it
is
often
impossible
to
know
which
features
are
missing
because
data
miners
do
not
operate
with
causal
relationships
in
mind
so
while
theoretically
a
less
discriminatory
alternative
would
almost
always
exist
proving
it
would
be
difficult
there
is
yet
another
hurdle
neither
congress
nor
courts
have
specified
what
it
means
for
an
employer
to
refuse
to
adopt
the
less
discriminatory
procedure
scholars
have
suggested
that
perhaps
the
employer
cannot
be
held
liable
until
it
has
considered
the
alternative
and
rejected
it
n
thus
if
the
employer
has
run
an
expensive
data
collection
and
analysis
operation
without
ever
being
made
aware
of
its
any
discriminatory
tendencies
and
the
employer
cannot
afford
to
re
run
the
entire
operation
is
the
employer
refusing
to
use
a
less
discriminatory
alternative
or
does
one
simply
not
exist
how
much
would
the
error
correction
have
to
cost
an
employer
before
it
is
not
seen
as
a
refusal
to
use
the
procedure
n
should
the
statute
actually
be
interpreted
to
mean
that
an
employer
unreasonably
refuses
to
use
an
alternative
employment
practice
these
are
all
difficult
questions
but
suffice
it
to
say
the
prospect
of
winning
a
data
mining
discrimination
case
on
alternative
employment
practice
grounds
seems
slim
the
third
and
final
consideration
regarding
disparate
impact
liability
for
data
mining
is
whether
a
court
or
congress
might
reinvigorate
strict
business
necessity
n
in
that
case
things
look
a
little
better
for
plaintiffs
bringing
disparate
impact
claims
where
an
employer
models
job
tenure
n
for
example
a
court
may
be
inclined
to
hold
that
it
is
job
related
because
the
model
is
a
legitimate
non
discriminatory
business
objective
n
but
it
is
clearly
not
necessary
to
the
job
the
same
reasoning
applies
to
mining
for
any
single
trait
that
is
job
related
the
practice
of
data
mining
is
not
focused
on
discovering
make
or
break
skills
unless
the
employer
can
show
that
below
the
cut
score
employees
cannot
do
the
work
then
the
strict
business
necessity
defense
will
fail
thus
disparate
impact
that
occurs
as
an
artifact
of
the
problem
specification
stage
can
potentially
be
addressed
by
strict
business
necessity
this
reasoning
is
undermined
though
where
employers
do
not
mine
for
a
single
trait
but
automate
their
decision
process
by
modeling
job
performance
on
a
holistic
measure
of
what
makes
good
employees
if
employers
determine
traits
of
a
good
employee
by
simple
ratings
and
use
data
mining
to
appropriately
divine
good
employees
characteristics
among
several
different
variables
then
the
argument
that
the
model
does
not
account
for
certain
skills
that
could
compensate
for
the
employee
s
failings
loses
its
force
taken
to
an
extreme
an
feature
holistic
determination
of
a
good
employee
would
still
not
be
strictly
necessary
holding
a
business
to
such
a
standard
however
would
simply
be
forbidding
that
business
from
ranking
candidates
if
any
disparate
impact
results
thus
while
the
strict
business
necessity
defense
could
prevent
myopic
employers
from
creating
disparate
impacts
by
their
choice
of
target
variable
it
would
still
not
address
forms
of
data
mining
that
model
general
job
performance
rather
than
predict
specific
traits
disparate
impact
doctrine
was
created
to
address
unintentional
discrimination
but
it
strikes
a
delicate
balance
between
allowing
businesses
the
leeway
to
make
legitimate
business
judgments
and
preventing
artificial
arbitrary
and
unnecessary
discrimination
n
successful
data
mining
operations
will
often
both
predict
future
job
performance
and
have
some
disparate
impact
unless
the
plaintiff
can
find
an
alternative
employment
practice
to
realistically
point
to
a
tie
goes
to
the
employer
c
masking
and
problems
of
proof
masking
poses
separate
problems
for
finding
title
vii
liability
as
discussed
earlier
there
is
no
theoretical
problem
with
finding
liability
for
masking
n
it
is
a
disparate
treatment
violation
as
clear
as
any
but
like
traditional
forms
of
intentional
discrimination
it
suffers
from
difficulties
of
proof
while
finding
intent
from
stray
remarks
or
other
circumstantial
evidence
is
challenging
in
any
scenario
masking
presents
additional
complications
for
detection
data
mining
allows
employers
who
wish
to
discriminate
on
the
basis
of
a
protected
class
to
disclaim
any
knowledge
of
the
protected
class
in
the
first
instance
while
simultaneously
inferring
such
details
from
the
data
an
employer
may
want
to
discriminate
by
using
proxies
for
protected
classes
such
as
in
the
case
of
redlining
n
due
to
housing
segregation
neighborhood
is
a
good
proxy
for
race
and
can
be
used
to
redline
candidates
without
reference
to
race
n
this
is
a
relatively
unsophisticated
example
however
it
is
possible
that
some
combination
of
musical
tastes
n
stored
likes
on
facebook
n
and
network
of
friends
n
will
reliably
predict
membership
in
protected
classes
an
employer
can
use
these
traits
to
discriminate
by
setting
up
future
models
to
sort
by
these
items
and
then
disclaim
any
knowledge
of
such
proxy
manipulation
more
generally
as
discussed
in
part
i
any
of
the
mechanisms
by
which
unintentional
discrimination
can
occur
can
also
be
employed
intentionally
the
example
described
above
is
intentional
discrimination
by
proxy
but
it
is
also
possible
to
intentionally
bias
the
data
collection
process
purposefully
mislabel
examples
or
deliberately
use
an
insufficiently
rich
set
of
features
n
though
some
of
these
would
probably
require
a
great
deal
of
sophistication
these
methods
of
intentional
discrimination
will
look
for
all
intents
and
purposes
identical
to
the
unintentional
discrimination
that
can
result
from
data
mining
therefore
detecting
discrimination
in
the
first
instance
will
require
the
same
techniques
as
detecting
unintentional
discrimination
namely
a
disparate
impact
analysis
further
assuming
there
is
no
circumstantial
evidence
like
an
employer
s
stray
remarks
with
which
to
prove
intent
a
plaintiff
might
attempt
to
prove
intent
by
demonstrating
that
the
employer
is
using
less
representative
data
poorer
examples
or
fewer
and
less
granular
features
than
he
might
otherwise
use
were
he
interested
in
the
best
possible
candidate
that
is
one
could
show
that
the
neutral
employment
practice
is
a
pretext
by
demonstrating
that
there
is
a
more
predictive
alternative
this
looks
like
disparate
impact
analysis
a
plaintiff
proving
masked
intentional
discrimination
asks
the
same
question
as
in
the
alternative
employment
practice
prong
whether
there
were
more
relevant
measures
the
employer
could
have
used
n
but
the
business
necessity
defense
is
not
available
in
a
disparate
treatment
case
n
so
alternative
employment
practice
is
not
the
appropriate
analysis
scholars
have
noted
though
that
the
line
between
disparate
treatment
and
disparate
impact
in
traditional
title
vii
cases
is
not
always
clear
n
and
sometimes
employer
actions
can
be
legitimately
categorized
as
either
or
both
n
as
professor
george
rutherglen
has
pointed
out
concrete
issues
of
proof
more
than
any
abstract
theory
reveal
the
fundamental
similarity
between
claims
of
intentional
discrimination
and
those
of
disparate
impact
the
evidence
submitted
to
prove
one
kind
of
claim
invariably
can
be
used
to
support
the
other
n
rutherglen
s
point
is
exactly
what
must
happen
in
the
data
mining
context
disparate
treatment
and
disparate
impact
become
essentially
the
same
thing
from
an
evidentiary
perspective
to
the
extent
that
disparate
impact
and
treatment
are
in
reality
different
theories
they
are
often
confused
for
each
other
plaintiffs
will
raise
both
types
of
claims
as
a
catch
all
because
they
cannot
be
sure
on
which
theory
they
might
win
so
both
theories
will
be
in
play
in
a
given
case
n
as
a
result
courts
often
seek
evidence
of
state
of
mind
in
disparate
impact
cases
n
and
objective
statistical
evidence
in
disparate
treatment
cases
n
assuming
the
two
theories
are
not
functionally
the
same
using
the
same
evidence
for
disparate
treatment
and
disparate
impact
will
only
lead
to
more
confusion
and
as
a
result
more
uncertainty
within
the
courts
thus
despite
its
clear
nature
as
a
theoretical
violation
it
is
less
clear
that
a
plaintiff
will
be
able
to
win
a
masking
disparate
treatment
case
a
final
point
is
that
traditionally
employers
who
do
not
want
to
discriminate
go
to
great
lengths
to
avoid
raising
the
prospect
that
they
have
violated
the
law
thus
they
tend
to
avoid
collecting
information
about
attributes
that
reveal
an
individual
s
membership
in
a
protected
class
employers
even
pay
third
parties
to
collect
relatively
easy
to
find
information
on
job
applicants
such
as
professional
honors
and
awards
as
well
as
compromising
photos
videos
or
membership
in
online
groups
so
that
the
third
party
can
send
back
a
version
of
the
report
that
remove
s
references
to
a
person
s
religion
race
marital
status
disability
and
other
information
protected
under
federal
employment
laws
n
this
allows
employers
to
honestly
disclaim
any
knowledge
of
the
protected
information
nonetheless
if
an
employer
seeks
to
discriminate
according
to
protected
classes
she
would
be
able
to
infer
class
membership
from
the
data
thus
employers
old
defense
to
suspicion
of
discrimination
that
they
did
not
even
see
the
information
is
no
longer
adequate
to
separate
would
be
intentional
discriminators
from
employers
that
do
not
intend
to
discriminate
iii
the
difficulty
for
reforms
while
each
of
the
mechanisms
for
discrimination
in
data
mining
presents
difficulties
for
title
vii
as
currently
written
there
are
also
certain
obstacles
to
reforming
title
vii
to
address
the
resulting
problems
computer
scientists
and
others
are
working
on
technical
remedies
n
so
to
say
that
there
are
problems
with
legal
remedies
does
not
suggest
that
the
problems
with
discrimination
in
data
mining
cannot
be
solved
at
all
nonetheless
this
part
focuses
on
the
legal
aspects
as
it
illustrates
even
assuming
that
the
political
will
to
reform
title
vii
exists
potential
legal
solutions
are
not
straightforward
this
part
discusses
two
types
of
difficulties
with
reforming
title
vii
first
there
are
issues
internal
to
the
data
mining
process
that
make
legal
reform
difficult
for
example
the
subjectivity
in
defining
a
good
employee
is
unavoidable
but
at
the
same
time
some
answers
are
clearly
less
discriminatory
than
others
n
how
does
one
draw
that
line
can
employers
gain
access
to
the
additional
data
necessary
to
correct
for
collection
bias
how
much
will
it
cost
them
to
find
it
how
do
we
identify
the
correct
baseline
historical
data
to
avoid
reproducing
past
prejudice
or
the
correct
level
of
detail
and
granularity
in
a
dataset
before
laws
can
be
reformed
policy
level
answers
to
these
basic
technical
philosophical
and
economic
questions
need
to
be
addressed
at
least
to
some
degree
second
reform
will
face
political
and
constitutional
constraints
external
to
the
logic
of
data
mining
that
will
affect
how
title
vii
can
be
permissibly
reformed
to
address
it
not
all
of
the
mechanisms
for
discrimination
seem
to
be
amenable
to
procedural
remedies
if
that
holds
true
only
after
the
fact
reweighting
of
results
may
be
able
to
compensate
for
the
discriminatory
outcomes
this
is
not
a
matter
of
missing
legislation
it
is
a
matter
of
practical
reality
unfortunately
while
in
many
cases
no
procedural
remedy
will
be
sufficient
any
attempt
to
design
a
legislative
or
judicial
remedy
premised
on
reallocation
of
employment
outcomes
will
not
survive
long
in
the
current
political
or
constitutional
climate
as
it
raises
the
specter
of
affirmative
action
politically
anything
that
even
hints
at
affirmative
action
is
a
nonstarter
today
and
to
the
extent
that
it
is
permissible
to
enact
such
policies
their
future
constitutionality
is
in
doubt
n
a
internal
difficulties
defining
the
target
variable
settling
on
a
target
variable
is
a
necessarily
subjective
exercise
n
disputes
over
the
superiority
of
competing
definitions
are
often
insoluble
because
the
target
variables
are
themselves
incommensurable
there
are
of
course
easier
cases
where
prejudice
or
carelessness
leads
to
definitions
that
subject
members
of
protected
classes
to
avoidably
high
rates
of
adverse
determinations
but
most
cases
are
likely
to
involve
genuine
business
disagreements
over
ideal
definitions
with
each
having
a
potentially
greater
or
lesser
impact
on
protected
classes
there
is
no
stable
ground
upon
which
to
judge
the
relative
merits
of
definitions
because
they
often
reflect
competing
ideas
about
the
very
nature
of
the
problem
at
issue
n
as
professor
oscar
gandy
has
argued
c
ertain
kind
s
of
biases
are
inherent
in
the
selection
of
the
goals
or
objective
functions
that
automated
systems
will
be
designed
to
support
n
there
is
no
escape
from
this
situation
a
target
variable
must
reflect
judgments
about
what
really
is
the
problem
at
issue
in
making
hiring
decisions
for
certain
employers
it
might
be
rather
obvious
that
the
problem
is
one
of
reducing
the
administrative
costs
associated
with
turnover
and
training
for
others
it
might
be
improving
sales
for
still
others
it
might
be
increasing
innovation
any
argument
for
the
superiority
of
one
target
variable
over
the
other
will
simply
make
appeals
to
competing
and
incommensurate
values
for
these
same
reasons
however
defining
the
target
variable
also
offers
an
opportunity
for
creative
thinking
about
the
potentially
infinite
number
of
ways
of
making
sound
hiring
decisions
data
miners
can
experiment
with
multiple
definitions
that
each
seem
to
serve
the
same
goal
even
if
these
fall
short
of
what
they
themselves
consider
ideal
in
principle
employers
should
rely
on
proxies
that
are
maximally
proximate
to
the
actual
skills
demanded
of
the
job
while
there
should
be
a
tight
nexus
between
the
sought
after
features
and
these
skills
this
may
not
be
possible
for
practical
and
economic
reasons
this
leaves
data
miners
in
a
position
to
dream
up
many
different
nonideal
ways
to
make
hiring
decisions
that
may
have
a
greater
or
less
adverse
impact
on
protected
classes
the
second
circuit
considered
such
an
approach
in
hayden
v
county
of
nassau
n
in
hayden
the
county
s
goal
was
to
find
a
police
entrance
exam
that
was
valid
yet
minimized
the
adverse
impact
on
minority
applicants
n
the
county
thus
administered
an
exam
with
twenty
five
parts
that
could
be
scored
independently
by
design
a
statistically
valid
result
could
be
achieved
by
one
of
several
configurations
that
counted
only
a
portion
of
the
test
sections
without
requiring
all
of
them
n
the
county
ended
up
using
nine
of
the
sections
as
a
compromise
after
rejecting
one
configuration
that
was
more
advantageous
to
minority
applicants
but
less
statistically
sound
n
this
is
a
clear
example
of
defining
a
problem
in
such
a
way
that
it
becomes
possible
to
reduce
the
disparate
impact
without
compromising
the
accuracy
of
the
assessment
mechanism
training
data
a
labeling
examples
any
solution
to
the
problems
presented
by
labeling
must
be
a
compromise
between
a
rule
that
forbids
employers
from
relying
on
past
discrimination
and
one
that
allows
them
to
base
hiring
decisions
on
historical
examples
of
good
employees
in
theory
a
rule
that
forbids
employers
from
modeling
decisions
based
on
historical
examples
tainted
by
prejudice
would
address
the
problem
of
improper
labeling
but
if
the
only
examples
an
employer
has
to
draw
on
are
those
of
past
employees
who
had
been
subject
to
discrimination
all
learned
rules
will
recapitulate
this
discrimination
title
vii
has
always
had
to
balance
its
mandate
to
eliminate
discrimination
in
the
workplace
with
employers
legitimate
discretion
for
example
one
of
the
most
common
selection
procedures
that
explicitly
reproduced
past
discrimination
was
seniority
n
seniority
was
and
is
still
often
a
legitimate
metric
for
promotion
and
is
especially
important
in
collective
bargaining
after
the
passage
of
title
vii
however
seniority
was
also
often
used
to
keep
black
people
from
advancing
to
better
jobs
because
they
had
not
been
hired
until
title
vii
forced
employers
to
hire
them
n
despite
this
obvious
problem
with
seniority
title
vii
contains
an
explicit
carve
out
for
bona
fide
seniority
or
merit
system
s
n
as
a
result
the
supreme
court
has
held
that
absent
a
discriminatory
purpose
the
operation
of
a
seniority
system
cannot
be
an
unlawful
employment
practice
even
if
the
system
has
some
discriminatory
consequences
n
given
the
inherent
tension
between
ensuring
that
past
discrimination
is
not
reproduced
in
future
decisions
and
permitting
employers
legitimate
discretion
it
should
be
unsurprising
that
when
translated
to
data
mining
the
problem
is
not
amenable
to
a
clear
solution
in
fact
this
difficulty
is
even
more
central
to
data
mining
data
miners
who
attempt
to
remove
the
influence
of
prejudice
on
prior
decisions
by
recoding
or
relabeling
examples
may
find
that
they
cannot
easily
resolve

the
nonprejudicial
determination
would
have
been
as

t
he
notion
of
what

n
employers
are
unlikely
to
have
perfectly
objective
and
exhaustive
standards
for
hiring
indeed
part
of
the
hiring
process
is
purposefully
subjective
at
the
same
time
employers
are
unlikely
to
have
discriminated
so
completely
in
the
past
that
the
only
explanation
for
rejecting
an
applicant
was
membership
in
protected
classes
this
leaves
data
miners
tasked
with
correcting
for
prior
prejudice
with
the
impossible
challenge
of
determining
what
the
correct
subjective
employment
decision
would
have
been
absent
prejudice
undoing
the
imprint
of
prejudice
on
the
data
may
demand

complete
rerendering
of
the

than
simply
adjusting
those

according
to
some

there
are
some

skewed

the
existence
of
a
bias
any
attempt
to
correct
for
collection
bias
immediately
confronts
the
problem
of
whether
or
not
the
employer
recognizes
the
specific
type
of
bias
that
is
producing
disparate
results
then
in
order
to
correct
for
it
an
employer
must
have
access
to
the
underlying
data
and
often
an
ability
to
collect
more
where
more
data
is
clearly
not
accessible
data
miners
can
proactively
compensate
for
some
of
the
bias
by
oversampling
underrepresented
communities
n
if
the
employer
fails
to
be
proactive
or
tries
and
fails
to
detect
the
bias
that
causes
the
disparate
impact
liability
is
an
open
question
as
discussed
in
part
ii
b
liability
partly
depends
on
how
liberally
a
court
interprets
the
requirement
that
an
employer
refuses
to
use
an
alternative
scheme
n
even
a
liberal
interpretation
though
would
require
evidence
of
the
particular
type
of
discrimination
at
issue
coupled
with
evidence
that
such
an
alternative
scheme
exists
thus
finding
liability
seems
unlikely
worse
where
such
showing
is
possible
there
may
be
no
easy
or
obvious
way
to
remedy
the
situation
to
address
collection
bias
directly
an
employer
or
an
auditor
must
have
access
to
the
underlying
data
and
the
ability
to
adjust
the
model
congress
could
require
this
directly
of
any
employer
using
data
mining
techniques
some
employers
are
investing
in
their
own
data
now
and
could
potentially
meet
such
requirements
n
but
employers
also
seem
happy
to
rely
on
models
developed
and
administered
by
third
parties
who
may
have
a
far
greater
set
of
examples
and
far
richer
data
than
any
individual
company
n
furthermore
due
to
economies
of
scale
that
are
especially
important
in
data
analysis
one
can
imagine
that
third
parties
specializing
in
work
force
science
will
be
able
to
offer
employers
this
service
much
less
expensively
than
they
could
manage
it
themselves
if
congress
attempted
to
demand
that
employers
have
access
to
the
data
it
would
face
strong
resistance
from
the
ever
growing
data
analysis
industry
whose
business
depends
on
the
proprietary
nature
of
the
amassed
information
more
likely
congress
could
require
audits
by
a
third
party
like
the
eeoc
or
a
private
auditor
in
order
to
protect
trade
secrets
but
this
still
seems
a
tall
task
ultimately
because
proactive
oversampling
and
retroactive
data
correction
are
at
least
possible
collection
bias
has
the
most
promising
prospects
for
a
workable
remedy
of
any
of
the
identified
data
mining
mechanisms
feature
selection
even
in
the
absence
of
prejudice
or
bias
determining
the
proper
degree
of
precision
in
the
distinctions
drawn
through
data
mining
can
be
extremely
difficult
under
formal
disparate
treatment
this
is
straightforward
any
decision
that
expressly
classifies
by
membership
in
a
protected
class
is
one
that
draws
distinctions
on
illegitimate
grounds
it
is
far
less
clear
however
what
constitutes
legitimate
statistical
discrimination
when
individuation
does
not
rely
on
proscribed
criteria
in
these
cases
the
perceived
legitimacy
seems
to
depend
on
a
number
of
factors
whether
the
errors
seem
avoidable
because
gaining
access
to
additional
or
more
granular
data
would
be
trivial
or
would
not
involve
costs
that
outweigh
the
benefits
this
seems
to
suggest
that
the
task
of
evaluating
the
legitimacy
of
feature
selection
can
be
reduced
to
a
rather
straightforward
cost
benefit
analysis
companies
would
have
an
obligation
to
pursue
ever
more
and
more
granular
data
until
the
costs
of
gathering
that
data
exceed
the
benefits
conferred
by
the
marginal
improvements
in
accuracy
unfortunately
as
is
often
the
case
with
cost
benefit
analyses
this
approach
fails
to
consider
how
different
actors
will
perceive
the
value
of
the
supposed
benefits
as
well
as
the
costs
associated
with
errors
the
obvious
version
of
this
criticism
is
that
actuarially
saddled
victims
of
inaccurate
determinations
may
find
cold
comfort
in
the
fact
that
certain
decisions
are
rendered
more
reliably
overall
when
decision
makers
employ
data
mining
n
a
more
sophisticated
version
of
this
criticism
focuses
on
the
way
such
errors
assign
costs
and
benefits
to
different
actors
at
systematically
different
rates
a
model
with
any
error
rate
that
continues
to
turn
a
profit
may
be
acceptable
to
decision
makers
at
a
company
no
matter
the
costs
or
inconvenience
to
specific
customers
n
even
when
companies
are
subject
to
market
pressures
that
would
force
them
to
compete
by
lowering
these
error
rates
the
companies
may
find
that
there
is
simply
no
reason
to
invest
in
efforts
that
do
so
if
the
errors
happen
to
fall
disproportionately
on
especially
unprofitable
groups
of
consumers
furthermore
assessing
data
mining
as
a
matter
of
balancing
costs
and
benefits
leaves
no
room
to
consider
morally
salient
disparities
in
the
degree
to
which
the
costs
are
borne
by
different
social
groups
this
raises
the
prospect
that
there
might
be
systematic
differences
in
the
rates
at
which
members
of
protected
classes
are
subject
to
erroneous
determinations
n
condemning
these
groups
to
bear
the
disproportionate
burden
of
erroneous
determinations
would
strike
many
as
highly
objectionable
despite
greater
accuracy
in
decision
making
for
the
majority
group
n
indeed
simply
accepting
these
cost
differences
as
a
given
would
subject
those
already
in
less
favorable
circumstances
to
less
accurate
determinations
even
if
companies
assume
the
responsibility
for
ensuring
that
members
of
protected
classes
do
not
fall
victim
to
erroneous
determinations
at
systematically
higher
rates
they
could
find
that
increasing
the
resolution
and
range
of
their
analyses
still
fails
to
capture
the
causal
relationships
that
account
for
different
outcomes
because
those
relationships
are
not
easily
represented
in
data
n
in
such
cases
rather
than
reducing
the
error
rate
for
those
in
protected
classes
data
miners
could
structure
their
analyses
to
minimize
the
difference
in
error
rates
between
groups
this
solution
may
involve
some
unattractive
tradeoffs
however
in
reducing
the
disparate
impact
of
errors
it
may
increase
the
overall
amount
of
errors
in
other
words
generating
a
model
that
is
equally
unfair
to
protected
and
unprotected
classes
might
increase
the
overall
amount
of
unfairness
proxies
computer
scientists
have
been
unsure
how
to
deal
with
redundant
encodings
in
datasets
simply
withholding
these
variables
from
the
data
mining
exercise
often
removes
criteria
that
hold
demonstrable
and
justifiable
relevance
to
the
decision
at
hand
as
calders
and
x
d
liobait
x
note
i
t
is
problematic
to
remove
a
correlated
attribute
if
the
attribute
to
be
removed
also
carries
some
objective
information
about
the
label
quality
of
interest
n
part
of
the
problem
seems
to
be
that
there
is
no
obvious
way
to
determine
how
correlated
a
relevant
attribute
must
be
with
class
membership
to
be
worrisome
nor
is
there
a
self
evident
way
to
determine
when
an
attribute
is
sufficiently
relevant
to
justify
its
consideration
despite
its
high
correlation
with
class
membership
as
professors
devin
pope
and
justin
sydnor
explain
v
ariables
are
likely
neither
solely
predictive
nor
purely
proxies
for
omitted
characteristics
n
but
there
is
a
bigger
problem
here
attempting
to
ensure
fairly
rendered
decisions
by
excising
highly
correlated
criteria
only
makes
sense
if
the
disparate
impact
happens
to
be
an
avoidable
artifact
of
a
particular
way
of
rendering
decisions
and
yet
even
when
denied
access
to
these
highly
correlated
criteria
data
mining
may
suggest
alternative
methods
for
rendering
decisions
that
still
result
in
the
same
disparate
impact
focusing
on
isolated
data
points
may
be
a
mistake
because
class
membership
can
be
encoded
in
more
than
one
specific
and
highly
correlated
criterion
indeed
it
is
very
likely
that
class
membership
is
reflected
across
a
number
of
interrelated
data
points
n
but
such
outcomes
might
instead
demonstrate
something
more
unsettling
that
other
relevant
criteria
whatever
they
are
happen
to
be
possessed
at
different
rates
by
members
of
protected
classes
this
explains
why
for
instance
champions
of
predictive
policing
have
responded
to
critics
by
arguing
that
i
f
you
wanted
to
remove
everything
correlated
with
race
you
couldn
t
use
anything
that
s
the
reality
of
life
in
america
n
making
accurate
determinations
means
considering
factors
that
are
somehow
correlated
with
proscribed
features
computer
scientists
have
even
shown
that
r
emoving
all
such
correlated
attributes
before
training
does
remove
discrimination
but
with
a
high
cost
in
classifier
accuracy
n
this
reveals
a
rather
uncomfortable
truth
the
current
distribution
of
relevant
attributes
attributes
that
can
and
should
be
taken
into
consideration
in
apportioning
opportunities
fairly
is
demonstrably
correlated
with
sensitive
attributes
because
the
sensitive
attributes
have
meaningfully
conditioned
what
relevant
attributes
individuals
happen
to
possess
n
as
such
attempts
to
ensure
procedural
fairness
by
excluding
certain
criteria
from
consideration
may
conflict
with
the
imperative
to
ensure
accurate
determinations
the
only
way
to
ensure
that
decisions
do
not
systematically
disadvantage
members
of
protected
classes
is
to
reduce
the
overall
accuracy
of
all
determinations
as
dwork
et
al
remark
these
results
demonstrate
a
quanti
t
ative
trade
off
between
fairness
and
utility
n
in
certain
contexts
data
miners
will
never
be
able
to
fully
disentangle
legitimate
and
proscribed
criteria
for
example
the
workforce
optimization
consultancy
evolv
discovered
that
d
istance
between
home
and
work
is
strongly
associated
with
employee
engagement
and
retention
n
despite
the
strength
of
this
finding
evolv
never
factor
s
it
into
the
score
given
each
applicant
because
different
neighborhoods
and
towns
can
have
different
racial
profiles
which
means
that
scoring
distance
from
work
could
violate
equal
employment
opportunity
standards
n
scholars
have
taken
these
cases
as
a
sign
that
the
major
challenge
is
how
to
find
out
which
part
of
information
carried
by
a
sensitive
or
correlated
attribute
is
sensitive
and
which
is
objective
n
while
researchers
are
well
aware
that
this
may
not
be
easy
to
resolve
let
alone
formalize
into
a
computable
problem
there
is
a
bigger
challenge
from
a
legal
perspective
any
such
undertaking
would
necessarily
wade
into
the
highly
charged
debate
over
the
degree
to
which
the
relatively
less
favorable
position
of
protected
classes
warrants
the
protection
of
antidiscrimination
law
in
the
first
instance
the
problems
that
render
data
mining
discriminatory
are
very
rarely
amenable
to
obvious
complete
or
welcome
resolution
when
it
comes
to
setting
a
target
variable
and
feature
selection
policy
cannot
lay
out
a
clear
path
to
improvement
reducing
the
disparate
impact
will
necessitate
open
ended
exploration
without
any
way
of
knowing
when
analysts
have
exhausted
the
possibility
for
improvement
likewise
policies
that
compel
institutions
to
correct
tainted
datasets
or
biased
samples
will
make
impossible
demands
of
analysts
in
most
cases
they
will
not
be
able
to
determine
what
the
objective
determination
should
have
been
or
independently
observe
the
makeup
of
the
entire
population
dealing
with
both
of
these
problems
will
ultimately
fall
to
analysts
considered
judgment
solutions
that
reduce
the
accuracy
of
decisions
to
minimize
the
disparate
impact
caused
by
coarse
features
and
unintentional
proxies
will
force
analysts
to
make
difficult
and
legally
contestable
trade
offs
general
policies
will
struggle
to
offer
the
specific
guidance
necessary
to
determine
the
appropriate
application
of
these
imperfect
solutions
and
even
when
companies
voluntarily
adopt
such
strategies
these
internal
difficulties
will
likely
allow
a
disparate
impact
to
persist
b
external
difficulties
assuming
the
internal
difficulties
can
be
resolved
there
are
further
political
and
constitutional
restraints
on
addressing
title
vii
s
inadequacies
with
respect
to
data
mining
data
mining
discrimination
will
force
a
confrontation
between
the
two
divergent
principles
underlying
antidiscrimination
law
anticlassification
and
antisubordination
n
which
of
these
two
principles
motivates
discrimination
law
is
a
contentious
debate
and
making
remedies
available
under
antidiscrimination
law
will
require
a
commitment
to
antisubordination
principles
that
have
thus
far
not
been
forthcoming
from
legislatures
this
is
not
merely
a
political
concern
as
substantive
remediation
is
becoming
ever
more
suspect
constitutionally
as
well
n
while
such
remedies
may
be
politically
and
legally
impossible
the
nature
of
data
mining
itself
makes
them
practically
necessary
accordingly
these
external
difficulties
may
prevent
antidiscrimination
law
from
fully
addressing
data
mining
discrimination
two
competing
principles
have
always
undergirded
antidiscrimination
law
anticlassification
and
antisubordination
anticlassification
is
the
narrower
of
the
two
holding
that
the
responsibility
of
the
law
is
to
eliminate
the
unfairness
individuals
in
certain
protected
classes
experience
due
to
decision
makers
choices
n
antisubordination
theory
in
contrast
holds
that
the
goal
of
antidiscrimination
law
is
or
at
least
should
be
to
eliminate
status
based
inequality
due
to
membership
in
those
classes
not
as
a
matter
of
procedure
but
of
substance
n
different
mitigation
policies
effectuate
different
rationales
disparate
treatment
doctrine
arose
first
clearly
aligning
with
the
anticlassification
principle
by
proscribing
intentional
discrimination
in
the
form
of
either
explicit
singling
out
of
protected
classes
for
harm
or
masked
intentional
discrimination
since
disparate
impact
developed
however
there
has
never
been
clarity
as
to
which
of
the
principles
it
is
designed
to
effectuate
n
on
the
one
hand
disparate
impact
doctrine
serves
anticlassification
by
being
an
evidentiary
dragnet
used
to
smoke
out
well
hidden
disparate
treatment
n
on
the
other
hand
as
an
effects
based
doctrine
there
is
good
reason
to
believe
it
was
intended
to
address
substantive
inequality
n
in
this
sense
the
business
necessity
defense
is
a
necessary
backstop
that
prevents
members
of
traditionally
disadvantaged
groups
from
simply
forcing
their
way
in
without
the
necessary
skills
or
abilities
n
thus
the
mapping
from
anticlassification
and
antisubordination
to
disparate
treatment
and
disparate
impact
was
never
clean
early
critics
of
civil
rights
laws
actually
complained
that
proscribing
consideration
of
protected
class
was
a
subsidy
to
black
people
n
this
argument
quickly
gave
way
in
the
face
of
the
rising
importance
of
the
anticlassification
norm
n
over
the
years
the
anticlassification
principle
has
come
to
dominate
the
landscape
so
thoroughly
that
a
portion
of
the
populace
thinks
as
do
a
few
justices
on
the
supreme
court
that
it
is
the
only
valid
rationale
for
antidiscrimination
law
n
the
move
away
from
antisubordination
began
only
five
years
after
disparate
impact
was
established
in
griggs
in
washington
v
davis
the
court
held
that
disparate
impact
could
not
apply
to
constitutional
claims
because
equal
protection
only
prohibited
intentional
discrimination
n
since
then
the
various
affirmative
action
cases
have
overwritten
the
distinction
between
benign
and
harmful
categorizations
of
race
in
favor
of
a
formalistic
anticlassification
principle
removed
from
its
origins
as
a
tool
to
help
members
of
historically
disadvantaged
groups
n
white
men
can
now
bring
disparate
treatment
claims
n
if
antidiscrimination
law
is
no
longer
thought
to
serve
the
purpose
of
improving
the
relative
conditions
of
traditionally
disadvantaged
groups
antisubordination
is
not
part
of
the
equation
while
the
court
has
clearly
established
that
antisubordination
is
not
part
of
constitutional
equal
protection
doctrine
that
it
does
not
mean
that
antisubordination
cannot
animate
statutory
antidiscrimination
law
antisubordination
and
anticlassification
came
into
sharp
conflict
in
ricci
v
destefano
a
case
in
which
the
city
of
new
haven
refused
to
certify
a
promotion
exam
given
to
its
firefighters
on
the
grounds
that
it
would
have
produced
a
disparate
impact
based
on
its
results
n
the
supreme
court
held
that
the
refusal
to
certify
the
test
a
facially
race
neutral
attempt
to
correct
for
perceived
disparate
impact
was
in
fact
a
race
conscious
remedy
that
constituted
disparate
treatment
of
the
majority
white
firefighters
who
would
have
been
promoted
based
on
the
exam
s
results
n
the
court
held
that
disparate
treatment
cannot
be
a
remedy
for
disparate
impact
without
a
strong
basis
in
evidence
that
the
results
would
lead
to
actual
disparate
treatment
liability
n
ricci
was
the
first
indication
at
the
supreme
court
that
disparate
impact
doctrine
could
be
in
conflict
with
disparate
treatment
n
the
court
had
previously
ruled
in
essence
that
the
antisubordination
principle
could
not
motivate
a
constitutional
decision
n
but
it
had
not
suggested
that
law
effectuating
that
principle
could
itself
be
discriminatory
against
the
dominant
groups
that
has
now
changed
n
the
decision
has
two
main
consequences
for
data
mining
first
where
the
internal
difficulties
in
resolving
discrimination
in
data
mining
described
above
can
be
overcome
legislation
that
requires
or
enables
such
resolution
may
run
afoul
of
ricci
suppose
for
example
congress
amended
title
vii
to
require
that
employers
make
their
training
data
and
models
auditable
in
order
to
correct
for
detected
biases
in
the
training
data
that
result
in
a
model
with
a
disparate
impact
the
employer
would
first
have
to
consider
membership
in
the
protected
class
the
remedy
is
inherently
race
conscious
the
ricci
court
did
hold
that
an
employer
may
tweak
a
test
during
the
test
design
stage
however
n
so
as
a
matter
of
timing
data
mining
might
not
formally
run
into
ricci
if
the
bias
resulting
in
a
disparate
impact
is
corrected
before
applied
to
individual
candidates
after
an
employer
begins
to
use
the
model
to
make
hiring
decisions
only
a
strong
basis
in
evidence
that
the
employer
will
be
successfully
sued
for
disparate
impact
will
permit
corrective
action
n
of
course
unless
every
single
model
used
by
an
employer
is
subject
to
a
prescreening
audit
an
idea
that
seems
so
resource
intensive
that
it
is
effectively
impossible
the
disparate
impact
will
be
discovered
only
when
the
employer
faces
complaints
additionally
while
ricci
s
holding
was
limited
in
scope
the
strong
basis
in
evidence
standard
did
not
seem
to
be
dictated
by
the
logic
of
the
opinion
which
illustrated
a
more
general
conflict
between
disparate
treatment
and
disparate
impact
n
second
where
the
internal
difficulties
cannot
be
overcome
there
is
likely
no
way
to
correct
for
the
discriminatory
outcomes
aside
from
results
focused
balancing
and
requiring
this
will
pose
constitutional
problems
for
those
who
adhere
to
the
anticlassification
principle
alone
such
an
impasse
may
be
perfectly
acceptable
they
might
say
that
as
long
as
employers
are
not
intentionally
discriminating
based
on
explicitly
proscribed
criteria
the
chips
should
fall
where
they
may
to
those
who
believe
some
measure
of
substantive
equality
is
important
over
and
above
procedural
equality
this
result
will
be
deeply
unsatisfying
an
answer
to
the
impasse
created
by
situations
that
would
require
results
focused
rebalancing
is
to
reexamine
the
purpose
of
antidiscrimination
law
the
major
justification
for
reliance
on
formal
disparate
treatment
is
that
prejudice
is
simply
irrational
and
thus
unfair
but
if
an
employer
knows
that
his
model
has
a
disparate
impact
but
it
is
also
his
most
predictive
the
argument
that
the
discrimination
is
irrational
loses
any
force
thus
data
mining
may
require
us
to
reevaluate
why
and
whether
we
care
about
not
discriminating
consider
another
example
involving
tenure
predictions
one
in
which
an
employer
ranks
potential
employees
with
the
goal
of
hiring
only
those
applicants
that
the
company
expects
to
retain
for
longer
periods
of
time
in
optimizing
its
selection
of
applicants
in
this
manner
the
employer
may
unknowingly
discriminate
against
women
if
the
historical
data
demonstrates
that
they
leave
their
positions
after
fewer
years
than
their
male
counterparts
if
gender
accounts
for
a
sufficiently
significant
difference
in
employee
tenure
data
mining
will
generate
a
model
that
simply
discriminates
on
the
basis
of
gender
or
those
criteria
that
happen
to
be
proxies
for
gender
although
selecting
applicants
with
an
eye
to
retention
might
seem
both
rational
and
reasonable
granting
significance
to
predicted
tenure
would
subject
women
to
systematic
disadvantage
if
gender
accounts
for
a
good
deal
of
the
difference
in
tenure
if
that
is
the
case
any
data
mining
exercise
that
attempts
to
predict
tenure
will
invariably
rediscover
this
relationship
one
solution
could
be
for
congress
to
amend
title
vii
to
reinvigorate
strict
business
necessity
n
this
would
allow
a
court
to
accept
that
relying
on
tenure
is
rational
but
not
strictly
necessary
and
that
perhaps
other
factors
could
make
up
for
the
lack
of
predicted
tenure
but
this
solution
and
all
others
must
rely
on
the
antisubordination
principle
consider
this
question
should
the
law
permit
a
company
to
hire
no
women
at
all
or
none
that
it
correctly
predicts
will
depart
following
the
birth
of
a
child
because
it
is
the
most
rational
choice
according
to
their
model
n
the
answer
seems
obviously
to
be
no
but
why
not
what
forms
the
basis
for
law
s
objection
to
rational
decisions
based
on
seemingly
legitimate
criteria
that
place
members
of
protected
classes
at
systematic
disadvantage
the
supreme
court
has
observed
that
title
vii
requires
employers
to
treat
their
employees
as
individuals
not
as
simply
components
of
a
racial
religious
sexual
or
national
class
n
on
the
strength
of
that
statement
the
court
held
that
employers
could
not
force
women
to
pay
more
into
an
annuity
because
they
as
women
were
likely
to
live
longer
n
but
it
is
not
clear
that
this
reasoning
translates
directly
to
data
mining
here
the
model
takes
a
great
deal
of
data
about
an
individual
and
while
it
does
make
a
determination
based
on
statistics
it
will
make
a
different
one
if
analyzing
two
different
women
so
if
the
model
said
to
hire
no
women
it
would
be
illegal
but
according
to
the
doctrine
perhaps
only
because
every
woman
ends
up
with
the
same
result
the
only
escape
from
this
situation
may
be
one
in
which
the
relevance
of
gender
in
the
model
is
purposefully
ignored
and
all
factors
correlated
with
gender
are
suppressed
the
outcome
would
be
a
necessarily
less
accurate
model
the
justification
for
placing
restrictions
on
employers
and
limiting
the
effectiveness
of
their
data
mining
would
have
to
depend
on
an
entirely
different
set
of
arguments
than
those
advanced
to
explain
the
wrongfulness
of
biased
data
collection
poorly
labeled
examples
or
an
impoverished
set
of
features
here
shielding
members
of
protected
classes
from
less
favorable
treatment
is
not
justified
by
combatting
prejudice
or
stereotyping
in
other
words
any
prohibition
in
this
case
could
not
rest
on
a
procedural
commitment
to
ensuring
ever
more
accurate
determinations
instead
the
prohibition
would
have
to
rest
on
a
substantive
commitment
to
equal
representation
of
women
in
the
workplace
that
is
it
would
have
to
rest
on
a
principle
of
antisubordination
the
dilemma
is
clear
the
farther
the
doctrine
gets
from
substantive
remediation
the
less
utility
it
has
in
remedying
these
kinds
of
discriminatory
effects
n
but
the
more
disparate
impact
is
thought
to
embody
the
antisubordination
principle
as
opposed
to
the
evidentiary
dragnet
in
service
of
the
anticlassification
norm
the
more
it
will
invite
future
constitutional
challenges
n
this
also
raises
a
point
about
disparate
treatment
and
data
mining
within
data
mining
the
effectiveness
of
prohibiting
the
use
of
certain
information
exists
on
a
spectrum
on
one
end
the
prohibition
has
little
to
no
effect
because
either
the
information
is
redundantly
encoded
or
the
results
do
not
vary
along
lines
of
protected
class
on
the
other
end
the
prohibition
reduces
the
accuracy
of
the
models
that
is
if
protected
class
data
were
not
prohibited
that
information
would
alter
the
results
presumably
by
making
members
of
protected
classes
worse
or
in
some
cases
better
off
thus
as
a
natural
consequence
of
data
mining
a
command
to
ignore
certain
data
has
either
no
effect
n
or
the
effect
of
altering
the
fortunes
of
those
protected
classes
in
substantive
ways
therefore
with
respect
to
data
mining
due
to
the
zero
sum
nature
of
a
ranking
system
even
disparate
treatment
doctrine
is
a
reallocative
remedy
similar
to
affirmative
action
n
once
again
this
erodes
the
legitimate
rationale
for
on
the
one
hand
supporting
an
anticlassification
principle
but
on
the
other
holding
fast
against
antisubordination
in
this
context
the
two
principles
tend
to
accomplish
the
same
thing
but
one
is
less
effective
at
achieving
substantive
equality
this
reveals
that
the
pressing
challenge
does
not
lie
with
ensuring
procedural
fairness
through
a
more
thorough
stamping
out
of
prejudice
and
bias
but
rather
with
developing
ways
of
reasoning
to
adjudicate
when
and
what
amount
of
disparate
impact
is
tolerable
abandoning
a
belief
in
the
efficacy
of
procedural
solutions
leaves
policy
makers
in
an
awkward
position
because
there
is
no
definite
or
consensus
answer
to
questions
about
the
fairness
of
specific
outcomes
these
need
to
be
worked
out
on
the
basis
of
different
normative
principles
at
some
point
society
will
be
forced
to
acknowledge
that
this
is
really
a
discussion
about
what
constitutes
a
tolerable
level
of
disparate
impact
in
employment
under
the
current
constitutional
order
and
in
the
political
climate
it
is
tough
to
even
imagine
having
such
a
conversation
but
until
that
happens
data
mining
will
be
permitted
to
exacerbate
existing
inequalities
in
difficult
to
counter
ways
conclusion
this
essay
has
identified
two
types
of
discriminatory
outcomes
from
data
mining
a
family
of
outcomes
where
data
mining
goes
wrong
and
outcomes
where
it
goes
too
right
data
mining
can
go
wrong
in
any
number
of
ways
it
can
choose
a
target
variable
that
correlates
to
protected
class
more
than
others
would
reproduce
the
prejudice
exhibited
in
the
training
examples
draw
adverse
lessons
about
protected
classes
from
an
unrepresentative
sample
choose
too
small
a
feature
set
or
not
dive
deep
enough
into
each
feature
each
of
these
potential
errors
is
marked
by
two
facts
the
errors
may
generate
a
manifest
disparate
impact
and
they
may
be
the
result
of
entirely
innocent
choices
made
by
data
miners
where
data
mining
goes
right
data
miners
could
not
have
been
any
more
accurate
given
the
starting
point
of
the
process
this
very
accuracy
exposing
an
uneven
distribution
of
attributes
that
predict
the
target
variable
gives
such
a
result
its
disparate
impact
if
the
data
accurately
models
inequality
attempts
to
devise
an
alternative
way
of
making
the
same
prediction
will
only
narrow
the
disparate
impact
if
these
efforts
reduce
the
accuracy
of
the
decision
procedure
by
now
it
should
be
clear
that
title
vii
and
very
likely
other
similarly
process
oriented
civil
rights
laws
cannot
effectively
address
this
situation
this
means
something
different
for
the
two
families
and
it
should
be
slightly
more
surprising
for
the
former
at
a
high
level
of
abstraction
where
a
decision
process
goes
wrong
and
this
wrongness
creates
a
disparate
impact
title
vii
and
similar
civil
rights
laws
should
be
up
to
the
task
of
solving
the
problem
that
is
ostensibly
their
entire
purpose
but
aside
from
a
few
more
obvious
cases
involving
manifest
biases
in
the
dataset
it
is
quite
difficult
to
determine
ahead
of
time
what
correct
data
mining
looks
like
a
decision
maker
can
rarely
discover
that
the
choice
of
a
particular
target
variable
is
more
discriminatory
than
other
choices
until
after
the
fact
at
which
point
it
may
be
difficult
and
costly
to
change
course
while
data
miners
might
have
some
intuitions
about
the
influence
that
prejudice
or
bias
played
in
the
prior
decisions
that
will
serve
as
training
data
data
miners
may
not
have
any
systematic
way
of
measuring
and
correcting
for
that
influence
and
even
though
ensuring
reliable
samples
before
training
a
model
is
a
possibility
the
data
may
never
be
perfect
it
may
be
impossible
to
determine
ex
ante
how
much
the
bias
contributes
to
the
disparate
impact
it
may
not
be
obvious
how
to
collect
additional
data
that
makes
the
sample
more
representative
and
it
may
be
prohibitively
expensive
to
do
so
companies
will
rarely
be
able
to
resolve
these
problems
completely
their
models
will
almost
always
suffer
from
some
deficiency
that
results
in
a
disparate
impact
a
standard
that
holds
companies
liable
for
any
amount
of
theoretically
avoidable
disparate
impact
is
likely
to
ensnare
all
companies
thus
even
at
this
level
of
abstraction
it
becomes
clear
that
holding
the
decision
makers
responsible
for
these
disparate
impacts
is
at
least
partly
troubling
from
a
due
process
perspective
such
concerns
may
counsel
against
using
data
mining
altogether
this
would
be
a
perverse
outcome
given
how
much
even
imperfect
data
mining
can
do
to
help
reduce
the
very
high
rates
of
discrimination
in
employment
decisions
if
liability
for
getting
things
wrong
is
difficult
to
imagine
how
does
liability
for
getting
things
right
make
any
more
sense
that
proxy
discrimination
largely
rediscovers
preexisting
inequalities
suggests
that
perhaps
title
vii
is
not
the
appropriate
remedial
vehicle
if
what
is
at
stake
are
the
results
of
decades
of
historical
discrimination
and
wealth
concentration
that
have
created
profound
inequality
in
society
is
that
not
too
big
a
problem
to
remedy
through
individual
lawsuits
assuming
affirmative
action
and
similar
policies
are
off
the
table
thus
perfect
data
mining
forces
the
question
if
employers
can
say
with
certainty
that
given
the
status
quo
n
candidates
from
protected
classes
are
on
average
less
ready
for
certain
jobs
than
more
privileged
candidates
should
employers
specifically
be
penalized
for
hiring
fewer
candidates
from
protected
classes
doctrinally
the
answer
is
yes
to
some
extent
professor
christine
jolls
has
written
that
disparate
impact
doctrine
is
akin
to
accommodation
in
disability
law
that
is
both
accommodations
and
disparate
impact
specifically
require
employers
to
depart
from
pure
market
rationality
and
incur
costs
associated
with
employing
members
of
protected
classes
n
similarly
the
title
vii
annuity
cases
n
and
title
vii
s
ban
on
following
racist
third
party
preferences
n
each
require
a
departure
from
market
rationality
thus
title
vii
makes
that
decision
to
a
degree
but
to
what
degree
how
much
cost
must
an
employer
bear
title
vii
does
not
require
an
employer
to
use
the
least
discriminatory
means
of
running
a
business
n
likewise
title
vii
does
not
aim
to
remedy
historical
discrimination
and
current
inequality
by
imposing
all
the
costs
of
restitution
and
redistribution
on
individual
employers
n
it
is
more
appropriately
understood
as
a
standard
of
defensible
disparate
impact
one
route
then
to
addressing
the
problems
is
to
make
the
inquiry
more
searching
and
put
the
burden
on
the
employer
to
avoid
at
least
the
easy
cases
in
a
system
that
is
as
unpredictable
as
data
mining
can
be
perhaps
the
proper
way
of
thinking
about
the
solution
is
a
duty
of
care
a
theory
of
negligent
discrimination
n
but
if
title
vii
alone
cannot
solve
these
problems
where
should
society
look
for
answers
well
the
first
answer
is
to
question
the
status
quo
data
mining
takes
the
existing
state
of
the
world
as
a
given
and
ranks
candidates
according
to
their
predicted
attributes
in
that
world
data
mining
by
its
very
nature
treats
the
target
variable
as
the
only
item
that
employers
are
in
a
position
to
alter
everything
else
that
happens
to
correlate
with
different
values
for
the
target
variable
is
assumed
stable
but
there
are
many
reasons
to
question
these
background
conditions
sorting
and
selecting
individuals
according
to
their
apparent
qualities
hides
the
fact
that
the
predicted
effect
of
possessing
these
qualities
with
respect
to
a
specific
outcome
is
also
a
function
of
the
conditions
under
which
these
decisions
are
made
recall
the
tenure
example
from
part
iii
b
in
approaching
appropriate
hiring
practices
as
a
matter
of
selecting
the
right
candidates
at
the
outset
an
employer
will
fail
to
recognize
potential
changes
that
he
could
make
to
workplace
conditions
a
more
family
friendly
workplace
greater
on
the
job
training
or
a
workplace
culture
more
welcoming
to
historically
underrepresented
groups
could
affect
the
course
of
employees
tenure
and
their
long
term
success
in
ways
that
undermine
the
seemingly
prophetic
nature
of
data
mining
s
predictions
these
are
all
traditional
goals
for
reducing
discrimination
within
the
workplace
and
they
continue
to
matter
even
in
the
face
of
the
eventual
widespread
adoption
of
data
mining
but
data
can
play
a
role
here
too
for
example
comparing
the
performance
of
equally
qualified
candidates
across
different
workplaces
can
help
isolate
the
formal
policies
and
institutional
dynamics
that
are
more
or
less
likely
to
help
workers
flourish
research
of
this
sort
could
also
reveal
areas
for
potential
reform
n
education
is
also
important
employers
may
take
some
steps
to
rectify
the
problem
on
their
own
if
they
better
understand
the
cause
of
the
disparity
right
now
many
of
the
problems
described
in
part
i
are
relatively
unknown
but
the
more
employers
and
data
miners
understand
these
pitfalls
the
more
they
can
strive
to
create
better
models
on
their
own
many
employers
switch
to
data
driven
practices
for
the
express
purpose
of
eradicating
bias
n
if
employers
discover
that
they
are
introducing
new
forms
of
bias
they
can
correct
course
even
employers
seeking
only
to
increase
efficiency
or
profit
may
find
that
their
incentives
align
with
the
goals
of
nondiscrimination
faulty
data
and
data
mining
will
lead
employers
to
overlook
or
otherwise
discount
people
who
are
actually
good
employees
where
the
cost
of
addressing
these
problems
is
at
least
compensated
for
by
a
business
benefit
of
equal
or
greater
value
employers
may
have
natural
incentives
to
do
so
finally
employers
could
also
make
more
effective
use
of
the
tools
that
computer
scientists
have
begun
to
develop
n
advances
in
these
areas
will
depend
crucially
on
greater
and

this
essay
is
a
call
for
caution
in
the
use
of
data
mining
not
its
abandonment
while
far
from
a
panacea
data
mining
can
and
should
be
part
of
a
panoply
of
strategies
for
combatting
discrimination
in
the
workplace
and
for
promoting
fair
treatment
and
equality
ideally
institutions
can
find
ways
to
use
data
mining
to
generate
new
knowledge
and
improve
decision
making
that
serves
the
interests
of
both
decision
makers
and
protected
classes
but
where
data
mining
is
adopted
and
applied
without
care
it
poses
serious
risks
of
reproducing
many
of
the
same
troubling
dynamics
that
have
allowed
discrimination
to
persist
in
society
even
in
the
absence
of
conscious
prejudice

an

this

this

text
introduction
technological
and
scientific
advances
in
recent
decades
have
enabled
an
unprecedented
level
of
surveillance
and
permitted
law
enforcement
to
gather
store
and
retrieve
in
real
time
enormous
amounts
of
data
from
computerized
rap
sheets
and
dna
databases
to
sex
offender
and
other
registries
records
of
a
person
s
contact
with
the
criminal
justice
system
no
longer
rest
in
a
file
folder
or
card
catalog
in
a
local
precinct
instead
they
reside
indefinitely
on
law
enforcement
servers
and
in
many
cases
the
publicly
searchable
internet
n
for
most
of
the
last
century
the
criminal
justice
system
limited
recordmaking
and
increased
the
confidentiality
of
data
about
juveniles
n
that
reticence
and
protectiveness
no
longer
prevails
because
it
has
been
overwhelmed
by
technology
and
a
fervid
commitment
to
data
collection
today
the
criminal
justice
system
collects
and
stores
a
tremendous
amount
of
information
about
juveniles
n
state
and
federal
laws
compel
thousands
of
young
people
to
register
as
sex
offenders
and
provide
personal
information
that
is
posted
online
and
mandate
dna
collection
from
juveniles
as
a
result
of
delinquency
adjudications
and
arrests
children
as
young
as
ten
years
old
are
entered
into
databases
of
known
and
suspected
gang
members
often
in
the
absence
of
an
arrest
or
even
a
suspicion
of
wrongdoing
public
schools
across
the
nation
are
required
to
notify
law
enforcement
when
students
commit
certain
behaviors
at
school
and
law
enforcement
agencies
return
the
favor
providing
schools
with
criminal
or
delinquency
information
n
all
of
this
supplements
the
information
collected
by
police
during
street
encounters
and
bookings
and
the
records
amassed
and
maintained
by
criminal
and
juvenile
courts
the
numbers
of
which
have
also
greatly
expanded
in
recent
years
public
and
private
services
aggregate
much
of
this
information
making
it
available
to
law
enforcement
nationwide
private
employers
public
housing
authorities
colleges
and
the
general
public
often
at
no
cost
n
in
the
late
s
roger
clarke
offered
the
term
dataveillance
as
a
way
to
conceptualize
the
new
forms
of
surveillance
facilitated
by
the
widespread
use
of
computer
based
technology
n
this
article
critically
examines
the
expansion
of
the
modern
culture
of
dataveillance
to
youth
collectively
the
robust
and
expanding
data
collection
and
distribution
practices
described
in
this
paper
produce
what
i
call
criminal
justice
biographies
of
young
people
n
these
one
sided
negative
biographies
written
by
a
coercive
institution
label
youth
in
permanent
and
stigmatizing
ways
this
harms
individual
youth
and
distorts
the
perceptions
of
them
as
a
group
with
lasting
policy
implications
yet
the
literature
on
law
enforcement
surveillance
on
the
one
hand
and
traditional
juvenile
justice
on
the
other
have
yet
to
recognize
much
less
fully
grapple
with
the
databasing
of
delinquency
this
article
reveals
the
incoherence
and
destructiveness
of
databasing
delinquency
and
argues
that
we
must
rethink
this
practice
mindful
of
the
public
safety
benefits
and
inevitability
of
law
enforcement
information
gathering
it
calls
for
reforms
that
limit
the
amount
of
information
gathered

about

this
would
not
prevent
data
collection
but
would
instead
add
appropriate
restraints
so
that
public

from
databasing
do
not
come
at
the

or
childhood
itself
part
i
sets
the
context
instead
of
widely
discussed
constitutional
protections
like
the
fourth
amendment
or
privacy
n
this
article
examines
delinquency
databasing
through
the
lens
of
the
constructed
category
of
childhood
too
little
legal
scholarship
has
critically
examined
the
role
of
the
concept
of
childhood
in
shaping
law
and
social
practices
and
the
role
that
law
and
social
practices
play
in
shaping
the
conceptions
of
childhood
n
this
vacuum
leaves
juvenile
justice
scholarship
less
nuanced
than
it
could
be
drawing
on
the
insights
of
critical
childhood
studies
n
part
i
establishes
the
prevailing
conception
of
childhood
as
a
protected
space
separate
from
adult
society
marshaling
adolescent
brain
science
psychosocial
research
and
recent
supreme
court
jurisprudence
it
shows
that
young
people
s
vulnerability
their
capacity
for
change
and
their
future
as
adult
members
of
society
each
play
an
important
background
role
in
guiding
public
policy
regarding
youth
part
ii
uncovers
the
vast
extent
of
modern
delinquency
databasing
it
explains
how
despite
youths
vulnerability
to
harm
and
capacity
for
change
juveniles
now
find
themselves
indefinitely
cataloged
in
sex
offender
registries
gang
databases
and
dna
databases
it
documents
the
unprecedented
breadth
and
permanence
of
law
enforcement
and
court
recordkeeping
it
shows
how
schools
have
become
mandated
law
enforcement
informants
and
it
maps
the
many
ways
that
this
information
travels
within
and
outside
of
the
criminal
justice
system
while
extensive
data
collection
and
publicly
available
criminal
records
can
be
a
rational
law
enforcement
strategy
that
promotes
public
safety
part
iii
identifies
the
many
harms
that
databasing
delinquency
inflicts
on
juveniles
they
include
devastating
impacts
on
their
immediate
lives
in
the
form
of
punishment
restrictions
on
their
life
choices
stigma
and
perhaps
increases
in
recidivism
compiled
early
in
the
life
of
their
subject
when
identities
and
character
are
still
taking
shape
n
and
skewed
in
content
these
criminal
justice
biographies
also
distort
perceptions
of
juveniles
in
ways
that
facilitate
support
for
punitive
policies
toward
youth
and
discrimination
against
them
this
distortion
and
discrimination
is
visited
especially
heavily
on
minority
youth
and
constitutes
an
engine
of
racial
bias
in
its
own
right
part
iii
further
shows
that
databasing
delinquency
reshapes
the
very
meaning
of
childhood
breaching
its
protected
space
and
contradicting
the
special
understandings
that
guide
the
regulation
of
youth
n
rather
than
honoring
the
particular
developmental
characteristics
of
youth
databasing
delinquency
ignores
them
and
treats
young
people
like
adults
this
contradicts
the
long
dominant
diversionary
approach
to
juvenile
wrongdoing
n
and
gainsays
the
fundamental
message
of
a
quartet
of
recent
supreme
court
cases
that
criminal
law
and
the
police
cannot
proceed
against
young
people
as
though
they
were
not
children
n
cognizant
that
this
is
a
critical
time
in
the
rebuilding
of
juvenile
justice
norms
n
part
iv
proposes
limitations
on
what
information
law
enforcement
should
gather
how
long
that
information
should
be
stored
and
with
whom
the
information
may
be
shared
the
principles
and
values
discussed
in
part
i
young
people
s
vulnerability
their
capacity
for
change
and
their
future
as
adult
members
of
society
inform
the
recommendations
the
proposed
reforms
would
reduce
the
short
and
long
term
harms
caused
by
databasing
delinquency
enabling
the
criminal
justice
system
to
promote
public
safety
and
hold
juveniles
accountable
without
unduly
hindering
their
development
into
productive
adults
i
childhood
we
recognize
and
accommodate
many
values
when
we
choose
how
to
marshal
technology
s
unprecedented
data
collection
abilities
for
law
enforcement
purposes
that
we
have
extended
the
reach
of
law
enforcement
dataveillance
to
juveniles
necessarily
injects
the
developmental
characteristics
of
youth
and
the
purpose
and
meaning
of
childhood
into
the
debate
therefore
a
brief
introduction
to
the
concept
of
childhood
is
necessary
childhood
is
an
essential
and
permanent
component
of
the
social
order
n
it
is
a
natural
fact
children
are
different
from
adults
in
known
and
measurable
ways
n
yet
childhood
marks
something
more
than
empirical
biological
realities
or
chronological
age
n
it
is
also
a
social
construction
a
contingent
category
whose
boundaries
are
not
inevitable
or
fixed
but
are
instead
defined
and
maintained
by
law
n
as
such
childhood
is
the
product
of
our
collective
imagination
reflecting
prevailing
societal
priorities
and
aspirations
n
this
leads
to
varying
definitions
of
the
scope
of
childhood
individuals
cannot
lawfully
drive
a
vehicle
until
sixteen
vote
until
eighteen
or
drink
alcohol
until
twenty
one
n
the
variety
in
cut
offs
is
inevitable
as
different
activities
require
different
levels
of
skill
or
maturity
wherever
the
lines
between
childhood
and
adulthood
rest
the
expressive
function
of
the
law
then
feeds
the
law
s
definition
s
of
childhood
back
to
society
shaping
or
reinforcing
popular
views
of
childhood
n
the
prevailing
conception
of
childhood
today
is
a
protected
space
separated
from
the
broader
adult
society
n
childhood
is
separate
from
adulthood
because
children
are
different
from
adults
and
require
their
own
spaces
rules
and
institutions
n
childhood
is
protected
because
young
people
are
vulnerable
they
make
mistakes
and
have
a
greater
capacity
for
change
than
adults
as
a
result
the
law
applies
special
rules
to
young
people
n
indeed
it
provides
an
entirely
separate
forum
for
adjudicating
juvenile
matters
n
that
delivers
youth
focused
services
and
developmentally
appropriate
levels
of
accountability
as
a
matter
of
first
principles
the
law
aims
to
avoid
imposing
harsh
enduring
consequences
and
stigmas
so
that
juveniles
do
not
carry
the
burden
of
their
youthful
mistakes
into
adulthood
n
the
ultimate
goal
is
to
shepherd
children
into
a
self
sufficient
democratic
productive
and
autonomous
adulthood
n
this
part
explains
how
three
foundational
truths
about
youth
that
they
are
vulnerable
that
they
change
and
that
they
are
future
adults
guide
the
law
s
approach
to
childhood
a
youth
are
vulnerable
young
people
by
definition
are
immature
juveniles
are
in
the
earlier
stages
of
their
emotional
growth
their
intellectual
development
is
incomplete
they
have

experience

systems
have

been

identified

adopted
n
their
immaturity
profoundly
impacts
how
they
live
their
lives
first
and
foremost
it
makes
them
vulnerable
according
to
leading
juvenile
developmental
psychologist
laurence
steinberg
adolescence
is
often
a
period
of
especially
heightened
vulnerability
n
two
particular
vulnerabilities
of
youth
their
susceptibility
to
poor
decisionmaking
and
their
physical
and
emotional
immaturity
shape
the
legal
regulation
of
juveniles
juveniles
incomplete
cognitive
and
psychosocial
development
undermines
their
ability
to
make
competent
decisions
n
young
people
are
less
able
to
process
information
quickly
and
thoughtfully
and
have
less
general
knowledge
and
experience
to
draw
upon
leading
to
poorly
reasoned
choices
n
in
addition
adolescents
are
less
likely
to
consider
the
long
term
consequences
of
their
actions
and
are
more
reward
sensitive
and
less
risk
averse
than
adults
n
this
poor
impulse
control
is
compounded
by
the
fact
that
they
are
profoundly
attuned
to
and
influenced
by
peers
n
taken
together
these
qualities
often
lead
to
delinquent
behavior
indeed
largely
on
account
of
these
attributes
offending
peaks
during
late
adolescence
n
leading
many
to
consider
delinquency
a
part
of
the
normal
life
course
n
their
physical
and
emotional
immaturity
also
makes
youth
especially
vulnerable
to
harm
young
people
suffer
specific
and
often
greater
harms
as
youth
and
they
are
more
likely
to
suffer
them
because
of
their
youth
n
they
are
for
example
more
susceptible
to
suffering
psychological
harms
than
their
adult
counterparts
under
similar
circumstances
n
they
are
especially
vulnerable
to
victimization
in
adult
institutions
and
are
at
a
greater
risk
than
adult
inmates
of
psychological
harm
and
suicide
n
young
people
are
also
particularly
vulnerable
to
lasting
problems
as
a
result
of
stigma
including
mental
health
problems
substance
abuse
and
re
offending
n
moreover
particular
practices
such
as
a
life
long
criminal
record
or
a
life
without
parole
sentence
impose
greater
harms
on
juveniles
by
virtue
of
the
simple
fact
that
juveniles
will
live
with
the
sanction
longer
n
on
account
of
their
immaturity
and
vulnerability
the
regulation
of
youth
has
long
been
infused
with
the
idea
that
they
deserve
special
protections
n
this
protective
regime
first
came
to
legal
fruition
in
the
late
nineteenth
century
when
progressive
era
reformers
the
so
called
child
savers
passed
compulsory
education
laws
restricted
child
labor
and
created
the
child
welfare
system
and
juvenile
court
n
over
one
hundred
years
later
it
still
prevails
rules
protect
juveniles
from
being
subjected
to
the
same
procedures
and
punishments
imposed
on
adults
in
civil
tort
proceedings
for
example
children
are
judged
by
a
reasonable
person
of
like
age
intelligence
and
experience
under
like
circumstances
standard
that
leads
to
limited
civil
responsibility
for
damages
they
cause
n
to
protect
minors
from
foolishly
squandering
their
wealth
through
improvident
contracts
with
crafty
adults
who
would
take
advantage
of
them
in
the
marketplace
n
a
contracting
minor
may
repudiate
the
contract
at
any
time
before
reaching
majority
or
within
a
reasonable
time
afterwards
n
the
protective
approach
to
childhood
necessarily
includes
the
criminal
law
the
juvenile
court
was
founded
over
a
century
ago
on
the
proposition
that
children
are
different
from
adults
and
should
avoid
the
punitive
and
stigmatizing
consequences
imposed
by
criminal
court
n
it
survives
today
because
society
continues
to
recognize
that
youth
deserve
a
separate
more
protective
forum
that
will
impose
accountability
while
honoring
the
childhood
of
those
before
the
court
many
protections
extend
to
those
juveniles
processed
in
criminal
court
n
for
instance
the
supreme
court
has
held
that
the
death
penalty
cannot
be
constitutionally
imposed
on
juveniles
because
their
vulnerability
and
comparative
lack
of
control
over
their
immediate
surroundings
mean
juveniles
have
a
greater
claim
than
adults
to
be
forgiven
for
failing
to
escape
negative
influences
in
their
whole
environment
n
their
vulnerability
similarly
prevents
law
enforcement
from
ignoring
childhood
during
criminal
investigations
n
this
is
not
to
say
that
youth
are
innocents
while
vulnerable
juveniles
are
autonomous
actors
who
have
the
ability
to
recognize
right
from
wrong
and
they
exercise
that
autonomy
by
choosing
at
times
to
do
bad
things
n
moreover
they
require
and
respond
to
accountability
but
youths
reduced
culpability
and
increased
vulnerability
to
harm
mean
that
the
quantity
of
accountability
appropriate
for
juvenile
behavior
is
necessarily
limited
n
b
youth
change
young
people
are
developing
in
almost
every
arena
physically
biochemically
intellectually
emotionally
and
psychosocially
their
physical
bodies
undergo
a
growth
spurt
between
the
ages
of
ten
and
eighteen
n
and
neuroscientists
describe
adolescence
as
a
period
of
profound
social
cognitive
change
n
it
is
also
a
time
when
identity
is
taking
shape
and
character
forms
n
as
the
supreme
court
observed
the
signature
qualities
of
youth
are
transient
n
the
dynamism
of
youth
matters
greatly
to
the
law
s
response
to
juvenile
offending
as
explained
above
youths
immaturity
contributes
to
delinquent
behavior
yet
most
youth
desist
from
delinquency
as
they
mature
into
adulthood
n
studies
frequently
find
that
only
five
percent
to
ten
percent
of
adolescent
offenders
continue
offending
in
adulthood
n
this
is
because
many
of
the
factors
associated
with
antisocial
risky
or
criminal
behavior
lose
their
intensity
as
individuals
become
more
developmentally
mature
n
in
fact
it
has
proven
nearly
impossible
to
researchers
to
identify
which
few
among
the
many
youthful
offenders
will
persist
into
adulthood
n
courts
and
policymakers
have
regularly
affirmed
the
relevance
of
youths
capacity
for
change
to
the
proper
regulation
of
childhood
it
goes
a
long
way
in
explaining
why
juvenile
court
was
invented
and
why
it
aims
to
privilege
rehabilitation
over
punishment
the
notion
of
change
pervaded
the
words
of
one
of
the
nation
s
earliest
juvenile
court
judges
who
explained
that
the
purpose
of
the
juvenile
court
was
not
so
much
to
punish
as
to
reform
not
to
degrade
but
to
uplift
not
to
crush
but
to
develop
not
to
make
him
a
criminal
but
a
worthy
citizen
n
as
such
delinquency
adjudications
do
not
necessarily
become
part
of
a
young
person
s
permanent
criminal
record
n
instead
stricter
confidentiality
provisions
protect
them
against
disclosure
and
juvenile
court
records
typically
can
be
sealed
or
expunged
when
the
young
person
reaches
a
particular
age
n
youth
s
capacity
for
change
likewise
protects
them
when
they
are
charged
in
criminal
court
in
a
trio
of
recent
sentencing
cases
the
supreme
court
recognized
that
the
character
of
a
juvenile
is
not
as
well
formed
as
that
of
an
adult
and
that
their
personality
traits
are
more
transitory
less
fixed
n
because
juveniles
are
more
capable
of
change
than
are
adults
their
actions
are
less
likely
to
be
evidence
of
irretrievably
depraved
character
than
are
the
actions
of
adults
n
in
short
a
greater
possibility
exists
that
a
minor
s
character
deficiencies
will
be
reformed
n
as
a
result
the
law
seeks
to
protect
them
from
conclusive
judgments
and
permanent
legal
disabilities
according
to
the
supreme
court
from
a
moral
standpoint
it
would
be
misguided
to
equate
the
failings
of
a
minor
with
those
of
an
adult
n
the
constitution
thus
forbids
the
imposition
of
the
death
penalty
and
mandatory
life
without
parole
sentences
for
crimes
committed
by
youth
and
protects
youthful
offenders
from
life
without
parole
for
non
homicide
crimes
n
c
youth
ideally
become
productive
adults
childhood
is
a
time
limited
developmental
category
n
as
leading
critical
childhood
scholars
allison
james
and
adrian
james
observed
all
children
do
grow
up
and
in
doing
so
leave
their
childhood
behind
them
n
that
young
people
will
leave
childhood
and
become
adults
has
two
important
consequences
for
the
regulation
of
childhood
first
children
must
be
taught
social
norms
including
that
society
imposes
consequences
for
misbehavior
n
second
that
lesson
must
be
delivered
in
a
way
that
preserves
their
chances
for
a
productive
adulthood
n
the
juvenile
court
was
created
to
accomplish
both
those
tasks
n
its
purpose
was
to
divert
juveniles
from
the
criminal
process
and
its
debilitating
punishments
and
stigma
to
a
forum
where
their
cases
would
be
handled
by
trained
specialists
dedicated
to
imposing
accountability
while
promoting
the
youth
s
rehabilitation
n
because
children
are
future
adults
the
criminal
justice
system
as
a
whole
including
law
enforcement
and
criminal
courts
has
a
greater
interest
in
promoting
youth
development
and
rehabilitating
those
who
offend
than
punishing
stigmatizing
and
marginalizing
them
thus
some
jurisdictions
have
recently
sought
to
make
transfer
of
youth
charged
with
crimes
to
adult
court
more
difficult
n
and
attempted
to
minimize
the
consequences
for
youth
processed
in
criminal
court
through
legislatively
created
classifications
like
youthful
offender
status
n
other
statutes
limit
the
amount
of
restitution
juveniles
may
be
ordered
to
pay
to
avoid
saddling
them
with
debts
that
would
cripple
their
transition
to
independent
adulthood
n
these
policies
aim
to
protect
youth
from
full
accountability
to
preserve
their
future
life
chances
these
protective
impulses
reflect
the
view
that
severe
punishments
permanent
disabilities
and
lasting
stigma
for
youthful
mistakes
do
not
serve
the
long
term
interests
of
society
while
reforms
have
not
gone
as
far
as
they
might
n
the
vulnerability
of
youth
their
capacity
for
change
and
their
future
as
adults
have
taken
a
more
central
role
in
policymaking
in
the
twenty
first
century
one
notable
exception
to
this
trend
is
law
enforcement
data
collection
where
special
protections
for
youth
are
falling
away
compiling
criminal
justice
biographies
of
youth
disregards
their
vulnerability
discounts
their
capacity
for
change
and
makes
more
difficult
the
transition
to
adulthood

those
practices

of
this
article
demonstrates
in
contrast
to
decades
of
practices
that
mostly
shielded
young
people
from
accumulating
law
enforcement
records
the
criminal
justice
system
today
largely
treats

it
comes
to
the
collection
and

of

it
is
not
just
criminal
information

is

collected

and
shared
law
enforcement
collects
genetic
samples
from

it
catalogs
their

the
modern
tool

uses
to
collect

disseminate
intelligence
information
prior

the

repositories
for

the
los

database
in

similar
gang
databases

maintained
across

levels

include
almost
anything

typically
record
the
youth
s
name
address
dress
tattoos
locations
behaviors
criminal
histories
vehicles
school
family
and
friends
n
law
enforcement
collects
the
information
entered
into
the
database
primarily
through
routine
stops
on
the
street
and
in
schools
n
gang
membership
is
not
a
crime
and
a
conviction
is
not
necessary
before
an
individual
s
information
can
be
entered
into

database
n
indeed
neither
an
arrest
nor
a
criminal
investigation
need
precipitate
the
categorization
of
a

involved

decide

encounters

self
admission

indicators

criteria

statutory

discretion

qualifying
criteria
can
include
vague
and
perfectly
lawful
things

ended
up
in

was
attacked

were

members

assumed

and
registered
him
as
an
active
gang
member
n
the
broad
criteria
for
inclusion
in
gang
databases
and
the
discretion
afforded
to
law
enforcement
in
deciding
whom
to
include
make
it
difficult

desire

collect

possible
about

offenders

it
to
be
over
inclusive
in
its
classifications
n
the
lack
of
age
limits
for
inclusion
in

databases
means
that

individuals
to
contest
their
inclusion
or
to
seek
or
confirm
their
purging
from
a
gang
database
this
means
that
youth
classified
as
gang
involved
by
police
can
remain
in
a
gang
database
often
unbeknownst
to
them
for
years
even
where
purging
procedures
are
in
place
they
are
rarely
carried
out
n
there
is
little
incentive
for
law
enforcement
to
purge
records
from
their
intelligence
databases
and
because
of
how
the
guidelines
governing
many
gang
databases
work
purging
is
allowed
only
if
no
new
information
is
entered
regarding
an
individual
for
two
or
five
years
n
police
can
intentionally
avoid
purging
by
checking
in
on
someone
regularly
entering
gang
related
information
gained
during
the
encounter
perhaps
about
friends
or
family
members
of
the
juvenile
though
gang
databases
are
not
publicly
available
and
despite
the
fact
that
many
youth
never
know
they
have
been
classified
by
law
enforcement
as
a
gang
member
the
information
in
gang
databases
leaks
beyond
law
enforcement
as
a
general
matter
criminal
law
scholar
james
jacobs
noted
that
once
information
is
entered
into
an
investigative
or
intelligence
database
it
can
easily
migrate
to
other
public
and
private
databases
and
therefore
can
become
more
difficult
to
purge
or
edit
effectively
n
specific
studies
of
gang
database
information
have
found
this
to
be
true
according
to
one
study
information
collected
in
calgang
has
been
shared
with
employers
landlords
public
housing
and
section
and
school
administrators
n
others
have
found
that
police
share
gang
information
with
schools
n
b
schools
as
informants
schools
have
increasingly
become
a
contact
point
for
youth
and
the
criminal
justice
system
scholars
in
many
fields
including
law
education
political
science
and
sociology
have
traced
the
rise
of
the
culture
of
control
in
the
classroom
and
its
devastating
impacts
on
youth
n
from
metal
detectors
and
fingerprint
identification
required
for
entry
to
video
surveillance
and
police
presence
on
campuses
schools
are
policed
more
than
ever
n
in
addition
schools
have
criminalized
normal
adolescent
behavior
pushing
and
shoving
has
become
battery
swiping
a
classmate
s
headphones
has
become
theft
or
robbery
and
talking
back
to
staff
has
become
disorderly
conduct
or
obstructing
n
as
a
result
young
people
are
intentionally
and
increasingly
diverted
from
the
classroom
to
the
juvenile
and
criminal
justice
systems
n
these
practices
are
particularly
prevalent
in
urban
public
schools
attended
primarily
by
minority
youth
n
a
disparity
that
is
not
explained
by
more
frequent
or
more
serious
misbehavior
by
students
of
color
n
the
upshot
of
these
changes
is
that
schools
are
less
likely
to
handle
disciplinary
matters
internally
n
this
criminalization
of
school
discipline
n
makes
schools
the
first
institution
in
which
most
youth
have
an
opportunity
to
be
marked
as
failures
criminals
or
deviants
n
the
fact
that
schools
increasingly
turn
to
law
enforcement
to
deal
with
misbehavior
reinforces
the
perceived
criminality
of
the
acts
in
the
last
two
decades
legislatures
across
the
country
have
turned
schools
into
mandated
informants
requiring
school
officials
to
report
to
law
enforcement
a
wide
variety
of
behaviors
and
suspected
acts
by
students
at
school
as
a
result
all
sorts
of
behavior
and
suspicions
that
in
the
past
would
have
stayed
on
campus
are
now
shared
with
law
enforcement
n
this
leads
to
more
criminal
justice
contact
for
youth
disruptions
in
their
education
and
negative
outcomes
n
one
main
reason
that
schools
are
now
in
the
collecting
and
reporting
business
is
that
congress
has
incentivized
it
two
major
pieces
of
legislation
do
most
of
the
work
the
improving
america
s
schools
act
of
provided
funds
to
public
schools
that
demonstrated
an
existing
crime
problem
compelling
schools
nationwide
to
develop
data
collection
systems
and
define
crimes
broadly
so
that
they
could
qualify
for
federal
funds
n
many
of
these
funds
were
spent
on
school
police
partnerships
such
as
hiring
security
or
law
enforcement
officers
to
patrol
school
campuses
n
the
mere
presence
of
these
officers
both
facilitates
reporting
and
makes
more
crime
possible
as
refusing
to
follow
the
orders
of
these
school
security
officers
is
a
crime
n
then
in
the
no
child
left
behind
act
required
school
districts
receiving
federal
funds
to
have
a
policy
requiring
that
any
student
who
brings
a
firearm
or
weapon
to
school
be
referred
to
law
enforcement
n
with
federal
money
tied
to
documenting
crime
in
school
and
reporting
it
to
law
enforcement
it
is
no
surprise
that
almost
all
states
require
school
officials
to
report
to
law
enforcement
suspected
violent
crimes
or
incidents
that
involve
deadly
weapons
or
dangerous
instruments
n
other
states
go
much
farther
many
including
california
require
schools
to
report
when
students
use
sell
or
possess
drugs
or
alcohol
n
connecticut
requires
principals
to
notify
law
enforcement
when
the
principal
believes
that
any
acts
of
bullying
constitute
criminal
conduct
n
and
illinois
requires
principals
to
notify
law
enforcement
of
each
incident
of
intimidation
and
each
alleged
incident
of
intimidation
which
is
reported
to
him
or
her
n
kansas
requires
an
immediate
report
to
law
enforcement
by
or
on
behalf
of
any
school
employee
who
knows
or
has
reason
to
believe
that
a
misdemeanor
was
committed
at
school
or
a
school
supervised
activity
n
given
the
funding
incentives
schools
are
likely
to
err
on
the
side
of
reporting
even
when
they
do
not
believe
or
know
that
an
act
constitutes
a
crime
the
failure
of
a
school
employee
to
report
incidents
to
law
enforcement
can
carry
consequences
for
example
it
is
a
class
b
misdemeanor
in
kansas
to
willfully
and
knowingly
fail
to
report
suspected
crimes
to
law
enforcement
n
and
it
is
an
infraction
punishable
by
a
fine
of
up
to
in
california
for
any
employee
of
a
school
district
who
is
attacked
assaulted
or
physically
threatened
by
any
pupil
to
not
promptly
report
the
incident
to
the
appropriate
law
enforcement
authorities
n
schools
are
not
just
sharing
behavioral
information
with
law
enforcement
reports
have
surfaced
of
schools
sharing
records
with
noncriminal
justice
government
agencies
such
as
immigration
enforcement
authorities
n
information
also
flows
from
law
enforcement
to
the
schools
at
least
nineteen
states
now
require
courts
or
law
enforcement
agencies
to
provide
criminal
or
delinquency
information
to
schools
n
c
police
and
court
records
while
gang
databases
and
schools
as
informants
are
relatively
recent
phenomena
criminal
justice
recordkeeping
is
nothing
new
traditional
forms
of
data
collection
include
rap
sheets
intelligence
gathered
by
police
during
street
encounters
and
court
recordkeeping
technology
has
transformed
the
quantity
of
information
that
can
be
gathered
and
the
ability
to
retrieve
that
information
at
will
at
the
same
time
the
criminal
justice
system
has
expanded
the
kind
and
amount
of
information
it
keeps
about
young
people
moreover
juvenile
records
are
increasingly
accessible
to
the
media
employers
schools
government
agencies
victims
and
others
n
policing
data
legislatures
and
law
enforcement
have
a
history
of
restricting
law
enforcement
s
ability
to
create
records
of
juveniles
for
decades
most
states
prohibited
police
or
juvenile
authorities
from
taking
fingerprints
or
photographs
of
juvenile
suspects
unless
taking
them
was
necessary
to
an
investigation
or
was
otherwise
approved
by
a
court
n
such
restrictions
were
an
extension
of
the
efforts
to
protect
the
identities
of
juveniles
and
to
make
their
contact
with
the
police
and
the
court
less
like
that
experienced
by
adult
offenders
n
by
restricting
the
practice
they
sought
to
safeguard
the
child
from
unwarranted
indicia
of
misconduct
becoming
a
part
of
police
and
court
records
and
protect
their
privacy
n
identity
records
of
juveniles
once
created
benefitted
from
enhanced
confidentiality
and
other
protections
compared
to
adult
law
enforcement
records
juvenile
records
kept
by
police
were
typically
held
in
decentralized
local
systems
apart
from
adult
criminal
records
n
this
confined
knowledge
about
a
juvenile
s
prior
contact
with
the
police
to
the
juvenile
s
locality
statutory
confidentiality
combined
with
sealing
and
expungement
provisions
further
ensured
against
any
lasting
effect
of
criminal
records
n
these
practices
continued
well
into
the
late
twentieth
century
as
recently
as
only
a
quarter
of
law
enforcement
agencies
fingerprinted
juveniles
n
today
these
protections
have
faded
juvenile
law
enforcement
records
increasingly
resemble
adult
law
enforcement
records
they
are
more
regularly
created
include
more
information
are
stored
with
adult
records
and
are
more
widely
available
nearly
every
state
allows
juveniles
to
be
fingerprinted
at
arrest
n
all
states
allow
juvenile
arrestees
to
be
photographed
and
nearly
all
send
information
about
juvenile
arrestees
to
statewide
repositories
n
the
fbi
authorizes
the
inclusion
of
juvenile
criminal
history
record
information
in
the
fbi
s
national
crime
information
center
ncic
database
on
the
same
basis
as

records
n
the
supreme
court
has
held
that
the
media
cannot
be
stopped
from
disclosing
a
juvenile
arrestee
s
identity
as
long
as
it
acquired
the
information
lawfully
n
the
impact
of
eroded
protections
for
youth
has
been
multiplied
because
technology
has
enabled
law
enforcement
to
record
store
organize
and
retrieve
more
data
than
ever
a
traditional
method
for
police
to
gather
information
on
individuals
is
the
field
interview
fi
card
known
by
different
names
these
are
forms
filled
out
by
police
officers
after
encounters
with
individuals
n
they
record
pedigree
information
such
as
name
address
and
date
of
birth
and
details
about
the
encounter
n
police
often
complete
fi
cards
after
routine
encounters
done
without
probable
cause
a
great
many
of
which
did
not
end
in
an
arrest
n
the
fi
card
practice
has
been
transformed
by
technology
law
enforcement
staff
used
to
record
and
organize
the
information
by
hand
a
laborious
manual
entry
process
the
information
is
now
aggregated
and
stored
in
computers
making
it
easy
to
search
and
retrieve
software
companies
have
developed
computer
and
smartphone
applications
that
allow
officers
to
complete
fi
cards
using
their
smartphones
n
these
applications
eliminate
the
need
to
manually
enter
information
recorded
by
the
officer
on
the
paper
form
into
a
database
because
both
processes
happen
at
once
this
reduces
the
amount
of
time
required
for
data
entry
enabling
law
enforcement
to
record
more
information
after
more
encounters
n
it
also
makes
retrieval
and
analysis
of
the
information
gathered
much
easier
the
archetypal

record
the

of

and
prosecution

is
a
lifetime
record
of
an
individual

developed
at
the
beginning
of
the
twentieth
century
the
rap
sheet
was
created
by
police
for

use
to
enable

to
link
records
with
people
n
rap
sheets
are
no
longer
just
for

n
moreover
some
police
departments
go
beyond
what
constitutional
and
statutory
law
requires
aggressively
disseminating
arrestee
information

as
a
result
a
system
created
by
police
for
the
police

now
more
often
used
to
provide
criminal
biographies
for
non
criminal
justice
purpose
n
law
enforcement
agencies
across
the
nation
also
maintain
a
variety
of
intelligence
databases
that
store
much
more
than

this
is
significant
because

have
long

inspection
according
to

can

individual

approximately
twenty
state
court

sell
copies
of
their
criminal

vendors
n
the
vast
majority
of
juveniles
charged
with
crimes
have
their
cases
handled
in
a
juvenile
court
instead
of
a
criminal
court
n
consistent
with
the
institution
s
diversionary
aim
to
prevent
children
from
being
treated
as
criminals
n
juvenile
courts
have
offered
more
robust
protections
against
the
creation
of
a
criminal
dossier
at
its
inception
juvenile
court
proceedings
were
held
in
private
before
only
a
judge
and
not
a
jury
by
design
such
proceedings
were
not
criminal
and
resulted
in
something
other
than
a
criminal
conviction
n
most
states
limited
disclosure
of
information
about
juveniles
adjudications
and
required
court
case
files
to
be
automatically
sealed
when
the
juvenile
turned
twenty
one
n
when
judicial
opinions
regarding
delinquency
proceedings
were
issued
they
protected
a
juvenile
s
identity
by
using
the
juvenile
s
initials
instead
of
her
full
name
many
of
these
protective
policies
remain
today
there
still
are
no
juries
n
and
case
opinions
continue
to
mask
the
juvenile
s
identity
delinquency
adjudications
do
not
necessarily
become
part
of
a
young
person
s
permanent
criminal
record
instead
stricter
confidentiality
provisions
protect
against
disclosure
of
juvenile
adjudications
and
juvenile
court
records
typically
can
be
sealed
or
expunged
at
a
particular
age
n
but
as
with
police
records
these
confidentiality
provisions
have
eroded
over
time
juvenile
court
proceedings
today
are
less
likely
to
be
closed
to
the
public
n
juvenile
court
records
are
also
more
broadly
available
as
no
state
completely
protects
juvenile
court
records
from
dissemination
to
certain
entities
outside
the
court
and
law
enforcement
n
only
nine
states
require
a
court
order
before
juvenile
court
records
can
be
released
only
eighteen
states
ensure
that
juvenile
record
information
is
not
available
to
the
public
or
accessible
on
any
online
database
n
in
maine
for
example
anyone
can
obtain
a
person
s
delinquency
adjudications
for
a
thirty
one
dollar
fee
n
juvenile
records
can
be
obtained
in
florida
for
twenty
four
dollars
n
arizona
and
idaho
provide
no
confidentiality
protections
to
juvenile
court
records
n
compounding
the
significance
of
this
confidentiality
erosion
the
supreme
court
has
also
ruled
that
state
laws
cannot
protect
testifying
witnesses
from
impeachment
by
these
juvenile
records
n
while
juvenile
courts
used
to
seal
or
expunge
juvenile
court
records
on
their
own

only
five
states
automatically
expunge

the

party
must
file
a

many
do
not
even

do
initiate

more
than

d
dna
databases
another
controversial
criminal
justice
practice
that
has
similarly
expanded
to
include
juveniles
is
dna
profiling
in
short
it
works
as
follows
a
biological
sample
containing
a
person
s
entire
genetic
code
is
collected
via
buccal
swab
or
blood
draw
n
and
analyzed
by
a
laboratory
to
create
a
dna
profile
n
dna
profiles
are
then
entered
into
one
or
more
government
databases
n
the
combined
dna
information
system
codis
is
a
software
program
that
facilitates
the
matching
of
the
dna
profiles
of
known
offenders
or
arrestees
to
profiles
generated
from
crime
scene
dna
evidence
n
dna
databasing
is
a
powerful
tool
that
makes
it
possible
to
solve
crimes
quickly
and
confidently
including
very
old
crimes
and
can
even
exonerate
the
wrongfully
convicted
n
collection
of
biological
samples
is
accomplished
primarily
through
contact
with
the
criminal
justice
system
the
federal
government
and
all
fifty
states
compel
dna
collection
from
anyone
convicted
of
a
felony
in
criminal
court
n
in
every
state
except
hawaii
this
includes
any
juvenile
convicted
of
any
felony
in
criminal
court
n
all
but
four
states
also
mandate
collection
from
all
persons
convicted
of
certain
misdemeanors
including
juveniles
n
dna
collection
from
juveniles
is
not
limited
to
those
charged
as
adults
twenty
nine
states
compel
dna
samples
from
juveniles
following
a
finding
of
juvenile
delinquency
n
of
those
twenty
nine
states
twenty
collect
dna
for
all
felony
adjudications
while
nine
collecting
only
for
a
subset
of
felony
adjudications
n
nineteen
states
mandate
dna
collection
from
juveniles
adjudicated
delinquent
for
a
misdemeanor
n
neither
a
conviction
nor
a
delinquency
adjudication
is
a
necessary
predicate
for
dna
collection
in
some
states
a
mere
arrest
can
trigger
compulsory
dna
collection
as
of
the
federal
government
and
twenty
seven
states
require
individuals
arrested
but
not
yet
convicted
or
adjudicated
delinquent
to
provide
dna
samples
n
of
the
twenty
seven
nineteen
permit
collection
from
juveniles
at

also
acquires
dna
samples
from
juveniles
based
on
consent
most
notable
in
this
regard
is
orange
county
california
s

collection
and
crime
deterrence
program
known
colloquially
as
the

dismissed

they

reportedly
generated

the
program

not
restrict

harm
gathering

impact
those

are
placed
the

involves
five
components
labeling
stereotyping
separation
status
loss
and
discrimination
n
labeling
is
the
way
differences
are
marked
delinquency
databases
mark
young
people
as
delinquents
sex
offenders
as
perverts
n
school
kids
as
thugs
and
future
criminals
n
and
inner
city
youth
as
gang
bangers
n
stereotypes
are
the
negative
attributes
linked
however
rationally
or
persuasively
to
the
labels
the
negative
label
often
serves
to
separate
them
from
us
research
has
shown
how
delinquent
or
criminal
labels
embed
juveniles
into
deviant
social
groups
through
association
and
exclusion
n
in
some
cases
the
stigmatized
person
is
thought
to
be
so
different
from
us
as
to
be
not
really
human
n
this
has
certainly
happened
with
juvenile
offenders
most
infamously
in
the
mid
s
when
john
diiulio
described
teenaged
offenders
as
severely
morally
impoverished
juvenile
super
predators
n
these
attitudes
have
internal
and
external
effects
having
your
youthful
mistakes
and
wrongs
cataloged
leads
to
an
internal
stigma
that
impacts
life
chances
and
choices
according
to
labeling
theory
stigmatic
labels
are
self
fulfilling
prophecies
when
juveniles
are
identified
as
deviants
or
criminals
they
are
more
likely
to
act
like
criminals
n
delinquency
databasing
communicates
to
the
juveniles
subject
to
it
that
the
state
believes
they
already
committed
crimes
that
data
collection
will
help
solve
and
that
they
will
commit
crimes
in
the
future
n
juveniles
then
internalize
this
label
which
leads
to
marginalization
and
additional
offending
more
recent
research
has
suggested
a
slightly
different
mechanism
for
how
stigmatic
criminal
labels
impact
individuals
and
lead
to
deviance
modified
labeling
theory
posits
that
the
individual
s
desire
to
manage
shame
leads
him
to
follow
strategies
such
as
withdrawal
and
secrecy
which
generate
secondary
deviance
n
sex
offender
registration
and
community
notification
requirements
for
example
cause
sex
offenders
to
isolate
themselves
in
the
community
away
from
support
systems
that
help
prevent
recidivism
n
the
harm
is
magnified
for
juveniles
the
label
of
sex
offender
child
molester
or
sexual
predator
can
cause
profound
damage
to
a
child
s
development
and
self
esteem
n
the
stigma
continues
even
when
a
juvenile
is
no
longer
subject
to
registration
and
law
enforcement
no
longer
publishes
her
information
on
a
website
n
perhaps
it
is
no
surprise
then
that
evidence
indicates
that
sex
offender
registration
actually
raises
the
risk
of
recidivism
amongst
juveniles
n
likewise
including
marginal
youth
in
gang
databases
so
called
wannabes
n
potentially
drives
them
into
gang
membership
because
they
are
being
treated
as
and
known
as
gang
members
n
rather
than
reducing
the
crime
problem
linked
to
gangs
it
exacerbates
it
the
same
effect
appears
when
schools
the
first
social
institution
outside
of
the
family
in
which
most
youth
have
an
opportunity
to
be
marked
as
failures
criminals
or
deviants
n
serve
as
informants
and
share
information
with
law
enforcement
about
misbehavior
at
school
and
at
least
one
international
court
has
recognized
the
risk
of
stigmatization
brought
by
collecting
dna
from
juveniles
n
stigmatic
labels
lead
criminal
justice
actors
and
others
to
stop
seeing
young
people
as
children
and
to
instead
see
and
treat
them
as
criminals
n
this
is
the
external
stigma
of
databasing
delinquency
status
loss
follows
which
is
then
accompanied
by
formal
and
informal
discrimination
n
it
should
not
be
forgotten
that
juveniles
have
less
mobility
than
adults
making
it
more
difficult
for
them
to
escape
from
a
community
in
which
harmful
information
has
cast
them
in
an
unfavorable
light
n
in
short
collecting
information
harms
youth
by
invading
their
privacy
and
imposing
stigma
as
david
ball
has
succinctly
put
it
stigma
is
a
sentence
of
its
own
with
real
impacts
on

lives
n
juveniles
heightened
vulnerability
to
psychological
harm
exacerbates
the
stigmatizing
impact
of
delinquency
databasing
storing
information
distorts
perceptions
of
developing
youth
the
length
of
time
that
the
criminal

system
keeps
the
information
it
collects
in
the
delinquency
databases
imposes
additional
harms
on

as
shown
above
the
duration
of

can
be
indefinite
sex
offender
registration
can
last
a
lifetime
dna
samples
and

are
maintained
indefinitely
and
gang
databases
are
rarely
purged
n
law
enforcement
undoubtedly
retains
the

because
it
believes
that
the
information
remains
valuable
long
after
the
events
recorded
took
place
both
for
its
crime
solving
and
crime
deterring
purposes
adolescence
however
is
a
time
of
change
because
the
signature
qualities
of
youth
are
transient
n
youthful
behavior
does
not
reflect
an
individual
s
true
character
delinquency
is
developmentally
normal
offending
peaks
at
seventeen
to
eighteen
and
quickly
and
steadily
falls
thereafter
n
as
a
result
youthful
offending
is
unlikely
to
be
evidence
of
irretrievably
depraved
character
n
indeed
experts
agree
that
it
is
nearly
impossible
to
predict
which
juvenile
offenders
will
persist
into
adulthood
n
therefore
because
the
vast
majority
of
juveniles
desist
stored
criminal
history
information
has
much
less
value
than
it
does
for
adults
in
addition
juveniles
are
less
deterrable
meaning
that
the
ostensible
crime
preventing
value
of
databasing
delinquency
is
minimal
often
sold
as
tools
of
deterrence
n
little
empirical
data
supports
a
deterrence
justification
for
aggregate
data
collection
n
whatever
deterrence
it
may
provide
is
diminished
if
not
entirely
lost
with
regard
to
juveniles
as
a
group
juveniles
assess
risk
differently
are
more
subject
to
peer
influence
and
discount
the
future
more
than
adults
each
reduces
any
deterrent
effect
derived
from
the
increased
likelihood
of
getting
caught
in
the
future
or
suffering
punishment
created
by
delinquency
databases
n
as
juvenile
law
experts
christopher
slobogin
and
mark
fondacaro
put
it
the
traits
that
mark
adolescence
tend
to
produce
offenders
for
whom
the
deterrent
force
of
the
criminal
law
is
likely
to
be
literally
an
afterthought
n
databasing
delinquency
ignores
these
truths
about

much
more
than
solving

deterring
crime
it
marks
youth
subjected
to
it
as
trouble
as
a

policed
more
heavily
than

are
racially
skewed

are
similarly
filled
with
a
disproportionate

exhibit
racial

n
the

no
different
minority

are
punished
disproportionately
relative
to
their
violations

percentages
of

students
are
more
likely
to
suspend

or
refer

to

officials
for
violating

rules
n
as
a
result
the
negative
labeling
that
results
from
delinquency
databasing
falls
disproportionately
on
youth
of
color
extensive
recordkeeping
then
becomes
evidence
that
minorities
are
more
likely
to
offend
and
their
communities
more
likely
to
be
places
of
crime
thus
generating
continued
heavy
policing

a
greater
likelihood
of
formal
intervention
n
this
feedback
loop

produce
disturbing
results

to
prevent

storing
information
may
increase
recidivism
or
delay
desistance

placing

pool

suspects

the
likelihood

their
suspicion

evidence
suggests
that

with
the
criminal

is
criminogenic

for

such
databasing
delinquency
may
cause
perverse
effects

can
also
lead
people
to
wrongly
interpret
lawful
behavior
as
suspicious
or
criminal
andrew
guthrie
ferguson
has
shown
how
police
access
to
the
kind
of
data
gathered
in
these
databases
makes
it
easier
for
law
enforcement
to
believe
that
probable
cause
exists
to
arrest
an
individual
n
according
to
guthrie
ferguson
if
officers
view
those
individualized
and
particularized
identifying
characteristics
such
as
prior
convictions

associations
and
gps
coordinates
near
the
scene
of
the

otherwise
innocent
actions
might
create
a

composite
that
satisfies
the
reasonable
suspicion
standard
n

of

stops
after
they
were
erroneously
entered
into

n
finally
the
challenges

cannot
be

proclivity

heightens
the

that
the

n
the

problem
could
be
minimized
if

offered
a
procedure
for
youth
to
seek
or
confirm
the
purging
of
their
information
from
a
database

it
rarely
does
as
described

and
philosophy
scholar
anita
allen
has
explained
accountability
for
conduct
is
a
pervasive
feature
of

association
n
accountability
includes
being
accountable
to
individuals

in
the
form
of
providing
information
about
oneself
and
accountable
for
conduct
typically
in
the
form
of
negative
consequences
for

n
criminal
law
and
law
enforcement
are
strong
forms
of
accountability
modern
surveillance
and
the
data
collection
practices
discussed
above
represent
a
technologically
supercharged
form
of
informational
accountability
n
some
amount
of
accountability
is
necessary
to
regulate
childhood

as
future
full
members
of
society
children
must
be
taught
social
norms
and
learn
that
society
imposes
consequences
for
misbehavior
n
no
one
maintains
that
children
not
be
held
to
some
amount
of
accountability
under
the
law
the
characteristics
that
define
youth
however
mean
that
the
quantity
of
accountability
appropriate
during
childhood
is
necessarily
limited
n
and
the
harms

childhood
is
fragile
n
shifts
in
public
mood
can
lead
to
profound
changes
in
the
rights
and
responsibilities
of
young
people
one
such
shift
took
place
in
the
late
s
and
s
when
a
spike
in
violent
crime
by
young
people
triggered
a
moral
panic
about
juvenile
offending
n
events
like
the
central
park
jogger
case
where
five
youth
were
convicted
of
a
beating
and
rape
that
left
a
woman
comatose
a
crime
it
turned
out
that
none
of
the
five
committed
n
and
school
shootings
like
the
one
at
columbine
high
school
n
ignited
the
panic
academics
in
the
popular
press
fueled
the
flame
by
promising
a
coming
generation
of
severely
morally
impoverished
juvenile
super
predators
n
in
the
public
eye
juveniles
ceased
to
be
wayward
youth
in
need
of
help
and
became
hardened
criminals
in
need
of
being
locked
up
n
reforms
throughout
the
criminal
justice
system
led
to
more
juveniles
being
increasingly
treated
like
and
punished
alongside
adults
n
sentences
increased
and
laws
changed
permitting
the
prosecution
of
more
juveniles
in
criminal
court
the
supreme
court
refused
to
extend
or
recognize
special
protections
for
youth
n
confidentiality
waned
as
the
authors
of
a
report
on
juvenile
records
wrote
if
an
individual
wishes
to
be
protected
under
the
law
then
that
individual
must
first
act
within
the
law
when
a
juvenile
chooses
a
lifestyle
of
crime
and
violence
that
individual
should
not
expect
to
have
these
activities
shielded
from
disclosure
to
others
n
juvenile
justice
scholar
franklin
zimring
calls
this
the
forfeiture
theory
where
loss
of
the
protected
status
of
youth
becomes
in
effect
one
penal
consequence
of
the
forbidden
act
n
juveniles
who
break
the
law
are
seen
as
having
forfeited
by
their
conduct
the
protections
typically
afforded
to
youth
n
the
forfeiture
happens
despite
their
remaining
chronologically
developmentally
and
legally
children
as
zimring
observed
there
is
certainly
no
logically
necessary
reason
that
protective
features
of
youth
policy
are
only
for
nice
kids
n
databasing
delinquency
is
a
stout
and
expanding
remnant
of
the
forfeiture
era
it
subjects
juveniles
to
record
practices
and
consequences
akin
to
those
for
adults
including
juveniles
who
have
committed
no
crimes
sex
offender
registration
gang
databases
dna
collection
and
laws
turning
schools
into
informants
all
emerged
after
holistically
they
reflect
a
narrower
conception
of
the
protective
space
of
childhood
than
the
prevailing
notion
and
are
at
odds
with
developmental
science
the
continued
existence
of
juvenile
courts
and
recent
supreme
court
jurisprudence
as
a
result
databasing
delinquency
does
more
than
cause
immediate
and
lasting
harm
to
individual
juveniles
it
reshapes
the
very
meaning
of
childhood
breaching
its
protected
space
and
contradicting
the
special
understandings
that
policymakers
insist
must
dominate
the
regulation
of
youth
the
prevailing
concept
of
childhood
and
the
necessity
and
propriety
of
enhanced
protections
is
grounded
in
part
on
a
notion
of
childhood
as
innocence
n
that
childhood
is
marked
by
innocence
is
certainly
contested
and
undoubtedly
false
especially
with
regard
to
adolescents
despite
their
immaturity
juveniles
are
autonomous
actors
who
have
the
ability
to
recognize
right
from
wrong
and
exercise
such
autonomy
by
choosing
on
occasion
to
do
bad
things
n
indeed
delinquency
appears
to
be
a
normal
part
of
adolescence
n
their
offenses
however
do
not
make
them
adults
yet
the
criminal
justice
system
more
so
than
other
arenas
tends
to
treat
young
people
who
do
not
fit
the
innocent
image
as
outside
of
childhood
and
thus
not
cloaked
by
or
deserving
of
its
protections
in
the
last
decade
however
a
shift
back
to
first
principles
has
been
evident
the
superpredator
era
has
been
replaced
by
the
rebuilding
n
from
the
appropriate
amount
of
punishment
to
the
proper
treatment
by
police
courts
and
legislatures
have
displayed
a
renewed
commitment
to
the
primacy
of
special
protections
for
youth
n
in
the
wake
of
a
sharp
and
steady
decline
in
juvenile
offending
since
n
and
perhaps
in
response
to
the
punitive
extremes
of
s
reforms
courts
and
legislatures
have
made
it
clear
that
the
law
must
take
account
of
the
differences
between
youth
and
adults
n
as
a
result
several
juvenile
justice
policies
grounded
in
the
forfeiture
theory
have
been
rejected
in
recent
years
n
yet
it
is
not
just
the
dubious
forfeiture
theory
that
undergirds
delinquency
databasing
minority
youth
need
not
break
the
rules
before
they
lose
the
protections
of
childhood
n
for
them
by
virtue
of
being
black
or
brown
they
are
perceived
as
more
likely
to
be
criminal
more
culpable
for
the
same
behavior
committed
by
white
youth
and
older
than
their
actual
chronological
age
race
it
seems
overrides
youth
within
the
criminal
justice
apparatus
as
a
result
minority

exit

protective
space
sooner
justifying
their
subjection
to
adult
like
law
enforcement
practices
like
databasing
americans
have
long
associated
blackness
and
criminality
n
the
perceived
link
between
blackness
and
criminality
has
contributed
to
racial
disparities
throughout
criminal
justice
including
skews
in
enforcement
and
punishment
of
black
juveniles
n
one
study
for
example
found
that
african
american
youth
are
disproportionately
arrested
in
twenty
six
of
twenty
nine
offense
categories
overrepresented
in
cases
referred
to
juvenile
court
more
likely
to
be
formally
charged
more
likely
to
be
waived
into
adult
court
and
disproportionately
detained
in
both
juvenile
and
adult
facilities
n
these
enforcement
skews
then
result
in
racial
skews
in
data
collection
as
law
enforcement
is
more
likely
to
collect
and
retain
information
on
minorities
because
it
disproportionately
makes
contact
with
minorities
n
emerging
research
connects
this
racial
perception
and
skew
data
to
the
expanding
surveillance
of
minority
youth
researchers
have
found
that
black
youth
are
seen
as
older
than
their
actual
age
and
more
culpable
for
the
same
behavior
as
white
youth
in
one
study
researchers
tested
police
officers
in
large
urban
areas
mostly
white
males
average
age
thirty
seven
and
mostly
white
female
undergraduate
students
from
large
public
u
s
universities
to
determine
their
levels
of
certain
types
of
bias
n
they
found
that
black
youth
were
more
likely
to
be
mistaken
as
older
than
their
actual
age
by
an
average
of
years
n
the
same
study
found
that
white
undergraduate
female
students
judged
children
up
to
nine
years
old
as
equally
innocent
regardless
of
race
but
considered
black
children
significantly
less
innocent
than
other
children
in
every
age
group
beginning
at
age
ten
n
in
another
study
researchers
had
a
nationally
representative
sample
of
white
americans
participate
in
an
online
study
about
support
for
life
without
parole
sentences
for
juveniles
n
participants
read
a
sample
about
a
recipient
of
the
sentencing
option
a
fourteen
year
old
male
with
seventeen
prior
juvenile
convictions
on
his
record
who
brutally
raped
an
elderly
woman
researchers
manipulated
just
one
word
across
the
two
study
conditions
in
the
description
of
the
example
recipient
of
the
sentencing
option
the
juvenile
was
described
as
either
black
or
white
the
researchers
found
that
in
the
black
prime
condition
participants
perceived
juveniles
as
more
similar
to
adults
in
blameworthiness
than
they
did
in
the
white
prime
condition
n
this
led
participants
in
the
black
prime
condition
to
express
more
support
for
life
without
parole
sentences
for
juveniles
in
non
homicide
cases
than
did
those
in
the
white
prime
condition
n
in
short
when
test
subjects
knew
the
subject
of
a
potential
criminal
justice
sanction
was
black
they
showed
increased
support
for
punitive
policies
n
this
effect
is
occurring
in
schools
as
well
professor
ann
arnett
ferguson
spent
over
three
years
observing
a
racially
mixed
public
intermediate
school
grades
four
to
six
n
she
concluded
that
african
american
boys
are
not
seen
as
childlike
but
adultified
as
naturally
naughty
and
as
willfully
bad
n
their
misbehavior
was
not
seen
as
typical
childishness
but
was
likely
to
be
interpreted
as
symptomatic
of
ominous
criminal
proclivities
n
in
one
example
a
white
teacher
described
african
american
children
who
borrowed
books
from
a
classroom
without
returning
them
as
looters
as
ferguson
put
it
what
might
be
interpreted
as
the
careless
behavior
of
children
is
displaced
by
images
of
adult
acts
of
thefts
that
conjure
up
violence
and
mayhem
n
as
a
result
of
this
adultification
black
male
youth
became
exempted
from
the
dispensations
granted
the
child
and
the
boy
justifying
increased
surveillance
and
harsher
more
punitive
responses
to
rule
breaking
behavior
n
this
research
shows
that
race
profoundly
affects
the
degree
to
which
juveniles
are
afforded
the
established
protection
associated
with
childhood
status
n
this
happens
even
in
the
absence
of
wrongdoing
indeed
race
appears
to
override
youth
when
it
comes
to
support
for
punitive
juvenile
justice
policies
black
youth
are
viewed
as
older
than
their
actual
age
are
associated
with
criminality
and
are
seen
as
responsible
for
their
actions
at
an
age
when
white
youth
remain
protected
by
the
reduced
culpability
conception
of
childhood
as
a
result
law
enforcement
practices
like
the
databasing
described
here
that
treat
youth
of
color
like
adults
flourish
iv
reforms
there
is
ample
evidence
that
policymakers
are
rethinking
the
punitive
adult
like
policies
adopted
in
a
climate
of
fear
and
hostility
toward
juvenile
offenders
in
the
late
twentieth
century
n
this
momentum
toward
first
principles
led
juvenile
justice
scholar
terry
maroney
to
describe
the
current
era
as
the
rebuilding
of
juvenile
justice
n
in
that
spirit
this
part
offers
three
recommendations
to
curbing
delinquency
databasing
that
would
realign
law
enforcement
data
collection
practices
with
current
developmental
research
and
the
prevailing
conception
of
childhood
as
a
separate
protected
space
first
to
account
for
juveniles
unique
vulnerability
to
harms
laws
should
limit
the
amount
of
information
that
law
enforcement
may
collect
about
juveniles
second
because
most
juveniles
do
not
persist
in
offending
but
instead
mature
into
law
abiding
individuals
laws
should
limit
the
length
of
time
that
gathered
information
can
be
retained
third
in
recognition
of
juveniles
future
lives
as
adults
laws
should
restrict
law
enforcement
s
ability
to
share
the
information
it
gathers
and
stores
this
would
have
no
impact
on
law
enforcement
s
mission
and
would
facilitate
access
to
the
employment
higher
education
and
housing
that
is
so
critical
as
youth
transition
to
adulthood
a
limiting
what
information
is
gathered
the
easiest
way
to
limit
the
harms
caused
by
databasing
delinquency
is
to
not
gather
the
information
in
the
first
place
n
it
would
avoid
the
privacy
intrusion
attendant
to
the
gathering
of
information
and
would
prevent
the
additional
punishments
and
stigma
discussed
above
that
ensue
it
would
also
eliminate
the
long
shadow
of
a
young
person
s
mistakes
helping
to
ensure
that
juveniles
enter
adulthood
with
the
greatest
chance
for
a
productive
life
but
law
enforcement
will
not
be
prohibited
from
gathering
information
in
any
foreseeable
future
a
feasible
focus
becomes
limiting
law
enforcement
s
data
collection
abilities
deciding
how
much
to
limit
it
depends
in
part
on
the
role
of
law
enforcement
with
respect
to
juveniles
if
the
police
play
a
role
similar
to
that
of
a
general
welfare
agency
then
all
data
is
potentially
pertinent
and
the
limitations
proposed
here
will
not
come
to
be
n
but
if
law
enforcement
s
mission
is
limited
to
crime
solving
and
suppression
then
much
of
the
information
about
a
young
person
gathered
in
the
delinquency
databases
loses
its
value
to
law
enforcement
instead
a
narrower
universe
of
data
collection
is
justified
this
is
especially
so
for
data
collection
that
occurs
before
a
young
person
has
become
the
target
of
a
criminal
investigation
it
seems
safe
to
say
that
the
police
are
not
child
welfare
officials
n
and
therefore
every
last
bit
of
information
about
young
people
is
not
of
police
concern
gathering
data
about
the
friends
and
associations
of
juveniles
or
logging
reports
from
schools
of
bullying
especially
in
the
absence
of
a
criminal
investigation
that
would
make
the
information
relevant
is
thus
difficult
to
justify
on
the
other
hand
it
is
difficult
to
cull
the
information
that
has
or
might
have
intelligence
value
to
law
enforcement
from
that
which
does
not
n
indeed
the
belief
that
it
is
better
to
have
information
and
not
need
it
than
to
need
it
and
not
have
it
and
the
lure
of
complete
collection
has
proven
irresistible
to
the
government
n
one
guiding
principle
could
be
that
law
enforcement
may
only
collect
information
relevant
to
an
individual
s
identity
or
to
a
specific
investigation
restrictions
on
law
enforcement
s
ability
to
gather
information
are
not
impossible
the
fourth
and
fifth
amendments
stand
as
foundational
hurdles
to
unrestricted
government
data
collection
n
and
states
still
maintain
protective
rules
for
children
with
regard
to
police
identity
records
take
fingerprints
as
an
example
while
some
states
such
as
alaska
make
no
distinctions
between
juvenile
and
adult
fingerprinting
many
others
maintain
distinct
rules
limiting
fingerprinting
of

by

thereof

limited
the
content
of

policy

differently

opportunity
of
rehabilitation
and
re
integration
the
federal
requirement
that

be
placed
on
the
sex

registry
under

is
in
direct
conflict
with
that
public
policy
n
out
of
similar
concerns
the
state
of
washington
abolished
child
sex
offender
registration
completely
n
courts
have
also
found
juvenile

offender
registration
unconstitutional
because
it
frustrates
two
of
the
fundamental
elements
of

rehabilitation
confidentiality
and
the
avoidance
of

some

in

of
increased
crime
for
that
reason
the
best
chances
to
minimize
the
harms
caused
by
dataveillance
rest
in
restricting
the
storage
and
dissemination
of
criminal
information
about
youth
b
limiting
what
information
is
stored
youth
change
while
many
participate
in
some
form
of
delinquency
during
adolescence
most
desist
as
they
mature
into
adulthood
n
this
is
because
many
of
the
factors
associated
with
antisocial
risky
or
criminal
behavior
lose
their
intensity
as
individuals
become
more
developmentally
mature
n
that
youth
change
means
that
particularly
in
the
case
of
the
juvenile
yesterday
s
record
does
not
accurately
describe
today
s
individual
n
in
recognition
of
this
truth
limits
on
the
length
of
time
that
law
enforcement
can
retain
records
about
juveniles
should
be
imposed
these
limits
would
enable
law
enforcement
to
keep
information
during
peak
offending
years
while
also
protecting
young
people
from
the
long
shadow
of
youthful
mistakes
numerous
proposals
have
sought
to
limit
the
length
of
time
that
law
enforcement
can
retain
records
about
juveniles
before
the
dawn
of
computerized
dataveillance
the
aba
issued
a
report
entitled
standards
relating
to
juvenile
records
and
information
systems
n
in
it
the
aba
recommended
that
juvenile
police
and
court
records
be
destroyed
if
a
juvenile
who
is
arrested
or
detained
is
not
referred
to
a
court
n
the
report
emphasized
that
unless
the
juvenile
s
police
record
is
also
destroyed
when
the
court
record
is
destroyed
the
destruction
of
the
court
record
alone
would
become
a
relatively
meaningless
reform
n
in
a
foreshadowing
of
what
has
become
the
report
acknowledged
that
the
increasing
use
of
computers
to
disseminate
arrest
records
magnifies
the
risks
created
by
the
existence
of
arrest
records
n
the
juvenile
crime
wave
of
the
s
and
early
s
and
the
punitive
reforms
that
followed
meant
the
aba
s
proposal
was
not
heeded
similar
reform
proposals
are
now
making
headway
as
policymakers
have
begun
to
reimpose
limitations
on
how
long
juvenile
records
may
be
maintained
in
washington
state
passed
a
law
allowing
for
most
juvenile
records
to
be
automatically
sealed
when
the
youth
turns
eighteen
n
in
explaining
the
bill
representative
ruth
kagi
said
that
up
until
today
youth
in
washington
had
their
mistakes
follow
them
forever
the
sealing
of
juvenile
records
will
give
youth
the
chance
to
get
an
education
a
job
housing
and
a
productive
life
n
senators
rand
paul
and
cory
booker
proposed
a
similar
bill
at
the
federal
level
in
their
redeem
act
would
automatically
seal
juvenile
criminal
records
for
nonviolent
offenses
n
the
movement
toward
protective
juvenile
record
policies
is
not
limited
to
the
united
states
in
recent
commentary
on
the
european
rules
for
juvenile
offenders
the
council
of
europe
advised
that
sanctions
and
measures
imposed
on
juvenile
offenders
should
not
be
held
against
them
for
the
rest
of
their
lives
records
of
the
offences
of
juveniles
should
not
be
kept
for
longer
than
absolutely
necessary
n
just
how
long
is
necessary
would
undoubtedly
be
subject
to
great
debate
empirics
on
juvenile
offending
help
to
identify
an
appropriate
target
expunging
police
and
court
records
could
be
triggered
when
juveniles
hit
a
particular
age
such
as
eighteen
or
twenty
one
this
would
accord
with
offending
data
which
shows
that
offending
peaks
at
seventeen
and
then
sharply
and
steadily
decreases
n
as
a
result
the
intelligence
value
to
law
enforcement
of
all
that
the
delinquency
databases
contain
drops
off
just
as
sharply
and
steadily
into
the
future
since
it
is
increasingly
unlikely
to
be
actionable
information
there
is
less
justification
for
continuing
to
store
it
the
value
of
the
information
about
friends
and
associations
such
as
that
which
fills
gang
databases
diminishes
even
more
sharply
with
time
as
social
groups
and
activity
change
that
databasing
causes
such
extensive
harms
not
just
from
the
mere
gathering
of
the
information
but
also
from
the
retention
of
erroneous
information
and
the
broad
sharing
of
information
increases
the
need
for
limiting
its
storage
alternatively
records
could
be
expunged
when
a
juvenile
avoids
a
conviction
or
adjudication
for
a
certain
period
of
time
this
would
be
expungement
earned
not
by
simply
growing
old
but
by
behavior
data
about
desistance
would
support
such
an
approach
researchers
have
found
that
individuals
with
a
prior
criminal
justice
contact
who
stay
arrest
free
for
seven
years
or
more
pose
very
little
risk
of
future
crime
n
moreover
that
low
risk
converges
with
the
risk
of
a
same
aged
individual
from
the
general
population
at
around
seven
years
after
contact
and
approaches
though
never
equals
that
of
same
aged
individuals
with
a
clean
criminal
record
n
therefore
for
juveniles
who
avoid
arrests
and
conviction
there
would
be
little
risk
to
public
safety
of
destroying
their
old
records
the
upside
would
be
reduced
stigma
and
fewer
barriers
to
housing
education
and
employment
n
indeed
record
sealing
or
destruction
mechanisms
are
already
in
place
all
states
enable
the
destruction
expunging
or
sealing
of
some
juvenile
records
n
new
york
for
example
requires
fingerprint
records
to
be
destroyed
when
a
person
adjudicated
delinquent
reaches
the
age
of
twenty
one
or
has
been
discharged
from
placement
for
at
least
three
years
and
has
no
intervening
criminal
convictions
or
pending
criminal
actions
n
there
are
even
protections
in
some
states
for
juveniles
charged
in
criminal
court
under
youthful
offender
statutes
accusatory
instruments
can
be
sealed
and
records
that
would
otherwise
be
public
kept
confidential
n
the
software
that
enables
the
delinquency
databases
could
easily
accomplish
automatic
record
deletion
all
that
it
would
seemingly
require
would
be
an
allocation
of
resources
from
the
government
to
develop
programs
that
could
identify
records
due
for
sealing
or
destruction
and
accomplish
the
sealing
or
destruction
c
limiting
what
information
is
shared
as
described
above
many
are
able
to
access
the
information
in
the
delinquency
databases
law
enforcement
noncriminal
justice
government
agencies
courts
schools
employers
the
media
and
the
general
public
all
have
some
form
of
access
to
court
records
police
records
and
sex
offender
information
law
enforcement
noncriminal
justice
government
agencies
and
courts
each
have
access
to
behavior
information
about
youth
at
school
schools
and
employers
are
privy
to
information
stored
in
gang
databases
according
to
leading
criminal
records
scholar
jacobs
the
united
states
which
invented
a
juvenile
court
committed
to
confidentiality
now
is
exceptional
for
the
amount
of
juvenile
offender
information
that
is
disclosed
to
diverse
government
agencies
and
the
public
n
once
the
information
gets
beyond
law
enforcement
and
into
the
hands
of
employers
school
officials
and
landlords
the
harmful
impacts
are
felt
immediately
moreover
once
the
information
gets
beyond
law
enforcement
it
is
almost
impossible
to
make
it
go
away
or
control
the
havoc
it
wreaks
n
as
a
result
its
impact
is
lasting
this
liberal
policy
regarding
disclosure
is
in
part
linked
to
the
american
commitment
to
open
government
and
the
freedom
of
the
press
and
it
is
also
a
result
of
the
gradual
shift
of
law
enforcement
records
from
a
system
created
by
police
for
police
to
one
used
heavily
by
noncriminal
justice
actors
like
employers
and
schools
distributing
the
information
is
particularly
harmful
because
of
its
devastating
impacts
on
an
individual
s
ability
to
secure
employment
housing
and
school
that
accompany
sharing
criminal
history
n
not
only
does
criminal
history
information
sharing
frustrate
the
ability
of
young
people
and
adults
with
a
youthful
criminal
record
to
earn
a
living
educate
themselves
and
find
a
place
to
live
all
of
these
factors
are
linked
to
desistance
n
instead
of
punishing
youth
far
into
the
future
the
law
should
cabin
the
information
that
is
gathered
and
stored
by
law
enforcement
to
law
enforcement
as
much
as
possible
this
is
especially
true
for
intelligence
information
like
that
gathered
in
gang
databases
and
nonconviction
records
like
those
for
arrests
noncriminal
justice
actors
like
employers
are
likely
to
believe
that
an
arrest
reflects
a
guilty
act
when
upwards
of
fifty
percent
of
arrests
are
not
followed
by
a
conviction
n
moreover
the
presumption
of
innocence
that
bedrock
axiomatic
and
elementary
principle
whose
enforcement
lies
at
the
foundation
of
the
administration
of
our
criminal
law
n
demands
that
the
criminal
justice
system
only
share
police
record
information
when
it
reflects
certainty
that
the
act
was
committed
a
number
of
reforms
limiting
the
sharing
of
law
enforcement
records
have
recently
been
put
in
place
as
discussed
above
jurisdictions
are
limiting
the
extent
to
which
juveniles
are
subject
to
sex
offender
registration
and
federal
guidelines
do
not
require
that
juveniles
be
subject
to
community
notification
procedures
n
there
is
a
nationwide
movement
to
restrict
what
criminal
history
information
employers
can
access
n
colleges
are
beginning
to
add
nuance
to
their
use
of
criminal
history
information
in
admissions
instead
of
using
it
as
a
blunt
sorting
tool
n
public
schools
have
also
been
seeking
ways
to
minimize
law
enforcement
involvement
in
school
matters
n
as
these
efforts
demonstrate
limiting
what
criminal
history
information
gets
shared
beyond
law
enforcement
is
probably
the
most
attainable
reform
proposal
it
is
also
arguably
the
most
important
cabining
the
information
to
law
enforcement
reduces
the
negative
impact
the
criminal
justice
biography
may
have
while
they
are
still
subject
to
privacy
invasions
and
stigma
harms
and
law
enforcement
is
more
likely
to
police
them
and
their
communities
each
no
small
consequence
law
enforcement
does
not
hire
them
for
jobs
accept
them
to
colleges
or
act
as
their
landlord
without
access
to
the
information
employers
colleges
and
landlords
will
not
be
able
to
so
easily
discriminate
against
individuals
based
on
criminal
history
conclusion
because
adolescents
are
vulnerable
because
they
change
and
because
they
are
future
adults
we
must
strive
for
a
constellation
of
practices
that
protect
them
from
harm
and
promote
their
positive
development
the
criminal
justice
system
is
a
critical
part
of
that
constellation
with
renewed
vigor
courts
legislatures
and
policymakers
today
are
correcting
the
missteps
of
the
s
that
favored
treating
juveniles
like
adults
in
the
criminal
justice
system
by
reinstating
the
primacy
of
special
protections
for
youth
databasing
delinquency
a
broad
data
collection
retention
and
distribution
system
that
treats
juveniles
on
par
with
adults
reveals
that
two
pernicious
distortions
continue
to
inform
this
aspect
of
juvenile
justice
policy
first
youth
who
break
the
rules
are
seen
as
having
forfeited
the
protections
of
childhood
second
childhood
status
is
particularly
fragile
for
minority
youth
who
age
out
of
childhood
s
protective
space
sooner
than
white
youth
as
a
result
many
youth
are
saddled
with
a
record
of
mistakes
and
suspicions
that
haunt
them
into
adulthood
the
unwillingness
to
forgive
and
forget
youthful
mistakes
embedded
in
databasing
delinquency
ignores
the
fundamental
nature
of
adolescence
rather
than
pursuing
adult
like
surveillance
practices
in
the
name
of
public
safety
that
inflict
debilitating
short
and
long
term
harms
the
developmental
characteristics
of
youth
and
the
purpose
and
meaning
of
childhood
must
guide
juvenile
justice
policy
to
that
end
we
must
avoid
practices
that
unduly
stigmatize
that
permanently
punish
and
that
promote
or
entrench
criminal
behavior
by
limiting
the
information
that
the
criminal
justice
system
gathers
stores
and
shares
about
juveniles
we
can
avoid
those
harms
without
frustrating
public
safety

text
introduction
as
militaries
transition
from
a
war
footing
to
a
postwar
posture
they
inevitably
shed
excess
equipment
and
technology
that
is
outdated
no
longer
needed
or
too
expensive
to
maintain
in
the
drawdown
from
the
wars
in
iraq
and
afghanistan
the
u
s
military
found
willing
recipients
of
this
material
in
local
and
state
police
departments
in
addition
to
these
technology
transfers
local
police
departments
have
increasingly
adopted
military
tactics
techniques
and
procedures
ttps
originally
conceived
and
designed
for
military
units
in
combat
operations
for
use
in
their
day
to
day
policing
this
combination
has
led
to
the
overall
militarization
of
civilian
police
forces
in
the
united
states
putting
wartime
tools
in
the
hands
of
peace
officers
this
trend
toward
police
militarization
has
found
enthusiastic
support
from
departments
adhering
to
the
broken
windows
theory
of
policing
especially
with
respect
to
technologies
and
ttps
meant
for
intelligence
analysis
or
surveillance
purposes
the
locus
of
this
relationship
can
be
found
in
the
information
centric
approaches
found
in
broken
windows
policing
and
other
zero
tolerance
quality
of
life
police
programs
since
military
intelligence
has
long
prized
information
centric
methods
as
critical
to
the
goal
of
actionable
intelligence
militarized
systems
and
approaches
appear
to
be
a
perfect
fit
to
modern
policing
this
phenomenon
may
be
seen
as
the
natural
result
of
the
industrial
and
post
industrial
society
s
desire
to
maximize
control
and
efficiency
across
all
spheres
of
life
through
careful
observation
and
data
analysis
while
advances
in
policing
techniques
have
garnered
many
societal
benefits
they
have
also
established
a
system
of
structural
surveillance
that
has
entered
a
renaissance
with
the
help
of
military
technologies
automated
surveillance
analysis
systems
developed
in
the
wake
of
have
given
police
departments
a
powerful
toolkit
to
advance
algorithmic
policing
strategies
but
these
algorithmic
approaches
too
often
target
poor
and
minority
communities
inserting
a
de
facto
racial
component
into
the
system
even
when
the
automated
intelligence
systems
are
fed
objective
crime
data
for
example
in
a
recent
investigation
of
software
used
by
state
and
local
criminal
justice
authorities
to
predict
the
risk
of
recidivism
of
those
booked
into
city
and
county
jails
researchers
found
that
these
algorithms
were
not
only
wildly
inaccurate
in
their
assessments
but
were
also
highly
likely
to
falsely
flag
black
defendants
as
future
criminals
n
algorithmic
scoring
mechanisms
like
this
are
becoming
increasingly
common
tools
for
criminal
courts
and
law
enforcement
which
are
seeking
an
information
based
advantage
in
the
control
of
criminal
activity
these
programs
have
become
so
popular
in
fact
that
congress
is
considering
mandating
their
use
in
federal
prisons

this
article
examines
how
military
automated

systems
when
used
by

departments
to

policing
programs

the

i
the
militarization
of
police
intelligence
operations
the
militarization
of
civilian
law
enforcement
agencies
leas
has
long
been
viewed
as
anathema
to
the
founding
principles
of
the
united
states
and
corrosive
to
civil
liberties
in
a
constitutional
democracy
generally
n
paradoxically
contemporary
american
society
has
increasingly
taken
a
distinctly
militaristic
approach
to
solving
its
non
military
political
social
and
economic
issues
applying
war
metaphors
to
programs
and
policies
to
emphasize
the
seriousness
of
the
problem
and
the
approach
to
it
for
example
the
war
on
drugs
or
the
war
on
poverty
n
these
mixed
signals
have
been
the
backdrop
to
a
steady
increase
in
the
militarization
of
u
s
civilian
police
forces
post
world
war
ii
with
racial
tensions
broken
windows
policing
the
war
on
drugs
and
the
global
war
on
terror
acting
as
the
primary
catalysts
of
this
phenomenon
n
the
most
visible
aspect
of
police
militarization
can
be
seen
in
the
increased
deployment
within
leas
of
weapons
equipment
and
training
designed
for
use
in
combat
by
militaries
n
while
these
manifestations
might
be
the
most
outwardly
obvious
signs
of
this
militarization
trend
there
is
a
more
basic
facet
of
it
that
leas
have
almost
universally
adopted
intelligence
operations
n
a
military
intelligence
and
the
development
of
the
ooda
loop
the
importance
of
intelligence
operations
to
the
military
is
a
long
accepted
principle
since
as
often
quite
large
and
widely
distributed
organizations
militaries
are
expected
to
think
and
act
as
if
they
were
a
unitary
being
n
the
pace
environment
and
sheer
horror
of
combat
combine
to
create
a
state
of
near
chaos
the
realm
of
uncertainty
through
which
militaries
are
forced
to
navigate
n
to
mitigate
at
least
some
of
the
disorienting
effects
of
warfare
modern
militaries
must
organize
themselves
around
rational
bureaucratic
principles
with
robust
networks
of
communication
and
information
management
at
their
core
n
military
command
structures
simply
cannot
function
without
the
timely
communication
of
information
on
a
wide
range
of
broad
and
narrow
topics
including
terrain
troop
strength
and
movements
civilian
considerations
transportation
networks
availability
of
supplies
enemy
disposition
and
morale
weather
and
light
conditions
and
more
all
in
support
of
the
theory
that
the
better
prepared
and
informed
army
has
the
advantage
n
this
general
concept
is
often
referred
to
as
military
intelligence
or
more
succinctly
intelligence
n
the
term
intelligence
is
not
well
defined
however
as
it
draws
from
a
wide
array
of
broader
issues
such
as
strategy
command
and
control
and
communications
n
it
is
clearly
more
than
an
exhaustive
cataloging
of
all
available
information
even
if
this
were
possible
such
a
tool
would
quickly
prove
useless
to
militaries
as
their
organizations
became
mired
in
irrelevant
information
and
would
be
forced
to
spend
valuable
time
and
resources
ferreting
out
the
useful
bits
n
intelligence
therefore
must
produce
information
in
a
form
and
quantity
that
can
be
used
by
the
organization
to
make
timely
decisions
regarding
plans
and
operations
this
characteristic
is
often
summarized
as
actionable
intelligence
n
the
goal
of
perfectly
actionable
intelligence
is
often
unattainable
however
and
is
best
thought
of
in
aspirational
terms
n
the
industrialization
of
the
th
th
and
th
centuries
yielded
paradigmatic
advances
in
the
technology
and
subsequently
the
conduct
of
warfare
which
in
turn
brought
with
it
the
critical
need
for
more
rapidly
made
decisions
based
on
fresher
more
accurate
and
more
detailed
intelligence
n
the
united
states
military
experience
in
vietnam
illustrated
just
how
crucial
intelligence
and
communications
had
become
in
modern
warfare
where
larger
better
equipped
forces
were
often
outmatched
by
much
smaller
yet
better
informed
groups
of
guerrillas
and
regular
army
soldiers
n
the
post
vietnam
collapse
of
the
u
s
military
sent
shock
waves
through
the
pentagon
whose
leadership
began
the
arduous
process
of
rebuilding
a
communications
and
intelligence
centric
army
capable
of

his
highly
analytical
approach
to
solving
military
problems
began
development
of
a
general
theory
of
military
organizational
analysis
and

he
sought
to
address
the
challenge

moving
conflict

as
a
veteran
of

combat
flying

during

war
boyd
knew
well
the
challenge
for
fighter
pilots
of
gathering
processing
and
acting
on
information
in
a
very
short
amount
of
time

of
the
great
modern
military
theorists
such
as
clausewitz
and
j
f
c
fuller
but
also
of
philosophers
mathematicians
and
physicists
including
kurt
godel
and
werner
heisenberg
actively
sought
out
symmetries
and
commonalities
in
his
analyses
in
an
attempt
to
get
at
the
true
root
of
the
problem
at
hand
n
his
multidisciplinary
approach
allowed
him
to
extrapolate
common
principles
from
his
experiences
and
in
he
authored
the
first
of
five
essays
on
the
cognitive
psychological
and
temporal
processes
core
to
all
military
intelligence
analysis
and
decision
making
processes
from
the
highest
command
levels
to
the
lowest
n
boyd
s
described
his
groundbreaking
theory
as
a
cognitive
cycle
containing
four
tasks
observation
orientation
decision
and
action
ooda
see
figure
n
these
actions
worked
together
to
create
a
feedback
loop
that
gave
those
who
were
more
adept
at
accelerating
this
loop
a
tactical
advantage
over
their
less
nimble
adversaries
as
applied
to
boyd

initial
use
of

figure
the
ooda
loop
through
informed
use
of
the
boyd
cycle
more
often
referred
to
as
the
ooda
loop
one
could
not
only
gain
a
strategic
or
tactical
advantage
over
one
s
enemy
but
in
turn
disrupt
the
enemy
s
own
ooda
loop
by
denying
them
the
ability
to
run
through
its
stages
due
to
the
speed
at
which
you
are
able
to
run
through
your
own
n
the
goal
for
any
military
organization
according
to
boyd
is
to
increase
the
speed
at
which
it
can
navigate
this
cycle
or
to
tighten
the
ooda
loop
n
therefore
the
army
that
can
affect
the
tightest
ooda
loop
is
able
to
get
inside
their
opponent
s
cycle
and
thus
disrupt
their
ability
to
gather
process
and
act
on
intelligence
n
the
ooda
loop
as
boyd
observed
characterized
the
process
all
living
things
go
through
as
part
of
their
everyday
survival
n
learning
and
adapting
are
what
successful
individuals
and
groups
accomplish
faster
than
their
less
lucky
competitors
boyd
s
great
contribution
was
distilling
this
naturally
occurring
process
into
a
form
which
could
be
analyzed
and
implemented
by
military
strategists
and
tacticians
boyd
continued
to
develop
this
concept
through
the
mid
s
and
continued
to
present
his
theories
to
large
military
and
civilian
audiences
well
into
his
retirement
n
boyd
s
theories
enjoyed
moderate
success
among
contemporary
military
leadership
at
the
time
mainly
among
theorists
and
scholars
but
in
the
early
s
his
ideas
were
rediscovered
and
found
a
heightened
relevance
among
a
new
generation
of
warriors
joining
a
high
tech
military
in
a
post
world
n
this
renewed
popularity
soared
even
further
when
nonmilitary
and
quasi
military
organizations
seeking
a
competitive
advantage
over
crime
through
information
centric
efficiency
universally
accepted
as
the
path
to
success
since
the
earliest
days
of
industrialization
increasingly
turned
to
military
organizational
theories
and
doctrines
for
inspiration
n
b
the
audit
society
and
the
allure
of
information
management
while
boyd
s
ooda
loop
theories
were
revolutionary
in
their
military
context
their
foundations
began
to
form
nearly
two
centuries
earlier
with
the
emergence
of
industrialization
and
the
associated
growth
of
information
centric
organizational
theory
n
the
rise
of
bureaucracy
as
an
efficient
means
of
organizing
at
scales
unnecessary
in
agrarian
society
brought
with
it
a
strong
inclination
toward
surveillance
information
processing
and
data
based
planning
as
a
means
of
constant
management
and
improvement
a
school
of
thought
both
inspired
and
followed
by
military
organizational
theory
n
weber
s
theory
of
legitimate
order
and
authority
within
a
bureaucratic
structure
with
its
duties
without
regard
to
personal
considerations
and
an
obligation
to
obedience
provided
the
sort
of
military
based
organizational
socialization
needed
albeit
with
some
allowance
of
modification
for
less
martial
pursuits
for
the
management
of
such
modern
concepts
as
large
scale
factories
prisons
hospitals
and
law
enforcement
n
militaries
of
the
th
and
th
centuries
were
quick
to
adopt
these
organizational
innovations
which
fit
well
with
their
existing
hierarchical
frameworks
and
provided
the
tools
to
realize
a
modern
form
of
military
intelligence
and
personnel
management
which
contemporary
organizational
models
would
not
support
n
all
of
these
advances
were
necessary
to
support
and
maintain
large
armies
but
military
intelligence
was
perhaps
the
biggest
beneficiary
of
these
innovations
the
increasing
amounts
of
information
necessary
to
make
military
or
in
fact
any
state
decisions
in
a
rapidly
modernizing
world
highlighted
the
importance
of
bureaucracy
as
an
essential
tool
in
dealing
with
the
modern
crisis
of
control
n
but
even
with
the
benefit
of
a
modern
bureaucracy
some
of
which
already
existed
within
military
organizations
an
army
s
ability
to
process
intelligence
information
had
been
quite
limited
by
existing
technologies
n
this
limitation
of
a
military
organization
s
ability
to
make
informed
decisions
based
on
coded
intelligence
information
was
directly
dependent
upon
its
ability
to
communicate
store
and
process
that
information
described
in
weber
s
concept
of
rationalization
n
the
promise
of
increasingly
detailed
intelligence
pictures
improved
situational
awareness
generated
by
a
combination
of
the
improved
organizational
methods
of
weberian
bureaucracy
and
the
advances
in
communication
transportation
and
information
processing
technologies
of
industrialization
began
to
move
military
thinking
toward
an
information
centric
style
of
warfare
n
this
quest
for
more
information
better
data
processing
tools
and
improved
communication
methods
has
become
paradigmatic
of
modern
and
post
modern
society
n
this
control
revolution
as
beniger
puts
it
has
grown
to
permeate
every
area
of
society
where
efficiency
is
sought
bringing
with
it
a
need
to
develop
metrics
for
program
effectiveness
n
the
concept
of
civilian
police
agencies
is
driven
primarily
by
as
the
realization
of
a
society
s
social
control
function
and
as
such
makes
them
prime
candidates
for
the
information
centric
style
of
organization
and
leadership
n
the
quasi
military
structure
most
police
departments
now
adhere
to
can
be
found
in
the
organization
of
sir
robert
peel
s
london
metropolitan
police
in
credited
as
the
first
modern
civilian
law
enforcement
organization
n
the
rapid
industrialization
of
europe
and
the
united
states
in
the
first
half
of
the
th
century
brought
with
it
a
sudden
increase
in
the
population
much
of
it
concentrated
in
urban
areas
n
this
caused
no
small
amount
of
concern
among
the
upper
classes
who
feared
disease
petty
crime
property
damage
and
political
insurrections
just
to
name
a
few
of
the
phobias
the
ruling
elite
held
regarding
the
dangerous
classes
n
peel
as
chief
secretary
for
ireland
introduced
legislation
creating
paramilitary
forces
to
suppress
catholic
and
nationalist
disturbances
peel
applied
the
methods
he
had
refined
in
ireland
to
london
and
continued
the
use
of
the
military
organization
as
a
model
for
civilian
law
enforcement
n
in
addition
peel
recognized
that
former
members
of
the
military
made
excellent
candidates
for
the
role
of
civilian
police
officer
since
they
would
arrive
on
the
job
pre
acclimated
to
a
quasi
military
environment
and
would
have
an
instinctive
preference
for
hierarchy
discipline
and
order
n
these
somewhat
practical
decisions
cannot
however
be
separated
entirely
from
the
growth
of
information
centric
organization
theory
political
economics
and
surveillance
technologies
which
were
interlaced
with
much
of
the
social
political
and
economic
activity
of
industrialization
and
modernity
in
the
period
from
the
mid
th
through
the
mid
th
centuries
as
industrialization
in
western
nations
began
to
create
increasingly
complex
systems
of
interdependencies
between
manufacturing
capital
energy
production
labor
and
markets
new
means
of
communication
and
control
were
required
to
take
full
advantage
of
new
economies
of
scale
and
realize
productivity
levels
unheard
of
under
earlier
forms
of
management
and
organization
n
as
giddens
points
out
advances
in
the
information
management
enabled
organizations
to
form
more
effective
bureaucratic
structures
and
gave
these
budding
bureaucracies
more
control
over
the
timing
and
spacing
of
human
activities
n
these
advances
joined
with
the
modern
bureaucracy
s
growing
appetite
for
information
ultimately
led
to
the
surveillant
assemblage
as
integrated
into
our
contemporary
concept
of
governance
n
in
the
mid
s
a
movement
among
military
theorists
began
to
develop
around
the
concept
of
exploiting
a
technological
and
communications
advantage
to
create
a
new
kind
of
army
where
every
soldier
and
piece
of
material
was
equipped
with
sensors
that
would
allow
direct
communication
of
information
at
the
lowest
organizational
levels
but
would
also
pass
this
information
up
the
chain
of
command
to
give
military
leaders
a
god
s
eye
view
of
the
battle
space
allowing
for
even
tighter
ooda
loops
n
this
concept
generally
known
as
network
centric
warfare
envisioned
the
sort
of
information
driven
military
hitherto
impossible
now
enabled
by
smaller
faster
and
cheaper
technology
that
was
starting
to
drive
american
businesses
and
especially
advances
in
networking
and
communications
n
military
strategists
picked
up
on
the
new
style
of
bottom
up
management
enabled
through
these
technological
advances
where
information
gathered
from
the
very
edges
of
an
organization
and
passed
to
leadership
in
near
real
time
could
allow
leaders
of
even
the
largest
businesses
to
view
analyze
and
make
decisions
about
detailed
data
actionable
intelligence
that
weber
bentham
mill
and
their
contemporaries
could
only
dream
of
n
following
this
model
an
information
and
network
centric
military
could
be
more
agile
and
aware
than
its
adversaries
thus
allowing
fewer
troops
to
cover
much
wider
geographic
areas
with
less
equipment
and
with
dynamic
ad
hoc
supply
chains
that
could
place
material
in
the
right
place
at
the
right
time
a
philosophy
at
the
center
of
secretary
of
defense
donald
rumsfeld
s
wholesale
force
transformation
program
of
the
early
and
mid
s
n
the
bush
administration
s
focus
on
transforming
the
military
through
a
network
centric
shift
from
platforms
to
networks

viewed
with
skepticism
by
rank
and
file

was
enthusiastically
accepted
by
the
u

military
s
civilian
and
political
leadership
and
opened
up
a
wide
array
of
new
business
opportunities
for
contractors
willing
to
help
implement
this
vision

of
these

superior

that
were
the
legacy

funding
streams
for

who
had

looking

leas
n
like
the
military
of
the
mid
s
police
departments
had
also
discovered
the
promise
of
network
centricity
a
concept
that
fit
well
within
the
quasi
military
organizational
structures
found
in
most
police
organizations
n
beginning
in
the
mid
s
police
departments
especially
those
in
larger
u
s
cities
began
to
feel
political
pressure
to
address
what
was
widely
seen
as
a
crime
epidemic
and
the
downward
spiral
of
urban
decay
that
accompanied
a
post
industrial
economic
slowdown
n
the
standard
tactics
built
around
the
police
patrol
car
did
not
seem
to
be
having
any
real
success
in
reducing
the
crime
rate
and
leas
were
looking
for
alternatives
n
in
the
atlantic
monthly
published
an
article
written
by
two
social
scientists
who
after
studying
the
tactics
of
police
departments
concluded
that
disorder
and
crime
are
inextricably
linked
and
therefore
by
addressing
the
petty
crimes
associated
with
community
disorder
such
as
loitering
vandalism
and
public
intoxication
humble
crimes
that
were
generally
considered
unworthy
of
police
attention
leas
will
in
turn
prevent
the
more
serious
crimes
from
flourishing
in
those
areas
n
the
approach
became
known
as
broken
windows
policing
named
for
the
tendency
for
buildings
with
a
broken
window
to
encourage
further
window
breaking
and
other
forms
of
vandalism
a
phenomenon
described
by
stanford
psychologist
philip
zimbardo
in
his
well
known
abandoned
car
experiment
n
police
departments
in
large
american
cities
began
to
take
an
active
interest
in
the
broken
windows
theory
and
by
the
late
s
and
early
s
police
departments
in
new
york
city
chicago
and
los
angeles
had
all
implemented
some
version
of
this
model
n
in
new
york
then
mayor
rudy
giuliani
introduced
a
version
of
broken
windows
known
as
zero
tolerance
policing
which
placed
a
greater
emphasis
on
the
quality
of
life
issues
that
wilson
and
kelling
pointed
out
in
their
original
work
n
as
an
early
adopter
of
the
broken
windows
model
the
new
york
police
department
nypd
quickly
discovered
that
any
effective
implementation
of
such
a
program
would
require
curbing
disorder
not
only
on
the
streets
but
also
within
the
police
department
itself
which
had
been
in
a
decades
long
decline
of
poor
leadership
corruption
and
an
overall
breakdown
of
discipline
n
addressing
these
not
unrelated
problems
in
a
city
the
size
of
new
york
with
a
sworn
police
force
numbering
in
the
tens
of
thousands
would
require
an
approach
that
could
go
beyond
classical
organizational
techniques
n
the
data
and
network
centric
approaches
made
possible
by
the
rapid
technological
advances
beginning
in
the
late
s
and
early
s
and
implemented
as
a
successful
proof
of
concept
by
wal
mart
during
this
time
began
to
instill
in
the
nypd
other
police
departments
a
growing
faith
in
algorithms
and
automated
decision
tools
n
c
drugs
terrorism
and
the
blurring
of
military
and
civilian
spheres
the
confluence
of
military
and
police
use
of
data
and
network
centric
approaches
in
their
hitherto
separate
spheres
can
be
traced
in
its
earliest
forms
to
the
war
on
drugs
n
as
drug
trafficking
began
to
be
seen
not
only
as
a
law
enforcement
issue
but
also
a
threat
to
national
security
military
and
police
agencies
began
to
engage
as
partners
in
this
effort
sometimes
through
the
exchange
of
ideas
sometimes
quite
literally
through
interagency
actions
n
these
activities
were
complicated
by
the
fact
that
the
posse
comitatus
act
generally
prohibited
the
use
of
federal
military
forces
for
domestic
law
enforcement
purposes
n
congress
amended
the
posse
comitatus
act
in
to
address
this
legal
obstacle
which
allowed
for
military
support
of
civilian
leas
with
the
clear
legislative
intent
that
this
military
law
enforcement
cooperation
be
employed
in
counterdrug
operations
n
both
the
concept
and
the
realization
of
the
war
on
drugs
have
a
rather
spotty
record
n
the
political
rhetoric
that
tends
to
accompany
calls
for
such
a
war
creates
images
of
a
dangerous
other
who
threatens
social
stability
due
to
lax
morals
and
inherent
inabilities
to
exercise
self
control
n
efforts
within
the
war
on
drugs
are
therefore
designed
to
target
such
deviant
groups
within
society
and
by
doing
so
promise
to
reestablish
the
societal
values
held
by
the
upstanding
citizens
the
laws
are
there
to
protect
n
these
words
describing
the
dangerous
other
are
carefully
selected
to
mask
their
veiled
intent
to
play
on
white
fears
of
racial
minorities
n
the
disproportionate
effects
of
this
war
on
african
americans
and
hispanics
have
been
well
documented
resulting
in
broken
social
structures
overcrowded
prisons
and
a
retrenchment
of
jim
crow
policies
albeit
under
different
names
n
a
vivid
example
of
the
literal
law
enforcement
military
partnership
in
the
drug
war
can
be
found
in
the
formation
of
joint
task
force
now
known
as
joint
task
force
south
jtf
south
which
combined
combat
and
reconnaissance
forces
from
the
department
of
defense
dod
intelligence
services
and
civilian
leas
to
patrol
sections
of
the
u
s
mexican
border
on
drug
interdiction
missions
n
the
regular
armed
border
patrols
by
military
personnel
abruptly
stopped
in
after
a
young
u
s
marine
shot
and
killed
an
unarmed
civilian
n
the
american
public
s
appetite
for
the
use
of
military
troops
within
its
borders
evaporated
after
this
incident
only
to
be
revived
on
september
n
the
terrorist
attacks
of
opened
the
floodgates
on
law
enforcement
military
cooperation
with
many
of
the
political
and
legal
objections
to
such
partnerships
disappearing
almost
overnight
this
sudden
paradigm
shift
brought
on
by
a
level
of
terroristic
violence
previously
unthinkable
in
the
united
states
created
an
environment
within
which
the
traditionally
separate
spheres
of
military
and
civilian
law
enforcement
began
to
significantly
blur
n
the
military
contractors
large
and
small
that
tooled
up
to
support
the
war
effort
both
the
literal
combat
operations
in
afghanistan
and
iraq
as
well
as
the
larger
more
metaphorical
sense
began
making
much
of
this
material
available
to
civilian
leas
including
machine
guns
semi
automatic
shotguns
night
vision
equipment
sniper
rifles
combat
uniforms
grenades
and
high
tech
surveillance
gear
n
many
civilian
police
departments
were
especially
appreciative
of
the
expansion
of
two
dod
programs
designed
to
equip
leas
with
military
gear
through
the
transfer
or
direct
purchase
of
material

highly
visible
nature
of

the
use
of
this

enforcement
is
largely
limited
to
special

this
invisibility

the

be
a

of

something
new

city
had
not
had
for
decades
n
the
organizational

tools
necessary
for
such
an
endeavor
simply
did
not
exist
until
advances
in

opened
up
the

was
exactly
this
sort
of

a

forward
thinkers
within

nypd
proposed
as
a
solution
to
their
burgeoning
organizational

commissioner
william
bratton
revealed
the
compstat
program
as
a
centralized
solution
to
the

s
organizational
dilemma
n
the
goal
of
the
program
was
to
obtain
accurate
up
to
date
crime
statistics
at
every
level
within
the
department
something
that
had
proven
impossible
up
to
that
point
n
by
requiring
patrol
officers
to
keep
records
of
their
daily
activities
including
stops
arrests
and
the
details
of
each
incident
the
nypd
could
collect
these
data
on
a
computer
database
which
allowed
them
to
generate
weekly
books
of
city
wide
statistics
they
could
slice
and
dice
as
they
saw
fit
if
they
wanted
statistics
on

wished
to
compare

they
could
do
so
with
relative
ease

with
these

analysis
tools
the
nypd
could
now
begin
to
efficiently
address
the
city
s
broken

trouble
spots
and
do
so
by
directing
the
minimum
amount
of
manpower
to
the
right
place
at
the
right
time
exactly
the
outcome
giuliani
and
bratton
sought
n
the
nypd
began
to
see
a
significant
amount
of
success
with
the
compstat
system
both
with
their
ability
to
address
the
quality
of
life
crimes
highlighted
by
broken
windows
policing
as
well
as
in
their
ability
to
effectively
manage
a
large
and
growing
police
force
n
this
successful
adoption
gave
compstat
a
fair
amount
of
national
publicity
and
it
was
touted
alongside
broken
windows
policing
as
the
new
paradigm
of
crime
prevention
in
the
united
states
n
soon
other
cities
began
to
emulate
and
adapt
compstat
systems
within
their
own
police
departments
n
with
the
early
success
of
compstat
also
came
a
redoubled
faith
in
the
possibilities
of
automated
law
enforcement
intelligence
systems
allowing
police
departments
to
do
more
with
less
n
as
police
departments
became
increasingly
convinced
that
the
broken
windows
model
of
policing
with
its
dynamic
problem
oriented
approach
would
replace
the
old
static
bureaucratic
model
that
police
agencies
had
relied
on
for
generations
they
began
to
accept
and
explore
more
deeply
the
managerial
tools
and
techniques
offered
by
algorithmic
data
driven
systems
n
this
new
thinking
sparked
a
flurry
of
data
and
network
centric
experiments
in
leas
around
the
world
and
revived
a
global
interest
in
an
intelligence
based
model
of
policing
that
had
been
deployed
by
british
police
departments
since
the
s
n
b
the
rise
of
intelligence
led
policing
the
british
model
of
intelligence
led
policing
was
developed
in
part
as
a
response
to
the
privatization
initiatives
in
the
uk
in
the
s
and
s
where
portions
of
government
services
were
either
taken
over
by
private
companies
or
adopted
a
private
business
model
within
their
organizations
effectively
becoming
quasi
private
agencies
n
the
british
national
criminal
intelligence
service
ncis
originally
organized
to
address
drug
trafficking
and
later
expanded
to
include
organized
crime
generally
adopted
a
business
data
processing
model
to
develop
the
national
intelligence
model
nim
a
nationwide
system
for
use
by
all
police
agencies
across
the
uk
replacing
their
existing
bureaucratic
management
processes
with
an
intelligence
led
policing
model
n
this
model
had
been
developed
by
british
authorities
to
mimic
the
traditional
military
intelligence
model
where
data
are
collected
and
analyzed
in
order
to
identify
patterns
and
generate
actionable
intelligence
to
best
prioritize
the
deployment
of
patrols
based
on
a
set
of
problem
oriented
goals
n
it
is
not
difficult
to
see
the
allure
of
such
a
system
the
combination
of
tightening
budgets
increased
public
concern
over
crime
and
disorder
and
a
rising
perception
that
the
world
had
become
a
more
dangerous
place
due
in
large
part
to
drug
trafficking
terrorism
and
a
general
breakdown
of
civil
order
created
an
environment
that
made
automated
solutions
to
these
problems
all
the
more
credible
rapid
advances
in
technology
and
research
into
data
mining
and
automated
intelligent
decision
support
systems
began
to
instill
in
police
departments
a
newfound
enthusiasm
for
technology
not
generally
seen
since
the
days
of
sputnik
and
the
space
race
researchers
began
looking
for
existing
mathematical
and
physical
models
which
could
provide
even
faster
and
more
accurate
intelligence
n
by
the
late
s
police
departments
began
to
consider
the
possibility
that
intelligence
led
policing
coupled
with
advanced
technologies
and
analytical
tools
could
move
leas
beyond
mere
crime
fighting
and
into
the
realm
of
crime
prevention
n
c
the
tantalizing
prospect
of
predictive
policing
organizations
seeking
to
tighten
their
respective
ooda
loops
have
followed
boyd
s
logic
to
an
inevitable
conclusion
instead
of
merely
seeking
further
methods
to
tighten
the
ooda
loop
they
find
ways
to
tighten
the
loop
to
a
point
where
it
has
inverted
into
itself
that
is
the
decision
cycle
becomes
predictive
rather
than
reactive
n
the
possibility
of
preventing
crime
before
it
actually
happens
has
been
the
holy
grail
of
police
departments
especially
when
local
state
and
federal
governments
were
actively
looking
for
ways
to
cut
back
on
police
budgets
n
the
apparent
successes
of
broken
windows
and
zero
tolerance
policing
backed
by
sophisticated
decision
support
systems
like
compstat
and
intelligence
led
policing
gave
many
in
law
enforcement
the
firm
belief
that
these
systems
and
methodologies
would
eventually
yield
tools
that
would
collect
the
massive
amounts
of
data
now
available
from
inside
and
outside
of
police
departments
swiftly
store
and
analyze
those
data
and
produce
results
to
anticipate
prevent
and
respond
more
effectively
to
future
crime
n
a
common
trope
among
police
department
is
that
an
experienced
and
talented
officer
can
apply
their
knowledge
and
analytical
skills
to
attain
an
imperfect
version
of
predictive
policing
but
that
the
model
does
not
scale
well
n
the
benefit
these
new
analytical
tools
and
methods
could
bring
to
these
officers
could
mean
the
difference
between
investigating
a
crime
that
just
occurred
versus
preventing
the
crime
from
happening
in
the
first
place
n
the
savings
to
society
in
administrative
costs
property
damage
and
human
lives
alone
make
this
a
worthy
goal
for
a
data
and
network
centric
police
force
but
for
such
a
police
intelligence
system
to
work
as
advertised
one
needs
to
provide
it
with
as
much
good
data
as
possible
from
as
broad
a
sampling
as
possible
so
that
the
pattern
recognition
models
can
achieve
the
nearest
thing
to
a
god
s
eye
view
thus
allowing
the
analyst
to
find
the
proverbial
needle
in
the
haystack
n
this
means
police
agencies
need
to
turn
to
nontraditional
sources
of
information
such
as
social
media
as
well
as
developing
and
refining
internal
data
sources
n
the
risks
inherent
in
such
an
approach
especially
if
implementation
or
strategy
is
rushed
or
otherwise
undertaken
without
a
full
understanding
of
the
implications
can
include
not
only
the
more
obvious
issues
of
privacy
and
fairness
but
also
technical
liabilities
attributable
to
cyber
security

criticisms
of
the
broken
windows
policing
model
the
broken
windows
policing
model
along
with
the
collection
of
technologies
and
techniques
supporting
this
approach
have
met
with
a
growing
body
of
criticisms
even
as
police
departments
continue
to
adopt
and
promote
these
methods
n
central
to
many
of
these
criticisms
is
the
core
role
that
disorder
plays
in
the
broken
windows
model
specifically
the
subjective
definition
and
measurement
of
the
term
as
well
as
the
limited
beneficiaries
of
this
approach
n
these
criticisms
have
seriously
questioned
the
premise
of
broken
windows
citing
statistics
that
indicate
that
the
broken
windows
model
has
a
measurable
direct
negative
effect
on
the
very
neighborhoods
and
communities
whose
hot
spots
were
supposedly
the
beneficiaries
of
increased
police
focus
n
among
the
sharpest
critiques
of
the
broken
windows
policing
model
is
that
whatever
the
original
intent
was
of
such
programs
their
implementations
have
been
less
about
policing
disorder
than
about
the
control
of
poor
neighborhoods
and
poor
people
most
of
whom
are
racial
minorities
n
the
longstanding
practice
within
the
american
legal
system
of
using
race
as
a
signal
of
increased
risk
of
criminal
behavior
combined
with
programs
encouraging
police
officers
to
gather
intelligence
data
through
arbitrary
stop
and
frisk
programs
sometimes
referred
to
as
enhanced
terry
stops
to
feed
into
automated
intelligence
systems
has
created
an
environment
where
racial
minorities
end
up
bearing
the
costs
of
broken
windows
while
wealthy
white
communities
tend
to
see
the
majority
of
its
benefits
n
the
social
disorder
that
broken
windows
policing
targets
has
been
shown
to
be
a
very
fluid
concept
where
the
perceptions
of
a
minority
neighborhood
s
residents
are
often
far
different
than
those
of
the
police
officers
patrolling
those
neighborhoods
who
frequently
come
from
other
wealthier
neighborhoods
n
the
result
of
the
intelligence
data
collected
based
on
race
or
class
bias
or
parochial
perceptions
of
social
disorder
creates
an
inherent
bias
in
automated
decision
support
systems
that
tends
to
be
reinforced
with
every
trip
around
the
ooda
loop
n
this
result
can
be
directly
traced
to
the
sort
of
feedback
loops
data
centric
decision
support
systems
like
compstat
are
prone
to
encounter
n
that
is
if
the
data
used
to
initiate
an
automated
decision
support
tool
is
biased
or
otherwise
flawed
the
actionable
intelligence
that
emerges
will
likely
also
be
biased
or
flawed
if
this
bad
intelligence
is
then
acted
upon
the
resulting
stops
or
arrests
will
likely
generate
even
more
bad
data
which
is
then
fed
back
into
the
decision
support
system

what
makes

systems
an
attractive
as
a
solution
for

to
increase

is
the
same
aspect
that
makes

potentially
dangerous
we
tend
to
implicitly
trust
algorithms
and
data
since
we
assume
that

this
common
misconception
is
based
on
two
fundamental
misunderstandings
of

or
expert
systems

it
is
true
that
computers
as

machines
that
at
their

no

are
strictly
limited
to
the
instructions
we
give

we
run
on

computers
are
necessarily
unbiased

up
in

can
often
translate
subtle
biases
often
in
unexpected
ways
n
for
example
from
an
algorithmic
modeling
perspective
incorrect
or
imbalanced
input
data
has
long
been
shown
to
lead
to
biased
results
n
perhaps
the
most
commonly
used
statistical
method
in
predictive
modeling
systems
is
linear
regression
n
particularly
a
maximum
likelihood
linear
regression
which
is
a
widely
used
technique
in
military
and
police
predictive
intelligence
systems
n
in
systems
such
as
these
the
data
used
often
contain
a
large
number
of
events
belonging
to
one
class
while
the
other
class
contains
only
a
few
data
points
a
data
disparity
known
as
a
class
imbalance
n
this
phenomenon
often
occurs
in
data
where
the
event
of
interest
the
crime
is
sampled
far
more
frequently
than
non
events
n
this
problem
also
manifests
itself
in
the
differences
in
class
data
representations
between
the
sample
set
and
the
actual
population
known
as
sampling
bias
n
there
are
of
course
statistical
sampling
methods
to
mitigate
these
effects
but
there
is
no
clear
consensus
as
to
which
method
of
class
distribution
sampling
will
work
best
in
all
or
even
most
situations
n
the
best
solutions
tend
to
be
those
that
are
specially
selected
based
on
such
factors
as
the
statistical
methods
employed
the
population
size
the
sample
size
and
specifics
regarding
the
event
in
question
n
in
plain
language
this
means
that
a
one
size
fits
all
solution
is
likely
to
produce
questionable
results
at
best
and
at
worst
dangerously
biased
results
this
danger
becomes
increasingly
amplified
when
one
examines
the
trend
of
police
analysis
being
extended
from
the
realm
of
geospatial
analysis
predicting
which
neighborhoods
are
most
likely
to
be
crime
hot
spots
to
the
individual
where
police
keep
close
tabs
on
people
who
according
to
predictive
algorithms
are
more
likely
to
be
involved
in
future
crimes
n
c
the
introduction
of
automation
bias

rise
of
the
information
and
audit
society
and
the
associated
increase
in
the
use

decision
making
often
leads
to
an
overreliance
on

overconfidence
in
the
results

automation
bias
leads
to
misuse
of
automated

complacency

the
negative
effects
of
this
automation
bias
have
been
seen
in
healthcare
transportation
power
distribution
defense
and
space
exploration
often
with
serious
life
threatening
consequences
n
there
are
multiple
reasons
for
this
behavior
including
our
natural
tendencies
to
seek
out
paths
of
least
cognitive
effort
to
expend
less
energy
when
part
of
a
team
including
teams
with
automated
members
and
to
treat
computers
as
decision
making
authorities
n
these
errors
have
been
further
categorized
into
two
classes
that
manifest
in
automated
environments
omission
errors
where
operators
fail
to
respond
to
system
anomalies
because
the
automated
system
fails
to
detect
or
warn
of
them
and
commission
errors
where
users
blindly
follow
incorrect
guidance
from
automated
systems
in
spite
of
contraindications
from
other
information
sources
n
studies
have
repeatedly
shown
that
automation
bias
of
both
types
leads
to
users
making
incorrect
decisions
at
a
rate
as
high
as
even
when
the
information
they
needed
to
make
the
correct
decision
was
readily
available

automation
bias
becomes
especially
dangerous
when
life
or
liberty
is
at
stake
multiple
studies
in
domains
such
as
health
care
air
transportation
and
military
command
and
control
have
repeatedly
shown
how
bias
and
complacency
lead
users
of

to
make
very
costly
mistakes
n
in
military
environments
especially
overconfidence
in
the
authority
of
automated

can
be
particularly
catastrophic

the
importance

defer
to
authorities
within
their
supervisory
structure
a
trait
that
remains
in
effect
when
users
of
these
systems
seek
guidance
from
algorithms
and
data
structures
n
the
natural
result
is
an
amplification
of
automation
bias
in
these
overtly
hierarchical
environments
where
users
exhibit
tendencies
to
rely
exclusively
on
automated
systems
even
when
conflicting
information
is
presented
by
other
available
systems
n
the
transfer
of
military
intelligent
decision
support
systems
to
civilian
law
enforcement
organizations
where
the
paramilitary
organizational
structure
closely
resembles
that
of
the
military
makes
police
susceptible
to
the
same
dangerous
automation
bias
exhibited
in
military
environments
so
how
do
law
enforcement
organizations
take
advantage
of
continued
advances
in
automated
intelligence
and
decision
support
techniques
without
either
further
alienating
the
communities
they
serve
or
succumbing
to
various
data
and
algorithm
based
biases
iv
a
community
policing
solution
to
algorithmic
race
bias
of
course
to
completely
ignore
the
opportunities
presented
by
advances
in
automation
makes
no
sense
there
are
many
tasks
that
computers
simply
do
better
than
humans
such
as
repetitive
tasks
rapid
response
to
control
tasks
rule
based
deductive
reasoning
and
simultaneous
task
handling
n
as
our
systems
both
human
and
computer
grow
increasingly
complex
we
need
automation
to
give
us
the
enhanced
capabilities
to
handle
time
critical
and
complex
control
environments
the
trick
then
is
to
recognize
the
critical
role
automated
information
systems
play
in
these
domains
but
at
the
same
time
maintain
an
informed
awareness
of
the
pitfalls
an
overreliance
on
automated
decision
support
can
bring
this
is
of
great
importance
to
leas
who
have
a
special
duty
to
their
communities
not
only
to
enforce
the
laws
but
also
to
protect
and
maintain
the
health
and
safety
of
everyone
in
those
communities
allocating
the
appropriate
amount
of
functionality
between
police
officers
and
automated
systems
is
critical
to
this
role
in
this
section
i
recommend
a
two
element
approach
to
this
problem
that
takes
into
account
both
the
important
social
role
police
play
within
their
communities
as
well
as
the
phenomenon
of
automation
and
data
bias
that
can
artificially
reinforce
racial
disparities
in
police
treatment
a
a
return
to
the
original
intent
of
community
policing
a
significant
part
of
the
original
broken
windows
policing
concept
articulated
by
wilson
and
kelling
was
the
role
of
the
police
officer
in
reassuring
community
members
of
their
safety
and
maintaining
a
high
degree
of
sensitivity
to
signaling
by
community
residents
with
respect
not
only
to
criminal
activity
but
also
with
their
comfort
with
the
police
agency
itself
n
community
policing
requires
a
more
holistic
approach
to
the
problem
of
public
safety
that
goes
beyond
mere
crime
fighting
to
encompass
overall
community
health
safety
and
quality
of
life
n
under
this
model
crime
fighting
was
not
an
end
in
itself
but
the
means
toward
healthier
communities
and
was
seen
as
a
more
modern
inclusive
method
of
policing
n
too
many
implementations
of
broken
windows
and
intelligence
led
policing
models
however
failed
to
follow
through
on
this
part
of
the
theory
rather
than
measure
their
performance
and
direct
their
activities
using
data
that
reflected
a
community
s
overall
health
and
quality
of
life
systems
like
compstat
relied
heavily
sometimes
exclusively
on
traditional
crime
statistics
such
as
the
number
of
stops
arrests
and
clearance
rates
despite
the
fact
that
these
metrics
have
repeatedly
been
shown
to
have
little
to
no
bearing
on
overall
community
safety
n
sadly
this
flawed
approach
to
the
original
community
policing
concept
originates
in
the
fact
that
these
crime
statistics
are
easy
to
collect
and
measure
and
police
departments
have
developed
a
high
degree
of
comfort
with
these
metrics
over
the
years
n
thus
the
most
direct
approach
to
solving
the
problem
of
bad
data
leading
to
biased
results
from
data
centric
decision
support
tools
is
to
require
that
police
departments
retool
their
data
collection
and
analysis
efforts
toward
more
meaningful
metrics
another
misinterpreted
requirement
of
the
original
wilson
and
kelling
model
is
the
concept
of
proactive
policing
most
police
departments
implementing
broken
windows
models
have
designed
their
systems
as
incident
oriented
frameworks
which
do
a
poor
job
at
addressing
levels
of
criminality
in
a
community
and
serve
mainly
to
feed
a
cycle
of
incarceration
n
the
wilson
and
kelling
method
of
proactive
policing
focuses
instead
on
the
root
causes
of
criminality
such
as
poverty
economic
and
ecological
injustice
and
racism
where
police
departments
form
part
of
a
larger
community
team
to
go
beyond
the
punishing
of
window
breakers
and
actually
fix
the
broken
windows
n
finally
community
policing
requires
police
departments
to
hone
their
sensitivities
to
cultural
norms
and
the
needs
of
the
community
since
perceptions
of
social
disorder
can
be
highly
dependent
upon
time
place
and
circumstance
and
most
police
officers
are
not
residents
of
the
communities
they
patrol
n
public
perceptions
can
also
vary
by
context
which
means
social
disorder
often
falls
into
the
i
can
t
define
it
but
i
know
it
when
i
see
it
category
n
when
police
officers
develop
a
feel
for
their
communities
they
patrol
they
will
also
benefit
their
departments
by
providing
better
more
meaningful
intelligence
data
which
can
then
be
used
to
improve
their
decision
support
outcomes
n
police
department
policies
and
procedures
that
are
put
in
place
with
automated
decision
support
tools
like
compstat
which
supports
the
broken
windows
policing
regimes
have
had
a
distinctly
negative
effect
on
minority
communities
n
as
discussed
in
section
iii
above
this
problem
is
not
a
new
one
but
is
instead
one
that
has
been
exacerbated
by
the
use
of
military
tactics
and
technologies
n
leas
already
obligated
to
collect
evidence
especially
feel
the
pressure
in
information
societies
to
observe
collect
record
and
evaluate
all
available
data
n
this
predilection
leads
police
to
treat
their
communities
as
intelligence
landscapes
and
people
as
data
elements
n
resulting
in
dissociative
or
adversarial
relationships
between
cop
and
citizen
n
this
result
is
counter
to
the
original
intent
behind
community
policing
n
in
hindsight
there
is
a
certain
level
of
disconnect
between
the
algorithmic
policing
model
and
the
community
policing
model
since
algorithmic
policing
seeks
to
build
a
centralized
automated
police
force
that
operates
from
the
inside
out
while
the
community
policing
model
requires
a
process
that
begins
and
ends
with
the
citizen
n
but
a
key
driver
behind
broken
windows
and
algorithmic
policing
is
a
heightened
fear
of
crime
and
disorder
a
fear
that
has
not
diminished
significantly
over
the
past
few
decades
despite
the
nearly
universal
drop
in
crime
rates
nationally
n
a
necessary
part
of
this
transformation
therefore
is
to
cultivate
a
base
level
of
trust
within
police
organizations
as
well
as
stakeholder
communities
one
method
of
building
this
trust
is
to
continue
to
use
the
automated
policing
systems
while
redesigning
them
to
focus
on
local
community
goals
rather
than
those
of
police
departments
or
outside
interests
transparency
is
critical
to
this
step
s
success
police
management
must
create
a
system
through
which
community
members
can
not
only
seek
police
assistance
but
can
examine
the
systems
and
goals
the
police
themselves
use
to
guide
their
day
to
day
patrol
activities
another
critical
part
of
this
transformation
is
an
immediate
increase
in
accountability
within
police
departments
automation
bias
data
bias
and
corrupted
procedures
and
goals
often
give
police
departments
a
certain
amount
of
artificial
cover
when
things
go
badly
however
technological
opacity
is
no
substitute
for
human
accountability
up
and
down
the
lea
management
chain
finally
law
enforcement
resources
must
be
shifted
towards
a
citizen
focused
organization
giving
rank
and
file
police
officers
the
power
to
help
drive
automation
policy
while
also
giving
them
the
discretion
to
problem
solve
independent
of
the
automated
process
b
incorporate
outcome
and
process
feedback
into
existing
systems
we
live
in
a
time
in
which
our
lives
are
increasingly
influenced
and
affected
whether
we
know
it
or
not
by
data
algorithms
and
machine
learning
n
it
would
be
a
mistake
to
believe
that
police
departments
would
somehow
be
immune
to
this
trend
therefore
the
solution
to
modern
or
post
modern
problems
of
public
safety
is
not
to
go
the
way
of
ned
ludd
but
to
develop
police
decision
support
systems
with
an
eye
toward
civil
rights
and
avoiding
race
discrimination
and
economic
injustice
the
key
principle
in
developing
any
of
these
systems
is
transparency
in
floyd
et
al
v
city
of
new
york
n
the
court
held
that
the
nypd
s
stop
and
frisk
program
violated
the
fourth
amendment
by
systematically
conducting
warrantless
searches
of
pedestrians
the
majority
of
which
were
african
american
or
hispanic
under
the
nypd
s
stop
and
frisk
program
police
made
over
million
stops
between
and
n
over
half
of
these
stops
were
of
black
citizens
thirty
percent
were
of
hispanic
citizens
and
only
ten
percent
were
of
white
citizens
n
the
guidelines
that
backed
such
a
system
were
based
on
opaque
police
policy
decisions
implementing
a
broken
windows
policing
model
and
thereby
creating
the
sort
of
insular
environment
that
often
fails
to
punish
bad
actors
and
creates
perverse
incentives
n
further
since
most
police
departments
do
not
employ
software
developers
or
statisticians
they
are
forced
to
purchase
their
decision
support
systems
from
third
party
contractors
n
the
same
principles
of
transparency
should
apply
to
contractors
so
as
to
avoid
these
problems
next
algorithmic
and
predictive
policing
systems
need
to
be
based
on
accurate
and
meaningful
data
for
example
police
stop
and
frisk
programs
despite
criticisms
and
claims
of
racial
bias
inherent
in
these
programs
have
been
widely
supported
by
leas
based
on
their
assertions
that
while
more
minorities
are
subject
to
these
stops
it
is
only
because
minorities
commit
disproportionately
more
crimes
than
whites
and
not
due
to
any
particular
bias
of
police
officers
and
departments
n
to
support
these
claims
police
often
cite
automated
police
intelligence
systems
such
as
compstat
to
justify
these
stops
n
statistical
studies
conducted
on
stop
and
frisk
data
however
have
shown
that
minorities
are
far
more
likely
subjects
of
these
programs
with
statistical
patterns
pointing
toward
a
structural
racial
bias
reinforced
through
automated
decision
support
tools
n
finally
we
must
be
cognizant
of
the
limitations
of
purely
technical
solutions
to
human
problems
mathematical
and
computer
models
of
real
life
systems
can
of
course
provide
critical
insights
into
complex
systems
but
they
are
imperfect
algorithms
for
deriving
patterns
from
large
amounts
of
seemingly
random
data
are
getting
better
as
research
and
technology
progress
but
their
most
effective
use
within
the
broken
windows
policing
model
is
as
a
supplemental
tool
informing
human
decision
making
not
as
a
digital
crutch
upon
which
bad
practices
and
biased
policing
may
rest
further
known
biases
in
automation
systems
can
be
mitigated
through
a
number
of
established
means
for
example
automation
bias
and
automation
complacency
can
be
avoided
by
increasing
accountability
by
the
users
of
a
system
n
by
requiring
system
operators
to
provide
complete
justifications
for
their
decisions
beyond
the
machine
told
me
so
users
will
be
driven
toward
deeper
cognitive
engagement
and
awareness
of
alternative
information
sources
n
the
level
of
automation
used
in
a
situation
should
also
be
carefully
assessed
on
a
domain
basis
that
is
the
level
of
automation
available
can
exceed
the
level
of
automation
necessary
for
a
given
situation
n
repetitive
rigid
tasks
that
expect
no
user
decision
making
flexibility
are
often
good
candidates
for
a
high
degree
of
automation
while
those
tasks
that
rely
on
human
intuition
pattern
perception
and
contextual
reasoning
are
best
served
with
lower
levels
of
automation
n
much
of
the
work
of
law
enforcement
falls
into
this
latter
category
for
the
time
being
algorithmic
and
predictive
approaches
are
only
as
useful
as
their
human
creators
selecting
the
proper
policing
model
for
every
instance
is
likely
impossible
so
one
of
the
most
important
decisions
in
the
field
of
machine
learning
is
the
selection
of
the
model
that
will
provide
superior
results
for
a
particular
problem
a
task
which
still
requires
an
experienced
and
informed
human
in
the
loop
n
but
this
limit
can
be
leveraged
as
a
benefit
rather
than
a
liability
by
using
predictive
systems
to
decentralize
police
command
structures
and
allow
more
creativity
and
initiative
among
rank
and
file
patrol
officers
characteristics
that
are
critical
to
a
true
community
policing
model
n
conclusion
the
problem
of
bias
in
algorithmic
policing
has
deep
roots
as
evidenced
above
solutions
to
this
problem
cannot
ignore
technological
advances
that
help
us
make
better
more
efficient
decisions
but
they
also
cannot
allow
these
technologies
to
subvert
the
proper
role
of
public
safety
in
our
communities
we
live
in
an
information
society
that
is
once
again
experiencing
a
crisis
of
control
that
we
are
naturally
inclined
to
solve
through
data
and
analytic
methods
but
our
approach
must
be
based
on
lessons
learned
from
our
successes
and
failures
in
this
arena
many
of
these
failures
have
led
to
a
trust
deficit
between
authorities
and
the
communities
they
govern
especially
where
racial
prejudices
have
been
part
of
these
failures
addressing
these
disparities
in
algorithmic
policing
cannot
solve
all
of
these
problems

marked

that
uses

to
make
real

of
where
hate

may
occur
the

will
be

it
is
the
first
time
that
social
media
has
been
used
in
the
united
states
to
create
predictive
policing
models
of
hate
crime
over
the
next
three
years
the
team
will
be
closely
scrutinizing
data
taken
from
twitter
and
cross
referencing
this
with
reported
hate
crimes
in
los
angeles
to
develop
markers
or
signatures
which
could
indicate
if
and
where
a
hate
crime
is
likely
to
take
place
at
a
certain
point
in
time
and
then
enable
police
officers
to
intervene
the
term
hate
crime
is
used
to
describe
a
prejudice
motivated
crime
often
violent
which
occurs
when
a
perpetrator
targets
a
victim
because
of
his
or
her
affiliation
to
a
social
group
such
as
their
sex
ethnicity
disability
or
religion

uk
official

shows
that
there
were
hate

in
an
increase
of
per
cent
compared
with
previous
research
from
the

already
shown
that
twitter

can
be
used
to
identify
hot
spots
such
as
certain
states
or
cities
where
hate
speech
has
occurred
but
where
hate
crime
has
not
been
reported
one
example
is
an
area
when
recent
immigrants
may
be
unlikely
to
report
crime
due
to
fear
of
deportation
professor
matt
williams
from
the
university
s
school
of
social
science
said
developing
a
better
understanding
of
hateful
sentiments
online
and
their
relationship
with
crime
on
the
streets
could
push
law
enforcement
to
better
identify
report
and
address
hate
crimes
that
are
occurring
offline
the
insights
provided
by
our
work
will
help
us
localities
to
design
policies
to
address
specific
hate
crime
issues
unique
to
their
jurisdiction
and
allow
service
providers
to
tailor
their
services
to
the
needs
of
victims
especially
if
those
victims
are
members
of
an
emerging
category
of
hate
crime
targets
the
los
angeles
police
department
has
a
history
of
incorporating
progressive
and
forward
thinking
methods
into
their
policing
having
previously
used
mathematical
models
to
predict
other
areas
of
crime
which
have
been
shown
to
successfully
lower
crime
rates
the
huge
volumes
of
data
that
social

now
generates
has
provided
researchers
with
large
swathes
of
information
that
can
be
used
to
identify
emerging
patterns
and
trends
in
a
number
of
areas
across
society
including

this
is
the
first
study
in
the
united

to
use
social

data
in
predictive
policing
models
of
hate

predictive
policing
is
a
proactive
law
enforcement
model
that
has
become
more
common
partially
due
to
the
advent
of

and
machine

methods
new
analytic
approaches
and
the
ability
to

have
increased
the

over

introduction
police
authority
to
stop
question
and
frisk
citizens
on
the
street
has
been
a
controversial
police
practice
for
more
than
a
century
consider
that
in
sam
b
warner
a
member
of
the
interstate
commission
on
crime
started
his
law
review
article
on
the
uniform
arrest
act
by
noting
that
the
law
governing
police
authority
to
stop
question
frisk
and
arrest
suspects
illustrates
the
discrepancy
between
law
in
the
books
and
the
law
in
action
n
since
the
early
s
this
discrepancy
has
grown
into
a
highly
divisive
controversy
as
a
function
of
a
strong
disconnect
between
how
police
authority
to
stop
question
and
frisk
suspects
is
supposed
to
work
in
principle
and
how
it
has
actually
worked
in
practice
n
on
one
hand
the
practice
is
grounded
in
a
historical
and
legal
tradition
dating
back
hundreds
of
years
the
basis
of
a
police
officer
s
authority
to
stop
question
and
frisk
a
suspicious
person
can
be
traced
back
to
english
common
law
as
watchmen
and
private
citizens
had
the
authority
to
arrest
any
suspicious
nigh
twalker
and
detain
him
till
he
give
a
good
account
of
himself
n
that
common
law
approach
to
stop
and
frisk
carried
over
to
some
united
states
jurisdictions
although
the
legal
authority
for
the
practice
was
nebulous
at
best
n
the
lack
of
a
clear
legal
framework
for
stop
and
frisk
led
the
u
s
interstate
commission
on
crime
to
draft
the
uniform
arrest
act
in
n
that
model
statute
outlined
nine
different
types
of
police
citizen
contacts
including
q
uestioning
and
detaining
suspects
and
s
earching
suspects
for
weapons
n
litigation
over
various
statutes
authorizing
stop
and
frisk
led
the
u
s
supreme
court
to
formally
establish
stop
and
frisk
as
a
constitutionally
permissible
policing
tactic
in
the
landmark
decision
in
terry
v
ohio
n
in
the
terry
case
the
court
held
that
police
may
temporarily
detain
and
question
a
citizen
if
the
officer
has
reasonable
articulable
suspicion
that
a
person
may
be
involved
in
criminal
activity
n
the
court
also
held
that
officers
may
superficially
search
frisk
a
detained
person
if
there
is
reasonable
articulable
suspicion
that
the
person
may
be
armed
and
dangerous
n
since
the
terry
ruling
the
court
has
not
only
consistently
reaffirmed
the
constitutionality
of
stop
and
frisk
but
also
expanded
officers
authority
during
such
stops
n
on
the
other
hand
police
use
of
stop
and
frisk
in
numerous
jurisdictions
has
strayed
dramatically
from
the
principles
set
forth
in
terry
and
its
progeny
n
in
some
cases
police
use
of
stop
and
frisk
has
been
characterized
by
gross
overuse
and
misuse
of
the
strategy
violations
of
citizens
fourth
and
fourteenth
amendment
rights
strained
police
community
relationships
low
or
no
police
legitimacy
and
significant
emotional
psychological
and
physical
consequences
experienced
by
citizens
n
the
new
york
city
police
department
nypd
epitomizes
this
story
in
the
office
of
the
new
york
state
attorney
general
released
a
report
that
examined
stops
and
raised
serious
questions
about
their
constitutionality
as
well
as
racial
disparities
in
those
who
were
stopped
n
allegations
of
racial
discrimination
in
stops
conducted
by
the
nypd
led
to
two
federal
lawsuits
that
mired
the
nypd
and
its
stop
and
frisk
program
in
federal
court
for
more
than
a
decade
daniels
v
city
of

n
and

the
controversy
came

ruled
that

was
considerable

in
how

law
handled
police
initiated
contacts
with
citizens
that
did
not
reach
the
level
of
arrest
in
some
states
it
was
unclear
if
american
common
law
borrowing
from
its
english
antecedents
conferred
a
right
to
detain
and
question
suspects
when
the
requirements
for
a
full
arrest
were
clearly
absent
n
in
other
jurisdictions
the
right
to
detain
and
question
suspects
was
conferred
on
police
by
state
statute
or
by
municipal
ordinance
n
in
these
states
detentions
for
questioning
were
generally
left
to
the
discretion
of
individual
officers
and
were
not
subject
to
constitutional
protections
or
judicial
oversight
n
inconsistency
in
state
law
came
to
be
viewed
as
entirely
inadequate
to
meet
the
modern
needs
for
questioning
and
detaining
suspects
n
in
the
interstate
commission
on
crime
authorized
a
study
to
examine
how
arrests
were
made
across
the
united
states
the
study
examined
the
feasibility
of
creating
a
model
law
that
states
could
adopt
to
harmonize
arrest
practices
across
the
country
and
to
bring
the
actions
of
police
into
alignment
with
constitutional
standards
n
once
drafted
that
model
law
became
known
as
the
uniform
arrest
act
its
provisions
dealt
with
nine
types
of
police
initiated
contacts
with

of
which
were

as
a
consequence
considerable
variation
persisted
across

by
the
need
to

the

perhaps
concerns
about
how

three
landmark
rulings

constitutional
benchmarks
for

within
the
framework
of

amendment
terry
v

cases
of
sibron
v
new

and
peters
v
new
york
n
in
the
interest
of
brevity
the
next
section
summarizes
only
the
key
facts
and
holdings
of
these
cases
n
b
terry
sibron
and
peters
in
terry
detective
martin
mcfadden
testified
that
he
observed
two
men
while
on
patrol
the
court
summarized
mcfadden
s
observations
as
follows
he
saw
one
of
the
men
leave
the
other
one
and
walk
southwest
on
huron
road
past
some
stores
the
man
paused
for
a
moment
and
looked
in
a
store
window
then
walked
on
a
short
distance
turned
around
and
walked
back
toward
the
corner
pausing
once
again
to
look
in
the
same
store
window
he
rejoined
his
companion
at
the
corner
and
the
two
conferred
briefly
then
the
second
man
went
through
the
same
series
of
motions
strolling
down
huron
road
looking
in
the
same
window
walking
on
a
short
distance
turning
back
peering
in
the
store
window
again
and
returning
to
confer
with
the
first
man
at
the
corner
the
two
men
repeated
this
ritual
alternately
between
five
and
six
times
apiece
in
all
roughly
a
dozen
trips
at
one
point
while
the
two
were
standing
together
on
the
corner
a
third
man
approached
them
and
engaged
them
briefly
in
conversation
this
man
then
left
the
two
others
and
walked
west
on
euclid
avenue
chilton
and
terry
resumed
their
measured
pacing
peering
and
conferring
after
this
had
gone
on
for
to
minutes
the
two
men
walked
off
together
heading
west
on
euclid
avenue
following
the
path
taken
earlier
by
the
third
man
n
mcfadden
s
observations
led
him
to
suspect
that
the
men
were
planning
to
commit
a
robbery
in
the
store
he
therefore
approached
the
men
and
began
to
question
them
fearing
that
they
might
be
armed
he
patted
them
down
and
recovered
a
revolver
on
two
of
the
men
mcfadden
arrested
the
men
for
illegal
possession
of
the
firearms
in
upholding
their
convictions
the
u
s
supreme
court
made
it
clear
that
the
fourth
amendment
applies
to
stop
and
frisk
activities
n
but
i
nstead
of
applying
the
probable
cause
standard
to
stops
and
frisks
the
court
applied
the
fundamental
test
of
the
fourth
amendment
the
reasonableness
under
all
the
circumstances
of
the
particular
governmental
invasion
of
a
citizen
s
personal
security
n
in
deciding
to
analyze
the
reasonableness
of
officer
mcfadden
s
conduct
the
court
approved
a
line
of
inquiry
that
is
distinct
from
questions
of
probable
cause
indeed
the
court
analyzed
the
reasonableness
of
officer
mcfadden
s
conduct
as
a
general
proposition
by
balancing
the
need
to
search
or
seize
against
the
invasion
which
the
search
or
seizure
entails
n
moreover
the
court
maintained
that
this
balancing
test
depends
on
whether
a
law
enforcement
officer
can
point
to
specific
and
articulable
facts
which
taken
together
with
rational
inferences
from
those
facts
reasonably
warrant
that
intrusion
n
the
court
then
applied
a
similar
balancing
test
to
assess
the
reasonableness
of
mcfadden
s
search
for
weapons
in
doing
so
the
court
found
the
search
to
be
permissible
under
the
fourth
amendment
in
large
part
because
of
its
limited
nature
namely
the
pat
down
of
the
men
s
outer
clothing
for
weapons
he
did
not
conduct
a
general
exploratory
search
for
whatever
evidence
of
criminal
activity
he
might
find
n
in
sibron
the
defendant
was
convicted
of
the
unlawful
possession
of
heroin
over
the
course
of
several
hours
a
police
officer
observed
the
defendant
talking
with
six
or
eight
persons
whom
he
patrolman
martin
knew
from
past
experience
to
be
narcotics
addicts
n
the
officer
did
not
hear
any
of
the
conversations
nor
did
anyone
ever
pass
anything
to
the
defendant
during
these
conversations
nonetheless
the
officer
subsequently
approached
sibron
and
said
you
know
what
i
am
after
prompting
sibron
to
reach
into
his
pocket
that
action
in
turn
caused
the
officer
to
reach
into
sibron
s
pocket
and
retrieve
several
glassine
envelopes
that
contained
heroin
n
the
u
s
supreme
court
overturned
sibron
s
conviction
on
the
grounds
that
the
officer
s
initial
stop
was
not
supported
by
reasonable
suspicion
that
sibron
was
involved
in
any
criminal
activity
so
far
as
the
officer
knew
they
might
indeed
have
been
talking
about
the
world
series
the
inference
that
persons
who
talk
to
narcotics
addicts
are
engaged
in
the
criminal
traffic
in
narcotics
is
simply
not
the
sort
of
reasonable
inference
required
to
support
an
intrusion
by
the
police
upon
an
individual
s
personal
security
n
moreover
the
court
determined
that
the
officer
lacked
reasonable
suspicion
that
sibron
was
armed
and
dangerous
in
fact
the
court
reasoned
that
the
officer
s
opening
statement
to
sibron
you
know
what
i
am
after
made
it
abundantly
clear
that
he
sought
narcotics
and
did
not
believe
that
sibron
was
reaching
for
a
weapon
n
in
peters
an
off
duty
police
officer
heard
strange
noises
outside
his
apartment
door
he
investigated
and
observed
two
men
he
had
never
seen
before
tiptoeing
out
of
the
apartment
building
in
which
the
officer
had
lived
for
years
believing
that
he
had
happened
upon
the
two
men
in
the
course
of
an
attempted
burglary
the
officer
opened
his
door
entered
the
hallway
and
slammed
the
door
loudly
behind
him
this
precipitated
a
flight
down
the
stairs
on
the
part
of
the
two
men
and
the
officer
gave
chase
n
the
officer
patted
down
the
men
and
found
burglar
s
tools
the
court
affirmed
peters
conviction
because
the
officer
had
probable
cause
to
believe
the
men
were
involved
in
an
attempted
burglary
in
light
of
the
existence
of
probable
cause
to
arrest
the
search
of
peters
could
be
justified
as
a
search
incident
to
arrest
a
more
complete
search
than
the
limited
frisk
patdown
for
weapons
authorized
under
terry
n
c
key
court
cases
after
terry
v
ohio
established
the
legal
parameters
for
stop
and
frisk
in
the
united
states
the
supreme
court
revisited
stop
and
frisk
just
over
a
decade
later
in
two
cases
brown
v
texas
n
and
ybarra
v
illinois
n
the
court
invalidated
police
actions
and
reinforced
the
narrow
authority
granted
under
terry
by
the
s
however
courts
began
to
interpret
terry
as
providing
significant
leeway
to
law
enforcement
officers
to
conduct
stops
additionally
the
u
s
supreme
court
directed
the
lower
courts
to
assess
the
validity
of
stops
based
on
the
whole
picture
or
what
came
to
be
known
as
the
totality
of
the
circumstances
n
perhaps
more
importantly
the
court
told
lower
courts
to
defer
to
the
professional
judgment
and
experience
of
police
when
assessing
the
totality
of
the
circumstances
n
throughout
the
s
the
u
s
supreme
court
exempted
several
classes
of
stops
from
the
usual
requirements
of
terry
for
example
in
united
states
v
mendenhall
the
court
ruled
that
a
stop
had
not
occurred
when
federal
agents
approached
the
defendant
in
the
open
concourse
area
of
an
airport
n
because
the
agents
neither
wore
uniforms
nor
displayed
weapons
and
because
they
requested
but
did
not
demand
to
see
the
defendant
s
ticket
and
identification
the
court
reasoned
that
the
encounter
did
not
constitute
a
stop
that
qualified
as
a
seizure
for
fourth
amendment
purposes
but
rather
a
voluntary
and
cooperative
encounter
because
at
no
time
should
a
reasonable
person
in
the
defendant
s
situation
have
ever
felt
that
she
could
not
leave
n
then
in
i
n
s
v
delgado
the
free
to
leave
test
morphed
into
something
even
more
restrictive
on
personal
liberty
free
to
continue
working
and
moving
about
a
factory
while
armed
agents
wearing
badges
roamed
the
premises
questioning
people
about
their
immigration
status
n
the
court
further
narrowed
terry
in
florida
v
bostick
when
it
clarified
that
law
enforcement
officers
have
the
authority
to
stop
and
ask
basic
investigatory
questions
including
requests
to
examine
identification
or
to
search
luggage
of
bus
passengers
without
there
being
a
seizure
for
fourth
amendment
purposes
as
long
as
the
police
do
not
convey
a
message
that
compliance
with
their
requests
is
required
n
in
short
bostick
all
but
abandoned
mendenhall
s
free
to
leave
test
by
changing
the
inquiry
to
one
of
coercive
police
tactics
through
shows
of
authority
in
other
cases
the
u
s
supreme
court
extended
the
authority
of
police
to
conduct
frisks
consider
that
in
michigan
v
long
the
court
permitted
the
police
to
conduct
a
brief
search
of
the
passenger
compartment
of
a
car
to
look
for
hidden
weapons
n
perhaps
most
importantly
the
court
has
partially
retreated
from
sibron
s
holding
that
reasonable
suspicion
needed
to
be
based
on
more
than
just
hunches
in
alabama
v
white
the
court
upheld
a
stop
of
a
vehicle
based
on
an
anonymous
tip
even
though
there
was
no
indication
of
the
reliability
of
the
tip
n
michigan

of

extended
that
reasoning
to
uphold
random
drug
testing
of
all
students
who
participate
in
any
extracurricular
activities
n
illinois
v
wardlow
approved
an
inference
of
suspicion
from
flight
n
an
inference
that
logically
extends
to
any
type
of
evasive
behavior
n
whren
v
united
states
upheld
pretextual
stops
thereby
allowing
police
to
conduct
stops
for
minor
infractions
so
they
could
investigate
other
more
serious
crimes
n
and
because
minnesota
v
dickerson
approved
of
the
so
called
plain
feel
exception
n
police
likely
have
an
incentive
to
frisk
people
even
when
they
do
not
actually
fear
the
presence
of
a
weapon
but
rather
hope
to
feel
some
drugs
in
the
pat
down
a
seemingly
permissible
pretext
in
light
of
whren
n
in
sum
the
terry
ruling
in
set
the
initial
rules
for
stop
and
frisk
since
court
rulings
in
most
of
the
associated
cases
have
expanded
police
authority
to
stop
question
and
frisk
citizens
this
expanded
authority
undoubtedly
increased
the
risk
that
officers
would
employ
racial
ethnic
and
socio
economic
class
stereotypes
as
part
of
a
calculus
of
suspicion
to
initiate
stop
and
frisk
activities
the
expansion
of
stop
and
frisk
authority
and
the
increased
risk
of
racial
profiling
is
especially
problematic
when
considering
the
persistent
undercurrent
of
racial
injustice
throughout
nearly
two
centuries
of
american
policing
iii
stop
and
frisk
and
the
undercurrent
of
racial
injustice
n
an
undercurrent
of
racial
injustice
and
discrimination
has
served
as
a
backdrop
in
professional
policing
in
the
united
states
for
the
last
years
n
the
larger
race
relation
problems
that
have
defined
american
policing
provide
an
important
lens
through
which
to
view
the
rulings
in
terry
and
subsequent
cases
as
well
as
the
increasing
reliance
on
mass
stop
and
frisk
programs

opinion
in

v
ohio
chief
justice
warren
noted
that
stop
and
frisk
activities
by
police
contributed
to
racial
strife
we
would
be
less
than
candid
if
we
did
not
acknowledge
that
this
question
thrusts
to
the
fore
difficult
and
troublesome
issues
regarding
a
sensitive
area
of
police
activity
issues
which
have
never
before
been
squarely
presented
to
this
court
reflective
of
the
tensions
involved
are
the
practical
and
constitutional
arguments
pressed
with
great
vigor
on
both
sides
of
the
public
debate
over
the
power
of
the
police
to
stop
and
frisk
as
it
is
sometimes
euphemistically
termed
suspicious
persons
n
the
opinions
in
terry
however
omitted
or
glossed
over
several
important
facts
relevant
to
the
racial
issues
underlying
the
case
indeed
nowhere
in
any
of
the
opinions
in
terry
does
any
justice
mention
that
both
terry
and
chilton
were
black
men
n
nor
does
any
justice
mention
that
katz
who
was
white
was
not
charged
he
was
held
as
a
suspicious
person
and
released
after
two
days
n
according
to
the
transcript
of
the
trial
court
s
suppression
hearing
in
terry
officer
mcfadden
testified
that
when
he
saw
the
men
standing
on
the
street
they
didn
t
look
right
to
him
at
the
time
n
criminologists
delores
jones
brown
and
brian
maule
suggested
that
mcfadden
s
attention
may
have
been
drawn
to
the
men
on
account
of
their
race
n
this
conclusion
is
bolstered
by
a
number
of
ambiguities
and
inconsistencies
in
officer
mcfadden
s
account
of
the
case
as
law
professor
lewis
r
katz
explained
mcfadden
was
not
acquainted
with
either
man
by
name
or
sight
and
he
had
received
a
bsolutely
no
information
regarding
the
men
at
all
officer
mcfadden
did
not
explain
what
about
the
two
men
didn
t
look
right
to
him
the
two
men
were
dressed
in
topcoats
the
standard
dress
of
the
day
they
were
engaged
in
no
unusual
behavior
when
they
initially
attracted
mcfadden
s
attention
when
pressed
on
what
about
the
two
men
attracted
his
interest
and
whether
he
would
pursue
them
as
he
did
if
he
saw
them
that
day
across
from
the
courthouse
officer
mcfadden
replied
i
really
don
t
know
what
happened
as
mcfadden
studied
terry
and
chilton
depends
upon
which
version
of
officer
mcfadden
s
statement
of
the
facts
one
reads
and
in
which
court
opinion
the
facts
appear
mcfadden
watched
the
men
over
a
period
ten
minutes
he
watched
as
one
of
the
two
men
left
the
other
and
walked
down
the
street
and
looked
inside
a
shop
window
and
continued
walking
and
then
walked
back
to
the
other
man
again
looking
in
the
shop
window
the
second
man
then
repeated
the
same
behavior
that
behavior
is
the
critical
conduct
which
gives
rise
to
the
stop
in
this
case
if
they
did
it
once
or
twice
each
their
behavior
was
pretty
unremarkable
so
how
many
times
they
looked
in
the
store
window
is
crucial
in
the
police
report
filed
the
same
day
as
the
incident
officer
mcfadden
wrote
that
the
men
did
this
about
three
times
each
between
the
day
of
the
event
when
he
wrote
the
police
report
and
his
memory
was
freshest
and
the
suppression
hearing
which
was
almost
one
year
to
the
day
after
the
event
officer
mcfadden
s
memory
changed
at
the
suppression
hearing
three
times
each
became
at
least
four
or
five
times
apiece
which
later
turned
into
four
to
six
trips
each
moreover
at
trial
when
asked
how
many
trips
he
observed
officer
mcfadden
replied
about
four
trips
three
to
four
trips
maybe
four
to
five
trips
maybe
a
little
more
it
might
be
a
little
less
i
don
t
know
i
didn
t
count
the
trips
the
ohio
court
of
appeals
decision
in
the
case
picked
up
on
the
uncertainty
and
asserted
that
the
men
separated
and
looked
in
the
window
at
least
two
to
five
times
each
however
by
the
time
the
fact
worked
its
way
into
chief
justice
warren
s
majority
opinion
in
the
supreme
court
the
number
expands
exponentially
he
wrote
that
the
men
did
this
between
five
or
six
times
apiece
in
all
roughly
a
dozen
trips
later
in
the
majority
opinion
chief
justice
warren
came
up
with
still
another
number
when
he
described
terry
and
chilton
s
behavior
where
these
men
pace
alternately
along
an
identical
route
pausing
to
stare
in
the
same
store
window
roughly
twenty
four
times
the
body
of
law
which
stems
from
terry
is
dependent
upon
this
single
fact
officer
mcfadden
was
never
sure
which
store
was
the
subject
of
the
suspects
attention
at
the
suppression
hearing
he
admitted
he
had
no
experience
in
observing
the
activities
of
individuals
who
were
casing
a
store
for
a
robbery
in
the
police
report
officer
mcfadden
indicated
that
they
were
looking
in
an
airline
ticket
office
at
the
suppression
hearing
the
detective
mentioned
an
airline
office
or
a
jewelry
store
n
in
light
of
these
facts
mcfadden
s
inability
to
explain
why
he
was
initially
suspicious
of
the
men
the
ever
changing
number
of
trips
the
men
made
up
and
down
the
street
and
the
uncertainty
of
the
type
of
store
into
which
the
men
were
looking
the
reasonableness
of
the
initial
stop
appears
to
be
more
open
to
debate
than
the
terry
decision
suggests
the
failure
of
the
court
to
address
the
questionable
reasonableness
of
the
stop
in
terry
illustrates
how
the
very
foundation
of
the
reasonable
suspicion
standard
in
american
constitutional
law
masks
racially
disparate
stop
and
frisk
practices
with
the
cloak
of
race
neutrality
n
b
racial
issues
throughout
american
policing
police
scholars
george
kelling
and
mark
moore
developed
a
widely
cited
historical
framework
that
contextualizes
years
of
police
history
into
three
eras
political
reform
and
community
problem
solving
n
though
the
kelling
and
moore
framework
is
useful
for
examining
police
history
it
has
been
criticized
for
overlooking
the
role
of
racism
in
professional
policing
hubert
williams
and
patrick
murphy
for
example
argue
that
the
origins
of
american
policing
are
rooted
in
slave
patrols
in
the
south
and
that
the
advances
that
have
occurred
through
the
reform
and
community
problem
solving
eras
excluded
minority
citizens
n
in
effect
as
policing
progressed
through
the
political
professional
and
community
problem
solving
eras
the
minority
community
was
left
behind
williams
and
murphy
referred
to
this
as
the
minority
view
of
policing
kelling
and
moore
published
their
framework
in
the
late
s
but
the
experiences
of
numerous
agencies
with
stop
and
frisk
suggest
that
williams
and
murphy
s
minority
view
of
policing
is
still
a
stark
reality
the
philadelphia
police
department
ppd
stopped
more
than
citizens
in
prompting
the
american
civil
liberties
union
of
pennsylvania
aclu
pa
to
file
a
federal
lawsuit
in
november
n
the
lawsuit
bailey
v
city
of
philadelphia
alleged
that
the
ppd
was
engaged
in
racial
profiling
the
litigation
resulted
in
a
settlement
agreement
between
the
plaintiffs
and
the
philadelphia
police
department
that
centered
on
quarterly
analysis
of
stop
data
by
the
aclu
pa
appointment
of
an
independent
monitor
retraining
of
officers
and
new
protocols
governing
stop
and
frisk
practices
n
the
aclu
pa
subsequently
reported
to
the
court
and
the
settlement
monitor
that
although
the
number
of
stops
had
declined
by
n
there
had
been
no
significant
improvement
in
the
quality
of
stops
and
frisks
by
our
analysis
pedestrian
stops
are
being
made
without
reasonable
suspicion
in
approximately
of
the
cases
frisks
are
being
conducted
without
reasonable
suspicion
in
over
of
the
cases
by
race
of
the
stops
were
of
minorities
african
americans
and
latinos
and
of
the
frisks
were
of
minorities
the
findings
as
to
impermissible
stops
and
frisks
are
particularly
disturbing
given
the
fact
that
the
police
department
had
the
time
and
resources
following
the
entry
of
the
agreement
to
re
train
its
officers
on
stop
and
frisk
practices
and
to
establish
supervisory
reviews

accountability

collision
between
a
constitutionally
permissible
tactic

in
an
unconstitutional
manner
the
persistent
undercurrent
of
racial
injustice
in

an
effort

new

city
like
many
cities
across
the
united
states
experienced
a
major
spike
in
violence
crime
and
disorder
in
the
s
n
much
of
the
violence
in
new
york
was
driven
by
the
emergence
of
crack
cocaine
and
competition
for
the
drug
market
n
homicides
climbed
steadily
from
in
to
in
n
at
the
same
time
the
city
and
subway
system
were
struggling
with
rampant
social
and
physical
disorder
n
marijuana
heroin
cocaine
and
crack
cocaine
were
regularly
and
openly
being
sold
on
street
corners
blocks
and
city
parks
n
kelling
and
coles
estimated
that
a
pproximately
to
persons
a
night
were
sleeping
in
the
subway
system
n
the
new
york
transit
authority
appointed
william
bratton
as
chief
of
the
transit
police
to
address
crime
and
disorder
in
the
subway
system
n
chief
bratton
partnered
with
criminologist
george
kelling
to
develop
an
enforcement
strategy
based
on
wilson
and
kelling
s
broken
windows
theory
n
that
targeted
low
level
offenses
e
g
turnstile
jumping
as
well
as
social
and
physical
disorder
through
frequent
arrests
and
removals
from
the
subway
system
n
broken
windows
theory
posits
that
minor
forms
of
social
and
physical
disorder
cause
a
breakdown
in
informal
social
control
as
citizen
investment
in
an
area
diminishes
n
as
citizens
withdraw
from
the
area
the
level
of
disorder
increases
and
the
risk
for
more
serious
types
of
crime
to
emerge
becomes
greater
n
the
theory
suggests
that
police
focus
enforcement
efforts
on
disorder
and
quality
of
life
offenses
as
a
mechanism
for
reengaging
law
abiding
citizens
commitment
to
the
area
n
under
chief
bratton
the
transit
police
adopted
a
broken
windows
based
strategy
in
the
subway
system
over
the
next
two
years
the
level
of

dropped
dramatically
and
felony
offenses
declined

rudolph
giuliani
appointed
william

bratton
immediately
began

of
a
broken

based
strategy
throughout

two
policy
initiatives

strategy
first
reclaiming
the
public
spaces
of
new
york
outlined
the
broken
windows
theory
and
articulated
an
order
maintenance
strategy
that
targeted
disorder
and
quality
of
life
offenses
through
systematic
and
aggressive
enforcement
strategies
e
g
replicating
the
subway
strategy
n
second
getting
guns
off
the
streets
of
new
york
n
outlined
the
nypd
s
strategy
to
reduce
gun
violence
through
the
seizure
of
illegal
firearms
and
through
the
intensive
investigation
of
gun
related
incidents
n
stop
and
frisk
emerged
as
the
primary
tactic
to
meet
the
objectives
of
both
policy
initiatives
n
over
the
next
several
years
critics
argued
that
police
over
enforced
quality
of
life
infractions
through
a
zero
tolerance
approach
because
officers
could
easily
justify
the
stops
under
the
reasonable
suspicion
standard
n
as
waldeck
states
there
is
not
any
doubt
that
the
police
use
quality
of
life
offenses
as
excuses
to
fish
for
drugs
guns
or
evidence
of
a
more
serious
crime
n
the
effects
of
the
stop
and
frisk
program
were
immediate
from
to
arrests
rose
by
including
a
increase
in
misdemeanor
arrests
and
a
increase
in
drug
arrests
n
the
nypd
made
approximately
gun
related
arrests
over
a
three
year
period
resulting
in
the
removal
of
more
than
guns
from
the
streets
n
stop
and
frisk
also
produced
a
large
increase
in
arrests
for
marijuana
possession
in
geller
and
fagan
reported
that
there
were
arrests
for
marijuana
possession
marking
a
increase
from
the
previous
decade
n
the
nypd
s
use
of
stop
and
frisk
increased
steadily
in
the
late
s
into
the
twenty
first
century
in
for
example
nypd
officers
conducted
more
than
stop
and
frisks
of
citizens
n
in
the
nypd
implemented
operation
impact
a
hot
spots
strategy
where
police
commanders
identified
twenty
four
high
crime
impact
zones
that
would
be
targeted
with
saturation
foot
patrol
in
combination
with
resources
from
a
variety
of
departmental
divisions
n
stop
and
frisk
activity
increased
dramatically
over
the
next
several
years
peaking
at
more
than
in
n
as
the
frequency
of
stops
increased
critics
attacked
the
strategy
s
low
rates
of
return
jones
brown
and
colleagues
found
that
of
the
stops
in
just
stops
resulted
in
an
arrest
and
an
additional
stops
resulted
in
a
summons
thus
the
percentage
of
innocent
stops
those
not
resulting
in
summons
or
arrest
accounted
for
roughly
n
similarly
the
percentage
of
stops
resulting
in
the
recovery
of
a
gun
dropped
by
from
guns
recovered
out
of
a
total
of
stops
in
to
in
guns
recovered
out
of
a
total
of
stops
n
furthermore
the
percentage
of
citizen
complaints
involving
stops
increased
from
in
to
in
n
as
the
use
of
stop
and
frisk
expanded
dramatically
the
nypd
drifted
away
from
the
central
tenets
of
broken
windows
theory
and
the
program
devolved
into
a
strictly

the
nypd
focused
on
interdiction
of
social

n
these
efforts
led
the
nypd
to
implement

set
of
practices
that
encouraged
the
aggressive
pursuit
of
individuals
through
stop
and
frisks
rather
than
mutually
beneficial
interactions
with
law
abiding
citizens
n
this
zero
tolerance
mentality
compounded
the
police
department
s
disconnect
from
the
community
in
a
number
of
important
ways
first
the
nypd
focused
less
on
preventing
disorder
and
alternatives
to
arrest
and
more
on
aggressively
removing
weapons
and
wanted
criminals
from
the
community
n
second
the
nypd
de
emphasized
informal
interactions
between
police
and
the
community
in
the
manner
advocated
by
both
community
policing
principles
and
broken
windows
theory
n
the
lack
of
police
community
engagement
was
driven
in
large
part
by
the
management
style
that
bratton
embraced
from
the
private
sector

innovative
approaches

over

decades
as
evidence
that
the

is

for

former
nypd
commissioner
raymond
kelly
touted
stop
and
frisk
at
a
news
conference
by
saying
police
stops
are
just
one
component
of
multiple
efforts
by
the
department
that
have
saved
lives
and
driven
the
murder
rate
to
record
lows
in
the
first
years
of
mayor
bloomberg
s
tenure
there
were
fewer
murders
in
new
york
city
compared
to
the
years
prior
to
the
mayor
taking
office
n
former
new
york
city
mayor
michael
bloomberg
similarly
praised
the
effectiveness
of
stop
and
frisk
in
combatting
crime
stating
new
york
is
the
safest
big
city
in
the
nation
and
our
crime
reductions
have
been
steeper
than
any
other
big
city
s
for
instance
if
new
york
city
had
the
murder
rate
of
washington
d
c
more
new
yorkers
would
have
been
killed
last
year
n
whether
stop
and
frisk
caused
or
contributed
to
the
crime
decline
in
new
york
city
is
a
hotly
contested
proposition
n
several
studies
have
suggested
a
causal
connection
corman
and
mocan
reported
that
misdemeanor
arrests
were
associated
with
declines
in
robbery
motor
vehicle
theft
and
grand
larceny
but
not
homicide
assault
burglary
and
rape
n
similarly
kelling
and
sousa
found
that
misdemeanor
arrest
levels
were
significantly
associated
with
reductions
in
violent
crime
while
controlling
for
several
relevant
community
factors
n
smith
and
purtell
found
that
operation
impact
had
a
significant
effect
on
crimes
against
persons
in
impact
zones
n
smith
and
purtell
also
examined
the
effects
of
stop
and
frisk
on
crime
in
new
york
and
they
found
that
there
was
a
significant
inverse
relationship
between
stop
rates
and
robbery
burglary
motor
vehicle
theft
and
homicides
rates
n
zimring
argued
that
new
york
s
crime
decline
from
through
was
largely
attributable
to
the
nypd
s
policing
practices
n
conversely
there
are
a
number
of
studies
indicating
that
the
relationship
between
stop
and
frisk
and
the
crime
decline
in
new
york
city
is
modest
at
best
n
for
instance
rosenfeld
and
fornango
found
that
police
stops
did
not
decrease
robbery
and
burglary
rates
n
in
a
re
analysis
of
kelling
and
sousa
s
data
harcourt
and
ludwig
found
no
significant
relationships
between
policing
minor
disorder
offenses
and
new
york
city
s
crime
decline
n
macdonald
and
colleagues
conducted
a
comprehensive
examination
of
the
crime
effects
of
operation
impact
with
a
specific
focus
on
stop
and
frisk
they
concluded
impact
zones
were
significantly
associated
with
reductions
in
total
reported
crimes
assaults
burglaries
drug
violations
misdemeanor
crimes
felony
property
crimes
robberies
and
felony
violent
crimes
impact
zones
were
significantly
associated
with
increases
in
total
reported
arrests
arrests
for
burglary
arrests
for
weapons
arrests
for
misdemeanor
crimes
and
arrests
for
property
felony
crimes
impact
zones
were
also
significantly
associated
with
increases
in
investigative
stops
for
suspected
crimes
but
only
the
increase
in
stops
made
based
on
probable
cause
indicators
of
criminal
behaviors
were
associated
with
crime
reductions
the
largest
increase
in
investigative
stops
in
impact
zones
was
based
on
indicators
of
suspicious
behavior
that
had
no
measurable
effect
on
crime
the
findings
suggest
that
saturating
high
crime
blocks
with
police
helped
reduce
crime
in
new
york
city
but
that
the
bulk
of
the
investigative
stops
did
not
play
an
important
role
in
the
crime
reductions
the
findings
indicate
that
crime
reduction
can
be
achieved
with
more
focused
investigative
stops
n
c
the
social
costs
regardless
of
the
impact
on
crime
there
is
considerable
evidence
demonstrating
that
the
nypd
s
stop
and
frisk
program
exacted
significant
social
costs
that
were
disproportionately
experienced
by
ethnic
minorities
by
the
end
of
the
s
stop
and
frisk
had
become
a
point
of
contention
among
ethnic
minorities
a
vera
institute
of
justice
study
examined
the
experiences
of
more
than
people
who
had
been
stopped
by
the
nypd

they
had
been

they

out
of

they
were
involved
in

that
the
way

them
was

their
age

that
they
were
treated
worse
than
others

of
their

and
or

n
a
study
by
fagan
and
colleagues
on
stop
and
frisk
in
new
york
city
identified
three
noteworthy
findings
first
stops
within
neighborhoods
take
place
at
rates
in
excess
of
what
would
be
predicted
from
the
separate
and
combined
effects
of
population
demography
physical
and
social
conditions
and
the
crime
rate
this
excess
seems
to
be
concentrated
in
predominately
black
neighborhoods
second
the
excess
stops
in
these
neighborhoods
persist
over
time
even
as
the
black
population
declines
crime
rates
remain
low
and
effectively
unchanged
the
city
s
overall
social
and
economic
health
improves
and
housing
and
other
investments
increase
across
the
city
s
neighborhoods
including
its
poorest
and
most
segregated
neighborhoods
third
there
appears
to
be
a
declining
return
in
crime
detection
from
marginal
increases
in
enforcement
and
this
efficiency
gap
seems
to
grow
over
time
n
the
racial
focus
of
the
nypd
s
stop
and
frisk
program
was
acknowledged
and
minimized
by
city
and
police
department
leaders
n
former
mayor
michael
bloomberg
stated
publicly
that
according
to
the

statistics

we
disproportionately
stop

little

be
devastating

describe
a

so
pervasive
and
hostile
that

statements
by
city

police
leaders
along
with
clear
racial
disproportionality
in
the
administration
of

illustrates
the
persistent
undercurrent
of
racial
injustice
in

an
important
backdrop
for
the
federal
litigation
accusing
the
nypd
of
racially
discriminatory
policing
v
federal
civil
litigation
as
an
instrument
of
police
reform
given
the
decentralized
nature
of
law
enforcement
in

the
federal

are
often
called
upon
to
address
allegations
of
widespread
unconstitutional
police
practices
such
as
discriminatory
stop

frisk
practices
n
there
are
several
avenues
through
which
federal
court
relief
from
unconstitutional
police
practices
can
be
pursued
the
two
most
frequently
used
of
which
are
civil
lawsuits

section
introduced
by
rep
samuel
shellabarger
r
ohio
was
the
subject
of
only
limited
debate
and
was
swiftly
passed
without

n
its
primary
purpose
was
to
provide
a
mechanism
for
private
persons
to
enforce
the
rights
secured
by
the
fourteenth
amendment
n
although
it
has
been
amended
a
few
times
since
its
passage
the
language
of
the
act
today
remains
essentially
unchanged
from
the
original
n
section
was
hardly
used
from
the
time
of
its
enactment
until
the
early
s
n
in
the
u
s
supreme
court
decided
monroe
v
pape
n
that
case
upheld
the
authority
of
the
plaintiff
to
use
as
a
jurisdictional
basis
for
suing
police
officers
who
had
allegedly
conducted
an
illegal
search
of
his
home
in
violation
of
the
fourth
amendment
n
notably
the
court
refused
to
allow
the
lawsuit
to
proceed
against
the
city
of
chicago
as
the
employer
of
the
officers
reasoning
that
congress
had
not
intended
the
word
person
in
to
apply
to
municipalities
n
of
particular
relevance
to
this
article
however
the
court
reversed
itself
on
this
key
issue
in
the
case
of
monell
v
department
of
social
services
of
the
city
of
new
york
n
our
analysis
of
the
legislative
history
of
the
civil
rights
act
of
compels
the
conclusion
that
congress
did
intend
municipalities
and
other
local
government
units
to
be
included
among
those
persons
to
whom
applies
local
governing
bodies
therefore
can
be
sued
directly
under
for
monetary
declaratory
or
injunctive
relief
where
as
here
the
action
that
is
alleged
to
be
unconstitutional
implements
or
executes
a
policy
statement
ordinance
regulation
or
decision
officially
adopted
and
promulgated
by
that
body
s
officers
moreover
although
the
touchstone
of
the
action
against
a
government
body
is
an
allegation
that
official
policy
is
responsible
for
a
deprivation
of
rights
protected
by
the
constitution
local
governments
like
every
other
person
by
the
very
terms
of
the
statute
may
be
sued
for
constitutional
deprivations
visited
pursuant
to
governmental
custom
even
though
such
a
custom
has
not
received
formal
approval
through
the
body
s
official
decisionmaking
channels
n
importantly
municipal
practices
and
customs
are
so
broadly
defined
in
monell
that
the
terms
include
whatever
the
agency
does
routinely
whether
stated
in
official
policy
or
not
such
that
the
practice
amounts
to
a
custom
or
usage
that
is
tantamount
to
formal
law
or
policy
n
if
a
number
of
people
have
been
aggrieved
by
state
actors
whose
conduct
falls
within
a
municipal
policy
practice
or
custom
those
plaintiffs
lawsuits
may
be
certified
as
a
class
action
under
federal
rule
of
civil
procedure
b
n
such
class
action
lawsuits
play
a
critical
role
in
the
enforcement
of
civil
rights
if
the
plaintiffs
are
able
to
establish
the
requirements
to
be
certified
as
a
class
as
they
were
in
floyd
they
can
present
evidence
to
the
court
and
seek
federal
injunctive
relief
against
a
law
enforcement
agency
n
perhaps
because
claims
against
municipalities
can
seek
both
injunctive
relief
and
monetary
remedies
the
decision
in
monell
led
to
a
dramatic
increase
in
civil
litigation
against
police
because
it
opened
the
deep
pockets
of
government
treasuries
to
civil
rights
plaintiffs
n
for
example
from
the

of
los

more

in
a
racial

n
professors
marc
miller
and
ronald
wright
reported
that
although
some
of
these
settlements
garner
intense
media
attention
municipalities
quietly
settle
many
more
lawsuits
than
people
generally
assume
the
majority
of
which
involve
secret
settlements
that
are
filed
under
seal
n
there
have
been
few
evaluations
of
the
impact
of
lawsuits
on
police
misconduct
n
criminologist
candace
mccoy
argues
that
federal
lawsuits
have
led
to
improved
police
practices
because
of
the
unique
role
of
insurance
carriers
n
that
is
in
the
wake
of
the
monell
ruling
many
law
enforcement
agencies
sought
to
reduce
their
exposure
to
lawsuits
by
securing
liability
insurance
n
but
insurance
companies
would
not
offer
attractively
priced
policies
if
police
agencies
could
not
demonstrate
that
they
had
done
everything
possible
to
reduce
the
risk
of
lawsuits
n
insurance
companies
began
devising
risk
management
protocols
for
police
that
specified
mandates
for
training
policy
and
supervision
that
met
national
standards
n
mccoy
notes
that
litigation
coupled
with
the
professional
risk
management
skills
and
oversight
of
the
private
insurance
industry
have
not
been
given
the
credit
they
deserve

the

n
a
number
of
themes
emerge
from
a
close
reading
of
this
handful
of
consent
decree
studies
first
officers
view
consent
decrees
skeptically
and
federal
oversight
negatively
affects
officer
morale
n
second
though
officers
frequently
suggested
that
the
consent
decree
led
to
less
proactive
police
work
results
from
several
studies
showed
increased
levels
of
summons
stops
and
arrests
during
the
consent
decree
n
third
there
is
modest
evidence
that
both
use
of
force
n
and
citizen
complaints
n
decrease
during
consent
decrees
though
research
has
not
demonstrated
that
excessive
or
unlawful
force
declined
during
federal
oversight
fourth
there
is
also
some
evidence
to
suggest
that
public
satisfaction
with
police
increases
as
a
result
of
consent
decrees
n
alternatively
several
studies
have
shown
that
racial
disparities
in
stops
and
arrests
persisted
despite
federal
oversight
n
the
dearth
of
research
on
consent
decrees
and
their
impact
is
troubling
given
their
significant
cost
for
example
the
consent
decree
for
the
lapd
is
estimated
to
have
cost
between
and
million
annually
totaling
million
over
five
years
and
the
cincinnati
police
department
consent
decree
entailed
million

over
the

determined
that

avoid
the
appearance

therefore
ordered
her
removal
from

n
importantly
though
the

did
not
overturn
the
substance
of

several

concerning

the

explore

post

to

these
research
questions
the

first
examine
the

annually
from

the
authors
identify
the

at

precinct
level
and
examine
the
percent
change
in
stop
locations
pre

post

ruling
this
analysis
is
of
particular
interest
because
the
fagan
analyses
in
the
floyd
case
demonstrated
that
nypd
stop
activity
disproportionately
targeted
neighborhoods
and
precincts
where
the
majority
of

were
ethnic
minorities
the
analyses
here
will
assess
whether
the
racially
geographic
concentration
of
stops
has
persisted
post

ruling
third
fagan
s
analyses
in
the

case
demonstrated
that

were

more
likely
to
be
stopped
they
were
also
disproportionately
likely
to

the

descriptively
compare

the

to
determine
whether
reforms
in
stop

if
they
occurred
may
be
associated
with
changes
in
crime
in
new
york
the
current
study
does
suffer
from
several
limitations
that
should
be
acknowledged
first
the
current
study
presents
a
descriptive
year
to
year
comparison
only
which
restricts
statements
about
causality
between
the
federal
civil
litigation
and
changes
in
stop
and
frisk
practices
second
the
findings
are
based
on
nypd
administrative
data
and
several
critics
have
suggested
that
the
uf
data
may
not
be
complete
and
accurate
in
fact
there
are
indications
that
a
substantial
proportion
of
stops
occur
without
formal
documentation
consider
that
jones
brown
and
colleagues
reported
that
although
one
study
estimated
that
approximately
of
all
stops
were
captured
on
uf
forms
an
nypd
commander
estimated
that
only
in
stops
was
documented
by
officers
on
the
uf
n
finally
the
earlier
discussion
demonstrates
that
a
number
of
events
after
the
floyd
ruling
may
have
shaped
the
nypd
s
stop
and
frisk
program
including
media
attention
a
new
mayor
and
a
new
police
commissioner
though
many
of
these
events
are
directly
related
to
the
floyd
ruling
results
should
be
interpreted
in
the
context
of
these
limitations

enormous

the
substantial

discussion
and
conclusion
the
last
years
have
arguably
been
the
most
innovative
in
the
history
of
policing
n
since
the
mid
s
a
host
of
new
strategies
have
emerged
on
the
law
enforcement
landscape
from
problem
oriented
policing
pop
and
community
oriented
policing
cop
to
hot
spots
policing
focused
deterrence
pulling
levers
e
g
targeted
offender
strategies
intelligence
led
policing
and
even
predictive
policing
the
innovation
in
strategies
has
been
matched
by
the
development
of
new
technologies
such
as
geographic
information
systems
gis
crime
analysis
and
advanced
analytics
compstat
dna
and
forensics
license
plate
readers
less
lethal
alternatives
pepper
spray
taser
body
worn
cameras
and
gunshot
detection
systems
n
during
this
period
of
innovation
stop
and
frisk
has
emerged
as
a
preferred
tactic
for
controlling
crime
and
disorder
despite
the
tremendous
innovation
in
policing
one
phenomenon
that
has
remained
unchanged
is
the
undercurrent
of
racial
injustice
the
misuse
and
abuse
of
stop
and
frisk
appears
to
be
the
next
iteration
of
that
injustice
the
stories
of
stop
and
frisk
in
newark
philadelphia
chicago
pittsburgh
and
new
york
illustrate
that
williams
and
murphy
s
minority
view
of
policing
remains
a
stark
reality
the
deaths
of
eric
garner
michael
brown
and
freddie
gray
among
others
demonstrate
the
centrality
of
stop
and
frisk
to
the
persistent
racial
crisis
in
policing
these
tragic
deaths
have
led
to
unprecedented
attention
on
racial
disparities
in
police
actions
best
exemplified
by
the
president
s
task
force
on
st
century
policing
n
and
they
have
facilitated
a
national
dialogue
on
the
need
for
police
accountability
and
reform
as
part
of
this
dialogue
federal
civil
litigation
has
received
considerable
attention
as
a
potential
mechanism
for
police
reform
federal
civil
litigation
can
be
employed
through
a
variety
of
mechanisms
such
as
individual
or
class
action
lawsuits
and
u
s
department
of
justice
actions
via
unfortunately
very
little
research
has
examined
the
impact
of
federal
civil
litigation
on
unconstitutional
police
practices
and
as
a
result
there
is
little
understanding
of
its
effectiveness
or
lack
thereof
as
an
instrument
of
police
reform
a
federal
civil

and

the

generate

the
year

comparison
of

highlights
a
number
of
positive
findings
suggesting
that
the
federal
civil
litigation
has
begun
to
alter
the
unconstitutional
practices
outlined
in
the
floyd
case
first
the
sheer
number
of
stops
conducted
by
officers
has
dropped
dramatically
by
more
than
second
the
geographic
concentration
of
stops
in
mostly
minority
precincts
has
also
declined
an
examination
of
ten
precincts
with
large
minority
populations
showed
that
the
racial
ethnic
concentration
of
stops
has
dropped
by
nearly
overall
in
those
precincts
with
some
precincts
experiencing
declines
of
or
more
third
stops
appear
to
be
more
efficient
and
accurate
the
percentage
of
stops
resulting
in
arrest
has
more
than
doubled
the
percentage
of
stops
where
weapons
and
contraband
were
seized
remain
low
but
those
percentages
have
doubled
or
tripled
compared
to
the

in

the
nypd
has
altered
its
day
to
day
practices
with
regard
to
stop
and
frisk
to
the
benefit
of
thousands
of
new
yorkers
and
importantly
the
reforms
in
the
nypd
s
stop
and
frisk
program
coincided
with
continued
declines
in
crime
and
violence
in
new
york
especially
homicides
which
declined
by
from
to
the
one
negative
finding
is
the
persistence
of
racial
disparities
in
those
subjected
to
stop
and
frisk
minorities
remain
overrepresented
among
those
stopped
frisked
searched
and
arrested
by
the
nypd
according
to
the
census
bureau
the
racial
and
ethnic
composition
of
new

city
is
approximately
white
black
hispanic
asian
and
other
n
in
the
percentage
of
whites
blacks
and
hispanics
combining
black
hispanic
with
white
hispanic
stopped
was
and
respectively
the
authors
acknowledge
that
the
racial
composition
of
a
population
is
a
rough
at
best
benchmark
for
assessing
racial
disparities
other
benchmarks
such
as
the
racial
composition
of
the
arrestee
population
in
new
york
would
suggest
much
smaller
racial
disparities
n
nevertheless
the
stability
in
race
ethnicity
among
those
who
were
stopped
in
and
in
is
troubling
given
that
the
federal
court
determined
that
the
nypd
was
engaged
in
unconstitutional
stop
and
frisks
in
notably
the
persistence
of
racial
disparities
in
new
york
is
consistent
with
findings
from
the
few
studies
that
have
examined
the
impact
of
consent
decrees
on
discriminatory
police
practices
in
other
jurisdictions
e
g
new
jersey
and
los
angeles
n
it
is
clear
that
more
work
needs
to
be
done
in
new
york
but
this
fact
should
not
overshadow
the
considerable
progress
that
the
nypd
has
made
during
the
last
few
years
and
importantly
the
structure
for
effective
police
reform
in
new
york
is
in
place
for
example
recent
changes
have
been
made
to
training
and
policy
the
student
guide
for
patrol
recruits
presents
officers
with
a
more
inclusive
understanding
of
diversity
issues
as
police
officers
you
are
required
to
enforce
the
law
impartially
without
regard
to
actual
or
perceived
race
class
ethnicity
culture
religion
age
gender
sexual
orientation
disability
immigration
or
housing
status
at
the
same
time
we
are
members
of
a
larger
society
in
which
bias
and
discrimination
against
certain
groups
of
people
are
matters
of
historical
and
statistical
fact
as
noted
in
a
recent
speech
by
police
commissioner
bratton
american
policing
has
been
part
of
the
best
of
american
history
but
unfortunately
some
of
the
worst
parts
as
well
understanding
this
history
and
how
it
has
shaped
perceptions
will
help
you
become
a
better
more
effective
police
officer
n
the
nypd
is
also
in
the
process
of
revising
the
patrol
guide
to
provide
clearer
more
accurate
guidance
on
the
proper
legal
standards
for
stop
and
frisk
including
what
constitutes
a
stop
when
a
stop
may
be
conducted
when
a
frisk
may
be
conducted
and
when
a
search
may
be
conducted
a
definition
of
reasonable
suspicion
the
standard
needed
for
a
stop
based
on
terry
v
ohio
that
officers
must
have
separate
reasonable
suspicion
that
a
person
is
armed
and
dangerous
in
order
to
conduct
a
frisk
of
that
person
require
ing
officers
to
document
the
stop
and
reasonable
suspicion
and
if
conducted
the
frisk
on
both
a
stop
report
form
formerly
called
a
uf
and
in
their
activity
logs
require
ing
supervisory
review
of
stops
including
review
of
the
constitutionality
of
the
stop
not
just
that
a
stop
report
form
was
filled
out
and
provid
ing
for
supervisors
to
identify
officers
needing
further
training
and
or
potential
discipline
n
last
the
federal
monitor
reviews
nypd
activities
analyzes
data
and
issues
public
reports
with
recommendations
for
change
the
monitor
s
reports
can
document
progress
but
they
can
also
highlight
deficiencies
in
supervision
policy
and
training
the
reporting
of
deficiencies
provides
a
roadmap
for
continued
reform
and
the
public
nature
of
this
reporting
places
tremendous
pressure
on
the
nypd
to
follow
that
roadmap
and
address
the
identified
deficiencies
in
sum
the
findings
presented
here
show
that
the
nypd
has
made
significant
progress

constitutional
policing
b
larger
lessons
for
federal
civil
litigation
as
an
instrument
for
police
reform
the
federal
court
litigation
in
new
york
was
relatively
unique
since
the
case
was
filed
as
a
class
action
lawsuit
plaintiffs
first
had
to
satisfy
the
four
requirements
for
class
certification
under
federal
rule
of
civil
procedure
b
namely
numerosity
commonality
typicality
and
adequacy
n
then
plaintiffs
were
required
to
demonstrate
fourth
and
fourteenth
amendment
liability
for
the
certified
class
as
a
result
of
the
nypd
s
stop
and
frisk
program
margeson
highlighted
the
power
of
this
federal
civil
litigation
approach
politics
socio
economic
inequality
and
the
accumulation
of
precedent
that
has
diminished
the
likelihood
of
legal
redress
for
fourth
and
fourteenth
amendment
violations
have
effectively
deregulated
police
power
to
conduct
investigative
terry
stops
the
floyd
litigation
demonstrates
the
immense
value
of
judicial
process
to
advocates
of
social
reform
especially
where
the
prospective
beneficiaries
have
been
underserved
by
the
democratic
process
in
floyd
the
democratic
and
judicial
processes
worked
in
tandem
to
effect
a
policy
shift
in
the
oversight
of
police
conduct
that
either
branch
acting
in
isolation
most
probably
would
not
have
achieved
n
though
the
floyd
case
began
as
a
class
action
suit
in
the
judge
s
ruling
in
mimicked
the
oversight
process
outlined
in
as
a
result
the
progress
made
by
the
nypd
in
the
three
years
since
the
floyd
ruling
speaks
directly
to
the
potential
for
consent
decrees
to
effect
change
in
police
departments
only
a
handful
of
studies
have
sought
to
assess
the
effectiveness
of
consent
decrees
on
law
enforcement
agencies
engaged
in
pattern
or
practice
unconstitutional
policing
the
research
is
mixed
but
there
are
modestly
promising
findings
from
that
small
body
of
work
e
g
enhanced
public
satisfaction
implementation
of
new
processes
and
policies
reductions
in
use
of
force
and
citizen
complaints
during
the
consent
decree
and
greater
transparency
via
access
to
department
data
and
independent
monitor
reports
n
more
generally
the
experiences
of
agencies
under
consent
decrees
demonstrate
that
police
reform
is
a
complex
multi
year
process
with
a
high
level
of
difficulty
it
involves
organizational
change
in
a
profession
characterized
by
resistance
to
change
and
the
remedies
target
functions
that
go
to
the
very
core
of
policing
supervision
training
policy
and
accountability
in
short
police
reform
is
a
marathon
not
a
sprint
the
results
from
this
study
demonstrate
that
important
police
reforms
can
be
achieved
early
on
during
the
marathon
as
a
result

it
should
be
noted
that
laws
against
vagrancy
and
loitering
exacerbated
the
problems
attendant
to
unclear
stop
and
frisk
authority
indeed
vagrancy
and
loitering
laws
blurred
suspicion
with
criminal
conduct
by
permitting
the
police
to
make
arrests
and
searches
incident
to
arrest
whenever
someone
seemed
out
of
place
or
presented
as
an
undesirable
in
a
particular
location
see
caleb
foote
vagrancy
type
law
and
its
administration
u
pa
l
rev
it
is
important
to
note
that
two
quite
different
kinds
of
suspicion
are
involved
the
alleged
vagrant
may
be
suspected
of
past
criminality
the
arrest
for
vagrancy
offering
the
opportunity
to
investigate
whether
the
suspect
is
wanted
in
another
jurisdiction
or
has
committed
other
crimes
on
the
other
hand
the
suspicion
may
be
of
future
criminality
the
inference
being
that
purposeful
poverty
is
likely
to
lead
to
other
crimes
unless
the
state
steps

in

much
of
the
crime
prevention
work
accomplished
by
modern
stop
and
frisk
procedures
used
to
be
accomplished
by
vagrancy
and

law
arrests
perhaps
it
is
therefore
unsurprising
that
within
four
years
of

the

over

years
in

marking
a

in
efforts

of

related

in
an
effort
to
identify
patterns
and
markers
that
prejudice
motivated
violence
is
about
to
occur
in
real
time
the
researchers
then
will
compare
the
data
against
records
of
reported
violent
acts
the
u
s
department
of
justice
is
investing
in
research
by
cardiff
university
social
data
science
lab
which
has
been
at
the
forefront
of
predictive
social
media
models
cardiff
university
professor
matthew
williams
said
the
research
is
designed
to
eventually
enable
authorities
to
predict
when
and
where
hate
crime
is
likely
to
occur
and
deploy
law
enforcement
resources
to
prevent
it
the
insights
provided
by
our
work
will
help
u
s
localities
to
design
policies
to
address
specific
hate
crime
issues
unique
to
their
jurisdiction
and
allow
service
providers
to
tailor
their
services
to
the
needs
of
victims
especially
if
those
victims
are
members
of
an
emerging
category
of
hate
crime
targets
his
lab
s
previous
research
in
the
united
kingdom
found
that
twitter
data
can
be
used
to
identify
areas
where
hate
speech
is
occurring
but
where
no
hate
crimes
have
been
committed
this
can
be
useful
researchers
said
in
neighborhoods
with
many
new
immigrants
who
are
unlikely
to
report
the
crime
because
of
fear
of
deportation
in
an
estimated
nonfatal
violent
and
property
hate
crimes
occurred
in
the
united
states
according
to
the
bureau
of
justice
statistics
about
percent
of
those
were
not
reported
the
justice
department
found
of
course
there
is
a
big
difference
between
someone
spouting
off
on
twitter
or
snapchat
and
an
actual
hate
crime
it
is
a
great
idea
in
the
abstract
but
it
is
not
the
panacea
you
might
think
said
brian
levin
executive
director
of
cal
state
san
bernardino
s
center
on
hate
and
extremism
the
problem
is
the
correlation
and
reliability
there
are
many
different
forms
of
social
media
levin
who
has
tracked
both
middle
eastern
terror
groups
and
local
neo
nazi
organizations
also
noted
that
some
hate
groups
don
t
advertise
their
work
on
social
media
local
tensions
may
arise
to
fly
and
be
absent
from
social
media
he
said
some
segments
of
the
community
shun
social
media
so
examining
social
media
as
a
predictor
can
be
a
bit
like
having
one
screwdriver
and
sometimes
it
doesn
t
work
predictive
policing
already
is
in
use
at
the
los
angeles
police
department
and
other
agencies
the
lapd
uses
a
predictive
policing
algorithm
to
deploy
officers
to
locations
where
prior
crime
patterns
strongly
suggest
similar
crimes
may
occur
as
crime
during
the
last
two
decades
has
dropped
dramatically
across
the
nation
and
los
angeles
police
commanders
are
increasingly
looking
for
any
edge
they
can
get
in
cutting
crime
l
a
county
is
particularly
useful
because
a
huge
volume
of
social
media
produces
massive
data
sets
that
increase
the
accuracy
of
predictive
models
over
traditional
crime
analysis
and
trend
chasing
said
pete
burnap
from
cardiff
university
s
school
of
computer
science
and
informatics
predictive
policing
is
a
proactive
law
enforcement
model
that
has
become
more
common
partially
due
to
the
advent
of
advanced
analytics
such
as
data
mining
and
machine
learning
methods
he
said
traditional
predictive
police
modeling
has
paired
historical
crime
records
with
geographical
locations
and
then
made
a
probable
calculation
to
predict
future
crimes
but
twitter
and
social
media
based
models
work
in
real
time
using
what
people
are
talking
about
now
the
algorithms
look
for
particular
language
that
is
likely
to
indicate
the
imminent
occurrence
of
a
crime
british
researchers
began
looking
at
cyber
hate
in
the
aftermath
of
the
killing
of
british
army
soldier
lee
rigby
at
the
hands
of
islamic
extremists
on
a
london
street
in
analysts
collected
twitter
data
and
tested
a
text
classifier
that
distinguished
between
hateful
and
antagonistic
responses
focusing
on
race
ethnicity
and
religion
from
a
computer
at
chicago
s
police
headquarters
on
the
city
s
south
side
deputy
chief
jonathan
lewin
pulls
up
a
list
of
about
names
of
people
with
criminal
records
attached
to
each
name
is
a
mug
shot
demographics
prior
arrest
record
and
gang
affiliation
there
is
also
a
score
determined
by
a
computer
algorithm
based
on
weighted
variables
the
score
measures
the
likelihood
of
a
person
to
be
involved
in
a
shooting
either
as
a
victim
or
an
offender
the
scores
range
from
to
and
the
higher
the
score
the
more
likely
the
person
will
be
a
party
to
violence
this
is
really
evidence
based
policing
says
deputy
chief
lewin
chicago
is
at
the
forefront
of
a
growing
trend
in
police
departments
across
the
united
states
to
use
big
data
and
algorithms
to
determine
the
individuals
and
places
that
are
most
as
risk
for
violence
some
of
these
risk
assessments
are
astonishingly
accurate
but
while
the
people
centered
model
pioneered
in
chicago
is
now
spreading
predictive
policing
so
far
has
not
succeeded
in
bringing
down
the
murder
rate
here
that
s
led
some
to
question
whether
big
data
alone
can
prevent
crimes
it
is
certainly
possible
that
other
factors
such
as
a
breakdown
in
trust
between
police
and
minority
communities
a
need
to
hire
more
officers
or
the
overturning
of
the
city
s
gun
laws
in
federal
court
may
be
driving
the
increase
in
the
murder
rate
which
is
up
percent
over
this
time
last
year
supporters
of
the
data
program
for
their
part
say
they
believe
the
murder
spike
would
be
worse
without
the
predictive
tools
the
idea
that
one
might
be
able
to
target
and
approach
the
human
drivers
and
do
something
about
that
is
obviously
incredibly
attractive
to
police
departments
says
andrew
ferguson
a
law
professor
at
the
university
of
the
district
of
columbia
in
washington
the
difficulty
with
chicago
as
a
laboratory
is
that
predictive
policing
is
obviously
not
working
that
might
not
be
the
fault
of
the
theory
but
just
empirically
we
re
seeing
the
bodies
pile
up
in
the
city
other
cities
however
have
seen
success
in
using
data
to
bring
down
the
crime
rate
the
los
angeles
police
department
lapd
expanded
a
program
to
predict
where
to
deploy
its
officers
to
of
its
divisions
up
from
three
in
after
a
university
of
california
at
los
angeles
study
showed
that
the
computers
prevented
twice
as
much
crime
as
trained
analysts
chicago
uses
a
different
algorithm
and
it
also
may
have
aggravating
factors
contributing
to
its
rise
in
murders
in
the
wake
of
shootings
of
unarmed
minorities
the
city
has
been
wracked
by
months
of
turmoil
and
protests
that
led
to
the
firing
of
the
former
police
chief
the
federal
government
is
investigating
the
shooting
of
unarmed
teenager
laquan
mcdonald
and
a
months
long
investigation
by
the
police
accountability
task
force
concluded
in
april
that
the
chicago
police
department
has
a
history
of
using
excessive
force
against
minorities
and
perpetuating
a
code
of
silence
can
you
imagine
where
we
d
be
if
everyone
wasn
t
working
as
hard
as
they
were
now
says
christopher
mallette

director

chicago
violence
reduction
strategy
the
reason
that
we
struggle
with
a
solution
is
that
people
don
t
want
to
look
at
the
problem
in
its
totality
we
want
to
look
at
the
part
that
makes
sense
to
us
can
math
save
lives
predictive
policing
has
its
origins
in
a
program
started
in
by
the
lapd
that
early
program
used
analytical
techniques
to
determine
locations
that
were
most
at
risk
for
criminal
activity
chicago
became
the
first
city
to
use
a
people
centered
model
when
it
launched
the
first
version
of
its
strategic
subject
list
algorithm
in
based
on
the
public
health
concept
that
crime
is
like
a
contagion
that
can
spread
from
person
to
person
the
model
analyzes
social
networks
to
determine
who
is
most
likely
to
be
involved
in
violent
crimes
since
then
kansas
city
los
angeles
and
new
orleans
have
started
using
big
data
to
determine
who
among
their
population
is
most
at
risk
sixty
six
people
were
killed
in
the
city
in
may
alone
making
last
month
the
deadliest
may
in
years
more
than
percent
of
shooting
victims
and
percent
of
individuals
arrested
for
shootings
in
so
far
have
been
on
the
ssl
so
why
hasn
t
the
accuracy
of
the
algorithm
translated
into
less
crime
on
the
street
professor
ferguson
says
that
while
many
initially
saw
big
data
as
a
panacea
for
reducing
crime
realistically
it
may
be
better
at
identifying
problems
that
preventing
murders
people
should
recognize
that
big
data
does
provide
real
insights
and
allows
you
to
see
things
that
you
might
not
see
without
the
data
says
ferguson
but
the
solution
is
not
in
the
data
it
s
in
what
you
do
with
the
data
i
think
what
a
lot
of
people
have
done
is
take
the
first
step
which
is
the
easier
step
to
crunch
the
numbers
and
not
taken
the
second
step
which
is
to
ask
now
that
we
ve
identified
these
risks
how
do
we
remedy
this
the
home
visit
model
in
chicago
law
enforcement
officers
community
members
and
social
service
agencies
all
take
part
in
the
home
visits
called
custom
notifications
the
police
department
does
for
people
on
the
strategic
subject
list
during
the
home
visit
police
officers
warn
the
person
on
the
ssl
and
their
family
that
they
are
in
danger
of
either
being
shot
killed
or
put
in
prison
then
a
community
partner
offers
help
in
the
form
of
job
training
opportunities
substance
abuse
counseling
and
better
housing
options
this
carrot
and
stick
model
comes
from
a
realization
on
the
police
department
s
part
that
as
new
superintendent
eddie
johnson
said
in
an
interview
we
cannot
arrest
our
way
out
of
this
situation
but
at
the
same
time
superintendent
johnson
says
that
those
who
do
not
accept
the
offer
of
help
on
custom
notification
visits
should
not
expect
leniency
what
those
individuals
need
to
know
if
they
choose
to
stay
in
that
lifestyle
we
ll
come
after
them
with
everything
that
we
have
says
johnson
rand
corp
is
currently
studying
the
effectiveness
of
chicago
s
ssl
and
its
data
informed
interventions
according
to
the
individuals
who
go
on
home
visits
results
thus
far
have
been
mixed
roughly
in
home
visits
results
in
someone
accepting
an
offer
of
help
according
to
mr
mallette
who
invites
representatives
from
one
of
six
outreach
and
support
organizations
to
each
house
call
he
says
that
the
police
have
connected
with
between
and
individuals
through
custom
notification
during
the
past
three
years
while
it
s
too
early
to
tell
the
long
term
effect
of
the
house
visits
mallette
says
that
he
s
seen
some
changes
in
those
individuals
in
the
short
term
chicago
police
deputy
chief
dave
mcnaughton
recalls
one
occasion
where
he
went
to
do
a
custom
notification
for
a
young
man
he
says
his
mother
was
in
complete
denial
about
her
son
s
risk
for
gun
violence
she
pretty
much
told
us
to
leave
the
home
which
we
did
of
course
says
deputy
chief
mcnaughton
i
remember
three
days
later
there
was
a
person
shot
right
behind
her
house
that
was
playing
with
her
son
on
the
same
day
that
mcnaughton
met
the
mother
he
did
a
custom
notification
for
a
person
who
was
deeply
involved
in
the
violence
in
the
th
police
district
on
chicago
s
southwest
side
he
met
with
the
subject
s
significant
other
and
she
accepted
their
offers
of
help
the
couple
got
services
to
move
out
of
the
neighborhood
and
mcnaughton
says
that
person
has
not
been
involved
in
violence
since
who
should
take
the
lead
ferguson
says
that
part
of
the
problem
with
chicago
s
data
driven
interventions
might
be
the
very
fact
that
the
police
are
the
ones
leading
them
like
risk
assessment
lists
in
many
cities
chicago
s
strategic
subject
list
is
made
available
only
to
law
enforcement
officers
and
is
not
given
out
to
the
social
service
agencies
who
lead
violence
prevention
programs
or
to
the
community
groups
who
may
know
the
individuals
most
at
risk
to
me
the
big
mistake
of
all
of
this
is
putting
predictive
policing
in
the
hands
of
the
police
says
ferguson
the
identifying
of
risk
within
a
society
should
be
put
in
the
hands
of
other
social
service
entities
it
should
be
with
the
larger
city
rather
than
just
the
police
mallette
agrees
that
the
community
should
play
an
important
role
in
data
driven
interventions
our
focus
isn
t
on
locking
people
up
our
focus
is
on
saving
people
s
lives
says
mallette
we
re
trying
to
take
active
measures
to
try
and
provide
assistance
from
multiple
angles
law
enforcement
is
doing
what
law
enforcement
is
doing
our
message
is
that
the
community
loves
you
we
value
you
but
we
need
you
in
your
rightful
place
three
years
ago
milpitas
police
department
had
hopes
of
employing
a
new
crime
fighting
technology
that
bordered
on
something
one
might
see
in
a
science
fiction
movie
but
about
a
year
after
the
city
authorized
a
three
year
contract
with
california
based
predpol
inc
for
so
called
predictive
policing
software
which
uses
mathematics
social
science
and
probability
to
geographically
pinpoint
and
ultimately
reduce
crime
the
department
pulled
the
plug
on
the
agreement
after
approximately
one
year
of
usage
it
was
our
experience
that
the
minimal
benefit
did
not
justify
continuing
costs
milpitas
police
chief
steve
pangelinan
said
last
week
in
police
here
were
interested
in
predpol
s
web
based
algorithmic
software
that
calculates
historic
crime
trends
demographics
and
even
the
weather
in
order
to
deploy
officers
to
areas
that
experience
the
most
crime
at
the
time
pangelinan
told
this
newspaper
the
predictive
technology
had
the
ability
to
locate
crime
to
an
area
as
small
as
feet
by
feet
in
total
it
will
hopefully
reduce
crime
pangelinan
previously
said
fast
forward
three
years
and
the
police
chief
found
the
software
less
than
stellar
it
was
our
experience
that
we
often
did
not
have
sufficient
staff
to
post
officers
at
predpol
identified
locations
and
still
remain
responsive
to
priority
calls
for
service
pangelinan
said
he
added
his
police
force
discovered
that
within
milpitas
approximately
square
miles
the
existing
internal
processes
of
tracking
crime
and
identifying
potential
areas
of
exposure
were
often
more
accurate
than
results
received
from
predpol
since
ditching
predpol
pangelinan
asserted
milpitas
police
are
not
using
similar
crime
predictive
technologies
in
part
due
to
the
size
of
the
city
i
think
the
predpol
system
may
have
greater
benefit
to
law
enforcement
organizations
policing
much
larger
geographical
jurisdictions
where
greater
variables
in
crime
patterns
may
exist
he
said
when
the
city
s
police
force
had
envisioned
using
predpol
the
technology
had
come
with
some
fanfare
that
included
time
magazine
which
called
the
predictive
policing
software
one
of
the
best
inventions
of
similarly
a
associated
press
story
on
the
new
technology
stated
los
angeles
police
department
was
the
largest
agency
to
embrace
the
technology
predpol
s
website
states
its
tool
was
developed
over
the
course
of
six
years
by
a
team
of
mathematicians
and
social
scientists
at
the
university

at

predpol
states
the
mission
for
its
software
is
simple

and
claim

in
those

the
firm
s

states
according
to
pangelinan
there
was
no
real
cost
to
the

for

of

he
said
meanwhile
pangelinan
asserted
that
crime
rates
which
can
be
cyclical
rising
and
falling
year
over
year
in
the
city
of
milpitas
has
been
declining
as
of
late
he
said
the
federal
bureau
of
investigation
s
part
serious
violent
crimes
such
as
murder
rape
robbery
aggravated
assault
auto
theft
arson
burglary
have
all
seen
decreases
in
milpitas
in
the
last
year
or
so
in
we
realized
a
percent
increase
in
fbi
part
crimes
and
in
a
percent
increase
however
in

in
these

categories
declined
by

pangelinan
said
through
may

in
these

are
down

in

pangelinan
would
not

the

fascinates
whether

the

n
or
the

n
the
reality
is
quite
a
bit
more
pedantic
astronauts
travel
into
the

via
the
relativistic
effects
of
time
dilation
it
is
true
but
in
an
amount
measured
in
milliseconds
n
to
do
anything
more
impressive
would
require
greater
speeds
than
are
currently
possible
n
gazing
at
the
stars
is
seeing
events
of
time
past
it
is
true
n
but
i
can
do
the
same
by
inserting
a
dvd
or
opening
a
book
travel
into
the
past
remains
the
domain
and
dispute
of
theoretical
physics
and
its
einstein
rosen
bridges
more
commonly
known
as
wormholes
meaning
that
so
far
as
we
know
traveling
backwards
in
time
might
prove
forever
impossible
n
so
much
for
science
n
yet
when
it
comes
to
criminal
investigation
time
travel
seems
increasingly
possible
it
is
not
actually
time
travel
of
course
and
it
has
longstanding
roots
in
traditional
investigation
but
science
has
provided
us
remarkably
complete
historical
records
in
the
form
of
digital
data
n
well
over
a
half
century
ago
justice
robert
h
jackson
recognized
that
it
would
no
doubt
simplify
enforcement
of
all
criminal
laws
if
each
citizen
were
required
to
keep
a
diary
that
would
show
where
he
was
at
all
times
with
whom
he
was
and
what
he
was
up
to
n
the
law
requires
no
such
diary
only
in
certain
sector
specific
instances
such
as
banking
prescription
records
or
hotel
registries
has
the
law
itself
created
comprehensive
records
n
nonetheless
we
increasingly
create
a
diary
like
that
justice
jackson
envisioned
via
our
smartphones
and
online
technologies
and
we
even
helpfully
carry
it
with
us
wherever
we
go
further
the
national
security
agency
nsa
has
demonstrated
that
data
from
various
third
party
sources
might
be
gathered
stored
and
later
queried
for
evidence
of
criminality
or
in
that
case
evidence
of
threats
to
national
security
n
in
short
we
are
living
in
the
golden
age
of
surveillance
n
and
lest
we
think
criminal
investigation
can
only
offer
that
elusive
travel
back
in
time
developments
in
data
mining
and
machine
learning
are
demonstrating
that
significant
human
behavior
is
predictable
for
example
one
study
using
mobile
phone
data
found
that
location
is
predictable
n
and
based
only
upon
facebook
likes
a
computer
was
able
to
better
predict
personality
and
personal
problems
including
substance
abuse
than
real
life
friends
n
so
the
more
we
learn
about
the
past
the
better
we
can
predict
the
future
n
we
have
not
reached
anything
like
the
world
of
philip
k
dick
s
the
minority
report
with
its
mutant
forward
seeing
precogs
n
or
the
world
of
lewis
padgett
s
private
eye
with
its
ever
recording
surroundings
n
but
as
is
so
often
the
case
today
s
science
is
creeping
towards
yesterday
s
science
fiction
so
what
happens
as
technology
increasingly
permits
capture
of
almost
all
information
how
should
we
and
our
constitutional
jurisprudence
approach
bulk
government
capture
such
as
by
a
solar
powered
drone
employing
wide
area
persistent
stare
technology
n
or
by
a
massive
system
of
interconnected
ground
cameras
n
is
it
equivalent
to
a
general
warrant
that
can
never
be
reasonable
or
is
that
too
simplistic
an
analogy
n
the
general
warrant
permitted
indiscriminate
searching
not
merely
storing
is
such
direct
gathering
meaningfully
different
from
what
the
government
could
obtain
from
a
private
party
gathering
such
data
either
by
drone
n
or
by
a
vast
network
of
interconnected
cameras
n
is
it
meaningfully
different
from
what
is
available
via
an
internet
service
provider
that
logs
all
of
our
online
activity
or
from
a
mobile
phone
company
tracking
all
of
our
movements
what
about
searches
of
our
own
devices
that
spy
upon
us
like
our
computers
that
log
information
we
do
not
realize
or
desire
can
the
government
forever
freeze
and
store
that
data
creating
a
mini
targeted
time
machine
can
it
do
the
same
by
recording
every
home
that
officers
enter
perhaps
via
officer
body
cameras
while
it
may
not
be
immediately
obvious
what
to
do
about
these
disparate
fourth
amendment
time
machines
there
is
value
in
considering
them
for
what
they
are
we
should
consider
how
they
affect
the
security
in
our
persons
houses
papers
and
effects
n
and
we
should
consider
their
benefits
to
criminal
investigation
and
perhaps
separately
to
front
end
deterrence
we
have
always
known
that
limited
government
norms
like
that
expressed
in
the
fourth
amendment
are
anti
accuracy
if
police
could
enter
any
home
at
will
or
even
were
quartered
there
we
would
have
less
crime
n
but
life
would
be
insufferable
and
so
we
accept
more
crime
in
return
for
more
liberty
while
always
attempting
not
only
the
ideal
balance
whatever
that
might
be
but
also
always
seeking
pareto
superior
moves
that
increase
one
without
lessening
the
other
as
science
increasingly
permits
capture
without
immediate
human
observation
does
this
call
for
a
fundamental
rethinking
should
we
in
certain
instances
abandon
entirely
front
end
limitations
on
capture
so
long
as
we
are
guaranteed
evenhanded
treatment
that
traditional
investigation
lacks
and
back
end
limitations
on
access
use
and
distribution
can
we
ever
feel
secure
if
there
is
a
government
database
of
ruin
that
could
be
accessed
at
any
moment
n
yet
can
we
turn
our
backs
on
the
ability
to
save
lives
and
livelihoods
and
in
a
manner
that
uniformly
distributes
the
privacy
costs
n
for
some
perhaps
the
failed
east
german
state
and
its
stasi
is
sufficient
answer
a
view
to
which
i
am
personally
sympathetic
n
but
of
course
access
to
those
secret
police
files
was
not
strictly
circumscribed
by
fair
legal
process
and
more
importantly
the
data
in
the
files
were
created
by
and
for
officers
of
the
state
should
the
same
rules
apply
when
data
are
created
for
other
beneficial
purposes
or
will
never
be
subject
to
human
analysis
except
upon
demonstrated
cause
n
and
if
it
becomes
the
case
that
either
on
account
of
lack
of
political
will
or
perhaps
on
account
of
very
broadly
interpreted
first
amendment
rights
private
third
parties
retain
all
data
n
is
there
a
realistic
way
to
keep
them
out
of
government
hands
or
do
the
more
important
questions
essentially
once
again
amount
to
access
use
and
disclosure
if
a
store
everything
world
is
so
abhorrent
and
i
personally
believe
it
might
be
then
why
do
we
keep
rushing
towards
precisely
that
n
big
questions
rarely
have
small
or
singular
answers
and
this
article
will
hardly
provide
either
but
it
can
begin
the
conversation
or
more
accurately
continue
it
under
different
framing
it
does
so
in
the
following
manner
part
i
reminds
us
what
the
national
security
agency
was
attempting
with
its
bulk
telephone
metadata
collection
and
then
looks
at
two
recent
court
decisions
one
by
a
second
circuit
panel
in
united
states
v
ganias
now
headed
en
banc
n
and
one
from
the
united
states
supreme
court
in
riley
v
california
n
each
of
which
articulates
a
realization
that
historic
digital
data
are
meaningfully
different
for
fourth
amendment
purposes
it
then
considers
the
supreme
court
s
most
recent
fourth
amendment
decision
city
of
los
angeles
v
patel
in
which
the
court
floats
the
proposition
that
record
keeping
for
purposes
of
deterrence
might
be
a
special
need
subject
to
more
lenient
fourth
amendment
rules
n
all
three
decisions
and
the
nsa
metadata
program
concern
what
might
be
considered
fourth
amendment
time
machines
part
ii
canvasses
the
important
principles
of
information
privacy
that
are
at
stake
part
iii
then
travels
back
in
time
to
consider
a
proposal
by
harold
krent
in
which
he
argues
the
fourth
amendment
should
employ
use
restrictions
upon
data
law
enforcement
has
lawfully
acquired
n
the
second
circuit
panel
in
ganias
would
have
recognized
such
a
restriction
n
it
would
of
course
be
a
significant
further
move
to
argue
that
the
fourth
amendment
might
be
satisfied
by
such
restrictions
alone
a
move
i
believe
is
fraught
with
great
danger
in
most
contexts
but
perhaps
there
are
limited
contexts
in
which
a
move
to
solely
use
restrictions
is
one
that
legislatures
courts
agencies
and
commentators
should
at
least
debate
if
not
begin
to
experiment
with
particularly
when
designed
by
legislatures
perhaps
programs
of
uniform
applicability
should
generally
be
considered
constitutionally
reasonable
and
if
there
is
any
chance
we
are
ever
to
rely
solely
upon
back
end
limitations
in
the
world
of
fourth
amendment
time
machines
it
would
be
best
to
start
learning
now
in
smaller
spheres
whether
such
means
can
ever
alone
guarantee
the
securities
promised
by
the
fourth
amendment
thus
perhaps
an
ideal
sphere
for
experimentation
might
be
officer
body
cameras
here
the
benefits
of
always
recording
are
sufficiently
great
and
the
domain
sufficiently
narrow
that
it
seems
reasonable
and
perhaps
wise
to
always
record
and
to
rely
upon
access
use
and
disclosure
limitations
to
protect
our
security
interests
i
the
nsa
hard
drives
cell
phones
and
hotel
registries
on
june
glenn
greenwald
broke
the
first
story
based
upon
the
disclosures
of
former
nsa
contractor
edward
snowden
n
pursuant
to
an
order
from
the
secret
foreign
intelligence
surveillance
court
verizon
business
was
providing
the
national
security
agency
on
an
ongoing
daily
basis
all
call
detail
records
or
telephony
metadata
created
for
communications
i
between
the
united
states
and
abroad
or
ii
wholly
within
the
united
states
including
local
telephone
calls
n
telephony
metadata
was
defined
to
include
originating
and
terminating
telephone
number
and
time
and
duration
of
the
call
n
the
nsa
was
creating
a
database
of
all
telephone
calls
made
on
the
verizon
business
network
similar
orders
were
issued
to
other
carriers
such
that
the
nsa
was
databasing
virtually
all
telephone
calls
made
or
received
in
the
united
states
n
why
perhaps
no
program
of
surveillance
is
surprising
for
an
agency
that
eerily
declares
its
collection
posture
as
sniff
it
all
know
it
all
collect
it
all
process
it
all
exploit
it
all
partner
share
it
all
n
but
why
in
particular
did
the
nsa
want
to
gather
these
phone
records
because
the
nsa
wanted
a
time
machine
n
say
on
august
the
agency
obtained
reason
to
believe
a
particular
telephone
number
was
being
used
by
a
terrorist
that
might
lead
to
a
court
order
requiring
the
provider
to
place
a
pen
register
and
trap
and
trace
device
on
that
line
n
but
of
course
the
line
might
at
this
point
be
abandoned
or
at
least
this
would
not
reveal
communications
made
in
the
past
so
a
court
order
might
require
the
provider
to
produce
historic
records
n
only
the
provider
might
have
retained
those
records
for
only
a
limited
duration
moreover
the
nsa
wanted
guaranteed
access
not
only
to
the
numbers
with
which
had
communicated
first
hop
but
also
the
numbers
with
which
those
first
hop
numbers
had
communicated
second
hop
and
further
the
numbers
with
which
those
second
hop
persons
had
communicated
third
hop
n
the
amount
of
data
is
growing
exponentially
such
that
if
each
telephone
number
communicated
with
one
hundred
others
the
nsa
is
looking
at
one
million
records
quite
convenient
then
to
have
everything
stored
and
ready
to
query
in
their
own
servers
time
machines
are
handy
like
that
n
the
nsa
claimed
statutory
authorization
to
create
this
historical
repository
n
was
found
in
section
of
the
usa
patriot
act
n
whether
or
not
it
would
be
ideal
to
create
such
time
machines
the
nsa
was
certainly
wrong
in
claiming
it
had
been
granted
here
n
thus
the
co
author
of
usa
patriot
worked
to
enact
legislation
that
has
for
now
shut
down
this
particular
program
at
least
in
the
sense
that
the
telephone
records
are
no
longer
being
centralized
from
all
providers
and
held
by
the
government
n
but
this
has
not
been
the
first
such
government
attempt
n
and
it
would
be
startling
if
it
is
the
last
there
is
nothing
particularly
special
about
telephone
numbers
that
make
them
the
only
useful
time
machine
metadata
the
same
use
could
be
made
of
financial
internet
and
other
data
n
in
rejecting
the
nsa
s
contention
that
its
bulk
collection
satisfied
the
required
relevance
threshold
the
second
circuit
reasoned
as
follows
if
information
can
be
deemed
relevant
solely
because
of
its
necessity
to
a
particular
process
that
the
government
has
chosen
to
employ
regardless
of
its
subject
matter
then
so
long
as
the
government
develops
an
effective
means
of
searching
through
everything
in
order
to
find
something
everything
becomes
relevant
to
its
investigations
and
the
government
s
technological
capacity
to
ingest
information
and
sift
through
it
efficiently
would
be
the
only
limit
to
what
is
relevant
n
this
criticism
first
made
by
the
privacy
and
civil
liberties
oversight
board
is
a
fair
criticism
of
the
nsa
s
interpretation
of
relevance
in
that
it
is
an
interpretation
inconsistent
with
legal
tradition
but
notice
the
proposition
is
not
illogical
if
later
searches
would
prove
useful
in
investigating
national
security
threats
or
crime
the
existence
of
the
database
is
relevant
to
a
legitimate
government
role
and
the
program
did
include
audit
security
and
reporting
requirements
n
but
again
in
this
case
it
was
clear
this
novel
interpretation
was
not
one
congress
intended
the
second
circuit
was
correct
that
such
expansive
development
of
government
repositories
of
formerly
private
records
would
be
an
unprecedented
contraction
of
the
privacy
expectations
of
all
americans
perhaps
such
a
contraction
is
required
by
national
security
needs
in
the
face
of
the
dangers
of
contemporary
domestic
and
international
terrorism
but
we
would
expect
such
a
momentous
decision
to
be
preceded
by
substantial
debate
and
expressed
in
unmistakable
language
n
instead
usa
patriot
and
its
legislative
sponsors
intended
and
therefore
used
the
traditional
language
of
legal
relevance
n
but
what
if
the
debate
occurred
and
that
unmistakable
language
did
come
about
then
there
would
of
course
be
the
question
of
whether
it
is
a
method
of
investigation
the
constitution
will
abide
although
the
second
circuit
did
not
decide
this
constitutional
issue
it
recognized
the
issue
as
one
of
the
most
difficult
issues
in
fourth
amendment
jurisprudence
the
extent
to
which
modern
technology
alters
our
traditional
expectations
of
privacy
n
is
this
an
issue
of
technology
after
all
was
not
the
first
investigating
time
machine
an
officer
taking
notes
on
what
she
hears
and
sees
not
to
mention
the
myriad
recordkeeping
requirements
imposed
by
the
modern
industrial
state
three
recent
decisions
shed
more
light
on
this
issue
a
panel
decision
in
the
second
circuit
now
headed
en
banc
considering
a
digital
time
machine
in
the
form
of
government
preservation
of
private
computer
hard
drives
n
a
decision
by
the
united
states
supreme
court
considering
a
voluntarily
compiled
and
carried
digital
time
machine
in
the
form
of
a
mobile
phone
n
and
another
decision
by
the
supreme
court
considering
much
more
old
fashioned
recordkeeping
in
the
form
of
a
hotel
guest
registry
n
a
ganias
and
preservation
of
hard
drives
in
november
of
federal
agents
executed
a
search
warrant
on
the
accounting
offices
of
stavros
ganias
n
ganias
himself
was
not
the
target
but
rather
the
army
was
investigating
one
of
his
clients
with
whom
the
army
contracted
n
the
agents
executing
the
warrant
therefore
did
not
remove
ganias
s
three
computers
respecting
his
as
an
ongoing
business
but
instead
mirrored
the
hard
drives
making
exact
duplications
thereof
n
forensics
examiners
thereafter
copied
that
data
onto
two
sets
of
identical
dvds
thereby
preserving
the
government
originals
from
any
harm
occasioned
by
access
n
that
access
would
not
occur
for
eight
months
until
july
when
army
forensics
agents
began
to
review
the
dvds
pursuant
to
the
search
warrant
n
when
they
discovered
the
suspect
business
might
have
committed
tax
fraud
they
shared
a
copy
of
the
data
with
the
irs
n
and
together
the
two
sets
of
investigators
ultimately
identified
all
responsive
material
by
december
of
n
nonetheless
the
agents
did
nothing
to
try
and
delete
or
return
the
non
responsive
material
unlike
for
seized
physical
items
these
agents
never
consider
deleting
or
returning
non
responsive
digital
data
n
you
never
know
what
data
you
may
need
in
the
future
testified
one
n
in
july
of
some
twenty
months
after
the
search
of
ganias
s
office
and
corresponding
seizure
of
his
computer
data
army
and
irs
investigators
came
to
believe
that
ganias
might
have
been
underreporting
income
and
therefore
expanded
their
investigation
to
include
him
as
a
suspect
n
they
therefore
wanted
to
have
another
look
at
his
files
but
appropriately
did
not
consider
their
mere
possession
of
those
files
to
authorize
further
searches
thereof
n
to
understand
why
one
must
first
consider
traditional
searches
and
basic
fourth
amendment
law
when
police
search
a
home
pursuant
to
a
warrant
they
may
look
only
where
sought
after
items
can
be
n
and
they
may
seize
only
things
the
warrant
authorizes
or
things
so
located
for
which
authority
for
seizure
is
immediately
apparent
such
as
child
pornography
or
obviously
illegal
drugs
n
these
things
are
said
to
be
in
plain
view
n
so
for
example
police
searching
for
a
large
knife
should
not
open
a
small
book
at
all
it
cannot
contain
the
sought
after
knife
and
therefore
is
not
subject
to
search
whereas
police
searching
for
a
knife
and
any
threatening
communications
could
peruse
the
small
book
but
upon
finding
it
to
contain
entirely
unrelated
material
police
of
course
must
leave
the
book
behind
unless
that
material
is
independently
subject
to
seizure
meaning
the
officer
has
probable
cause
to
believe
it
either
the
fruit
of
crime
it
appears
to
be
a
rare
book
that
was
reported
stolen
an
instrumentality
of
crime
it
appears
to
be
the
very
book
used
to
lure
a
young
victim
contraband
it
appears
to
contain
child
pornography
or
evidence
of
crime
it
appears
to
contain
the
planning
for
a
recent
bank
robbery
n
in
rare
instances
large
quantities
of
physical
documents
might
be
impossible
to
sort
onsite
but
then
special
rules
are
to
be
followed
n
with
computers
everything
is
done
differently
because
they
contain
so
much
disparate
data
and
in
so
many
formats
police
cannot
reasonably
be
expected
to
bring
experts
to
sufficiently
sort
through
it
on
site
n
thus
courts
all
permit
over
seizure
of
digital
evidence
in
every
instance
the
entire
hard
drive
say
can
be
seized
even
though
much
most
or
even
all
of
its
contents
entire
libraries
of
digital
materials
let
alone
files
arguably
equivalent
to
that
small
book
found
in
the
hypothetical
home
search
are
in
fact
entirely
innocent
n
investigators
have
thus
obtained
a
time
machine
following
the
november
execution
of
the
search
warrant
ganias
modified
the
relevant
files
n
therefore
had
the
government
not
over
seized
and
then
retained
digital
content
that
it
knew
was
not
relevant
to
the
first
investigation
and
therefore
which
was
not
covered
by
the
original
warrant
this
evidence
would
not
have
existed
n
yet
because
agents
did
retain
not
only
the
exact
copies
of
his
hard
drive
but
also
the
dvds
the
data
did
exist
and
they
might
retain
such
data
for
ten
twenty
or
a
hundred
years
n
so
pursuant
to
another
warrant
obtained
in
april
some
two
and
a
half
years
after
the
data
s
seizure
the
government
once
again
searched
the
data
and
found
incriminating
evidence
time
machines
are
handy
like
that
the
second
circuit
panel
addressed
just
this
time
machine
functionality
although
its
opinion
is
now
vacated
pending
en
banc
review
n
we
consider
a
limited
question
whether
the
fourth
amendment
permits
officials
executing
a
warrant
for
the
seizure
of
particular
data
on
a
computer
to
seize
and
indefinitely
retain
every
file
on
that
computer
for
use
in
future
criminal
investigations
we
hold
that
is
does
not
n
the
over
two
year
retention
of
ganias
s
unresponsive
data
retained
a
year
and
a
half
after
the
government
had
concluded
it
was
non
responsive
violated
the
fourth
amendment
n
or
at
the
very
least
its
use
in
a
future
criminal
investigation
did
n
i
agree
though
i
differ
from
the
panel
s
reasoning
the
panel
believed
the
government
s
position
would
mean
that
every
warrant
to
search
for
particular
electronic
data
would
become
in
essence
a
general
warrant
n
that
does
not
seem
quite
apt
as
a
general
warrant
permitted
the
executive
to
search
anyone
s
house
for
information
of
interest
n
or
at
least
one
person
s
house
for
anything
incriminating
n
whereas
both
in
and
in
the
government
obtained
a
warrant
demonstrating
particularized
suspicion
towards
ganias
s
data
and
in
each
instance
agents
thereafter
only
looked
for
the
responsive
data
instead
the
government
s
position
would
turn
every
computer
warrant
into
an
investigative
time
machine
it
is
a
serious
invasion
if
the
government
can
over
seize
massive
amounts
of
private
information
and
forever
retain
it
for
indefinite
later
search
one
can
understand
the
concern
of
the
government
which
is
that
if
the
data
are
not
retained
in
their
original
form
it
might
be
difficult
to
answer
later
claims
of
unreasonable
search
or
challenges
to
authentication
n
but
like
the
panel
i
do
not
see
that
as
an
impossible
hurdle
n
so
perhaps
the
panel
s
answer
is
broadly
the
right
answer
maybe
the
fourth
amendment
bans
even
relatively
small
digital
time
machines
no
matter
how
useful
no
matter
how
regulated
and
no
matter
how
democratically
conceived
and
applied
the
government
can
retain
the
data
for
its
original
purposes
as
long
as
it
must
but
cannot
search
the
data
for
any
other
or
perhaps
such
time
machines
are
only
permissible
where
government
need
is
at
its
highest
such
as
for
purposes
of
national
security
or
where
the
retention
was
pursuant
to
a
carefully
structured
and
fairly
inclusive
legislative
authorization
i
will
return
to
these
questions
below
the
immediate
point
is
merely
to
highlight
that
digital
evidence
has
made
these
questions
increasingly
pressing
the
supreme
court
came
to
the
same
realization
when
it
considered
searches
of
cell
phones
incident
to
lawful
arrest
b
riley
and
searches
of
cell
phones
david
riley
was
stopped
for
a
minor
traffic
infraction
his
car
was
searched
pursuant
to
impoundment
and
he
was
arrested
for
illegally
possessing
two
handguns
found
therein
n
as
police
are
permitted
to
do
as
a
routine
incident
of
any
lawful
arrest
n
officers
searched
riley
s
person
and
found
a
smartphone
in
his
pocket
n
a
search
of
that
phone
onsite
and
a
couple
of
hours
later
at
the
station
yielded
relevant
evidence
in
the
form
of
incriminating
text
messages
videos
and
images
n
the
supreme
court
consolidated
riley
s
case
with
that
of
brima
wurie
who
was
arrested
following
an
apparent
drug
sale
n
at
the
police
station
officers
seized
two
phones
from
his
person
and
one
of
them
a
flip
phone
continued
to
receive
calls
from
a
number
the
phone
identified
as
my
house
n
officers
opened
the
phone
and
accessed
the
call
log
thereby
obtaining
the
phone
number
associated
with
these
calls
n
the
court
resoundingly
rejected
both
searches
modern
cell
phones
are
not
just
another
technological
convenience
with
all
they
contain
and
all
they
may
reveal
they
hold
for
many
americans
the
privacies
of
life
quoting
boyd
v
united
states
u
s
the
fact
that
technology
now
allows
an
individual
to
carry
such
information
in
his
hand
does
not
make
the
information
any
less
worthy
of
the
protection
for
which
the
founders
fought
our
answer
to
the
question
of
what
police
must
do
before
searching
a
cell
phone
seized
incident
to
an
arrest
is
accordingly
simple
get
a
warrant
n
established
doctrine
would
allow
similar
searches
of
non
digital
containers
immediately
associated
with
an
arrestee
s
person
including
any
found
in
the
same
pocket
as
riley
s
phone
n
so
why
did
all
nine
justices
reject
these
mobile
phone
searches
lacking
both
precedent
and
any
precise
guidance
from
the
founding
era
n
the
court
had
to
make
its
own
assessment
of
what
constitutes
an
unreasonable
search
n
and
that
is
done
by
assessing
on
the
one
hand
the
degree
to
which
it
intrudes
upon
an
individual
s
privacy
and
on
the
other
the
degree
to
which
it
is
needed
for
the
promotion
of
legitimate
governmental
interests
n
the
governmental
interests
motivating
searches
incident
to
arrest
officer
safety
and
evidence
preservation
n
are
not
particularly
relevant
to
this
article
but
very
briefly
what
swayed
the
court
was
that
the
interests
are
generally
less
significant
in
the
digital
context
n
as
for
officer
safety
there
is
no
possibility
the
digital
data
will
harm
the
arresting
officers
unlike
say
a
surreptitious
knife
or
razor
blade
n
as
for
the
remote
possibility
the
data
would
inform
officers
of
indirect
harm
for
example
that
dangerous
confederates
were
en
route
the
court
properly
held
this
to
be
a
case
specific
exigent
circumstance
sufficiently
accounted
for
by
that
doctrine
n
in
other
words
it
will
be
the
exception
not
the
rule
similarly
there
is
little
risk
of
evidence
destruction
once
the
officers
seize
the
mobile
phone
as
even
the
typically
negligible
possibility
of
the
device
being
remotely
wiped
can
be
countered
with
a
faraday
bag
the
cheap
version
of
which
is
wrapping
the
phone
in
aluminum
foil
n
more
importantly
for
the
purposes
of
this
article
the
privacy
interest
in
digital
data
is
very
significant
both
in
terms
of
quality
and
quantity
n
while
the
government
urged
that
a
search
of
all
data
stored
on
a
cell
phone
is
materially
indistinguishable
from
searches
of
wallets
and
purses
to
the
court
that
is
like
saying
a
ride
on
horseback
is
materially
indistinguishable
from
a
flight
to
the
moon
n
as
for
quality
a
cell
phone
collects
in
one
place
many
distinct
types
of
information
an
address
a
note
a
prescription
a
bank
statement
a
video
that
reveal
much
more
in
combination
than
any
isolated
record
n
as
for
quantity
a
phone
s
capacity
allows
even
just
one
type
of
information
to
convey
far
more
than
previously
possible
n
such
is
the
marvel
of
digital
data
and
its
modern
storage
n
indeed
it
is
no
exaggeration
to
say
that
many
of
the
more
than
of
american
adults
who
own
a
cell
phone
keep
on
their
person
a
digital
record
of
nearly
every
aspect
of
their
lives
from
the
mundane
to
the
intimate
n
it
did
not
come
at
government
behest
as
justice
jackson
feared
in
but
it
came
nonetheless
n
each
such
person
is
carrying
a
time
machine
and
the
court
has
now
recognized
how
especially
private
are
the
digital
data
contained
therein
as
the
court
recognized
a
single
mobile
phone
will
often
contain
more
information
than
an
entire
home
n
time
machines
are
useful
like
that
in
the
words
of
the
court
in
the
cell
phone
context
it
is
reasonable
to
expect
that
incriminating
information
will
be
found
on
a
phone
regardless
of
when
the
crime
occurred
n
so
while
riley
perhaps
left
things
unanswered
that
it
could
have
addressed
n
it
made
very
clear
that
when
it
comes
to
the
fourth
amendment
digital
is
different
and
while
compelled
government
access
therefore
required
a
warrant
this
does
not
necessarily
mean
the
court
is
generally
averse
to
the
existence
of
digital
time
machines
the
court
s
most
recent
fourth
amendment
decision
which
considered
records
that
could
be
either
analog
or
digital
contains
a
facially
surprising
claim
that
is
a
nod
to
time
machines
utility
c
patel
and
searches
of
hotel
registries
city
of
los
angeles
v
patel
is
a
case
about
mini
government
mandated
time
machines
in
the
form
of
hotel
guest
registries
n
a
provision
of
the
los
angeles
municipal
code
requires
that
hotels
record
and
maintain
information
about
their
guests
including
name
and
address
vehicle
license
plate
of
any
car
parked
on
the
premises
and
method
of
payment
n
under
certain
circumstances
additional
identification
information
must
be
recorded
such
as
when
a
guest
pays
by
cash
rents
a
room
without
a
reservation
or
stays
for
fewer
than
twelve
hours
n
registry
information
must
be
maintained
for
a
period
of
ninety
days
and
must
be
made
available
upon
officer
request
n
as
the
recent
publicity
regarding
the
hack
of
cheating
or
adultery
website
ashley
madison
demonstrates
n
it
is
not
hard
to
imagine
some
of
the
privacy
interests
implicated
by
knowledge
of
hotel
stays
n
at
the
same
time
such
a
recordkeeping
requirement
is
hardly
novel
and
the
hotels
did
not
challenge
it
n
a
group
of
hotel
operators
did
however
challenge
the
provision
requiring
that
the
registry
shall
be
made
available
to
any
officer
of
the
los
angeles
police
department
for
inspection
n
they
contended
such
unrestrained
access
violated
their
fourth
amendment
rights
and
a
closely
divided
supreme
court
agreed
n
according
to
the
five
justice
majority
the
officer
demand
requirement
is
unconstitutional
because
it
offers
no
opportunity
for
pre
compliance
legal
challenge
n
essentially
combining
the
ease
of
an
administrative
subpoena
with
the
effectiveness
of
a
warrant
patel
is
an
important
opinion
because
it
permits
meaningful
facial
challenges
under
the
fourth
amendment
n
and
because
it
limits
what
has
been
a
nebulous
closely
regulated
industry
exception
n
but
what
is
of
interest
for
this
article
is
the
court
s
dictum
regarding
deterrence
the
court
assumed
without
deciding
that
the
government
purpose
for
the
registry
program
was
a
special
need
outside
of
ordinary
crime
control
thus
lessening
the
fourth
amendment
burden
n
since
the
ordinance
was
clearly
aimed
at
solving
crime
it
is
hard
to
imagine
what
this
special
need
would
be
although
the
boundaries
have
always
been
unclear
in
the
automobile
context
for
example
the
court
has
differentiated
roadblocks
aimed
at
preventing
highway
fatalities
and
carnage
a
special
need
from
those
aimed
at
interdicting
drugs
ordinary
crime
control
n
officers
accessing
the
historic
registry
were
unlikely
to
prevent
imminent
threatened
harm
akin
to
that
posed
by
drunk
drivers
as
opposed
to
finding
the
clues
necessary
to
prosecute
past
offenses
this
seems
true
by
definition
for
a
registry
dating
back
three
months
yet
the
court
assumed
a
special
need
namely
deterring
criminality
n
it
seems
hard
to
imagine
deterrence
of
criminality
can
be
a
meaningful
special
need
deterrence
is
not
the
reason
for
legitimate
police
investigation
that
constitutes
a
search
or
a
seizure
but
instead
is
the
happy
albeit
very
important
byproduct
of
investigating
actual
crime
in
other
words
surely
police
cannot
routinely
make
warrantless
entry
into
homes
and
claim
the
special
need
of
deterring
crimes
that
might
otherwise
be
committed
therein
instead
when
law
enforcement
officers
enter
homes
pursuant
to
lawful
warrants
or
exceptions
thereto
and
people
learn
of
those
events
including
subsequent
prosecutions
they
are
deterred
from
themselves
engaging
in
such
criminality
so
why
the
odd
assertion
of
deterrence
as
a
special
need
presumably
because
of
the
intuition
that
the
registry
requirement
like
other
and
more
significant
time
machines
is
an
effective
and
perhaps
smart
way
to
go
after
criminal
behavior
but
even
if
that
might
be
so
the
court
was
right
to
find
problematic
the
complete
absence
of
access
restrictions
given
the
privacy
interests
at
stake
indeed
it
is
worth
stepping
back
to
broadly
consider
these
interests
of
information
privacy
before
contemplating
what
they
implicate
for
investigatory
time
machines
ii
privacy
as
integral
as
privacy
is
to
most
of
our
lives
or
at
least
as
integral
as
i
believe
it
is
to
mine
there
is
considerable
controversy
and
confusion
as
to
its
definition
including
as
to
whether
it
is
a
state
of
being
or
a
right
n
in
other
words
is
perfect
privacy
achieved
only
when
nobody
has
any
information
about
and
access
to
my
person
which
sounds
rather
awful
or
also
when
i
have
complete
control
over
those
modes
of
access
but
have
volitionally
granted
them
in
certain
amounts
which
sounds
rather
utopian
n
learned
philosophical
minds
have
debated
these
concepts
for
years
and
presumably
will
for
as
long
as
there
are
philosophers
to
debate
my
less
philosophically
tutored
mind
finds
useful
and
for
criminal
procedure
purposes
seemingly
sufficient
the
construct
that
information
privacy
is
the
ability
of
a
person
to
control
what
information
about
her
is
given
to
others
and
for
what
purposes
n
such
a
control
construct
was
most
notably
articulated
by
alan
westin
n
and
charles
fried
n
and
has
been
recognized
by
the
supreme
court
n
so
understood
privacy
can
be
seen
as
a
constitutive
element
of
human
autonomy
or
as
a
key
element
in
the
identity
formation
and
mental
freedom
that
is
central
to
a
fully
realized
autonomy
n
in
the
words
of
thomas
nagel
the
boundary
between
what
we
reveal
and
what
we
do
not
and
some
control
over
that
boundary
are
among
the
most
important
attributes
of
our
humanity
n
without
privacy
people
will
engage
in
harmful
self
censorship
not
only
in
what
they
will
say
and
in
what
they
will
do
but
even
in
what
they
will
think
as
they
internalize
an
awareness
that
they
are
always
watched
n
and
the
ability
to
think
freely
and
critically
is
essential
to
full
development
of
one
s
moral
character
n
this
is
not
to
deny
of
course
that
social
pressures
can
be
beneficial
ones
n
but
instead
only
to
recognize
that
they
can
also
be
debilitating
in
the
extreme
n
furthermore
without
privacy
people
are
at
best
stunted
in
their
ability
to
form
meaningful
and
diverse
relationships
as
those
relationships
depend
upon
a
volitional
gradual
and
granular
mutual
sharing
of
information
n
as
nagel
explains
selective
intimacy
permits
some
interpersonal
relations
to
be
open
to
forms
of
exposure
that
are
needed
for
the
development
of
a
complete
life
no
one
but
a
maniac
will
express
absolutely
everything
to
anyone
but
most
of
us
need
someone
to
whom
we
can
express
a
good
deal
that
we
would
not
reveal
to
others
n
as
ferdinand
shoeman
explains
information
appropriate
in
the
context
of
one
relationship
may
not
be
appropriate
in
another
n
indeed
devoid
of
intended
and
appropriate
context
information
can
present
a
vastly
incomplete
if
not
completely
inaccurate
assessment
n
a
spouse
for
example
should
have
sufficient
knowledge
of
a
partner
that
she
can
place
any
new
information
in
nearly
its
correct
context
but
a
stranger
acquaintance
or
even
fairly
good
friend
might
totally
misperceive
its
relevance
as
andrew
taslitz
has
noted
not
only
does
other
assessment
have
practical
manifestations
e
g
loss
of
a
job
opportunity
but
psychologically
we
hold
other
assessment
dear
n
without
privacy
people
thus
have
less
fully
developed
characters
and
relationships
which
in
turn
are
the
constituent
elements
of
a
robust
marketplace
of
ideas
associations
and
religions
n
in
other
words
privacy
may
be
critical
to
the
individual
in
a
manner
necessary
to
identity
formation
and
to
robust
small
scale
personal
relationships
but
it
is
ultimately
of
collective
societal
importance
especially
to
a
democracy
n
thus
it
is
not
surprising
that
alan
westin
found
a
correlation
between
political
philosophy
and
privacy
throughout
western
civilization
n
and
there
are
other
ramifications
without
privacy
there
is
increased
identity
theft
stalking
and
other
information
based
or
assisted
crimes
n
and
given
asymmetries
of
power
distortions
in
information
privacy
tend
to
run
solely
in
one
direction
or
at
least
are
not
distributed
equally
benefiting
some
at
the
costs
of
others
n
of
course
to
assert
that
information
privacy
is
about
control
is
not
to
say
that
one
must
exercise
absolute
control
most
rights
and
perhaps
all
rights
are
not
absolute
and
in
this
case
absolute
control
is
unthinkable
first
nobody
would
benefit
from
exercising
control
to
achieve
absolute
seclusion
n
and
society
could
not
permit
absolute
control
not
only
because
it
would
have
too
great
a
cost
to
the
social
order
but
also
because
once
any
information
about
me
is
known
to
another
person
my
right
of
privacy
control
runs
up
against
their
right
of
free
expression
n
fortunately
people
innately
understand
this
and
rarely
if
ever
expect
absolute
control
but
they
do
wish
to
exercise
some
control
even
as
they
are
becoming
increasingly
disillusioned
regarding
their
ability
to
do
so
n
as
sociologist
christena
nippert
eng
explains
based
upon
her
recent
studies
it
became
clear
that
what
i
now
think
of
as
the
process
of
selective
concealment
and
disclosure
plays
an
important
role
in
how
we
try
to
achieve
privacy
this
is
the
daily
activity
of
trying
to
deny
or
grant
varying
amounts
of
access
to
our
private
matters
to
specific
people
in
specific
ways
n
nippert
eng
unsurprisingly
found
disparate
people
each
trying
to
achieve
their
preferred
balance
n
thus
while
any
replacement
is
far
less
crisp
and
easy
i
have
long
been
a
critic
of
the
fourth
amendment
s
third
party
doctrine
which
tries
to
artificially
categorize
all
information
as
either
totally
secret
purely
private
or
freely
available
to
law
enforcement
effectively
purely
accessible
n
attempting
to
force
people
to
maintain
absolute
secrecy
in
order
to
have
any
degree
of
constitutional
protection
is
unrealistic
and
counter
productive
n
but
what
does
a
control
theory
of
information
privacy
have
to
say
about
investigatory
time
machines
obviously
at
least
as
to
government
created
ones
there
is
a
serious
tension
and
it
is
a
tension
that
goes
to
the
heart
of
privacy
s
motivations
can
we
fully
develop
as
human
beings
with
the
necessarily
divergent
ideas
and
willingness
to
express
them
that
a
thriving
democracy
requires
if
the
government
is
always
watching
no
of
course
in
even
the
most
totalitarian
regimes
there
have
proved
to
be
some
persons
who
exercise
unpopular
autonomy
but
then
truly
pervasive
technology
like
we
have
today
has
never
before
been
available
and
more
importantly
as
ruth
gavison
explains
even
if
we
grant
that
privacy
may
not
be
a
necessary
condition
for
autonomy
for
all
it
is
enough
to
justify
it
as
a
value
that
most
people
may
require
it
we
are
not
all
giants
and
societies
should
enable
all
not
only
the
exceptional
to
seek
moral
autonomy
n
an
ideal
democracy
requires
thoughtful
participation
from
far
more
than
just
a
few
thus
there
is
good
reason
to
be
extremely
skeptical
of
any
government
mandated
time
machines
and
outside
of
the
particular
instances
in
which
they
have
historically
been
used
e
g
banking
pharmaceuticals
and
hotels
we
might
do
best
to
forbid
them
whether
constitutionally
or
otherwise
indeed
it
might
be
wise
to
reconsider
even
those
we
have
historically
permitted
the
supreme
court
in
patel
struck
down
a
year
old
reporting
ordinance
n
but
at
the
very
least
a
drone
hovering
high
overhead
that
records
all
public
movements
seems
problematic
as
do
mammoth
databases
of
digital
information
that
can
later
be
searched
on
the
other
hand
broad
based
surveillance
does
have
benefits
more
inclusive
surveillance
benefits
from
a
genuine
check
in
the
political
process
and
can
more
evenly
distribute
the
costs
and
provide
superior
accountability
n
so
is
it
possible
to
have
our
cake
and
eat
it
too
if
there
are
sufficiently
robust
access
use
and
disclosure
limitations
can
they
ever
ameliorate
the
very
serious
privacy
concerns
i
first
address
whether
such
use
restrictions
could
be
found
within
the
fourth
amendment
and
then
turn
to
the
wisdom
of
their
adoption
in
the
very
limited
context
of
police
body
cameras
iii
fourth
amendment
use
restrictions
and
police
body
cameras
in
a
prescient
article
from
harold
krent
argued
that
whatever
definitions
of
search
and
seizure
are
required
to
make
it
happen
the
uses
to
which
law
enforcement
can
put
lawfully
acquired
information
should
be
governed
by
the
fourth
amendment
s
reasonableness
requirement
n
according
to
krent
rapidly
developing
technology
has
thrust
the
use
issue
to
the
forefront
what
the
government
does
with
information
may
now
threaten
privacy
more
than
the
collection
itself
n
the
ganias
second
circuit
panel
adopted
such
a
use
restriction
even
if
it
was
permissible
for
investigators
to
retain
the
nonresponsive
computer
data
for
such
a
long
period
it
was
not
permissible
to
search
through
that
data
to
use
that
data
in
a
new
investigation
even
pursuant
to
a
newly
obtained
search
warrant
n
although
it
is
not
clear
that
krent
would
agree
with
this
particular
use
limitation
n
he
recognized
that
generally
such
limits
are
conducive
to
the
control
theory
of
information
privacy
each
different
use
of
the
data
interferes
with
a
person
s
ability
to
control
for
what
purposes
information
about
her
is
utilized
n
neither
the
ganias
panel
nor
krent
argued
that
use
restrictions
should
be
the
sole
fourth
amendment
restrictions
the
original
law
enforcement
acquisition
remains
subject
to
traditional
restraints
for
example
merely
agreeing
to
limit
use
would
of
course
not
itself
justify
compulsory
copying
of
ganias
hard
drives
but
there
might
be
circumstances
when
it
is
impossible
to
get
the
desired
law
enforcement
safety
benefit
without
completely
abandoning
front
end
acquisition
restraints
as
with
broad
scale
panvasive
drone
surveillance
or
with
broad
scale
panvasive
internet
surveillance
for
malware
n
in
each
instance
assuming
complete
automation
the
key
privacy
harm
seems
to
occur
only
upon
human
viewing
or
use
of
course
this
does
not
mean
the
sole
privacy
harm
occurs
upon
use
if
human
programmed
algorithms
are
making
decisions
based
upon
content
that
seems
a
relevant
use
regardless
of
the
lack
of
direct
human
observation
n
and
as
described
above
knowing
that
all
of
our
movements
online
or
off
will
be
recorded
for
potential
later
perusal
can
very
meaningfully
chill
those
actions
jeremy
bentham
long
ago
realized
that
constant
observation
was
not
necessary
in
his
panopticon
merely
its
potential
was
sufficient
to
achieve
the
same
results
n
thus
european
courts
have
recently
rejected
requirements
that
internet
service
providers
retain
information
for
defined
periods
of
time
n
so
we
should
be
extremely
cautious
in
accepting
ex
post
use
and
dissemination
controls
as
a
substitute
for
as
opposed
to
a
supplement
to
front
end
acquisition
controls
but
as
part
of
this
calculus
we
should
recognize
the
benefits
of
broad
access
including
its
more
uniform
distribution
and
thus
greater
political
accountability
as
i
argued
some
ten
years
ago
whether
the
issue
is
dna
databanking
or
a
thermal
scan
of
homes
or
a
millimeter
wave
scan
of
persons
as
now
takes
place
at
airports
advanced
notice
and
broad
and
uniform
applicability
trigger
the
protections
of
the
political
process
in
a
way
that
most
contemporary
policing
does
not
and
this
should
factor
into
fourth
amendment
reasonableness
n
in
this
i
was
building
upon
the
arguments
of
william
stuntz
n
and
the
supreme
court
s
school
drug
testing
cases
n
christopher
slobogin
has
recently
developed
the
concept
into
a
more
rich
theory
of
representative
democracy
relying
upon
the
constitutional
scholarship
of
john
hart
ely
that
would
provide
judicial
review
even
where
the
government
activity
does
not
constitute
a
fourth
amendment
search
or
seizure
n
but
again
whatever
the
benefits
of
even
a
well
functioning
political
process
there
are
strong
reasons
to
be
cautious
as
justice
sandra
day
o
connor
argued
in
personally
rejecting
the
court
s
permissive
regime
of
drug
testing
for
student
athletes
we
have
a
strong
tradition
against
general
warrants
and
blanket
searches
because
they
can
involve
thousands
or
millions
of
searches
pose
a
greater
threat
to
liberty
than
do
suspicion
based
ones
which
affect
one
person
at
a
time
n
nonetheless
it
would
be
just
as
wrong
to
ignore
the
fairness
benefit
of
broad
applicability
as
it
would
to
think
a
misery
loves
company
conception
would
be
ideal
across
the
board
the
latter
of
which
would
adopt
wholesale
the
hated
general
warrants
of
our
founding
period
n
it
seems
there
might
be
limited
relatively
narrow
circumstances
in
which
we
should
embrace
solely
use
restrictions
and
i
submit
that
one
of
them
might
be
for
law
enforcement
body
cameras
of
course
perhaps
this
is
an
unfairly
easy
case
because
in
order
for
the
camera
to
capture
anything
the
law
enforcement
officer
should
already
be
lawfully
present
a
criterion
that
brings
its
own
sometimes
significant
front
end
restrictions
but
such
recording
nonetheless
creates
time
machines
and
lots
of
them
there
are
almost
a
million
law
enforcement
officers
in
the
united
states
n
with
officers
on
duty
at
all
times
watching
over
mostly
innocent
behavior
as
well
as
some
criminal
if
every
one
records
his
or
her
entire
shift
that
is
a
staggering
amount
of
data
those
recordings
will
psychologically
affect
the
officers
and
not
only
in
the
sense
of
promoting
good
behavior
as
discussed
above
nobody
does
well
to
be
under
constant
surveillance
though
interestingly
to
many
thousands
of
americans
working
in
retail
and
other
industries
it
is
probably
already
their
daily
reality
albeit
without
accompanying
audio
and
these
workers
might
have
little
to
no
promises
regarding
ex
post
use
and
dissemination
nor
is
it
the
case
that
these
recordings
will
merely
duplicate
what
officers
could
themselves
personally
explain
instead
high
quality
cameras
would
record
all
sorts
of
events
and
details
never
noticed
by
the
officers
and
potentially
permanently
store
them
for
later
high
tech
perusal
e
g
zoom
in
and
slow
down
n
moreover
for
things
an
officer
does
notice
which
will
include
highly
traumatic
events
the
digital
record
will
remain
forever
pristine
whereas
memories
quickly
degrade
and
even
fade
entirely
n
such
cameras
would
record
not
only
events
taking
place
in
public
but
instead
would
record
everywhere
officers
go
including
the
interiors
of
our
homes
and
therefore
potentially
under
every
bed
and
into
every
drawer
so
even
if
officer
presence
already
has
an
access
and
thus
acquisition
limitation
it
would
not
necessarily
follow
that
nothing
more
should
be
required
for
the
further
intrusion
of
recording
n
however
these
panvasive
qualities
of
officer
recording
also
make
for
some
of
its
benefits
as
long
as
there
have
been
police
we
have
had
to
rely
not
only
upon
their
perceptions
of
what
they
observe
but
upon
their
memories
of
those
perceptions
both
perception
and
memory
are
fallible
and
recollection
thereof
subject
to
falsification
of
course
we
have
done
what
we
can
because
memory
dissipates
quickly
it
is
helpful
when
police
contemporaneously
record
their
perceptions
and
hence
we
value
the
ubiquitous
police
report
which
also
freezes
the
account
making
later
fabrication
more
difficult
with
the
advent
of
readily
mobile
photography
police
could
better
preserve
those
observations
deemed
sufficiently
important
and
photography
of
crime
scenes
thus
became
routine
n
with
the
advent
of
tape
recording
certain
police
citizen
interactions
were
recorded
n
and
with
the
advent
of
videotaping
we
became
accustomed
to
its
benefits
in
certain
contexts
such
as
video
recordings
of
traffic
stops
via
cameras
fixed
in
police
vehicles
but
when
that
videotaping
made
it
to
the
interior
of
the
home
it
caused
concern
a
concern
that
reached
the
supreme
court
in
in
the
case
of
wilson
v
layne
n
as
part
of
operation
gunsmoke
united
states
marshals
were
working
with
local
maryland
police
to
apprehend
dangerous
criminals
including
one
dominic
wilson
n
unfortunately
the
address
in
police
files
was
that
of
wilson
s
parents
so
when
police
entered
the
home
to
execute
an
arrest
warrant
accompanied
by
invited
representatives
of
the
media
what
they
found
was
dominic
s
father
roused
from
bed
and
dressed
only
in
briefs
and
dominic
s
mother
in
a
nightgown
n
before
police
were
made
aware
of
or
at
least
were
convinced
of
their
mistake
they
forcibly
subdued
the
elder
mr
wilson
at
gunpoint
while
a
photographer
from
the
washington
post
took
photographs
n
the
court
unanimously
held
that
the
officers
violated
the
fourth
amendment
by
bringing
representatives
of
the
media
into
a
home
entered
pursuant
to
a
warrant
n
however
the
court
acknowledged
government
interests
that
could
be
furthered
by
law
enforcement
s
own
recording
accurately
publicizing
efforts
to
combat
crime
furthering
education
and
deterrence
deterring
and
detecting
police
abuse
protecting
the
safety
of
officers
and
preserving
evidence
n
thus
it
might
be
reasonable
for
police
officers
to
themselves
videotape
home
entries
n
the
benefits
the
court
proffered
are
real
and
can
be
significant
as
for
evidence
preservation
recording
can
preserve
evidence
without
requiring
its
physical
removal
n
preserve
evidence
that
would
otherwise
be
destroyed
by
investigatory
or
non
investigatory
government
actions
or
simply
by
the
passage
of
time
n
and
preserve
evidence
in
its
most
pristine
form
allowing
a
judge
or
juror
to
view
it
herself
n
one
could
imagine
recordings
being
used
to
routinely
decide
such
contested
issues
as
whether
a
person
consented
to
an
entry
or
search
and
if
so
the
scope
of
that
consent
whether
a
reasonable
officer
would
have
believed
a
person
to
be
in
need
of
immediate
assistance
whether
there
was
a
fair
probability
that
evidence
would
be
imminently
destroyed
whether
police
exceeded
the
authorization
of
a
warrant
or
whether
an
officer
reasonably
believed
deadly
force
was
justified
n
to
be
sure
no
single
video
is
perfect
as
the
camera
perspective
can
itself
suggest
a
cognitive
frame
and
thereby
affect
these
myriad
determinations
n
but
it
is
far
better
than
without
in
the
straightforward
words
of
the
alaska
supreme
court
in
the
context
of
recording
custodial
interrogations
a
recording
will
help
trial
and
appellate
courts
to
ascertain
the
truth
n
thus
preservation
has
secondary
benefits
including
in
deterring
and
detecting
police
abuse
there
are
ample
recorded
examples
from
detectives
playing
wii
bowling
during
a
home
search
n
to
accident
investigators
doing
a
little
walt
disney
to
protect
a
cop
who
rear
ended
another
vehicle
n
the
most
prominent
recent
examples
might
be
the
shootings
of
walter
scott
and
samuel
dubose
each
of
which
resulted
in
murder
charges
against
the
police
officer
n
it
seems
self
evident
that
video
would
deter
and
where
that
fails
detect
abuse
an
inference
supported
by
police
recording
in
rialto
california
in
the
first
year
of
body
camera
recording
complaints
against
officers
fell
by
and
use
of
force
by
officers
fell
by
almost
n
thus
in
judge
shira
a
scheindlin
s
order
holding
unconstitutional
the
new
york
police
department
s
stop
and
frisk
tactics
she
required
a
trial
program
of
officer
body
cameras
n
to
be
most
effective
that
video
must
record
all
police
citizen
interaction
lest
officers
only
turn
it
on
when
it
serves
their
purposes
n
and
be
tamper
resistant
n
and
when
it
comes
to
deterring
and
detecting
abuse
turnabout
is
fair
play
recording
can
shield
police
against
false
allegations
of
abuse
as
well
as
deter
or
at
least
detect
poor
citizen
decisions
perhaps
including
some
that
caused
those
previously
unrecorded
use
of
force
incidents
so
given
the
myriad
benefits
of
tamper
resistant
always
on
officer
recording
where
always
on
includes
cameras
with
a
significant
typically
overwritten
buffer
meant
to
become
permanent
when
triggered
by
an
officer
citizen
interaction
it
seems
such
recording
is
worth
the
privacy
cost
but
this
merely
means
police
should
record
it
remains
to
be
determined
or
should
remain
to
be
determined
what
can
be
done
with
those
recordings
which
of
course
preserve
immense
amounts
of
otherwise
ephemeral
irrelevant
information
like
the
takedown
of
an
innocent
man
in
his
bedclothes
in
wilson
v
layne
the
mere
preservation
of
that
information
is
a
meaningful
harm
if
nothing
else
because
the
relevant
parties
know
there
is
always
a
risk
of
its
further
consumption
and
dissemination
n
and
thus
recording
can
also
harm
law
enforcement
interests
if
it
deters
citizen
cooperation
and
assistance
where
persons
fear
criminal
reprisal
thus
as
an
administrative
matter
in
police
department
guidelines
as
a
legislative
matter
and
i
would
argue
as
a
matter
of
fourth
amendment
and
state
constitutional
analog
reasonableness
there
should
be
use
and
disclosure
limitations
on
that
data
these
would
include
security
from
unauthorized
access
need
to
know
limitations
audit
logs
and
destruction
schedules
n
for
example
viewing
the
footage
of
a
home
search
should
at
least
sometimes
itself
constitute
a
fourth
amendment
search
just
like
perusing
a
seized
computer
reentering
the
home
after
completion
of
the
search
would
of
course
require
a
new
warrant
n
and
just
as
a
search
of
a
seized
hard
drive
yields
previously
unknown
information
viewing
of
video
will
yield
information
not
noticed
by
officers
and
given
video
enhancement
capabilities
information
not
previously
noticeable
moreover
the
resource
and
legal
restraints
are
far
different
when
any
number
of
officers
can
view
video
in
their
offices
than
when
those
officers
are
on
the
scene
executing
a
search
warrant
governed
by
the
constraints
of
the
fourth
amendment
potentially
including
a
judicial
warrant
thus
just
as
courts
have
begun
to
recognize
that
digital
is
different
in
other
contexts
courts
should
here
recognize
a
meaningful
difference
in
kind
despite
law
enforcement
officers
traditionally
being
permitted
to
re
examine
physical
items
in
their
possession
the
over
seizure
inherent
in
the
recording
merits
a
different
result
so
understood
in
the
limited
context
of
police
body
cameras
the
benefits
of
complete
recording
seem
to
outweigh
the
costs
and
therefore
this
is
a
government
time
machine
that
i
would
permit
subject
only
to
meaningful
access
use
and
dissemination
controls
this
of
course
leaves
for
future
work
the
development
of
a
taxonomy
as
to
when
acquisition
restrictions
are
more
or
less
important
and
what
should
be
the
constitutional
and
statutory
rules
and
administrative
best
practices
but
it
provides
a
critical
perspective
as
we
approach
these
decisions
seeing
them
for
what
they
are
fourth
amendment
time
machines
conclusion
we
are
in
the
midst
of
dramatic
techno
social
change
in
the
words
of
christena
nippert
eng
it
s
as
if
a
distinct
cultural
climate
change
is
underway
the
ocean
has
risen
shrinking
our
islands
of
privacy
and
even
submerging
many
of
them
altogether
like
atlantis
perhaps
some
private
spaces
and
times
and
matters
are
fading
into
the
realm
of
folklore
even
legend
their
very
existence
destined
to
rest
one
day
on
the
unsubstantiated
claims
of
prior
generations
n
the
ability
of
technology
for
the
first
time
to
feasibly
record
and
store
most
all
behavior
both
online
and
off
is
certainly
a
tectonic
shift
it
seriously
threatens
privacy
and
thus
all
of
privacy
s
myriad
individual
and
societal
benefits
of
course
any
such
shift
can
be
exaggerated
and
in
some
sense
little
is
ever
new
in
with
the
advent
of
the
portable
camera
a
newspaper
bemoaned
that
this
season
there
is
something
at
the
seaside
worse
than
sharks
it
is
the
amateur
photographer
n
yet
we
somehow
made
it
through
sufficient
privacy
intact
laws
have
long
required
that
certain
records
be
retained
and
businesses
have
long
retained
far
more
than
what
the
laws
require
nonetheless
differences
in
scope
at
some
point
become
differences
in
kind
and
i
believe
there
is
utility
in
recognizing
today
s
digital
records
for
what
they
are
investigative
time
machines
and
openly
confronting
whether
their
benefits
justify
their
costs
where
they
do
we
should
utilize
access
use
and
dissemination
restrictions
for
our
privacy
and
in
those
instances
in
which
only
a
panvasive
time
machine
will
do
and
in
which
its
benefits
still
outweigh
its
costs
we
can
rely
solely
upon
those
ex
post
restrictions
n
but
these
time
machines
are
fraught
with
great
danger
to
our
humanity
and
to
our
democracy
and
thus
should
be
approached
with
a
healthy
if
not
vigorous
distrust
thus
in
this
article
i
have
taken
only
a
baby
step
recommending
a
use
restriction
regime
for
police
officer
body
cameras
recognizing
that
officer
presence
builds
in
acquisition
restraints
legislatures
should
provide
frameworks
for
these
recordings
requiring
reasonable
guarantees
of
secure
storage
and
appropriately
restricting
and
disciplining
errant
access
use
and
dissemination
n
if
those
restrictions
ultimately
prove
unworkable
or
insufficient
in
this
limited
context
then
we
will
have
learned
that
they
certainly
cannot
alone
be
trusted
in
other
spheres

in

if
subjected
to
a
world
without

we
would
probably
try
hard
to
suppress
our
daydreams
and
fantasies
once
others
had
access
to
them
we
would
try
to
erase
from
our
minds
everything
we
would
not
be
willing
to
publish
and
we
would
try
not
to
do
anything
that
would
make
us
likely
to
be
feared
ridiculed
or
harmed
there
is
a

flatness

the

the

nothing

about

in

what
on
the
outside
might
look
like
blind
luck
or
coincidence
is
actually
part
of
a
predictive
system
the
department
has
been
perfecting
with
the
help
of
academic
partners
turned
businessmen
since
and
this
is
not
someone
sitting
in
a
room
with
a
crystal
ball
or
tarot
cards
trying
to
pinpoint
the
next
crime
this
is
the
intersection
of
advanced
probabilistic
algorithms
and
community
policing
it
s
appropriately
called
predpol
short
for
predictive
policing
crime
data
fed
into
the
predpol
system
provides
officers
with
different
zones
for
four
types
of
crime
auto
theft
vehicle
burglary
burglary
and
gang
related
activity
at
the
start
of

the
deputy
chief
said
maximizing
the
efficacy
of
his
department
was
a
no
brainer
the
technological
edge
provided
by
the
advanced
software
would
help
to
close
the
gap
between
what
was
at
the
time
increasing
crime
and
staffing
limitations
time
is
a
zero
sum
game
i
only
have
the
number
of
officers
times
the
number
of
hours
that
they
re
working
to
address
crime
issues
in
the
city
if
now
all
of
a
sudden
a
chunk
of
our
time
is
dealing
with
radio
calls
for
service
that
greatly
reduces
my
proactive
policing
time
the
only
way
to
increase
that
is
you
either
lower
the
demand
or
you
get
more
officers
to
dilute
or
diffuse
the
calls
for
service
so
you
have
more
proactive
time
said
deputy
chief
steve
clark
i
couldn
t
afford
more
officers
so
i
had
to
get
smarter
about
how
we
were
going
to
deal
with
our
limited
time
resources
despite
giving
officers
a
substantial
leg
up
when
it
comes
to
patrolling
the
city
clark
said
the
system
still
requires
them
to
interact
with
the
community
and
walk
the
beat
as
it
were
they
cannot
and
do
not
rely
solely
on
the
system
s
predictions
to
do
their
jobs
they
still
patrol
the
city
as
any
cop
would
but
they
re
looking
for
any
indication
that
the
predictions
were
correct
however
effective
the
system
might
be
in
predicting
crime
clark
said
the
job
of
policing
is
more
than
simply
following
the
data
you
can
t
become
too
reliant
on
these
things
the
officers
have
to
continue
to
sharpen
their
saws
as
far
as
their
instincts
their
training
their
experience
their
instincts
those
things
that
we
spend
a
lot
of
money
to
teach
them
and
train
them
those
years
of
experience

system
photo
by
eyragon
eidam
from
clark
s
perspective
the
platform
does
more
than
just
point
cops
in
the
right
direction
it
also
removes
the
potential
for
race
and
income
based
biases
so
often
a
concern
in
policing
the
predictive
platform
doesn
t
see
race
financial
status
or
any
of
the
other
indicators
that
often
lead
to
the
perception
of
police
profiling
all
predpol
sees
are
the
reports
of
crimes
that
have
occurred
which
are
then
translated
into
where
they
are
likely
to
occur
next
there
s
nothing
in
there
about
demographics
clark
said
whether
it
be
the
population
type
or
monetary
demographics
these
are
actual
crime
reports
and
that
s
what
it
makes
its
predictions
from
halfway
across
the
country
in
eden
prairie
minn
a
town
of
about
people
predictive
policing
has
taken
on
a
slightly
different
form
officers
rely
on
a
dedicated
analyst
for
up
to
the
moment
intelligence
on
their
patrols
the
public
safety
system
may
not
rely
on
advanced
probabilities
and
mapping
but
rather
law
enforcement
analyst
ryan
kapaun
who
tracks
each
crime
and
translates
it
into
usable
intelligence
for
the
department
which
averages
calls
for
service
a
year
using
fairly
simple
tools
like
the
microsoft
office
suite
and
ibm
s

kapaun

officers
suspect
descriptions
potential

and
anything
else
that
may
help
stop
or
catch
a
criminal

just
map
every
burglary
for
me
doesn
t
tell
me
a
lot
because
it
doesn
t
tell
me
that
those
burglaries
are
linked
so
one
might
be
an
overnight
garage
burglary
and
one
might
be
a
front
door
kicked
in
burglary
during
the
day
while
people
are
at
work
he
said
what
i
m
most
interested
in
is
not
aggregating
and
mapping
all
of
the
burglaries
what
i
want
to
know
is
what
are
the
anomalies
what
doesn
t
fit
what
are
the

as
an
example
that
aren

fitting

the
concept
took
time
to
catch
on
with
his
badge

according
to
the
analyst
but
now
kapaun
s
work
represents
one
more
tool

everyone
is
using
data
and
they
might
not
either
be
aware
of
it
or
understand
it
and
if
you
think
of
it
a
police
department
has
a
wealth
of
data
they
re

rich
it
s
just
figuring
out
how
to
take
that
data
and
use
that
data
in
a
way
that
s
meaningful
he
said
i
think
a

of
agencies
end
up
using
the
data
to
just
say
burglaries
are
up
percent
from
this
week
over
last
week
for
a

when
i
used
to
do
that
eyes
would
glaze
over
what
does
that
mean
you
have
to
tell

with

kapaun
said
the
program
s
successes
have
the
department
looking
at
how
to
expand
it
and
potentially
bring
in
other
analysts
the
rise
of
biometrics
and
fingerprint
alternatives
in
recent
years
the
push
to
include
alternative
identification
methods
in
daily
police
work
has
exploded
past
fingerprinting
and
the
classic
mug
shot
law
enforcement
agencies
are
now
looking
toward
options
like
facial
recognition
to
help
finger
the
right
perp
at
the
federal
level
the
fbi
s
next
generation
identification
program
has
given
new
identity
tools
to
federal
state
and
local
law
enforcement
and
has
stoked
the
flames
of
critics
who
believe
the
system
is
little
more
than
a
way
to
catalog
people
the
guilty
the
innocent
and
those
somewhere
in
the
middle
but
the
program
seems
to
be
the
next
logical
step
in
a
national
process
where
fingerprints
and
photographs
don
t
always
tell
the
whole
story
of
a
person
s
criminal
past
the
larger
program
which
extends
its
database
services
to
participating
state
and
local
agencies
relies
on
a
growing
index
of
finger
and
palm
prints
as
well
as
facial
and
iris
scans
to
identify
persons
of
interest
in
san
diego
the
city
s
police
department
sdpd
employs
facial
recognition
equipment
to
identify
people
its
officers
come
in
contact
with
for
example
if
an
individual
does
not
produce
an
id
during
a
traffic
stop
facial
recognition
could
close
the
information
gap
for
the
officer
according
to
officer
steve
thorn
the
sdpd
facial
recognition
program
coordinator
around
facial
scanners
have
served
the
department
well
since
the
city
first
signed
on
with
the
automated
regional
justice
information
system
a
larger
regional
law
enforcement
collective
officers
use
the
devices
to
assist
in
the
identification
of
individuals
lawfully
detained
or
arrested
when
those
persons
are
unwilling
or
unable
to
provide
identity
a
typical
situation
would
be
when
officers
contact
an
individual
for
a
crime
the
crime
could
be
minimal
in
nature
such
as
littering
or
jay
walking
or
more
severe
such
as
battery
or
theft
he
said
if
the
individual
has
no
identification
on
them
or
would
not
provide
their
name
the
officers
could
use
the
device
to
verify
their
identity
and
issue
a
citation
in
the
field
versus
having
to
transport
the
individual
to
a
police
station
and
take
fingerprints
which
could
be
very
time
consuming
but
the
usefulness
of
the
tools
extends
far
beyond
identifying
criminals
thorn
said
officers
also
use
the
department
s
or
so
scanners
to
work
with
the
homeless
community
and
identify
potential
missing
persons
i
have
spoken
to
a
number
of
officers
who
use
the
device
regularly
they
all
say
the
device
works
very
well
saves
time
and
helps
prevent
misidentification
the
device
is
extremely
useful
for
officers
assigned
to
the
quality
of
life
team
and
homeless
outreach
team
both
teams
are
a
resource
to
the
homeless
population
but
also
take
enforcement
action
as
necessary
a
vast
majority
of
homeless
peoples
have
no
identification
in
their
possession
and
the
device
enables
the
officers
to
make
quick
identification
and
take
appropriate
action
for
critics
programs
like
these
represent
a
way
to
capture
and
store
permanent
vital
information
about
civilians
with
little
oversight
most
recently
the
next
generation
identification
program
took
fire
from
critics
when
the
fbi
petitioned
to
exempt
it
from
federal
privacy
regulations
which
critics
say
would
prevent
the
misuse
and
abuse
of

police
video
is
not
a
new
concept
by
any
stretch
of
the
imagination
what
started
as
the
occasional
camera
capturing
a
liquor
store
or

has
grown
into
cameras
being
installed
on
seemingly
every

in

past
few
years
law
enforcement
agencies
across
the
country
have
started
equipping
officers
with
body
cameras
to
document
interactions
with
citizens
the
prevalence
of
video
and
its
societal
benefits
are
the
reason
that

yung

lu
leads
the
team
behind
cam
from
his
perspective
as
a
technologist
the
system
has
applications
in
law
enforcement
environments
but
it
doesn
t
give
them
anything
sensitive
we
do
not
use
any
data
that
requests
passwords
and
furthermore
we
actually
take
reasonable
efforts
to
exclude
any
camera
we
think
may
look
at
a
private
space
he
said
most
of
the
cameras
we
have
in
our
system
come
from
departments
of
transportation
of
different
governments
different
states
different
cities
for
obvious
reasons
because
our
research
is
about
data
management
it
is
not
about
looking
at
whether
you
are
sitting
on
your

the

the

to
adapt
them
to

the

is
inextricably
linked
to

and
has
unsurprisingly
been
the
focus
of
researchers
around

while

may
not

there
are

and
said
the
video
platform
has
sparked
the
interest
of
some
in
the
larger
law
enforcement
environment
who
see
more
potential
applications
one
of
the
things
that
i
see
as
a
great
potential
for
this
also
is
in
the
emergency

and
where
your

should
be
allocated
being
able
to
pull
up
that
information
through
this
sort
of
system
is
a
good
way
to
crowdsource
the
information
instead
of
having
to
wait
until
people
upload
photos
or
look
through
twitter
images
or
snapchat
information
and
things
like
that
but
the
tool
comes
with
the
need
for
the
inclusion
of
best
practices
ebert
added
while
it
may
not
be
peering
into
the
living
rooms
of
everyday
citizens
he
likens
it
to
how
local
agencies
address
the
collection
of
information
on
publicly
available
social
media
platforms
i
think
a
similar
set
of
guidelines
for
these
type
of
cameras
would
be
very
appropriate
depending
on
your
current
interpretation
of
the
laws
the
view
is
that
all
of
the
information
that
people
put
out
on
social
media
they
re
making
publicly
available
if
they
don
t
have
privacy
settings
turned
on
so
there
is
no
violation
of
privacy
that
s
the
perception
but
the
question
is
have
the
laws
caught
up
with
what
the
public
expects
the
evolution
of
data
analytics
and
collection
and
now
to
the
stuff
agencies
seem
a
bit
shy
about
the
stingray
made
recent
national
news
as
information
slowly
trickled
out
that
the
u
s
justice
department
had
provided
local
agencies
with
the
funds
to
purchase
so
called
cell
site
simulators
the
devices
are
designed
to
intercept
cellular
communications
access
the
data
within
them
and
track
locations
but
as
quickly
as
the
technology
made
its
way
to
the
headlines
legislation
began
to
consider
the
implications
of
what
many
considered
to
be
the
possibility
of
mass
surveillance
by
local
agencies
states
like
illinois
and
nebraska
began
to
propose
legislation
to
strip
agencies
of
their
simulators
and
bar
them
from
buying
new
ones
but
this
isn
t
the
only
kind
of
tech
that
has
some
people
concerned
the
los
angeles
police
department
declined
interview
requests
about
its
use
of
a
software
platform
produced
by
a
company
called
palantir
which
also
won
t
discuss
its
work
with
law
enforcement
agencies
on
the
upside
the
department
talked
about
the
product
and
its
potential
for
a
company
testimonial
so
we
do
have
a
small
idea
about
what
it
is
capable
of
even
if
it
s
just
the
stuff
the
company
needs
to
sell
it
to
other
departments
while
the
lack
of
transparency
might
seem
like
a
cause
for
concern
for
residents
the
system
appears
to
be
little
more
than
an
advanced
data
analytics
platform
geared
toward
law
enforcement
applications
basically
palantir
s
platform
uses
available
data
sources
to
make
sense
of
all
of
the
noise
that
is
out
there
according
to
police
chief
charlie
beck
in
a
testimonial
for
years
we
ve
had
stovepipe
systems
that
have
a
lot
of
information
but
don
t
talk
to
each
other
and
don
t
compare
that
information
and
palantir
allows
us
to
do
that
he
added
while
details
are
limited
as
of
a
few
years
ago
the
company
was
gaining
momentum
in
palantir
founder
alex
karp
told

that
while

say
that

by

keep
an
eye
out
for
this
car
recalls
mr
mcphail
a
public
information
officer
for
the
department
and
a
helicopter
was
in
the
area
and
some
officers
went
by
and
found
it
that
was
the
city
has
since
installed
police
observation
devices
or
pods
now
sacramento
like
new
york
houston
miami
st
louis
and
other
cities
before
it
is
looking
at
the
next
step
the
launch
in
october
of
a
real
time
crime
center
a
central
location
from
which
officers
could
monitor
all
their
existing
surveillance
technologies
pods
included
the
idea
is
that
consolidating
information
about
criminal
activity
from
stalking
complaints
to
potential
lone
wolf
terrorist
attacks
would
make
law
enforcement
more
effective
at
investigating
and
perhaps
preventing
some
incidents
the
process
would
also
promote
accountability
and
transparency
at
a
time
of
rising
tension
between
police
and
the
black
community
providing
evidence
of
both
police
and
suspect
behavior
during
tense
encounters
proponents
say
but
the
technology
raises
big
privacy
issues
already
concerned
about
pods
privacy
advocates
are
concerned
by
the
prospect
of
centralizing
law
enforcement
data
especially
in
a
post
world
where
data
is
being
shared
more
widely
across
federal
state
and
local
lines
the
technology
is
already
causing
a
populist
backlash
the
theory
of
policing
has
changed
says
rebecca
lonergan
a
university
of
southern
california
law
professor
who
spent
years
prosecuting
public
corruption
and
national
security
cases
for
the
united
states
attorney
s
office
in
los
angeles
there
s
an
understanding
now
that
we
really
need
to
centralize
all
of
our
information
protection
for
large
gatherings
mcphail
is
usually
off
on
fridays
but
he
clocked
in
the
day
after
micah
xavier
johnson
shot
and
killed
five
police
officers
in
dallas
last
month
that
same
day
mcphail
explained
how
the
city
s
new
crime
center
would
help
prevent
future
tragedies
in
large
public
gatherings
the
department
is
planning
to
install
new
cameras
at
the
city
s
golden
center
arena
the
crime
center
itself
will
have
banks
of
state
of
the
art
screens
showing
live
high
definition
video
feeds
of
major
traffic
and
transportation
sites
as
well
as
trained
personnel
who
can
provide
real
time
information
to
officers
in
the
field
and
use
data
analysis
tools
to
interpret
any
data
being
collected
it
s
not
a
replacement
for
old
fashioned
police
work
mcphail
says
but
this
is
kind
of
like
a
natural
progression
of
how
we
do
business
the
questions
we
would
ask
it
s
like
the
first
bread
crumb
along
a
trail
where
at
least
our
investigators
know
where
to
start
looking
it
s
called
predictive
policing
and
law
enforcement
agencies
in
other
cities
are
already
making
it
happen
in
new
york
city
home
to
the
oldest
and
arguably
most
sophisticated
real
time
crime
center
in
the
country
police
can
use
surveillance
and
data
analysis
technology
to
identify
suspected
criminals
or
terrorists
based
on
anything
from
a
birthmark
to
a
limp
the
idea
is
that
people
who
have
a
record
get
their
identifying
marks
loaded
into
a
database
so
if
police
need
to
identify
someone
they
see
they
can
type
in
the
visible
characteristics
and
then
get
that
person
s
name
and
information
with
terrorism
it
s
so
hard
to
find
those
few
radicals
that
really
are
serious
about
it
says
professor
lonergan
at
usc
the
only
way
you
find
them
is
by
doing
the
kind
of
data
collection
and
data
mining
that
we
re
talking
about
the
technology
can
also
be
used
for
more
routine
policing
such
as
addressing
stalking
claims
if
complainants
have
a
license
plate
number
and
are
able
to
give
at
least
three
places
where
they
might
have
seen
the
stalker
the
pod
system
can
be
queried
to
see
if
the
vehicle
was
there
mcphail
says
now
i
might
have
a
stronger
case
to
substantiate
a
stalking
claim
in
advance
of
something
potentially
much
more
serious
happening
to
our
victim
he
says
and
it
has
been
used
to
that
effect
more
policing
not
the
answer
for
some
privacy
and
civil
liberties
advocates
such
predictive
strategies
in
routine
police
work
is
a
problem
not
a
solution
there
s
a
shift
in
the
primary
modality
of
policing
where
it
s
not
just
the
old
investigating
methods
being
employed
but
preemptive
policing
based
on
hunches
says
hamid
khan
a
coordinator
with
the
stop
lapd
spying
coalition
an
alliance
of
community
groups
that
aims
to
prevent
undue
surveillance
of
marginalized
communities
in
los
angeles
it
s
become
part
of
a
larger
architecture
of
surveillance
he
and
other
critics
say
that
sort
of
predictive
policing
reinforces
racial
profiling
and
violates
civil
liberties
with
little
accountability
on
the
part
of
the
officers
who
employ
such
methods
worse
the
strategy
fails
to
address
the
underlying
reasons
for
which
people
often
commit
crimes
t
he
deepest
flaw
in
the
logic
of
predictive
policing
is
the
assumption
that
what
the
model
predicts
is
the
need
for
policing
as
opposed
to
the
need
for
any
other
less
coercive
social
tools
to
deal
with
the
trauma
of
economic
distress
family
dislocation
mental
illness
environmental
stress
and
racial
discrimination
that
often
masquerade
as
criminal
behavior
writes
aderson
francois
a
professor
of
law
at
howard
university
in
washington
in
an
op
ed
for
the
new
york
times
law
enforcement
should
stay
out
of
the
surveillance
and
data
collection
business
critics
say
at
least
until
lawmakers
are
able
to
develop
clear
policies
that
regulate
their
use
technology
can
be
liberating
or
it
can
be
a
tool
for
control

he
says
could
spell
the
difference

mr
buttar
says
more
police
departments
are
adopting
the
devices
hailing
them
as
a
tool
for
improving
transparency
and
accountability
and
rebuilding
trust
in
communities
yet
a
recent
report
from
the
brennan
center
suggests
that
some
departments
continue
to
struggle
with
privacy
concerns
months
after
making
body
cameras
a
requirement
for
officers
in
dallas
for
example
officers
don
t
need
to
inform
residents
they
are
recording
as
long
as
they
are
in
a
private
residence
in
an
official
capacity
and
in
baltimore
homes
are
treated
the
same
as
any
other
property
though
officers
have
discretion
not
to
record
in
sensitive
circumstances
according
to
the
report
some
drivers
are
staging
their
own
protests
snapping
up
anticamera
license
plate
covers
even
sprays
that
keep
their
plates
visible
but
difficult
to
photograph
new
county
law
a
couple
of
interstates
down
from
sacramento
santa
clara
county
passed
an
ordinance
that
tries
to
address
these
concerns
the
first
of
its
kind
at
the
county
level
it
requires
the
sheriff
s
department
and
the
district
attorney
s
office
to
inform
the
board
of
supervisors
and
the
public
before
they
purchase
any
new
technology
they
also
have
to
lay
out
any
privacy
and
due
process
implications
of
the
devices
develop
a
set
of
policies
that
would
regulate
their
use
and
submit
an
annual
report
on
the
technology
s
use
to
the
board
this
notion
that
we
have
to
choose
between
public
safety
and
privacy
protection
is
wholly
false
says
joe
simitian
a
county
supervisor
and
former
california
state
senator
we
can
protect
the
public
and
respect
their
privacy
and
due
process
rights
at
the
same
time
privacy
advocates
have
praised
the
ordinance
what
protects
privacy
is
a
straightforward
explanation
of
what
we
ve
got
what
we
re
using
when
we
re
going
to
use
it
and
what
the
boundaries
are
says
tracy
rosenberg
executive
director
of

alliance
a
nonprofit
media
group
that
aims
to
defend
press
freedom
and
civil
rights
the
santa
clara
county
ordinance
does
just
that
she
says
and
should
be
raised
as
a
model
for
other
local
legislatures
to
look
into
limiting
the
cameras
standing
at
the
corner
of
fruitridge
road
and
franklin
boulevard
on
a
sunny
july
day
mcphail
points
to
a
traffic
light
where
three
small
domed
cameras
jut
out
from
a
beige
metal
box
marked
with
the
logo
of
the
sacramento
police
department
sacramento
does
not
have
anything
in
the
books
resembling
santa
clara
county
s
new
ordinance
but
mcphail
points
out
that
all
three
cameras
face
only
the
streets
avoiding
even
the
businesses
that
line
the
two
main
streets
the
department
also
works
closely
with
community
leaders
through
its
cops
and
clergy
program
mcphail
says
and
while
he
understands
concerns
over
data
collection
footage
from
the
pods
is
stored
in
a
third
party
database
and
is
accessible
to
sacramento
police
for
up
to
two
years
he
says
that
for
his
city
at
least
residents
have
little
to
worry
about
it
s
not
as
if
there
s
somebody
sitting
here
waiting
for
a
particular
person
to
walk
by
everyday
and
using
the
cameras
as
some
means
to
follow
people
or
monitor
their
daily
lives
that
s
not
what
it
s
for
he
says
we
don
t
have
time
for
that
people
do
value
their
privacy
he
adds
even
police
officers
value
that
when
i
m
at

with
my

i
don

want
to
have
to
watch

doing
or
be

i
m
having
to
go
out
of
concern
that
somebody
might
be
watching
me
but
he
says
i
think
there
s
also
a
recognition
of
the
value
that
this
can
add
in
terms
of
us
having
a
positive

on

cardiff

said
in

there
is
a

said
brian
levin
executive

the

is
the

levin

also
noted
that
some

groups
don

local
tensions
may
arise
to
fly
and
be
absent
from
social

he
said
some
segments
of
the
community
shun
social

so
examining
social
media
as
a
predictor
can
be
a
bit
like
having
one
screwdriver
and
sometimes
it
doesn
t
work
predictive
policing
already
is
in
use
at
the
los

police
department
and
other
agencies
the

uses
a
predictive

algorithm
to
deploy

to
locations
where
prior
crime
patterns
strongly
suggest
similar
crimes
may
occur
as
crime
during
the
last
two

dropped
dramatically
across

and
los

police
commanders
are
increasingly
looking
for
any
edge
they
can
get
in
cutting

l
a

is
particularly
useful
because
a
huge

here
in

the

many

they
re
catching

on

as

and
epidemiology
the
algorithms
can
help
bring
down

rates
while
also
reducing
bias
in

their
creators
say
they
replace
more
basic
trendspotting
and
gut
feelings
about
where
crimes
will
happen
and
who
will
commit
them
with

that
s
a
strategy

trying
at

william

the

but
civil

groups
and
racial

organizations
are
wary
they
argue
that

perpetuates
racial
prejudice
in
a
dangerous
new
way
by
shrouding
it
in
the
legitimacy
accorded
by

prediction
models
rely
on
flawed
statistics
that
reflect
the
inherent
bias
in

they
contend
the

type
of

that
makes

more
likely
to
get
shot
dead
by
the

than
white

in
the
near

those
people
are
then
told
they

at

even
if
they
have
done
nothing
wrong
to
what
degree
predictive

actually
prevents

is
up

point

american

has
issued
the
following
news
release
riding

in
their
squad
car
officers
jamie
pascucci
and
joe
kania
are
cruising
the
neighborhood
of
homewood
scanning
the
streets
for
trouble
pittsburgh
pennsylvania
has
one
of
the
highest
murder
rates
among
large
u
s
cities
and
violent
crime
is
particularly
severe
in
homewood
a
black
pocket
of
aging
pock
marked
victorians
on
the
east
side
young
white
officers
from
outside
the
neighborhood
pascucci
and
kania
patrol
using
a
mixture
of
police
radio
calls
to
their
department
s
communications
center
and
instinct
they
get
occasional
help
from
shotspotter
a
network
of
sensors
that
detects
gunshots
and
relays
the
information
to
a
laptop
mounted
between
the
front
seats
but
starting
next
month
pascucci
and
kania
may
get
a
new
type
of
guidance
homewood
is
set
to
become
the
initial
pilot
zone
for
pittsburgh
s
predictive
policing
program
police
car
laptops
will
display
maps
showing
locations
where
crime
is
likely
to
occur
based
on
data
crunching
algorithms
developed
by
scientists
at
carnegie
mellon
university
here
in
theory
the
maps
could
help
cops
do
a
better
job
of
preventing
crime
many
other
cities
have
already
adopted
similar
systems
which
incorporate
everything
from
minor
crime
reports
to
criminals
facebook
profiles
they
re
catching
on
outside
the
united
states
as
well
drawing
on
approaches
from
fields
as
diverse
as
seismology
and
epidemiology
the
algorithms
can
help
bring
down
crime
rates
while
also
reducing
bias
in
policing
their
creators
say
they
replace
more
basic
trendspotting
and
gut
feelings
about
where
crimes
will
happen
and
who
will
commit
them
with
ostensibly
objective
analysis
that
s
a
strategy
worth
trying
at
a
time
when
relations
between
u
s
police
and
minorities
are
at
an
all
time
low
says
pittsburgh
police
chief
cameron
mclay
who
acknowledges
that
policing
has
a
long
way
to
go
to
fix
bias
last
year
mclay
showed
up
at
a
new
year
s
eve
celebration
holding
a
sign
that
read
i
resolve
to
end
racism
work
mclay
sees
the
use
of
big
data
combined
with
more
community
focused
strategies
as
part
of
a
palliative
for
policing
s
ills
they
re
not
predicting
the
future
what
they
re
actually
predicting
is
where
the
next
recorded
police
observations
are
going
to
occur
william
isaac
the
human
rights
data
analysis
group
but
civil
liberties
groups
and
racial
justice
organizations
are
wary
they
argue
that
predictive
policing
perpetuates
racial
prejudice
in
a
dangerous
new
way
by
shrouding
it
in
the
legitimacy
accorded
by
science
crime
prediction
models
rely
on
flawed
statistics
that
reflect
the
inherent
bias
in
the
criminal
justice
system
they
contend
the
same
type
of
bias
that
makes
black
men
more
likely
to
get
shot
dead
by
the
police
than
white
men
privacy
is
another
key
concern
in
chicago
illinois
one
scientist
has
helped
the
police
department
generate
a
list
of
individuals
deemed
likely
to
perpetrate
or
be
victims
of
violent
crime
in
the
near
future
those
people
are
then
told
they
re
considered
at
risk
even
if
they
have
done
nothing
wrong
to
what
degree
predictive
policing
actually
prevents
crime
meanwhile
is
up
for
debate
proponents
point
to
quick
reductions
in
crime
rates

good
evening
everyone
and
thank
you
to
bobby
chesney
and
the
teams
at
the
strauss
center
and
ut
law
for
having
me
here
and
for
organizing
an
exceptional
day
of
panels
i
m
admittedly
at
a
bit
of
a
loss
to
find
myself
here
at
my
alma
mater
the
university
of
texas
nominally
keynoting
lecturing
to
a
room
filled
with
so
many
of
the
people
i
have
worked
with
or
against
over
the
past
fifteen
years
there
are
mentors
here
mentees
colleagues
from
my
former
organizations
friends
frenemies
esteemed
opponents
i
ve
litigated
against
it
s
an
incredible
group
which
leaves
me
incredibly
humbled
and
more
than
a
little
freaked
out
if
this
were
some
public
keynote
with
a
bunch
of
civilians
i
could
just
do
my
usual
song
and
dance
on
the
issue
of
the
moment
most
likely
encryption
and
going
dark
n
repeating
arguments
you
ve
all
heard
before
n
and
that
would
be
that
but
i
owe
you
guys
something
more
than
that
some
grand
holistic
theory
of
everything
that
pulls
together
all
the
threads
from
today
s
panels
or
some
deeply
personal
and
idiosyncratic
take
that
gets
to
the
meat
of
why
i
do
what
i
do
i
foolishly
will
try
to
do
a
little
bit
of
both
tonight
and
will
probably
fail
to
do
either
one
effectively
but
success
or
failure
i
hope
the
next
minutes
will
provide
some
light
entertainment
and
some
minor
food
for
thought
to
complement
your
dinners
i
m
going
to
talk
about
the
path
that
started
for
me
here
at
ut
and
brought
me
to
this
work
perhaps
prompting
you
to
stop
and
reflect
a
bit
on
how
you
got
here
and
i
m
going
to
talk
about
where
i
think
we
are
now
as
a
community
and
about
where
i
think
we
are
going
amongst
other
things
this
talk
will
be
a
bit
of
a
love
letter
to
and
a
friendly
argument
with
the
electronic
frontier
foundation
eff
n
the
organization
where
i
spent
most
of
my
career
and
that
basically
raised
me
and
as
will
be
no
surprise
to
anyone
here
who
knows
me
well
it
s
also
going
to
address
one
of
my
great
passions
science
fiction
and
how
it
can
be
used
as
a
tool
to
help
us
think
about
today
s
problems
yep
science
fiction
get
used
to
it
non
nerds
the
topic
of
science
fiction
came
up
just
a
couple
of
weeks
ago
at
another
cybersecurity
event
the
hewlett
foundation
s
cybersecurity
grantees
meeting
in
los
angeles
n
there
thanks
to
the
foundation
s
president
larry
kramer
and
its
cybersecurity
program
officer
eli
sugarman
i
was
lucky
enough
to
meet
walter
parkes
the
screenwriter
of
wargames
and
sneakers
and
the
producer
of
minority
report
amongst
many
other
hit
movies
n
if
you
want
a
good
example
of
the
feedback
loop
between
fiction
and
especially
science
fiction
and
real
world
tech
and
policy
you
can
t
get
much
better
than
walter
since
wargames
inspired
the
computer
fraud
and
abuse
act
that
our
panelists
were
arguing
about
earlier
n
sneakers
inspired
countless
security
engineers
and
hackers
and
spooks
to
do
what
they
do
n
and
the
movie
version
of
minority
report
is
probably
the
second
most
cited
fictional
work
in
policy
discourse
about
surveillance
and
privacy
and
an
inspiration
for
a
lot
of
modern
interface
design
to
boot
n
what
s
the
first
most
cited
work
i
think
we
all
know
the
answer
but
we
ll
get
to
that
walter
being
from
hollywood
is
all
about
story
beginning
middle
and
end
strong
protagonists
with
clear
conflicts
and
relatable
goals
and
right
now
he
d
tell
me
to
stop
with
all
the
throat
clearing
and
begin
the
beginning
so
here
s
where
it
starts
for
me
fade
in
on
the
ut
campus
spring
of
my
freshman
year
it
was
easily
one
of
the
happiest
years
of
my
life
coming
from
southern
louisiana
a
place
where
progressive
bookish
sci
fi
nerds
who
don
t
like
football
didn
t
really
fit
in
i
finally
felt
like
i
was
home
and
my
only
job
was
reading
and
thinking
and
writing
for
no
other
purpose
than
to
explore
a
freedom
for
which
i
thank
plan
ii
ut
s
incredible
liberal
arts
honors
program
it
was
then
that
i
was
put
on
the
path
that
led
me
here
today
though
i
didn
t
know
it
at
the
time
i
expected
i
d
just
end
up
an
english
professor
until
that
spring
of
which
changed
the
course
of
my
life
and
it
wouldn
t
have
happened
without
science
fiction
it
s
a
truism
at
this
point
that
science
fiction
often
predicts
or
inspires
real
world
developments
whether
it
s
famous
sci
fi
author
arthur
c
clarke
coming
up
with
the
idea
of
communications
satellites
in
the
s
n
or
sadly
less
famous
sci
fi
author
john
brunner
predicting
computer
worms
in
the
s
n
or
william
gibson
in
his
early
s
cyberpunk
classic
neurohd
mancer
coining
the
term
cyberspace
long
before
any
of
us
were
exposed
to
the
modern
internet
n
and
if
you
don
t
know
what
cyberpunk
is
well
you
re
in
luck
because
year
old
me
would
be
super
excited
to
tell
you
all
about
it
right
now
because
he
s
totally
a
huge
fan
the
cyberpunk
science
fiction
of
the
s
and
s
tossed
out
the
spaceships
and
aliens
and
shiny
exciting
far
futures
of
previous
generations
to
look
closer
to
home
painting
a
dark
dystopian
picture
of
a
globally
networked
near
future
where
multinational
corporations
were
as
powerful
as
states
states
looked
a
lot
more
like
corporations
and
ordinary
peoples
lives
were
dictated
by
transnational
networks
of
data
and
capital
far
beyond
their
control
or
comprehension
n
but
the
prototypical
hacker
protagonist
that
anti
establishment
hero
was
not
like
those
ordinary
people
only
he
unfortunately
it
was
almost
always
a
he
could
get
behind
the
data
and
make
the
technology
work
for
him
and
turn
the
tables
on
the
powerful
indeed
the
hacker
protagonist
had
become
such
an
established
trope
by
the
early
s
that
neal
stephenson
s
cyberpunk
classic
snow
crash
which
came
out
in
the
fall
of
my
freshman
year
had
a
hacker
protagonist
jokingly
named
hiro
protaganist
n
the
teenage
me
just
gobbled
this
stuff
up
so
too
did
several
of
the
original
founders
of
eff
which
was
being
born
just
as
i
was
finishing
high
school
frankly
if
you
want
to
understand
why
eff
was
founded
who
its
constituency
is
and
why
its
culture
is
what
it
is
now
if
you
want
to
understand
the
birth
of
the
digital
rights
movement
in
the
us
really
it
very
much
helps
to
have
read
the
cyberpunk
fiction
of
the
s
and
s
indeed
eff
s
tag
line
for
its
recent
anniversary
wears
the
organization
s
science
fictional
origin
on
its
sleeve
that
slogan
eff
fighting
dystopia
for
years
but
i
digress
and
walter
parkes
is
getting
impatient
suffice
to
say
cyberpunk
left
me
well
primed
when
four
things
happened
to
set
me
on
the
path
that
brought
me
here
the
first
thing
was
simply
this
i
got
on
the
internet
for
the
very
first
time
to
use
email
for
the
very
first
time
and
coming
fresh
off
of
gibson
s
cyberspace
and
stephenson
s
metaverse
it
kind
of
blew
my
mind
second
i
read
and
was
inspired
by
the
hacker
crackdown
a
non
fiction
book
by
science
fiction
writer
and
austinite
bruce
sterling
n
it
was
all
about
the
emerging
hacker
subculture
the
secret
service
s
overreaching
response
to
it
including
the
seizure
of
all
the
computers
at
austin
based
steve
jackson
games
since
they
hosted
a
bbs
to
which
someone
had
posted
some
proprietary
at
t
documents
and
about
the
foundation
of
eff
which
was
initially
created
to
raise
the
money
and
find
the
lawyers
to
fight
for
steve
jackson
games
to
get
its
computers
back
reading
the
hacker
crackdown
was
kind
of
like
reading
one
of
the
cyberpunk
novels
that
sterling
and
gibson
and
stephenson
were
writing
at
the
time
but
it
was
real
and
just
to
tie
it
all
up
in
a
nice
bow
one
of
steve
jackson
s
most
popular
role
playing
games
at
the
time
inspired
by
those
same
novels
was
called
cyberpunk
that
book
well
blew
my
mind
third
thing
being
a
fan
of
bruce
sterling
i
also
picked
up
the
first
issue
of
wired
magazine
since
he
was
on
the
cover
n
and
then
its
second
issue
that
second
issue
had
on
the
cover
the
so
called
cypherpunks
including
one
of
the
founders
of
eff
who
were
fighting
the
first
round
of
the
original
crypto
wars
n
again
note
the
eff
cyberpunk
connection
those
magazines
which
i
distinctly
remember
buying
at
the
ut
student
union
not
far
from
here
illustrated
in
a
way
that
i
hadn
t
quite
realized
before
that
many
of
the
technologies
i
d
been
reading
about
in
science
fiction
were
real
or
very
close
to
it
and
it
blew
my
mind
after
that
fourth
and
finally
my
computer
nerd
dorm
neighbors
who
are
still
some
of
my
best
friends
showed
me
the
liberal
arts
wussie
who
s
primary
understanding
of
technology
came
from
reading
sci
fi
this
funny
new
computer
program
it
was
called
mosaic
the
very
first
web
browser
netscape
s
predecessor
and
the
first
concrete
glimpse
of
what
the
next
twenty
years
would
look
like
n
it
yes
that
s
right
blew
mind
as
an
english
major
my
first
response
was
wow
i
would
love
to
see
a
hypertext
edition
of
james
joyce
s
ulysses
i
was
big
on
joyce
at
the
time
my
second
response
though
was
i
don
t
want
to
be
an
english
professor
i
want
to
help
build
this
i
want
to
help
defend
it
and
grow
it
and
if
you
d
told
me
then
that
i
d
actually
end
up
doing
that
by
working
for
nearly
a
decade
at
the
eff
in
san
francisco
and
would
eventually
end
up
running
a
whole
new
digital
rights
shop
in
washington
dc
fighting
for
a
more
open
and
secure
internet
called
the
open
technology
institute
n
i
would
have
slapped
you
in
the
face
and
called
you
liar
for
getting
my
hopes
up
yet
here
we
are
flash
forward
to
now
twenty
odd
years
later
and
in
a
lot
of
ways
we
re
navigating
the
cyberpunk
future
that
was
predicted
in
the
s
although
with
some
unanticipated
bright
spots
see
the
fall
of
the
soviet
union
which
loomed
large
as
a
state
power
in
s
cyberpunk
n
some
tragic
curveballs
see
and
some
technological
shifts
that
we
didn
t
predict
see
the
rise
of
the
smartphone
but
again
walter
is
nagging
me
what
s
the
story
kevin
these
nice
people
want
to
know
who
are
the
protagonists
and
what
s
the
conflict
cut
to
the
chase
and
i
ll
do
that
though
it
s
not
a
chase
it
s
a
race
it
s
a
race
against
two
futures
two
dystopias
and
the
protagonists
of
this
tale
of
two
dystopias
are
us
here
in
this
room
and
everyone
else
in
our
community
that
is
trying
to
preserve
the
security
of
the
internet
one
of
the
dystopias
is
from
a
science
fiction
that
you
all
know
it
s
which
i
pointed
to
earlier
as
the
most
cited
fiction
in
privacy
policy
circles
n
was
also
cited
by
walter
parkes
in
la
as
a
great
example
of
how
narrative
can
take
a
set
of
complex
ideas
and
simplify
them
package
them
and
create
a
powerful
shorthand
that
everyone
understands
big
brother
has
become
our
go
to
signifier
when
warning
of
a
technology
enabled
surveillance
society
and
it
is
still
a
relevant
warning
as
we
re
looking
down
the
barrel
of
the
kind
of
totalitarian
surveillance
dystopia
that
portrays
but
updated
from
a
telescreen
centric
to
an
internet
centric
mode
a
world
where
all
of
the
public
expression
and
private
communication
flowing
over
the
internet
can
easily
be
monitored
and
manipulated
and
made
to
serve
the
interests
of
the
state
we
see
the
most
virulent
strains
of
this
future
already
reaching
into
our
present
especially
in
russia
and
china
whose
governments
are
wholly
unapologetic
in
trying
to
turn
the
internet
into
the
most
powerful
tool
of
social
control
ever
devised
n
we
see
a
more
friendly
velvet
gloved
brave
new
world
ish
n
version
of
that
future
infiltrating
the
west
as
intelligence
services
have
begun
to
live
on
the
internet
backbone
and
mass
surveillance
has
replaced
targeted
surveillance
and
many
are
left
wondering
where
our
dreams
in
the
s
of
the
internet
as
an
open
frontier
have
gone
n
imagine
here
a
footnote
to
either
jennifer
granick
s
great
keynote
at
black
hat
last
year
the
end
of
the
internet
dream
n
and
or
the
less
apt
but
still
hilarious
dream
of
the
s
sketch
from
the
comedy
show
portlandia
n
both
of
which
i
recommend
wholeheartedly
or
to
reference
another
much
beloved
science
fiction
after
several
decades
of
mostly
unconstrained
growth
of
the
global
open
internet
the
empire
is
striking
back
states
are
acting
in
some
cases
very
aggressively
to
reassert
their
digital
sovereignty
in
contrast
to
the
other
second
dystopia
is
one
that
none
of
you
have
ever
heard
of
from
a
science
fiction
book
that
none
of
you
have
read
though
it
and
the
other
books
in
the
trilogy
of
which
it
is
a
part
are
available
for
free
online
if
you
google
for
them
n
it
s
called
the
maelstrom
by
peter
watts
n
one
of
my
favorite
sci
fi
novelists
writing
today
what
is
the
maelstrom
you
ask
well
imagine
today
s
internet
with
all
its
emergent
insecurities
all
the
spooks
and
spies
and
hackers
and
criminals
and
state
attackers
and
botnets
and
phishing
scams
and
mass
data
breaches
and
backdoors
and
bad
guys
imagine
all
the
ugly
trends
outlined
in
profeshd
sor
ron
deibert
s
black
code
n
a
harrowing
portrait
of
the
modern
internet
that
i
highly
recommend
and
then
multiply
them
by
a
imagine
us
building
new
layer
upon
new
layer
over
the
chaotic
crumbling
foundation
that
is
the
internet
continually
trying
to
make
it
more
secure
and
continually
failing
as
the
botnets
we
talked
about
in
today
s
panel
grow
and
multiply
into
a
pervasive
infestation
of
self
evolving
automated
agents
an
electronic
war
of
all
against
all
red
in
tooth
and
claw
a
digital
state
of
nature
imagine
the
internet
as
a
failed
state
where
no
one
wants
to
go
but
where
everyone
has
to
live
because
we
ve
built
our
entire
society
on
top
of
it
that
is
the
maelstrom
and
those
are
our
two
dystopias
versus
the
maelstrom
order
vs
chaos
the
scylla
and
charybdis
that
we
as
a
community
need
to
navigate
because
none
of
us
want
either
of
those
futures
sure
some
of
us
fall
a
bit
more
on
the
order
side
or
the
chaos
side
or
as
dahlia
lithwick
put
it
in
one
of
her
more
popular
columns
some
of
us
are
order
muppets
and
some
of
us
are
chaos
muppets
n
google
it
but
i
know
that
my
oft
time
opponents
in
government
ultimately
don
t
want
to
live
in
the
liberty
eroding
any
more
than
i
want
to
live
in
the
anarchic
chaos
of
the
maelstrom
where
no
one
is
safe
and
we
need
to
work
together
to
plot
a
course
that
avoids
those
futures
or
even
worse
a
combination
of
those
futures
where
the
totalitarian
states
of
ride
atop
the
maelstrom
and
the
only
choice
left
to
anyone
if
they
have
a
choice
at
all
is
to
be
left
in
the
utter
chaos
outside
the
walls
of
the
state
or
to
embrace
big
brother
it
s
that
result
that
i
actually
fear
the
most
so
i
look
at
the
landscape
as
many
of
you
do
and
try
to
figure
out
how
to
move
the
right
levers
to
avoid
those
futures
but
every
lever
you
can
move
makes
another
lever
move
in
the
other
direction
for
every
action
there
s
an
equal
and
opposite
reaction
indeed
many
of
those
actions
and
reactions
are
things
that
have
been
in
the
news
and
that
we
have
been
talking
about
in
our
panels
just
in
the
past
few
days
take
for
example
a
company
like
facebook
turning
on
https
for
all
of
its
traffic
that
encryption
prevents
foreign
countries
like
say
the
uk
just
in
the
news
today
on
this
issue
from
sniffing
their
citizens
facebook
messages
as
they
pass
through
the
territory
to
and
from
us
servers
n
that
in
turn
prompts
athd
tempts
by
those
countries
to
either
regulate
against
encryption
or
demand
that
the
data
be
stored
locally
or
try
to
apply
their
laws
outside
of
their
territory
to
demand
the
handover
of
data
stored
in
the
us
backed
by
the
threat
of
throwing
facebook
execs
in
jail
if
they
ever
visit
or
consider
the
example
of
users
turning
to
end
to
end
encrypted
apps
like
imessage
or
whatsapp
which
prompts
demands
that
the
companies
not
offer
such
encryption
or
build
a
backdoor
into
it
and
also
prompts
government
stockpiling
of
vulnerabilities
to
hack
into
the
phones
as
an
alternative
to
wiretapping
pushback
on
one
issue
leads
to
more
pushback
on
another
issue
back
and
forth
tit
for
tat
a
never
ending
whack
a
mole
n
so
how
do
we
respond
well
we
discussed
one
of
the
current
strategies
during
yesterday
s
dinner
panel
the
idea
of
letting
off
steam
and
trying
to
give
the
governments
more
of
the
data
they
say
they
need
in
the
least
harmful
ways
to
avoid
the
most
harmful
ways
last
night
we
discussed
the
example
of
trying
to
come
up
with
a
new
framework
for
cross
border
data
transfers
if
we
can
come
up
with
a
way
for
google
or
facebook
or
whoever
to
voluntarily
hand
over
data
to
the
uk
in
a
way
that
is
consistent
with
human
rights
and
perhaps
even
raises
standards
the
thinking
goes
then
we
can
help
head
off
bad
things
like
data
localization
or
anti
encryption
mandates
or
american
internet
execs
getting
thrown
in
jail
some
privacy
minded
technologists
and
advocates
have
similarly
argued
that
if
we
can
just
routinize
and
standardize
government
hacking
under
clear
and
protective
standards
i
mean
they
are
doing
it
already
anyway
right
just
under
weak
unclear
secret
standards
then
we
can
head
off
bad
anti
encryption
policies
n
that
s
the
thinking
anyway
and
i
have
to
admit
that
i
m
very
sympathetic
to
this
approach
i
m
one
of
the
people
trying
to
figure
out
what
that
reasonable
compromise
might
be
on
cross
border
data
transfers
n
i
m
one
of
those
people
who
without
endorsing
the
idea
of
government
hacking
wants
to
expose
the
practice
to
real
regulation
and
ensure
that
it
is
included
in
the
calculus
as
we
continue
to
have
this
never
ending
going
dark
debate
n
i
m
scared
we
won
t
make
any
progress
and
will
continue
to
lose
ground
on
these
issues
if
we
re
not
willing
to
have
those
sorts
of
conversations
i
m
scared
we
ll
fail
to
protect
the
technologies
that
we
need
to
protect
ourselves
that
said
i
ll
also
admit
that
i
have
some
serious
concerns
about
this
approach
because
i
fear
the
governments
will
be
not
be
placated
by
our
concessions
i
think
we
may
let
off
steam
by
conceding
in
one
area
yet
still
fail
to
reduce
the
pressure
elsewhere
the
cross
border
issue
is
a
good
example
we
re
willing
to
compromise
to
arrive
at
a
human
rights
respecting
solution
when
it
comes
to
accessing
stored
content
in
criminal
investigations
and
yet
it
s
clear
from
today
s
story
in
the
washington
post
that
the
uk
s
priority
is
a
wiretapping
solution
for
its
national
security
investigations
n
the
privacy
advocates
that
are
willing
to
engage
in
the
cross
border
data
discussion
are
doing
it
because
we
re
concerned
about
the
alternative
of
forced
data
localization
and
yet
data
localization
very
well
may
happen
anyway
due
to
that
national
security
wiretapping
need
that
we
re
unwilling
to
address
or
due
to
an
ultimate
failure
of
the
eu
data
protection
safe
harbor
that
allows
us
companies
to
take
in
european
data
or
due
to
a
variety
of
factors
we
can
t
necessarily
predict
similarly
we
may
end
up
legitimizing
government
hacking
through
our
attempts
to
expose
and
regulate
it
while
still
not
achieving
the
goal
of
getting
law
enforcement
to
stop
pushing
for
limits
on
encryption
this
is
why
many
of
my
friends
and
mentors
including
folks
in
this
room
like
aclu
s
chris
soghoian
or
my
fellow
eff
alum
jennifer
granick
would
say
don
t
compromise
just
fight
it
just
fight
it
all
fight
on
every
front
and
don
t
give
any
ground
that
s
basically
the
way
i
was
raised
at
eff
and
they
do
have
a
point
why
should
we
be
working
to
give
governments
more
access
to
data
when
the
overall
trend
is
in
the
direction
of
a
golden
age
of
surveillance
where
the
information
they
don
t
have
access
to
is
just
a
small
portion
of
a
massive
amount
of
communications
data
that
didn
t
even
exist
twenty
years
ago
and
that
they
can
now
easily
obtain
why
should
we
be
the
reasonable
compromisers
when
the
state
s
appetite
for
data
is
essentially
unquenchable
because
the
operating
theory
in
law
enforcement
and
intelligence
seems
to
be
that
every
scrap
of
data
that
exists
or
will
exist
should
be
technically
accessible
to
them
at
any
time
that
they
have
a
natural
right
to
it
even
though
until
very
recently
nearly
the
entire
mass
of
human
communication
was
always
outside
of
their
reach
hell
electronic
eavesdropping
of
any
sort
was
an
incredibly
rare
oddity
until
the
back
half
of
the
last
century
n
and
yet
now
we
are
asked
to
build
our
entire
world
around
the
idea
of
guaranteed
government
access
to
all
of
our
private
communications
and
records
screw
them
is
what
they
would
say
and
i
hear
them
and
i
know
where
they
are
coming
from
just
fight
it
was
where
i
was
as
a
younger
man
as
a
litigator
being
young
and
being
a
litigator
makes
it
easy
to
see
the
world
in
such
blacks
and
whites
and
it
may
be
where
i
end
up
as
an
older
man
assuming
i
ve
tired
of
the
horse
trading
and
compromise
and
shifting
alliances
of
the
policy
game
and
have
lost
faith
that
the
rules
of
law
and
reason
can
actually
restrain
the
powerful
but
right
now
i
will
do
whatever
i
can
to
protect
the
right
to
encrypt
above
all
others
even
if
that
means
compromising
on
some
other
things
even
if
pushing
them
back
on
that
front
means
they
push
us
back
on
other
fronts
because
here
s
the
nub
only
encryption
helps
us
avoid
both
dystopias
only
encryption
it
protects
us
both
from
the
maelstrom
of
an
insecure
internet
and
the
of
an
unconstrained
state
that
can
see
into
every
nook
and
cranny
it
offers
the
middle
way
between
order
and
chaos
the
middle
way
between
security
of
the
state
and
security
from
the
state
and
right
now
that
s
where
i
m
pointing
all
my
guns
right
down
the
middle
in
defense
of
crypto
and
maybe
i
will
tire
of
the
middle
at
some
point
maybe
i
will
finally
get
sick
of
participating
in
discussions
about
cross
border
data
exchange
and
government
hacking
that
make
the
just
fight
it
all
side
of
me
worry
but
right
now
it
s
where
i
m
standing
and
i
invite
you
to
join
me
there
perhaps
you
d
prefer
not
maybe
your
mileage
may
vary
and
your
calculus
may
be
different
and
i
ll
just
have
to
keep
having
all
of
these
arguments
both
with
the
people
who
i
m
fighting
and
with
the
people
who
think
i
m
not
fighting
hard
enough
but
it
s
late
and
it
s
been
a
long
day
so
let
s
not
argue
about
it
now
walter
is
telling
me
that
this
story
has
climaxed
and
it
s
about
time
to
wrap
things
up
but
before
i
let
you
go
let
me
offer
two
closing
thoughts
that
might
be
useful
in
your
thinking
of
our
future
inspired
by
two
science
fiction
novels
about
the
future
of
our
thinking
the
first
is
a
newer
sci
fi
novel
called
nexus
by
ramez
naam
n
naam
is
an
interesting
character
he
spent
years
at
microsoft
leading
teams
developing
internet
explorer
and
outlook
and
their
search
engine
bing
but
really
wanted
to
be
a
sci
fi
writer
n
nexus
is
his
first
book
and
although
it
s
maybe
not
the
most
literary
novel
it
reads
like
an
airport
techno
thriller
on
sci
fi
steroids
it
s
premise
is
a
nice
take
on
an
old
idea
the
hybridization
of
man
and
machine
the
titular
technology
nexus
is
essentially
a
nano
technological
drug
that
integrates
with
your
brain
and
internet
enables
it
allowing
amongst
other
things
for
people
to
silently
communicate
with
each
other
to
share
complex
skills
and
masses
of
knowledge
in
an
instant
and
even
create
group
minds
just
like
you
can
network
computers
it
s
pretty
far
out
but
it
s
not
totally
nuts
in
fact
naam
has
some
fascinating
afterwords
in
the
book
and
its
sequels
laying
out
the
current
state
of
brain
computer
interface
research
n
and
there
s
a
lot
of
surprising
things
happening
in
labs
right
now
such
as
paralyzed
people
moving
robot
limbs
using
their
thoughts
n
blind
people
whose
vision
has
been
restored
by
inputting
electrical
signals
directly
into
their
visual
cortices
n
fmri
brain
scanners
that
read
what
a
person
is
seeing
and
can
reconstruct
the
video
n
and
brain
damaged
rats
whose
memories
have
been
restored
with
computer
chips
implanted
in
the
hippocampus
whose
memories
can
be
recorded
and
replayed
in
their
brains
at
any
time
n
just
last
week
i
read
a
story
about
researchers
using
electrodes
to
monitor
a
person
s
brain
and
then
matching
that
data
against
data
collected
from
previous
brains
to
figure
out
in
near
real
time
what
the
person
is
looking
at
n
and
then
there
is
perhaps
my
favorite
brain
research
story
about
the
two
university
of
washington
researchers
who
in
cooperatively
played
a
video
game
by
networking
their
freaking
brains
n
one
researcher
could
see
a
video
game
display
but
had
no
controls
while
the
other
had
the
controls
but
no
display
when
the
one
with
the
controls
wanted
to
shoot
an
eeg
cap
on
his
skull
would
transmit
a
signal
across
campus
where
a
magnetic
stimulator
on
the
other
researcher
s
head
would
send
a
targeted
pulse
through
his
motor
cortex
and
cause
his
finger
to
twitch
and
hit
the
fire
button
amazing
right
i
know
it
s
still
a
far
cry
from
having
internet
enabled
brains
but
that
kind
of
technology
is
foreseeable
perhaps
even
inevitable
so
one
science
fictional
thought
experiment
for
you
to
consider
while
you
finish
your
dessert
how
would
you
approach
cybersecurity
policy
if
the
things
we
were
securing
were
our
brains
and
the
data
we
were
securing
were
our
thoughts
how
would
you
feel
about
not
being
able
to
encrypt
the
private
thoughts
that
you
share
with
your
family
how
would
you
feel
about
the
possibility
of
a
government
secretly
implanting
malware
in
your
brain
sure
you
can
say
that
the
whole
idea
is
just
science
fiction
nonsense
but
like
all
good
science
fiction
it
s
a
metaphor
that
speaks
to
us
about
how
we
live
today
regardless
of
whether
you
think
our
brains
will
ever
literally
merge
with
computers
in
a
way
they
already
have
as
the
unanimous
supreme
court
recently
recognized
in
riley
v
california
our
mobile
devices
now
house
an
absolutely
enormous
amounts
private
thoughts
images
and
information
amounts
of
data
we
couldn
t
even
conceive
of
a
generation
ago
n
every
day
these
devices
are
looking
more
and
more
like
our
outboard
brains
at
what
point
does
that
change
how
we
treat
them
as
a
policy
matter
that
s
closing
thought
number
one
the
second
and
final
closing
thought
was
inspired
by
charlie
stross
accelerando
n
perhaps
my
favorite
sci
fi
novel
of
the
aughts
and
certainly
the
one
with
the
most
crazy
new
ideas
per
square
inch
in
that
book
several
characters
have
an
entertaining
debate
one
that
we
could
also
have
ourselves
right
now
about
whether
or
not
the
singularity
has
already
happened
if
you
re
not
familiar
with
the
singularity
a
term
bandied
about
by
ai
researchers
and
sci
fi
nerds
alike
it
s
the
name
for
the
hockey
stick
part
of
the
curve
in
our
technological
growth
where
the
exponential
progress
of
moore
s
law
hits
a
point
of
accelerating
acceleration
and
the
capacity
of
our
computing
power
begins
to
exceed
our
own
grasp
and
starts
improving
on
itself
and
beyond
that
point
we
are
supplanted
by
thinking
machines
that
we
can
t
even
comprehend
and
we
are
unable
to
predict
anything
anymore
because
what
s
going
to
happen
next
is
so
far
beyond
our
ken
n
some
people
jokingly
call
this
the
rapture
of
the
nerds
no
seriously
this
is
a
thing
a
thing
that
some
of
the
architects
of
our
digital
lives
including
some
people
who
make
big
decisions
at
google
take
very
seriously
and
just
as
you
need
to
understand
cyberpunk
to
understand
the
origin
of
american
digital
rights
groups
you
kind
of
need
to
understand
the
singularity
if
you
truly
want
to
grok
n
silicon
valley
s
weirdo
strain
of
technolibertarian
utopianism
but
anyway
back
to
accelerando
these
people
in
the
book
are
wondering
seriously
arguing
at
length
about
whether
they
re
post
singularity
and
the
joke
is
this
they
are
having
this
argument
on
a
laser
propelled
spaceship
the
size
of
a
can
of
soup
on
its
way
to
the
next
star
system
and
the
reason
they
are
able
to
be
having
that
argument
on
that
spaceship
is
because
they
aren
t
people
at
all
they
are
the
digitally
uploaded
brains
of
people
kind
of
a
crazy
idea
right
but
there
s
a
real
truth
inside
the
crazy
and
it
s
this
you
can
t
tell
when
you
re
in
it
when
you
re
in
it
we
ve
learned
to
take
so
much
of
our
technology
for
granted
and
so
quickly
that
if
a
time
traveler
from
even
just
ten
years
ago
visited
us
they
d
be
totally
disoriented
by
it
and
if
we
went
back
even
ten
years
we
d
be
kind
of
helpless
without
it
stross
joke
is
the
sci
fi
version
of
an
older
joke
that
was
central
to
a
great
commencement
speech
by
not
quite
science
fiction
author
david
foster
wallace
entitled
this
is
water
n
you
should
google
that
too
it
s
great
the
joke
is
two
young
fish
are
swimming
one
day
when
an
older
fish
passes
by
and
says
how
s
the
water
after
the
old
fish
passes
one
fish
turns
to
the
other
and
asks
him
what
the
hell
is
water
we
have
told
ourselves
so
many
times
that
we
re
in
the
midst
of
an
epochal
shift
in
the
nature
of
human
society
and
its
relationship
to
technology
that
we
ve
forgotten
how
true
it
is
this
is
water
we
are
in
it
right
now
and
it
s
very
easy
to
look
at
these
seismic
shifts
and
feel
powerless
in
the
face
of
them
but
it
s
actually
the
opposite
we
are
only
at
the
beginning
of
this
new
era
still
in
the
early
days
of
what
we
currently
call
the
internet
and
complex
systems
are
very
sensitive
to
initial
conditions
that
s
what
people
mean
when
they
talk
about
the
butterfly
effect
the
decisions
we
make
now
matter
more
than
we
know
we
are
the
butterflies
or
let
me
put
it
another
way
the
nsa
has
this
acronym
nobus
it
stands
for
nobody
but
us
and
it
refers
to
software
vulnerabilities
that
the
nsa
thinks
only
the
nsa
will
ever
discover
and
exploit
n
i
think
it
s
a
profoundly
flawed
concept
n
as
demonstrated
at
s
chaos
computer
congress
when
jake
appelbaum
did
a
keynote
on
the
snowden
docs
laying
out
the
nsa
s
catalog
of
exploits
and
the
vulnerability
that
one
of
those
exploits
relied
on
had
been
the
subject
of
a
research
presentation
just
the
day
before
n
someone
other
than
us
had
found
it
but
we
don
t
need
to
argue
about
nobus
right
now
right
now
i
m
using
the
phrase
nobody
but
us
in
a
very
different
way
right
now
what
i
m
here
to
say
is
that
nobody
but
us
is
going
to
set
the
initial
conditions
for
the
future
of
the
internet
nobody
but
us
those
of
us
in
this
room
and
our
communities
outside
of
this
room
and
our
opponents
who
want
to
abuse
the
internet
to
control
us
or
steal
from
us
or
attack
us
is
going
to
determine
which
science
fictional
future
we
re
going
to
live
in
whether
it
looks
like
the
maelstrom
or
big
brother
or
both
or
neither
nobody
but
us
is
going
to
create
the
future
that
we
want
we
are
the
butterflies
this
is
water
it
s
up
to
us
all
of
us
chaos
muppets
and
order

increasingly
people

criminals
are
stockpiling
higher
caliber

many
with

in

if

you

than
ever

in

struck
by

dies
up
from
one
death
in

the
previous
decade
it
ranks
as
one
of
the
most
lethal
of
america
s
largest
cities
according
to
a
baltimore
sun
analysis
two
other
cities
washington
and
new
orleans
shared
the
brutal
distinction
of
one
in
three
shootings
ending
in
a

the

one

last

the
odds
for
gunshot

worsened
in
at
least
of
the
nation
s
largest
cities
the
sun
found
the
baltimore
sun
undertook
a
yearlong
investigation
into
this
rarely
studied
phenomenon
documenting
patterns
of
lethality
based
on
hundreds
of
crime
statistics
hospital
data
and
gun
trace
reports
as
well
as
interviews
with
police
chiefs
homicide
detectives
criminologists
medical
experts
community
activists
victims
of
gun
violence
and
the
perpetrators
themselves
researchers
said
lethality
is
a
significant
part
of
the
homicide
equation
with
implications
for
policing
public
health
and
trauma
care
but
in
depth
study
has
been
hampered
by
a
paucity
of
statistics
historically
gun
violence
research
in
the
u
s
has
been
inhibited
by
a
lack
of
federal
funding
and
data
many
police
departments
only
track
what
they
are
required
to
report
to
the
fbi
which
doesn
t
include
how
often
people
survive
shootings
where
on
the
body
people
are
shot
and
how
many
times
that
leaves
a
focus
on
body
counts
and
homicide
rates
which
can
be
traced
back
nearly
a
century
while
the
nation
s
overall
violent
crime
rate
declined
starting
in
the
s
a
city
s
homicide
rate
typically
fluctuates
sometimes
significantly
leaving
criminologists
to
puzzle
over
the
causes
behind
spikes
and
dips
just
five
years
ago
baltimore
public
officials
were
celebrating
a
drop
in
the
annual
homicide
count
below
this
year
that
marker
was
crossed
in
august
the
latest
crime
wave
in
a
number
of
cities
baltimore
chicago
milwaukee
and
washington
to
name
a
few
has
prompted
deeper
soul
searching
deteriorating
police
community
relations
have
been
blamed
for
a
sharp
increase
in
shootings
and
homicides
as
have
gang
conflicts
and
entrenched
societal
ills
such
as
segregation
poverty
and
joblessness
but
one
often
overlooked
trend
has
been
consistent
over
the
years
the
sun
analysis
found
lethal
force
has
become
more
so
in
baltimore
where
there
were
nearly
shootings
last
year
a
one
in
four
lethality
rate
means
about
victims
die
a
one
in
three
rate
means
more
than
people
die
so
even
if
shootings
subside
the
number
of
gun
deaths
remains
elevated
on
the
streets
particularly
in
poor
black
neighborhoods
residents
are
witnessing
increasingly
deadly
tactics
more
shooters
are
aiming
for
the
head
and
firing
multiple
rounds
into
victims
the
number
of
fatal
head
shots
in
the
city
rose
steadily
from
about
percent
two
decades
ago
to
percent
last
year
meanwhile
the
number
of
cadavers
with
or
more
bullets
more
than
doubled
in
the
past
decade
according
to
the
maryland
medical
examiner
s
office
which
tallied
the
bullet
wounds
at
the
request
of
the
sun
now
roughly
two
thirds
of
city
homicide
victims
are
either
shot
in
the
head
or
multiple
times
many
suffer
both
fates
guns
have
also
become
more
deadly
as
the
weapon
of
choice
for
criminals
and
then
law
enforcement
shifted
from
the
revolver
to
the
semiautomatic
pistol
which
can
fire
more
bullets
without
reloading
nationally
the
number
of
mm
and
caliber
guns
taken
off
the
streets
surged
during
the
past
four
years
as
seizures
of
less
powerful
caliber
guns
remained
relatively
flat
in
maryland
seizures
of
mm
handguns
overtook
caliber
guns
for
the
first
time
last
year
most
were
recovered
from
baltimore
s
streets
where
the
saying
goes
buy
every
gun
that
comes
through
don
t
let
it
be
the
gun
that
kills
you
many
of
the
guns
are
equipped
with
extended
magazines
allowing
a
shooter
to
fire
from
a
distance
and
walk
down
a
victim
continuously
firing
the
sale

they
are

said
baltimore
police
maj
donald
bauer
who
leads
the
homicide
unit
while
shooters
motives
vary
experts
and
those
caught
in
the
crossfire
note
a
ruthlessness
on
the
streets
where
criminals
with
more
sophisticated
weaponry
aren
t
just
using
guns
to
intimidate
rivals
or
rob
they
are
using
them
to
take
people
out
with
greater
success
in
baltimore
and
other
cities
with
a
deeply
entrenched
no
snitching
ethos
the
emphasis
is
on
leaving
behind
no
witnesses
and
no
one
to
retaliate
it
s
very
common
for
someone
to
walk
up
and
empty
a
pistol
at
close
range
said
criminologist
david
m
kennedy
describing
the
extreme
hold
that
gangs
and
drug
crews
have
in
cities
like
baltimore
washington
and
new
orleans
it
s
going
in
with
a
heightened
intent
to
actually
kill
you
those
same
criminals
have
honed
strategies
to
keep
weapons
at
the
ready
guns
are
stashed
in
trash
cans
hung
from
gutter
grates
by
string
and
stashed
in
other
nooks
where
they
can
be
quickly
recovered
when
needed
covington
says
he
kept
part
of
his
arsenal
under
an
apartment
complex
s
washing
machine
or
people
serve
as
human
holsters
carrying
guns
for
felons
according
to
milwaukee
police
chief
edward
a
flynn
and
in
baltimore
hit
men
for
hire
have
become
fixtures
on
the
streets
police
recently
began
tracking
the
so
called
grand
club
an
organized
gang
of
hit
men
willing
to
kill
for
that
price
and
prosecutors
say
that
s
double
the
typical
fee
covington
became
a
contract
killer
but
also
says
he
killed
out
of
friendship
for
free
if
a
woman
approached
him
about
taking
out
her
rapist
or
her
child
s
molester
not
even
decades
of
advancements
in
trauma
medicine
can
stem
the
carnage
even
as
patients
with
major
injuries
from
other
assaults
and
car
accidents
have
seen
their
chances
improve
dramatically
gunshot
victims
have
watched
their
chances
of
survival
plummet
studies
by
hospitals
and
trauma
centers
across
the
country
including
baltimore
s
top
ranked
medical
systems
have
documented
this
contrarian
trend
we
feel
this
represents
a
true
change
in
violence
intensity
researchers
with
the
johns
hopkins
medical
institutions
concluded
a
decade
ago
doctors
say
it
has
gotten
worse
since
then
this
has
left
communities
nationwide
reeling
with
violence
concentrated
in
traumatized
neighborhoods
where
mothers
are
forming
support
groups
not
only
to
help
each
other
cope
but
in
a
desperate
search
for
ways
to
stop
the
killing
a
nationwide
network
of
grief
is
starting
to
take
shape
with
more
support
groups
banding
together
and
becoming
politically
active
we
re
all
facing
similar
dynamics
said
corneilius
scott
who
volunteers
as
executive
director
of

of

sons
and

united
in
baltimore
there
s
a
lot
of
concern
and
not
many
answers
at
the
group
s
meetings
parents
are
talking
about
sensitizing
young
men
to
the
effects
of
violence
they
believe
and
social
science
is
finding
that
their
boys
need
to
be
taught
empathy
lest
they
become
trapped
in
a
cycle
repeatedly
exposed
to
violence
and
becoming
more
likely
to
commit
it
more
guns
bigger
bullets
rodney
chase
sensed
trouble
when
three
young
men
approached
him
on
gay
street
in
baltimore
but
he
didn
t
run
saying
he
s
not
the
kind
to
back
down
from
anyone
one
of
the
men
pulled
a
gun
they
wanted
his
nfl
starter
jacket
his
wallet
anything
of
value
as

took
off

jacket
one
of
the
men
tried
to
yank
it
off
and
chase
instinctively
hit
him
the
gunman
fired
into
chase
s
belly
and
chase
felt
as
if
hot
grease
had
been
thrown
at
him
a
woman
nearby
screamed
and
called
an
ambulance
he
underwent
surgery
doctors
put
a
screen
under
his
skin
to
hold
in
his
organs
he
wasn

discharged
for
nearly
two
months
that
was
more
than
two
decades

had
he
been
shot
today
with
the
kinds
of
guns
prevalent
on

he

you

he

they

now
in

police
are
tracking
this

a

the

were
a

this

he

the

i
was
growing
up
said
turner
fordbey
the
man
who
survived
shots
everybody
wants
to
be
a
killer
it
s
more
killings
going
on
now
because
everybody
feel
like
they
got
to
prove
themselves
back
in
the
day
i
was
told
it
was
like
a
kind
of
rule
the
old
dudes
wouldn
t
allow
outsiders
to
come
in
the
hood
and
everybody
respected
the
women
and
children
now
it
s
like
no
respect
for
nothing
people
don
t
care
in
west
baltimore
this
summer
shooters
opened
fire
at
a
church
after
a
funeral
and
at
a
candlelight
vigil
both
being
held
for
other
shooting
victims
six
people
were
wounded
in
those
attacks
eight
people
were
shot
last
weekend
in
east
baltimore
steps
from
a
makeshift
memorial
where
three
weeks
earlier
a
man
died
and
two
women
were
injured
in
a
triple
shooting
in
chicago
a
south
side
gang
war
sparked
a
series
of
shootings
last
year
s
retaliatory
execution
of
year
old
tyshawn
lee
which
became
emblematic
of
the
ruthlessness
plaguing
that
city
led
his
father
this
year
to
shoot
the
girlfriend
of
a
suspect
in
his
son
s
killing
according
to
police
the
challenge
for
police
is
knowing
when
someone
might
pull
the
trigger
police
departments
nationwide
have
turned
to
predictive
policing
to
try
to
understand
who
might
be
the
next
killer
or
next
on
a
hit
list
chicago
police
have
created
the
strategic
subject
list
the
product
of
an
algorithm
that
calculates
someone
s
propensity
to
become
a
party
to
violence
a
person
s
score
is
based
on
previous
police
contacts
and
criminal
activity
known
affiliations
with
gang
members
social
connections
or
networks
and
past
injuries
from
gunshots
or
assaults
once
a
person
lands
on
the
list
chicago
police
make
in
person
visits
to
warn
of
the
consequences
that
will
result
should
violent
activity
continue
police
hope
to
reach
out
to
people
this
year
they
make
up
a
fraction
of
the
city
s
population
but
take
part
in
an
outsized
share
of
the
violence
in
the
first
three
months
of
this
year
about
three
quarters
of
the
shooting
victims
and
homicide
suspects
were
already
on
the
list
in
baltimore
a
similar
undertaking
has
identified
trigger
pullers
who
police
believe
are
the
most
likely
to
shoot
or
be
shot
people
land
on
the
list
for
a
combination
of
factors
including
a
history
of
violent
crime
or
handgun
violations
parole
or
probation
involvement
in
previous
gun
violence
officers
monitor
them
with
a
laser
focus
said
baltimore
police
col
stanley
brandford
in
many
cities
it
s
a
select
club
suspects
and
targets
often
know
each
other
they
may
have
been
friends
lived
on
the
same
the
street
or
even
be
related
many
are
in
the
drug
trade
together
that
familiarity
allows
for
face
to
face
disagreements
that
can
end
with
a
trigger
pull
the
distance
has
closed
in
a
lot
of
these
cases
and
now
they
re
up
on
each
other
said
brandford
who
has
led
the
baltimore
police
homicide
unit
two
times
in
his
career
these
guys
stay
in
these
neighborhoods
they
really
don
t
travel
very
far
and
the
opportunity
to
get
close
and
do
some
damage
is
prevalent
in
some
of
these
neighborhoods
police
say
a
common
tactic
shooters
use
to
gain
proximity
is
to
work
with
an
accomplice
who
knows
the
target
the
accomplice
lures
the
target
to
an
area
putting
the
person
at
ease
to
ensure
a
blind
side
attack
in
gang
parlance
it
s
known
as
rocking
you
to
sleep
criminals
today
know
to
get
close
to
their
target
and
fire
a
lot
of
bullets
said
stuart
myers
a
former
police
officer
who
runs
optac
international
which
trains
law
enforcement
in
maryland
and
elsewhere
on
weapons
and
tactics
that
s
because
most
criminals
aren
t
good
shots
he
said
even
police
officers
who
train
and
are
certified
miss
their
targets
more
than
they
hit
them
one
study
put
the
average
hit
rate
for
officers
at
less
than
percent
if
you
re
close
enough
to
a
target
you
could
close
your
eyes
and
pull
the
trigger
myers
said
he
estimated
that
range
is
within
three
yards
then
he
said
you
will
hit
your
target
shooters
are
also
reaching
for
high
caliber
guns
with
large
magazines
to
ensure
they
hit
their
mark
according
to
advocates
working
to
stem
the
violence
in
some
neighborhoods
friends
or
drug
crews
pool
money
to
buy
guns
and
they
become
shared
weapons
on
a
given
street
corner
chris
wilson
said
shooters
prefer
long
magazines
as
well
as
hollow
point
bullets
which
expand
upon
impact
causing
greater
tissue
damage
and
blood
loss
the
extendos
which
carry
more
bullets
have
become
an
obsession
in
street
culture
he
said
when
you
get
a
gun
you
got
to
put
an
extended
on
it
you
got
to
that
s
policy
you
got
to
be
official
said
wilson
who
grew
up
in
washington
where
he
was
in
more
than
a
dozen
shootouts
he
was
sentenced
to
life
in
prison
at
after
he
shot
and
killed
a
man
he
served
nearly
years
and
moved
to
baltimore
where
he
started
a
contracting
company
that
connects

offenders

former
baltimore
deputy
police
commissioner
jerry
rodriguez
who
spent
the
last
few
years
of
his
law
enforcement
career
in
baltimore
after
more
than
years
with
the
los
angeles
police
department
said
he
was
struck
by
the
level
of
determination
among
killers
in
baltimore
he
noted
the
high
number
of
head
shots
i
think
there
s
a
meaning
behind
that
i
think
there
s
a
purpose
behind
that
he
said
it
s
sending
a
message
but
it
s
also
making
sure
the
outcome
is
what
they
want
rodriguez
who
works
for
a
company
developing
technological
solutions
for
police
departments
said
he
found
a
much
more
personal
type
of
killing
in
baltimore
a
city
of
square
miles
compared
to
los
angeles
which
sprawls
over
square
miles
but
even
on
the
west
coast
police
have
noted
a
shift
in
shooting
dynamics
in
los
angeles
gangs
in
the
s
often
carried
out
drive
by
shootings
which
could
be
indiscriminate
and
ineffective
if
the
intent
was
to
kill
someone
in
particular
in
the
last
decade
police
said
they
ve
been
getting
out
of
the
car
you
want
to
kill
em
not
wing
em
said
lapd
homicide
detective
chris
barling
describing
the
mentality
of
shooters
police
also
note
an
almost
cavalier
attitude
among
killers
in
baltimore
a
gunman
caught
on
video
burst
into
a
barbershop
in
and
pulled
the
trigger
but
his
weapon
jammed
so
he
briefly
took
a
step
back
fixed
it
and
took
aim
again
a
gunman
who
had
just
shot
a
man
in
the
head
late
last
year
did
a
three
point
turn
in
his
car
with
a
nonchalance
noted
by
davis
the
police
commissioner
who
said
he
took
his
time
and
drove
away
like
it
was
nobody
s
business
covington
who
said
in
a
series
of
jailhouse
interviews
with
the
sun
that
he
killed
or
people
and
helped
in
a
couple
of
other
hits
explained
that
he
believes
the
majority
of
them
deserved
to
die
they
were
drug
dealers
criminals
people
just
like
me
he
said
he
does
say
that
he
wishes
he
hadn
t
targeted
one
young
victim
a
teenager
but
generally
speaking
i
never
really
think
about
it
he
said
hit
men
for
hire
in
the

in
west

which
has
since
been
demolished
covington
grew
up
on
the
floor
above
solothal
itchy
man
thomas
one
of
the
city
s
most
notorious
hit
men
covington
said
he
regularly
saw
people
shot
beaten
killed
he
was
or
when
he
saw
a
man
he
only
knew
as
country
dave
shot
to
death
at
the
corner
of
west
lafayette
and
argyle
avenues
dave
had
been
a
friend
who
gave
kids
in
the
neighborhood
dollars
to
buy
snacks
at
the
corner
market
but
covington
didn
t
turn
away
from
the
streets
despite
dreams
of
becoming
a
boxer
or
an
orioles
baseball
player
like
cal
ripken
jr
instead
he
sized
up
one
of
two
paths
available
to
him
and
other
teens
in
his
neighborhood
drug
dealing
or
becoming
a
cowboy
someone
who
robs
drug
dealers
he
chose
cowboy
covington
now
and
incarcerated
in
westover
md
can
t
recall
whether
the
man
shot
on
his
first
shooting
caper
survived
but
said
he
could
have
gone
to
jail
for
his
involvement
as
a
teen
his
neighborhood
fame
grew
i
had
grown
men
scared
of
me
and
as
a
man
he
shifted
from
random
violence
to
targeted
murderousness
he
was
paid
to
kill
he
once
charged
as
much
as
he
says
but
that
was
a
package
deal
he
says
that
he
has
worked
in
maryland
virginia
west
virginia
and
ohio
covington
declined
to
give
details
about
many
of
his
crimes
baltimore
police
have
suspected
his
involvement
in
six
to
homicide
cases
he
pleaded
guilty
to
one
homicide
in
baltimore
county
he
also
pleaded
guilty
to
his
role
in
two
other
homicides
in
the
city
but
received
no
additional
time
in
exchange
for
his
testimony
against
a
co
defendant
he
has
been
acquitted
in
another
homicide
and
in
one
shooting
he
was
the
guy
that
would
kill
people
for
money
plain
and
simple
that
s
how
he
made
a
living
said
baltimore
homicide
detective
frank
miller
adding
that
covington
was
part
of
a
clique
of
gunmen
who
took
murder
for
hire
contracts
and
robbed
drug
dealers
there
s
been
several
guys
over
the
years
that
we
ve
encountered
that
was
their
thing
covington
joined
the
black
guerrilla
family
and
intimidated
witnesses
for
the
gang
he
said
inmates
held
on
homicide
charges
would
call
and
ask
him
to
visit
witnesses
in
their
cases
being
a
friend
i
take
friendship
very
seriously
he
would
oblige
sometimes
he
didn
t
have
to
say
a
word
he
would
smell
their
fear
see
the
sweat
rolling
down
faces
other
times
he
had
to
say
some
pretty
hard
and
nasty
words
to
make
them
think
twice
about
testifying
i
don
t
want
to
say
witness
tampering
but
in
hindsight
it
s
sort
of
what
it
was
covington
said
the
baltimore
police
department
has
long
struggled
with
closing
homicide
cases
because
investigations
are
often
stymied
by
a
lack
of
cooperation
from
witnesses
so
far
this
year
police
have
only
closed
percent
of
homicide
cases
as
a
killer
covington
says
he
took
steps
to
evade
capture
he
wore
a
ski
mask
and
gloves
unless
he
planned
to
shoot
a
victim
when
they
were
alone
in
the
woods
or
in
a
house
he
knew
they
wouldn
t
survive
to
identify
him
he
lured
victims
to
him
so
that
he
could
control
the
environment
covington
who
now
says
he
wants
to
help
young
people
avoid
the
life
he
chose
was
part
of
an
insidious
underground
world
of
hit
men
for
hire
in
baltimore
police
say
these
shooters
commit
an
outsized
number
of
homicides
in
the
city
they
embody
an
intent
to
kill
that
s
ingrained
in
the
city
s
street
culture
in
some
cases
federal
authorities
suspect
a
single
hit
man
in
more
than
homicides
going
back
decades
in
recent
months
police
said
they
have
been
tracking
the
grand
club
an
organization
of
hit
men
officers
said
they
learned
about
the
club
from
confidential
informants
but
didn
t
want
to
jeopardize
investigations
by
releasing
more
information
it
s
not
hard
to
shop
around
for
a
murder
for
hire
said
assistant
u
s
attorney
jim
warwick
who
has
prosecuted
a
number
of
hit
men
in
the
city
they
will
do
it
very
quickly
with
no
thought
involved
they
just
need
the
money
the
weapon
preferably
a
photograph
of
the
person
if
they
don
t
know
the
person
and
where
the
person
can
be
found
the
typical
fee
for
a
hit
in
baltimore
is
which
may
be
split
between
trusted
accomplices
and
subcontracted
shooters
the
hit
man
may
call
into
action
warwick
said
some
hit
men
have
grown
savvy
over
the
years
and
begun
to
recruit
younger
violent
and
cold
blooded
individuals
to
do
the
job
for
them
he
said
they
are
hired
to
settle
an
outstanding
drug
debt
to
kill
a
woman
owed
child
support
or
to
get
back
at
someone
who
was
perceived
to
be
disrespectful
they
typically
aim
for
the
head
or
fire
into
their
victims
repeatedly
warwick
said
witnesses
are
considered
collateral
damage
the
hit
man
will
kill
whoever
is
with
the
target
as
well
warwick
said
they
re
expected
to
finish
the
job

with
its
sprawling
connections

shooters
and
the
bgf
to

taylor
said
they
are
suspected
in
connection
with
four
to
five
dozen
shootings
often
working
in
tandem
to
lure
victims
and
then
ambush
them

jones

denied
that
his

and

were

men
he
said
they
were
broke
he
questioned
whether

they
committed
multiple

he
hasn
t
seen
it
both

growing

said
miller
who
investigated
covington
pat
brown
a
criminal
profiler
in
maryland
said
shooters
often
develop
an
attachment
disorder
during
troubled
childhoods
so
that
they
have
difficulty
forming
long
term
relationships
and
often
fail
to
develop
a
conscience
they
often
witness
death
and
violence
becoming
numb
to
it
it
becomes
a
survival
of
the
fittest
and
you
lose
empathy
for
others
brown
said
they
see
people
as
tools
objects
and
things
baltimore
streets
breed
this
kind
of
mindset
she
said
it
has
gotten
out
of
control
with
the
lawlessness
and
hopelessness
at

where

while

maybe
the
more

picture
according
to

experts
is
that
surveillance
and
the
collection
and
analysis
of

will
play
a
central
role
in
solving
and
preventing
crime
the
public
safety
regime
of
tomorrow
in
other
words
is
all
about
data
this
is
the
future
of
policing
says
christopher
schneider
an
associate
professor
of
sociology
at
brandon
university
in
manitoba
cops
in
the
coming
decades
will
gather
information
online
interact
with
the
public
through
social

and
even
use
data
gleaned
from
the
internet
and
past
crimes
to
predict
and
prevent
future
law
breaking
schneider
says
this
is
already
happening
to
varying
degrees
in
american
cities
and
places
such
as
vancouver
and
toronto
where
police
used
a
program
to
comb
through
twitter
to
gather
evidence
for
a
recent
online
harassment
trial
policing
as
an
apparatus
is
going
to
be
much
more
mediated
and
it
s
going
to
be
much
more
community
oriented
than
it
currently
is
through
the
internet
through
social

schneider
says
this
is
going
to
expand
the
gaze
as
it
were
toward
crime
and
deviance
the
nexus
between
police
and
the

they

already
expanded

ritesh
kotak
a

consultant
for
agencies
in

overseas
said
tools
such

have
created

for
the
co
creating
of
public

with
new
and
convenient
avenues
to

and

police

shared
over

that
s
where
it

with

is
the
currency

with
an

mentality
and
deeper

added
police

can

engender
trust
with
the

people

like
they
re

he
said

data

can
also
be
used
for
more
futuristic
means
ryan
prox
a
special
constable
with
the
vancouver
police
department
is
one
of
the
pre
eminent
experts
in
the
emerging
field
of
predictive
policing
prox
prefers
to
call
it
crime
forecasting
in
which
police
forces
use
complex
computer
programs
that
churn
through
mountains
of
data
to
try
and
predict
when
and
where
future
crimes
will
occur
this
has
yet
to
catch
on
in
full
force
in
canada
but
police
in
cities
such
as
los
angeles
and
miami
have
signed
on
to
predictive
programs
designed
by
companies
such
as
predpol
prox
explains
predpol
uses
three
data
points
time
place
and
type
of
crime
to
draw
up
boundaries
in
which
crimes
are
most
likely
to
occur
then
local
police
patrol
these
areas
in
the
hopes
of
catching
the
bad
guys
prox
cautions
however
that
little
independent
scientific
research
has
been
done
on
these
programs
in
the
u
s
and
suggests
they
may
not
be
as
accurate
as
their
makers
claim
that
s
why
he
s
spearheading
a
six
month
predictive
policing
pilot
project
in
vancouver
which
began
feb
that
uses
an
intricate
software
program
designed
by
a
team
of
mathematicians
and
geospatial
engineers
the
program
sifts
through
crime
data
as
far
back
as
march
including
the
time
place
and
nature
of
an
offence
prox
says
but
it
also
considers
non
crime
factors
such
as
neighbourhood
income
area
traffic
density
locations
of
illicit
graffiti
and
even
wind
speed
to
forecast
the
probability
of
a
future
crime
being
committed
in
the
coming
hours
within
a
metre
radius
of
a
given
location
plainclothes
cops
will
be
dispatched
to
monitor
these
areas
with
uniformed
officers
on
standby
to
make
an
arrest
in
the
event
that
a
crime
is
witnessed
prox
says
tests
have
already
shown
a
to
per
cent
accuracy
rate
for
some
property
crimes
such
as
break
and
enters
which
are
easiest
to
predict
because
they
re
high
frequency
and
often
involve
repeat
offenders
prox
says
the
more
police
use
the
program
the
more
data
they
have
and
the
more
accurate
officials
hope
it
can
become
it
sounds
really
sci
fi
goofy
he
laughs
but
they
basically
call
it
an
artificial
learning
neural
network
that
s
the
mathematical
model
the
endgame
of
such
programs
prox
says
is
maximum
police
efficiency
in
an
era
of
ballooning
police
budgets
now
more
than
billion
a
year
in
toronto
for
example
that
could
be
a
welcome
prospect
but
critics
point
to
controversial
information
gathering
programs
such
as
carding
in
toronto
which
many
argue
disproportionately
target
visible
minorities
to
rely
on
such
practices
to
fuel
computer
software
programs
that
dictate
how
cops
are
deployed
could
entrench
existing
police
biases
schneider
says
are
we
going
to
then
be
criminalizing
certain
people
certain
segments
of
the
population
who
are
the
police
going
to
be
looking
at
he
asks
prox
acknowledges
this
is
a
legitimate
concern
but
says
the
vancouver
police
program
only
considers
data
from
crime
reports
and
other
objective
factors
it
s
generated
by
the
public
rather
than
fuelled
by
the
cops
themselves
others
have
brought
forward
concerns
about
how
predictive
policing
will
affect
individual
rights
brenda
mcphail
director
of
the
canadian
civil
liberties
association
s
privacy
technology
and
surveillance
project
says
the
main
worry
is
that
the
types
of
data
currently
used
to
forecast
crime
will
expand
to
include
more
personal
information
social
media
posts
online
purchase
histories
travel
bookings
or
location
data
from
public
wi
fi
use
this
could
not
only
invade
individual
privacy
it
could
erode
the
presumption
of
innocence
mcphail
adds
citing
court
decisions
in
canada
and
the
u
s
that
have
suggested
it
is
disproportionate
to
comb
through
data
of
many
individuals
to
find
a
single
criminal
the
concern
is
that
it
is
the
thin
edge
of
a
wedge
she
says
before
any
such
programs
are
implemented
we
as
a
society
need
to
compare
the
benefits
with
the
costs
particularly
the
costs
to
our
rights
and
civil
liberties
we
need
to
consider
the
risks
such
worries
go
beyond
crime
forecasting
programs
some
point
to
privacy
issues
in
the
face
of
intensifying
means
of
surveillance
such
as
the
extensive
camera
networks
that
are
used
by
police
in
fresno
calif
where
police
can
monitor
live
feeds
throughout
the
community
through
their
real
time
crime
center
david
lyon
a
queen
s
university
sociologist
and
head
of
the
school
s
surveillance
studies
centre
has
argued
that
people
s
lives
are
being
watched
to
the
point
that
it
already
makes
sense
to
label
many
western
countries
surveillance
societies
lyon
is
coauthor
of
a
book
on
the
subject
in
which
he
and
his
colleagues
argue
we
re
at
a
historic
turning
point
for
the
expansion
of
surveillance
measures
developments
with
obvious
consequences
for
privacy
and
state
power
much
of
this
can
be
viewed
as
part
of
a
social
shift
toward
a
so
called
safety
state
where
more
and
more
government
policies
and
police
actions
are
justified
through
fear
of
danger
says
charles
raab
a
political
science
professor
at
the
university
of
edinburgh
as
long
as
there
are
some
plausible
reasons
to
think
we
live
in
exceptionally
dangerous
times
such
as
terrorist
attacks
in
big
cities
there
will
be
public
fears
and
demands
for
more
security
and
safety
says
raab
other
values
such
as
equality
fairness
and
the
exercise
of
rights
and
liberties
are
constrained
by
the
imperative
to
make
everything
safe
and
secure
this
isn
t
inevitable
raab
says
but
with
terrorism
and
climate
change
dominating
the
media
and
politicians
routinely
emphasizing
this
danger
in
their
quests
for
votes
safety
will
continue
to
be
a
top
social
priority
and
that
probably
means
the
police
of
tomorrow
will
find
ways
to
use
our
data
and
train
cameras
on
us
in
an
effort
to
keep
us
safe
june
staffing
shortages
fewer
opportunities
for
job
growth
and
a
perception
of
bias
in
promotions
and
policy
enforcement
are
hampering
morale
at
the
burbank
police
department
according
to
the
results
of
a
police
union
administered
survey
the
burbank
police
officers
assn
last
month
invited
members
including
officers
of
all
ranks
as
well
as
seven
recent
retirees
to
take
the
survey
they
answered
questions
some
with
multiple
parts
and
were
given
space
to
write
comments
roughly
half
of
the
participants
indicated
that
they
d
considered
leaving
the

sometime
during
the
last

that
morale
was
low
or
extremely
low
with
one
member
calling
the
department
a
depressing
place
to
work
while
another
wrote
that
pretty
much
everyone
dreads
going
to
work
meanwhile
of
participants
disagreed
or
strongly
disagreed
that
the
agency
has
improved
its
level
of
service
to
the
community
over
the
last
five
years
the
goal
of
the
survey
union
leaders
said
was
to
identify
problems
and
work
with
management
to
improve

conditions
burbank
police
chief
scott
lachasse
said
in

tuesday
it
would
be
premature
to
comment
on
the
survey
without
first
engaging
in
good
faith
discussions
with
the

but
pointed
to
the
department
s
strategic
plan
which
focused
on
changes
to
ensure
officer

reduce

and
guarantee
ethical

the

is
proceeding
and
the
objectives
are
being
achieved
lachasse
wrote
to
boost
morale
dozens
of
members
who
completed
the
survey
advocated
that
the
agency
hire
more
officers
increase
specialty

critics
of
the

say
that
the

sometimes
zeroes
in
on
obvious
areas
like
the

already
know

or
silly
ones
like
the

where
people
often
show
up
to

say
police
visibility
in

capt

our

this
is

made
progress
filling
vacancies

recruiting
diverse
candidates
to
join

several
months
into
a
two

recruitment
plan
that
involves
offering
more

the

one

two

other

fairness

the

are
constrained
by
the
imperative
to

inevitable

with

of
surveillance
measures
developments
with
obvious
consequences
for
privacy
and
state
power
much
of
this
can
be
viewed
as
part
of
a
social
shift
toward
a
so
called
safety
state
where
more
and
more
government
policies
and
police
actions
are
justified
through
fear
of
danger
says
charles
raab
a
political
science
professor
at
the
university
of
edinburgh
as
long
as
there
are
some
plausible
reasons
to
think
we
live
in
exceptionally
dangerous
times
such
as
terrorist
attacks
in
big
cities
there
will
be
public
fears
and
demands
for
more
security
and
safety
says
raab
other
values
such
as
equality
fairness
and
the
exercise
of
rights
and
liberties
are
constrained
by
the
imperative
to
make
everything
safe
and
secure
this
isn
t
inevitable
raab
says
but
with
terrorism
and
climate
change
dominating
the
media
and
politicians
routinely
emphasizing
this
danger
in
their
quests
for
votes
safety
will
continue
to
be
a
top
social
priority
and
that
probably
means
the
police
of
tomorrow
will
find
ways
to
use
our
data
and
train
cameras
on
us
in
an
effort
to
keep
us
safe
according
to
some
prominent
voices
in
the
tech
world
artificial
intelligence
presents
a
looming
existential
threat
to
humanity
warnings
by
luminaries
like
elon
musk
and
nick
bostrom
about
the
singularity
when
machines
become
smarter
than
humans
have
attracted
millions
of
dollars
and
spawned
a
multitude
of
conferences
but
this
hand
wringing
is
a
distraction
from
the
very
real
problems
with
artificial
intelligence
today
which
may
already
be
exacerbating
inequality
in
the
workplace
at
home
and
in
our
legal
and
judicial
systems
sexism
racism
and
other
forms
of
discrimination
are
being
built
into
the
machine
learning
algorithms
that
underlie
the
technology
behind
many
intelligent
systems
that
shape
how
we
are
categorized
and
advertised
to
take
a
small
example
from
last
year
users
discovered
that
google
s
photo
app
which
applies
automatic
labels
to
pictures
in
digital
photo
albums
was
classifying
images
of
black
people
as
gorillas
google
apologized
it
was
unintentional
but
similar
errors
have
emerged
in
nikon
s
camera
software
which
misread
images
of
asian
people
as
blinking
and
in
hewlett
packard
s
web
camera
software
which
had
difficulty
recognizing
people
with
dark
skin
tones
this
is
fundamentally
a
data
problem
algorithms
learn
by
being
fed
certain
images
often
chosen
by
engineers
and
the
system
builds
a
model
of
the
world
based
on
those
images
if
a
system
is
trained
on
photos
of
people
who
are
overwhelmingly
white
it
will
have
a
harder
time
recognizing
nonwhite
faces
a
very
serious
example
was
revealed
in
an
investigation
published
last
month
by
propublica
it
found
that
widely
used
software
that
assessed
the
risk
of
recidivism
in
criminals
was
twice
as
likely
to
mistakenly
flag
black
defendants
as
being
at
a
higher
risk
of
committing
future
crimes
it
was
also
twice
as
likely
to
incorrectly
flag
white
defendants
as
low
risk
the
reason
those
predictions
are
so
skewed
is
still
unknown
because
the
company
responsible
for
these
algorithms
keeps
its
formulas
secret
it
s
proprietary
information
judges
do
rely
on
machine
driven
risk
assessments
in
different
ways
some
may
even
discount
them
entirely
but
there
is
little
they
can
do
to
understand
the
logic
behind
them
police
departments
across
the
united
states
are
also
deploying
data
driven
risk
assessment
tools
in
predictive
policing
crime
prevention
efforts
in
many
cities
including
new
york
los
angeles
chicago
and
miami
software
analyses
of
large
sets
of
historical
crime
data
are
used
to
forecast
where
crime
hot
spots
are
most
likely
to
emerge
the
police
are
then
directed
to
those
areas
at
the
very
least
this
software
risks
perpetuating
an
already
vicious
cycle
in
which
the
police
increase
their
presence
in
the
same
places
they
are
already
policing
or
overpolicing
thus
ensuring
that
more
arrests
come
from
those
areas
in
the
united
states
this
could
result
in
more
surveillance
in
traditionally
poorer
nonwhite
neighborhoods
while
wealthy
whiter
neighborhoods
are
scrutinized
even
less
predictive
programs
are
only
as
good
as
the
data
they
are
trained
on
and
that
data
has
a
complex
history
histories
of
discrimination
can
live
on
in
digital
platforms
and
if
they
go
unquestioned
they
become
part
of
the
logic
of
everyday
algorithmic
systems
another
scandal
emerged
recently
when
it
was
revealed
that
amazon
s
same
day
delivery
service
was
unavailable
for
zip
codes
in
predominantly
black
neighborhoods
the
areas
overlooked
were
remarkably
similar
to
those
affected
by
mortgage
redlining
in
the
mid
th
century
amazon
promised
to
redress
the
gaps
but
it
reminds
us
how
systemic
inequality
can
haunt
machine
intelligence
and
then
there
s
gender
discrimination
last
july
computer
scientists
at
carnegie
mellon
university
found
that
women
were
less
likely
than
men
to
be
shown
ads
on
google
for
highly
paid
jobs
the
complexity
of
how
search
engines
show
ads
to
internet
users
makes
it
hard
to
say
why
this
happened
whether
the
advertisers
preferred
showing
the
ads
to
men
or
the
outcome
was
an
unintended
consequence
of
the
algorithms
involved
regardless
algorithmic
flaws
aren
t
easily
discoverable
how
would
a
woman
know
to
apply
for
a
job
she
never
saw
advertised
how
might
a
black
community
learn
that
it
were
being
overpoliced
by
software
we
need
to
be
vigilant
about
how
we
design
and
train
these
machine
learning
systems
or
we
will
see
ingrained
forms
of
bias
built
into
the
artificial
intelligence
of
the
future
like
all
technologies
before
it
artificial
intelligence
will
reflect
the
values
of
its
creators
so
inclusivity
matters
from
who
designs
it
to
who
sits
on
the
company
boards
and
which
ethical
perspectives
are
included
otherwise
we
risk
constructing
machine
intelligence
that
mirrors
a
narrow
and
privileged
vision
of
society
with
its
old
familiar
biases
and
stereotypes
if
we
look
at
how
systems
can
be
discriminatory
now
we
will
be
much
better
placed
to
design
fairer
artificial
intelligence
but
that
requires
far
more
accountability
from
the
tech
community
governments
and
public
institutions
can
do
their
part
as
well
as
they
invest
in
predictive
technologies
they
need
to
commit
to
fairness
and
due
process
while
machine
learning
technology
can
offer
unexpected
insights
and
new
forms
of
convenience
we
must
address
the
current
implications
for
communities
that
have
less
power
for
those
who
aren
t
dominant
in
elite
silicon
valley
circles
currently
the
loudest
voices
debating
the
potential
dangers
of
superintelligence
are
affluent
white
men
and
perhaps
for
them
the
biggest
threat
is
the
rise
of
an
artificially
intelligent
apex
predator
but
for
those
who
already
face

the

dogged
by

when

houston

appeared
among

the
p

were
big
enough
to
nab
all

but
while
the
results
were
promising
they
didn
t
provide
the
fine

detail
needed
to
foil
an
actual

strike
however
professor
peter
rosenfeld
from
the

a
co

on

says
recent

shows
a

narrow
things
down

for
example
authorities
know
houston

the

they
could
show

a

of
the
city
divide
it
into
quadrants
then
sequentially
ask
if
the

were
planned
in
each
when
they
recognise
the
quadrant
they

then
you
take
that
quadrant
and
break
it
down
into
quadrants

so
on
until
you
get
it
down
to
a
specific
neighbourhood
says
rosenfeld
who
has
been
studying
this
field
for
decades
but
there
s
a
further
obstacle
to
its
adoption
by
justice
departments
if
p
results
are
to
be
admitted
as
evidence
in
a

they
must
satisfy

not
just
scientific

but
also
a

of
arm
twisting
rosenfeld
is
on
the
cusp
of
running
a

the
recent

brussels

deeper
into

an

for
a

act
even
if
the

never

passed
by

police
forces
and
to
agencies
involved
with
counter
terrorism
but
without
their
consent
he
is
not
prepared
to
comment
on
their
responses
the
p
mermer
patent
holder
is
dr
larry
farwell
a
harvard
graduate
with
a
doctorate
in
biological
psychology
who
was
nominated
by

in
as
one
of

who
may
be
the
picassos
or
the
einsteins
of
the
st
century
like
rosenfeld
farwell
has
researched
in
the
field
for
decades
but
farwell
s
p
mermer
has
made
it
into
the
courtroom
in
a
cold
case
where
a
suspected
murderer
was
ultimately
convicted
and
in
a
separate
case
where
a
person
wrongly
convicted
of
murder
was
exonerated
however
the
degree
to
which
p
mermer
evidence
was
relied
upon
and
whether
it
was
definitively
ruled
admissible
is
unclear
and
farwell
s
version
of
the
p
test
has
its
detractors
who
dispute
that
the
p
mermer
differs
sufficiently
from
the
standard
test
to
warrant
claims
of
near
infallibility
a
article
in
cognitive
neurodynamics
criticised
small
sample
sizes
and
a
paucity
of
peer
review
in
studies
cited
by
farwell
to
support
his
claim
that
brain
fingerprinting
is
per
cent
accurate
those
authors
said
farwell
s
finding
of
per
cent
accuracy
stands
in
sharp
contrast
with
the
available
literature
and
concluded
he
was
misleading
and
misrepresents
the
scientific
status
of
brain
fingerprinting
technology
farwell
vigorously
rejected
those
charges
in
the
same
journal
and
in
an
email
to
fairfax
media
says
peer
reviewed
published
research
at
the
fbi
cia
and
us
navy
has
shown
that
all
studies
that
meet
the

fingerprinting
scientific
standards
have
produced
less
than

in

but
while
the

a

a

closer
to

policing
the
technology
on
which
the
test
is
based
has
been
widely
researched
and
performs
well
in
the
lab
but
the
commercial
version
dubbed
brain
fingerprinting
is
dogged
by
claims
that
its
high
profile
creator
a
harvard
trained
neuroscientist
has
oversold
it
and
even
if
its
scientific
bona

are
established
legal
experts
are
worried
that
acting
on
the
test
s
findings
could
threaten
the
very
pillars
of
our
criminal
justice
system
the
basic
technique
is
in
fact
relatively
uncontroversial
with
a
scientific
pedigree
that
has
chalked
up
over
a
thousand
peer
reviewed
articles
the
p
concealed
information
test
uses
eeg
to
measure
brain
waves
with
headgear
reminiscent
of
one
of
those
fifties
floral
bathing

it
exploits
the
fact
that
when

recognise

meaningful
to

among

a

blips
with

the

sprouting

roughly

later
in
an
era
of
heightened
fears
of

and
the
difficulty
of
policing
lone
wolves
and
covertly
radicalised
youths
it
s
not
hard
to
see
why
p
has
law
enforcement
all
a
quiver
say
john
or
jane
doe
has
been
scrolling
through
a
document
titled
how
to
make
an
improvised
explosive
device
and
is
invited
to
a
fireside
chat
at
constable
plod
s
plod
could
apply
the
bathing
cap
sit
doe
in

of
a
computer
and
show
him
or
her
the
terror
title
among
irrelevant
others
such
as
how
to
avoid
huge
ships
or
why
cats
paint
unless
doe
has
very
niche
literary
tastes
the
ied
guide
should
provoke
a
distinctive
peak
the
p
test
differs
from
traditional
question
and
answer
lie
detection
in
that
it
doesn
t
rely
on
the
fight
or
flight
nervous
system
to
moisten
palms
and
quicken
pulses
signs
some
experts
say
catch
lies
with
an
accuracy
little
better
than
chance
and
because
eeg
independently
detects
whether
a
suspect
recognises
dubious
material
p
does
not
rely
on
reluctant
people
answering
questions
they
would
rather
not
answer
but
its
potential
as
a
conduit
to
the
nefarious
plans
of
would
be
terrorists
really
took
off
with
the
release
of
a
study
that
had
psychology
students
turn
jihadist
for
a
day
the
faux
insurgents
were
asked
to
hatch
a
mock
terrorist
plot
by
selecting
one
of
four
dates
in
july
one
of
four
locations
in
houston
and
one
of
four
types
of
bomb
then
jot
it
all
down
in
a
letter
to
their
terrorist
boss
eeg

on
they
were
later
shown
a
slew
of
months
of

us
cities
and
varieties
of
terror
attack
on
a
computer
and
when
july
houston
and
bomb
appeared
among
them
the
p
spikes
were
big
enough
to
nab
all
culprits
but
while
the
results
were
promising
they
didn
t
provide
the
fine
grained
detail
needed
to
foil
an
actual
terror
strike
however
professor
peter
rosenfeld
from
the
department
of
psychology
at
northwestern
university
a
co
author
on
the
study
says
recent
research
shows
a
related
technique
called
searching
cit
might
narrow
things
down
if
for
example
authorities
know
houston
is
the
target
they
could
show
suspects
a
map
of
the
city
divide
it
into
quadrants
then
sequentially
ask
if
the
attack
were
planned
in
each
when
they
recognise
the
quadrant
they
ll
show
the
biggest
p
then
you
take
that
quadrant
and
break
it
down
into
quadrants
and
so
on
until
you
get
it
down
to
a
specific
neighbourhood
says
rosenfeld
but
there
s
a
further
obstacle
to
its
adoption
by
justice
departments
if
p
results
are
to
be
admitted
as
evidence
in
a
us
court
they
must
satisfy
the
daubert
standard
which
demands
not
just
scientific
credibility
in
the
lab
but
also
a
known
error
rate
in
the
field
after
years
of
arm
twisting
rosenfeld
is
on
the
cusp
of
running
a
study
at
a
major
united
states
airport
that
will
step
baggage
handlers
off
the
line
and
ask
them
to
load
pistols
into
a
distinctive
suitcase
aviation
authorities
have
been
understandably
reluctant
to
take
part
then
they
ll
use
the
p
to
see
if
the
suitcase
presented
on
a
computer
screen
with
a
duffle
bag
attach
case
backpack
and
other
assorted
luggage
generates
that
guilty
spike
law
enforcement
agencies
will
be
watching
the
results
intently
as
the
pressure
mounts
to
thwart
terrorism
at
the
planning
stage
fuelled
by
the
recent
attacks
in
paris
brussels
and
lahore
and
tougher
australian
terror
laws
are
likely
to
impel
police
deeper
into
the
world
of
pre

and
this
emerging
technology
it
is
already
an
offence
to
plan
or
prepare
for
a
terrorist
act
even
if
the
act
never
happens
and
legislation
passed
by
the
nsw
government
in
may
extends
the
time
a
suspected

can
be
held
without

from
four
to
days
with
the
approval
of
a
judge
each

has
separate

under

but
the

review
of

ditching
the
requirement
that

likely
to
happen
within

before

be
issued
in
this
new
world
of

the

of

tantalising
enter
brain
fingerprinting
a
variant
of
the
p
test
called
p
mermer
that
swaps
bathing
caps
for
sleek

has
been
commercially
available
in
australia
for
months
through
the
biometrics
company
fingerscan
fingerscan
s
general
manager
peter
ives
says
brain
fingerprinting
has
been
demonstrated
to
the
nsw
and
queensland
police
forces
and
to
agencies
involved
with
counter
terrorism
but
without
those
agencies
consent
he
is
not
prepared
to
comment
on
their
responses
the
p
mermer
patent
holder
is
dr
larry
farwell
a
harvard
graduate
with
a
doctorate
in
biological
psychology
who
was
nominated
by
time
magazine
in
as
one
of
innovators
who
may
be
the
picassos
or
the
einsteins
of
the
st
century
like
rosenfeld
farwell
has
researched
in
the
field
for
decades
but
farwell
s
p
mermer
has
made
it
into
the
courtroom
in
a
cold
case
where
a
suspected
murderer
was
ultimately
convicted
and
in
a
separate
case
where
a
person
wrongly
convicted
of
murder
was
exonerated
however
the
degree
to
which
p
mermer
evidence
was
relied
upon
and
whether
it
was
definitively
ruled
admissible
is
unclear
and
farwell
s
version
of
the
test
has
its
detractors
who
dispute
that
his
p
mermer
differs
sufficiently
from
the
standard
test
a
article
in
cognitive
neurodynamics
criticised
small
sample
sizes
and
a
paucity
of
peer
review
in
studies
cited
by
farwell
to
support
his
claim
brain
fingerprinting
is
per
cent
accurate
those
authors
said
farwell
s
finding
of
per
cent
accuracy
stands
in
contrast
with
the
available
literature
and
concluded
he
was
misleading
and
misrepresents
the
scientific
status
of
brain
fingerprinting
technology
farwell
rejected
those
charges
in
the
same
journal
and
in
an
email
to
fairfax
media
says
peer
reviewed
published
research
at
the
fbi
cia
and
us
navy
has
shown
that
all
studies
that
meet
the
brain
fingerprinting
scientific
standards
have
produced
less
than
per

error
rate
in
fact
per

error
rate
per

accuracy
but
while
the
role
of

it
sets

very
much

go

picks
up
on

a

a

policing
the
technology
on
which
the

is
based
has
been
widely
researched
and
performs
well
in
the

but
the
commercial
version
dubbed
brain
fingerprinting
is
dogged
by
claims
that
its
high
profile
creator
a
harvard
trained
neuroscientist
has
oversold
it
and
even
if
its

legal
experts
are
worried
that
acting
on
the

s
findings
could
threaten
the
very
pillars
of
our
criminal

the
basic
technique
is
in
fact
relatively
uncontroversial
with
a
scientific
pedigree
that
has
chalked
up
over
a
thousand
peer

articles
the
p
concealed

test
uses
eeg
to
measure
brain

with
headgear
reminiscent
of
one
of
those

floral

it
exploits
the

that
when

a

later
in

of

and
the

of

lone

and
covertly
radicalised

it
s
not
hard
to
see
why
p
has
law
enforcement
all
a
quiver
say
john

jane

how

plod

plod

apply
the

sit
doe
in

a

show
him
or
her
the
terror
title
among
irrelevant
others
such
as
how
to
avoid
huge
ships
or
why
cats
paint
unless
doe
has
very
niche
literary
tastes
the
ied
guide
should
provoke
a
distinctive
peak
the
p
test
differs
from
traditional
question
and
answer
lie
detection
in
that
it
doesn
t
rely
on
the
fight
or
flight
nervous
system
to
moisten
palms
and
quicken
pulses
signs
some
experts
say
catch
lies
with
an
accuracy
little
better
than
chance
and
because
eeg
independently
detects
whether
a
suspect
recognises
dubious
material
p
does
not
rely
on
reluctant
people
answering
questions
they
would
rather
not
answer
but
its
potential
as
a
conduit
to
the
nefarious
plans
of
would
be
terrorists
really
took
off
with
the
release
of
a
study
that
had

students
turn
jihadist
for

the

were
asked
to
hatch
a
mock

plot
by
selecting
one
of
four
dates
in

one
of
four
locations
in
houston
and
one
of
four
types
of
bomb
then
jot
it
all
down
in

were

and
varieties
of

attack
on

computer
and
when
july
houston
and
bomb
appeared
among
them
the
p
spikes
were
big
enough
to
nab
all
culprits
but
while
the
results
were
promising
they
didn
t
provide
the
fine
grained
detail
needed
to
foil
an
actual
terror
strike
however
professor
peter
rosenfeld
from
the
department
of
psychology
at
northwestern
university
a
co
author
on
the
study
says
recent
research
shows
a
related
technique
called
searching
cit
might
narrow
things
down
if
for
example
authorities
know
houston
is
the
target
they
could
show
suspects
a
map
of
the
city
divide
it
into
quadrants
then
sequentially
ask
if
the
attack
were
planned
in
each
when
they
recognise
the
quadrant
they
ll
show
the
biggest
p
then
you
take
that
quadrant
and
break
it
down
into
quadrants
and
so
on
until
you
get
it
down
to
a
specific
neighbourhood
says
rosenfeld
but
there
s
a
further
obstacle
to
its
adoption
by
justice
departments
if
p
results
are
to
be
admitted
as
evidence
in
a
us
court
they
must
satisfy
the
daubert
standard
which
demands
not
just
scientific
credibility
in
the
lab
but
also
a
known
error
rate
in
the
field
after
years
of
arm
twisting
rosenfeld
is
on
the
cusp
of
running
a
study
at
a
major
united
states
airport
that
will
step
baggage
handlers
off
the
line
and
ask
them
to
load
pistols
into
a
distinctive
suitcase
aviation
authorities
have
been
understandably
reluctant
to
take
part
then
they
ll
use
the
p
to
see
if
the
suitcase
presented
on
a
computer
screen
with
a
duffle
bag
attach
case
backpack
and
other
assorted
luggage
generates
that
guilty
spike
law
enforcement
agencies
will
be
watching
the
results
intently
as
the
pressure
mounts
to
thwart
terrorism
at
the
planning
stage
fuelled
by
the
recent
attacks
in
paris
brussels
and
lahore
and
tougher
australian
terror
laws
are
likely
to
impel
police
deeper
into
the
world
of
pre

and
this
emerging
technology
it
is
already
an
offence
to
plan
or
prepare
for
a
terrorist
act
even
if
the
act
never
happens
and
legislation
passed
by
the
nsw
government
in
may
extends
the
time
a
suspected
terrorist
can
be
held
without
charge
from
four
to
days
with
the
approval
of
a
judge
each
state

has
separate
laws
allowing

to

suspects
for
up

under

but
the
february
review
of

ditching
the
requirement
that

to
happen
within

before

in

enter
brain
fingerprinting
a
variant
of
the
p
test
called
p
mermer

commercially
available
in

through

general

peter

says
brain
fingerprinting
has
been
demonstrated
to
the
new
south
wales
and
queensland
police
forces
and
to
agencies
involved
with
counter
terrorism
but
without
those
agencies
consent
he
is
not
prepared
to
comment
on
their
responses
the
p
mermer
patent
holder
is
dr
larry
farwell
a
harvard
graduate
with
a
doctorate
in
biological
psychology
who
was
nominated
by

in
as
one
of
innovators
who
may
be
the
picassos
or
the
einsteins
of
the
st
century
like
rosenfeld
farwell
has
researched
in
the
field
for
decades
but
farwell
s
p
mermer
has
made
it
into
the
courtroom
in
a
cold
case
where
a
suspected
murderer
was
ultimately
convicted
and
in
a
separate
case
where
a
person
wrongly
convicted
of
murder
was
exonerated
however
the
degree
to
which
p
mermer
evidence
was
relied
upon
and
whether
it
was
definitively
ruled
admissible
is
unclear
and
farwell
s
version
of
the
test
has
its
detractors
who
dispute
that
his
p
mermer
differs
sufficiently
from
the
standard
test
a
article
in
cognitive
neurodynamics
criticised
small
sample
sizes
and
a
paucity
of
peer
review
in
studies
cited
by
farwell
to
support
his
claim
brain
fingerprinting
is
per
cent
accurate
those
authors
said
farwell
s
finding
of
per
cent
accuracy
stands
in
contrast
with
the
available
literature
and
concluded
he
was
misleading
and
misrepresents
the
scientific
status
of
brain
fingerprinting
technology
farwell
rejected
those
charges
in
the
same
journal
and
in
an
email
to
the
sunday
age
says
peer
reviewed
published
research
at
the
fbi
cia
and

navy
has
shown
that
all

that

have
produced

are
going
to
commit
a
crime
it
is
as
if
that
crime
has
already
occurred
it
produces
the
spectre
of
crime
she
says
worse
mcculloch
s
analysis
of
pre
crime
suggests
it
may
promote
the
very
terrorism
it
sets
out
to
prevent
pre
crime
prosecutions
very
much
focus
on
the
political
and
religious
ideology
of
the
person
and
if
you
target
a
whole
community
some
people
find
it
difficult
to
get
over
the
feeling
they
are
being
persecuted
people
go
underground
and
become
more
dangerous
she
says
people
are
being
convicted
for
their
beliefs
rather
than
their
behaviour
this
picks
up
on
phillip
k
dick
s
core
concern
that
the
utopian
ideal
of
eliminating
threat
creates
a
dystopian
world
of
state
power
highlight
our
world
is
increasingly
shaped
by
biased
algorithms
that
have
been
built
with
little
oversight
according
to
some
prominent
voices
in
the
tech
world
artificial
intelligence
presents
a
looming
existential
threat
to
humanity
warnings
by
luminaries
like
elon
musk
and
nick
bostrom
about
the
singularity
when
machines
become
smarter
than
humans
have
attracted
millions
of
dollars
and
spawned
a
multitude
of
conferences
but
this
hand
wringing
is
a
distraction
from
the
very
real
problems
with
artificial
intelligence
today
which
may
already
be
exacerbating
inequality
in
the
workplace
at
home
and
in
our
legal
and
judicial
systems
sexism
racism
and
other
forms
of
discrimination
are
being
built
into
the
machine
learning
algorithms
that
underlie
the
technology
behind
many
intelligent
systems
that
shape
how
we
are
categorized
and
advertised
to
take
a
small
example
from
last
year
users
discovered
that
google
s
photo
app
which
applies
automatic
labels
to
pictures
in
digital
photo
albums
was
classifying
images
of
black
people
as
gorillas
google
apologized
it
was
unintentional
but
similar
errors
have
emerged
in
nikon
s
camera
software
which
misread
images
of
asian
people
as
blinking
and
in
hewlett
packard
s
web
camera
software
which
had
difficulty
recognizingpeople
with
dark
skin
tones
this
is
fundamentally
a
data
problem
algorithms
learn
by
being
fed
certain
images
often
chosen
by
engineers
and
the
system
builds
a
model
of
the
world
based
on
those
images
if
a
system
is
trained
on
photos
of
people
who
are
overwhelmingly
white
it
will
have
a
harder
time
recognizing
nonwhite
faces
a
very
serious
example
was
revealed
in
an
investigation
published
last
monthby
propublica
it
found
that
widely
used
software
that
assessed
the
risk
of
recidivism
in
criminals
was
twice
as
likely
to
mistakenly
flag
black
defendants
as
being
at
a
higher
risk
of
committing
future
crimes
it
was
also
twice
as
likely
to
incorrectly
flag
white
defendants
as
low
risk
the
reason
those
predictions
are
so
skewed
is
still
unknown
because
the
company
responsible
for
these
algorithms
keeps
its
formulas
secret
it
s
proprietary
information
judges
do
rely
on
machine
driven
risk
assessments
in
different
ways
some
may
even
discount
them
entirely
but
there
is
little
they
can
do
to
understand
the
logic
behind
them
police
departments
across
the
united
states
are
also
deploying
data
driven
risk
assessment
tools
in
predictive
policing
crime
prevention
efforts
in
many
cities
including
new
york
los
angeles
chicago
and
miami
software
analyses
of
large
sets
of
historical
crime
data
are
used
to
forecastwhere
crime
hot
spots
are
most
likely
to
emerge
the
police
are
then
directed
to
those
areas
at
the
very
least
this
software
risks
perpetuating
an
already
vicious
cycle
in
which
the
police
increase
their
presence
in
the
same
places
they
are
already
policing
or
overpolicing
thus
ensuring
that
more
arrests
come
from
those
areas
in
the
united
states
this
could
result
in
more
surveillance
in
traditionally
poorer
nonwhite
neighborhoods
while
wealthy
whiter
neighborhoods
are
scrutinized
even
less
predictive
programs
are
only
as
good
as
the
data
they
are
trained
on
and
that
data
has
a
complex
history
histories
of
discrimination
can
live
on
in
digital
platforms
and
if
they
go
unquestioned
they
become
part
of
the
logic
of
everyday
algorithmic
systems
another
scandal
emerged
recently
when
it
was
revealed
that
amazon
s
same
day
delivery
service
was
unavailable
for
zip
codes
in
predominantly
black
neighborhoods
the
areas
overlooked
were
remarkably
similar
to
those
affected
by
mortgage
redlining
in
the
mid
th
century
amazon
promised
to
redress
the
gaps
but
it
reminds
us
how
systemic
inequality
can
haunt
machine
intelligence
and
then
there
s
gender
discrimination
last
july
computer
scientists
at
carnegie
mellon
university
found
that
women
were
less
likely
than
men
to
be
shown
ads
on
google
for
highly
paid
jobs
the
complexity
of
how
search
engines
show
ads
to
internet
users
makes
it
hard
to
say
why
this
happened
whether
the
advertisers
preferred
showing
the
ads
to
men
or
the
outcome
was
an
unintended
consequence
of
the
algorithms
involved
regardless
algorithmic
flaws
aren
t
easily
discoverable
how
would
a
woman
know
to
apply
for
a
job
she
never
saw
advertised
how
might
a
black
community
learn
that
it
were
being
overpoliced
by
software
we
need
to
be
vigilant
about
how
we
design
and
train
these
machine
learning
systems
or
we
will
see
ingrained
forms
of
bias
built
into
the
artificial
intelligence
of
the
future
like
all
technologies
before
it
artificial
intelligence
will
reflect
the
values
of
its
creators
so
inclusivity
matters
from
who
designs
it
to
who
sits
on
the
company
boards
and
which
ethical
perspectives
are
included
otherwise
we
risk
constructing
machine
intelligence
that
mirrors
a
narrow
and
privileged
vision
of
society
with
its
old
familiar
biases
and
stereotypes
if
we
look
at
how
systems
can
be
discriminatory
now
we
will
be
much
better
placed
to
design
fairer
artificial
intelligence
but
that
requires
far
more
accountability
from
the
tech
community
governments
and
public
institutions
can
do
their
part
as
well
as
they
invest
in
predictive
technologies
they
need
to
commit
to
fairness
and
due
process
while
machine
learning
technology
can
offer
unexpected
insights
and
new
forms
of
convenience
we
must
address
the
current
implications
for
communities
that
have
less
power
for
those
who
aren
t
dominant
in
elite
silicon
valley
circles
currently
the
loudest
voices
debating
the
potential
dangers
of
superintelligence
are
affluent
white
men
and
perhaps
for
them
the
biggest
threat
is
the
rise
of
an
artificially
intelligent
apex
predator
but
for
those
who
already
face
marginalization
or
bias

the
international
association
of
privacy
professionals
has
issued
the
following
news
release
i
have
to
be
honest
with
you
i
ve
been
working
as
a
journalist
in
the
privacy
space
for
the
last
six
years
and
privacy
never
really
mattered
that
much
to
me
when
i
first
understood
via
snowden
that
the
u
s
government
was
collecting
data
on
all
of
us
i
didn
t
knee
jerk
freak
out
i
thought
about
what
i
do
online
the
kinds
of
data
that
likely
generates
about
me
and
what
kind
of
surveillance
that
probably
meant
as
a
result
i
can
t
say
i
was
ever
in
the
if
you
re
not
doing
anything
wrong
you
ve
got
nothing
to
hide
camp
but
i
also
wasn
t
arms
up
in
the
air
outraged
that
some
corporation
potentially
handed
my
data
over
to
the
police
no
i
didn
t
love
the
idea
that
the
feds
maybe
knew
i
d
once
googled
is
a
yam
different
from
a
sweet
potato
but
it
didn
t
keep
me
up
at
night
as
a
journalist
it
s
kind
of
my
job
not
to
freak
out
i
m
to
strip
the
emotion
from
the
subject
and
report
on
the
facts
so
i
ve
spent
most
of
my
time
nonplussed
at
the
headlines
whether
i
m
writing
them
or
someone
else
is
but
then
i
went
to
an
event
at
georgetown
law
last
week
called
the
color
of
surveillance
and
the
hair
on
my
arms
stood
up
straight
for
about
eight
continuous
hours
i
d
missed
it
completely
i
d
missed
the
entire
reason
privacy
isn
t
just
a
concern
for
those
of
us
logged
into
ashley
madison
or
those
of
us
researching
something
more
nefarious
than
the
difference
between
starches
i
missed
that
it
should
matter
to
me
because
there
are
people
for
whom
it
has
to
matter
by
virtue
of
their
socioeconomic
or
racial
status
and
while
i
have
the
luxury
by
virtue
of
my
own
socioeconomic
status
and
race
of
ignoring
reality
and
letting
this
not
be
my
problem
that
s
not
how
wrongs
are
righted
never
has
been
there
s
this
kanye
west
lyric
that
s
been
chasing
me
around
since
i
first
heard
it
west
wrote
in
racism
s
still
alive
they
just
be
concealing
it
but
i
know
they
don
t
want
me
in
the
damn
club
they
even
make
me
show
id
to
get
inside
a
sam
s
club
i
never
really
understood
why
that
particular
lyric
of
all
the
powerful
rap
lines
i
ve
ever
heard
has
stayed
with
me
for
so
long
but
sitting
at
georgetown
last
week
and
hearing
speakers
many
of
them
african
american
and
or
muslim
themselves
describe
the
realities
on
the
ground
i
realized
it
s
exactly
that
kind
surveillance
showing
id
to
get
into
sam
s
club
that
seems
so
absurd
but
which
persists
in
much
more
dangerous
contexts
than
just
retail
stores
like
sam
s
last
week
i
finally
saw
surveillance
not
as
something
mildly
offensive
to
my
own
sense
of
civil
liberties
but
as
a
tool
of
institutional
racism
it
suddenly
became
clear
to
me
and
i
m
so
embarrassed
it
didn
t
prior
that
the
people
most
stripped
of
their
privacy
rights
in
this
surveillance
age
are
the
people
who
are
the
most
vulnerable
i
m
white
and
grew
up
in
middle
class
portland
maine
and
i
really
hadn
t
had
a
front
row
seat
to
the
kind
of
experiences
i
m
talking
about
here
but
the
powerful
surveilling
the
powerless
is
nothing
new
it
existed
even
in
the
earliest
days
of
slavery
surveillance
and
power
have
long
been
closely
linked
to
institutional
racism
from
slave
owners
branding
their
slaves
so
they
couldn
t
move
freely
and
privately
around
to
planation
owners
building
homes
tall
enough
to
surveill
the
entire
plantation
slavery
may
have
been
abolished
but
now
we
see
racism
and
oppression
in
a
new
power
structure
in
which
the
powerful
hold
the
data
on
the
less
powerful
and
in
that
way
control
a
whole
lot
of
things
including
access
to
services
freedom
of
movement
and
most
egregiously
dignity
here
s
one
example
khiara
bridges
is
a
professor
at
boston
university
who
studied
pregnant
women
applying
to
medicaid
all
of
them
poor
most
of
them
of
color
her
research
has
found
a
system
fundamentally
flawed
by
design
in
which
women
relying
on
government
assistance
to
have
a
child
were
required
before
ever
seeing
a
health
practitioner
to
be
informationally
canvassed
via
coerced
consultations
that
ask
the
kinds
of
degrading
questions
white
privately
insured
women
would
never
be
asked
at
a
healthcare
facility
these
women
are
routinely
drilled
on
whether
they
ve
missed
prenatal
care
appointments
whether
the
pregnancy
was
planned
or
accidental
whether
they
ve
ever
abused
controlled
substances
been
domestically
abused
been
homeless
and
if
they
say
yes
more
information
is
gathered
that
information
is
then
funneled
to
other
state
bureaucracies
including
immigration
customs
enforcement
or
even
criminal
justice
in
order
to
continue
their
medicaid
care
the
women
are
then
tracked
and
surveilled
in
demeaning
ways
which
bridges
calls
the
poverty
of
privacy
rights
and
because
poor
people
are
seen
as
social
problems
they
re
situated
inside
a
tight
government
net
where
they
can
be
patrolled
harassed
and
controlled
as
deemed
necessary
after
all
where
are
they
going
to
go
for
medical
care
if
not
government
assistance
that
s
the
trade
off
you
want
our
help
we
ll
use
your
data
how
we
see
fit
or
for
further
evidence
we
can
look
to
black
men
it
doesn
t
take
much
research
to
find
a
startling
number
of
examples
of
police
harassment
according
to
research
presented
by

they
make
up
less
than
percent
of
the
total
population
besides
arrests
khan
reported
there
are
more
covert
surveillance
methods
employed
in
which
housing
authorities
are
forging
partnerships
with
police
to
track
movements
of
residents
government
subsidized
cell

distributed
and
their
gps

in
recent
years
police

instituting

tactics
used
to

about

having
policemen
watching
your
every

suspiciously
waiting

we

that

something
black

in

neighborhoods
experience
every

and
now
other
communities
of

are
affected
as
well
if

georgetown

alvaro

said
that
to
him
privacy
is
black
kids
being
able

make
mistakes
without

watching

i
like
that
that
s
the
way
i
grew
up
i
made
mistakes
in
my
neighborhood
all
the
time
in
public
but
in
my
public
there
was
even
still
some
privacy
or
at
least
obscurity
and
i
was
allowed
to
get
smarter
more
mature
from
those
mistakes
rather
than
be
forever
marked
by
them
as
always
we
re
keeping
the
vulnerable
vulnerable
asserting
power
just
because
we
can
because
he
who
owns
the
data
who
makes
decisions
on
who
has
access
to
what
based
on
that
data
holds
the
power
and
that
s
why
privacy
pros
in

are
so
important
there
s
been
a
lot
of
talk
lately
about
the
need
to
continue
making
ethics

and
not
just
compliance
based
decisions
and
i
can
t
think
of
a
context
more
worthy
than
the
restoration
of
human
dignity
for
everyone
as
privacy
pros
you
get
to
make
decisions
that
have
real
impacts
on
people
s
lives
though
it
may
sometimes
seem
more
abstract
than
that
decisions
like
should
we
even
collect
this
data
to
begin
with
if
we
do
who
might
own
it
someday
and
it
may
seem
absurd
that
these
questions
are
related
to
social
injustice
and
an

guess
what
they
really

dateline
lahore
washington
the
international
association
of
privacy
professionals
has
issued
the
following
news
release
i
have
to
be
honest
with
you
i
ve
been
working
as
a
journalist
in
the
privacy
space
for
the
last
six
years
and
privacy
never
really
mattered
that
much
to
me
when
i
first
understood
via
snowden
that
the
u
s
government
was
collecting
data
on
all
of
us
i
didn
t
knee
jerk
freak
out
i
thought
about
what
i
do
online
the
kinds
of
data
that
likely
generates
about
me
and
what
kind
of
surveillance
that
probably
meant
as
a
result
i
can
t
say
i
was
ever
in
the
if
you
re
not
doing
anything
wrong
you
ve
got
nothing
to
hide
camp
but
i
also
wasn
t
arms
up
in
the
air
outraged
that
some
corporation
potentially
handed
my
data
over
to
the
police
no
i
didn
t
love
the
idea
that
the
feds
maybe
knew
i
d
once
googled
is
a
yam
different
from
a
sweet
potato
but
it
didn
t
keep
me
up
at
night
as
a
journalist
it
s
kind
of
my
job
not
to
freak
out
i
m
to
strip
the
emotion
from
the
subject
and
report
on
the
facts
so
i
ve
spent
most
of
my
time
nonplussed
at
the
headlines
whether
i
m
writing
them
or
someone
else
is
but
then
i
went
to
an
event
at
georgetown
law
last
week
called
the
color
of
surveillance
and
the
hair
on
my
arms
stood
up
straight
for
about
eight
continuous
hours
i
d
missed
it
completely
i
d
missed
the
entire
reason
privacy
isn
t
just
a
concern
for
those
of
us
logged
into
ashley
madison
or
those
of
us
researching
something
more
nefarious
than
the
difference
between
starches
i
missed
that
it
should
matter
to
me
because
there
are
people
for
whom
it
has
to
matter
by
virtue
of
their
socioeconomic
or
racial
status
and
while
i
have
the
luxury
by
virtue
of
my
own
socioeconomic
status
and
race
of
ignoring
reality
and
letting
this
not
be
my
problem
that
s
not
how
wrongs
are
righted
never
has
been
there
s
this
kanye
west
lyric
that
s
been
chasing
me
around
since
i
first
heard
it
west
wrote
in
racism
s
still
alive
they
just
be
concealing
it
but
i
know
they
don
t
want
me
in
the
damn
club
they
even
make
me
show
id
to
get
inside
a
sam
s
club
i
never
really
understood
why
that
particular
lyric
of
all
the
powerful
rap
lines
i
ve
ever
heard
has
stayed
with
me
for
so
long
but
sitting
at
georgetown
last
week
and
hearing
speakers
many
of
them
african
american
and
or
muslim
themselves
describe
the
realities
on
the
ground
i
realized
it
s
exactly
that
kind
surveillance
showing
id
to
get
into
sam
s
club
that
seems
so
absurd
but
which
persists
in
much
more
dangerous
contexts
than
just
retail
stores
like
sam
s
last
week
i
finally
saw
surveillance
not
as
something
mildly
offensive
to
my
own
sense
of
civil
liberties
but
as
a
tool
of
institutional
racism
it
suddenly
became
clear
to
me
and
i
m
so
embarrassed
it
didn
t
prior
that
the
people
most
stripped
of
their
privacy
rights
in
this
surveillance
age
are
the
people
who
are
the
most
vulnerable
i
m
white
and
grew
up
in
middle
class
portland
maine
and
i
really
hadn
t
had
a
front
row
seat
to
the
kind
of
experiences
i
m
talking
about
here

the
powerful
surveilling
the
powerless
is
nothing

washington
national
center
for
reason
and
justice
has
issued
the
following
news
release
to
many
the
idea
of
predictability
an
accurate
forecast
of
who
would
do
harm
in
the
future
if
released
is
alluring
in
our
widely
unjust
system
risk
assessments
can
appear
more
measured
and
bias
free
than
the
judgment
of
police
judges
corrections
officers
or
psychologists
the
logic
behind
this
reform
wave
if
police
and
prosecutors
mistakenly
target
good
people
an
algorithm
won
t
risk
assessment
instruments
are
often
seen
as
better
than
the
status
quo
where
few
people
convicted
of
violent
offenses
are
released
on
parole
or
receive
a
reduced
sentence
but
is
the
right
question
to
be
asking
in
this
moment
really
how
to
balance
professional
judgment
and
a
predictive
instrument
or
even
how
these
algorithms
or
tools
are
inaccurate
and
racially
profile
instead
perhaps
we
should
be
asking
why
there
is
such
a
profound
silence
surrounding
the
elephant
in
the
room
the
structural
problems
in
society
that
drive
harm
even
if
burgess
was
right
that
predictability
is
feasible
what
meanings
are
drawn
from
these
relationships
if
reoffending
can
be
predicted
why
is
the
problem
the
person
why
not
the
wider
environment
that
shapes
our
life
pathways
and
why
wouldn
t
we
conclude
as
harcourt
writes
in
against
prediction
that
there
is
a
problem
with
prisons
punishment
or
the
lack
of
reentry
programs
and
why
wouldn
t
predictability
then
motivate
an
examination
of
the
root
of
these
institutions
rather
than
a
push
to
seek
more
reform
take
the
turn
to
predictive
policing
los
angeles
already
spends
percent
of
its
general
funds
on
its
police
department
says
garcia
with
an
inability
to
acknowledge
and
address
racial
bias
within
its
force
continued
histories
of
corruption
and
a
long
list
of
lethal
actions
against
unarmed
residents
why
isn
t
the
conclusion
to
shrink
policing
in
la
rather
than
produce
new
and
expensive
predictive
tools
that
according
to
a
rand
study
don
t
work
similarly
cities
pay
to
expand
facilities
to
monitor
those
with
convictions
for
sex
offenses
including
civil
commitment
institutions
despite
the
fact
that
research
has
demonstrated
that
registries
and
an
array
of
other
punitive
responses
have
neither
protected
children
nor
ended
sexual
violence
if
our
goal
is
to
end
or
reduce
sexual
violence
why
not
focus
and
support
proven
preventative
measures
including
meaningful
sex
education
and
non
stigmatizing
mental
health
care
why
not
focus
on
ending
patriarchy
for
many
this
leap
for
now
is
too
much
the
lives
and
the
rights
of
those
with
convictions
for
sex
offenses
like
lieberman
and
jones
are
seen
as
necessary
collateral
damage
in
the
wider
march
toward
greater
public
safety
or
perhaps
exceptions
to
reform
practices
that
on
the
whole
will
work
for
others
but
as
risk
assessment
in
our
political
moment
gains
a
measure
of
mainstream
scrutiny
another
story
could
emerge
perhaps
the
focus
on
the
supposedly
incorrigible
nature
of
people
convicted
of
sex
offenses
and
the
assumption
that
given
the
gravity
of
their
acts
many
require
indefinite
detention
deftly
masks
our
collective
reality
just
like
prisons
maybe
big
data
can

make

safe
in

it
might
make

worse

despite

smith
can

predict
her
son

with
no
money
for
a
private

she
does
the
best
she
can
she
visits

and
tries

stay
informed
about
both
what

happening
at
rushville
and
how
jones
is
doing
she
is
pleased
about
the
small

her

who
is
now
years
old
and
therefore
no
longer
a
risk
according
to
rushville
can

for
those
in

confinement
and
their

the

is
a
question

introduction
a
major
law
and
policy
debate
shaping
the
contemporary
landscape
of
racial
inequality
today
concerns
police
whom
critics
assail
as
a
major
source
of
racial
inequity
and
whose
unions
are
said
to
be
the
major
obstacle
to
reform
critics
often
cite
a
recent
instance
in
which
a
police
officer
who
engaged
in
appalling
misconduct
escapes
firing
or
discipline
through
the
intervention
of
a
union
or
by
invoking
a
statutory
or
contractual
job
protection
the
many
recent
instances
of
police
killing
civilians
when
darren
wilson
shot
michael
brown
in
ferguson
missouri
n
or
when
daniel
pantaleo
choked
eric
garner
to
death
on
a
staten
island
street
n
or
when
baltimore
police
officers
killed
freddie
gray
while
driving
him
to
jail
n
or
when
peter
liang
shot
akai
gurley
in
the
stairwell
of
a
new
york
apartment
building
n
or
when
jeronimo
yanez
shot
philando
castile
during
a
traffic
stop
in
suburban
st
paul
n
or
when
jeffrey
cook
and
omar
thyme
shot
alexia
christian
in
the
back
of
an
atlanta
police
car
n
or
when
five
police
officers
shot
and
killed
kisha
michael
in
her
car
while
she
was
unconscious
n
have
sparked
calls
to
fire
and
prosecute
the
officers
involved
and
outrage
at
the
difficulty
and
delays
in
doing
so
and
at
the
union
s
resistance
to
summary
discipline
people
rightly
wonder
why
the
union
conceives
of
its
obligation
as
protecting
cops
who
appear
to
have
engaged
in
clear
misconduct
rather
than
protecting
the
interests
of
good
ones
by
allowing
bad
ones
to
be
disciplined
fired
or
prosecuted
under
this
analysis
public
employee
unions
are
a
major
impediment
to
the
kinds
of
reforms
that
would
eliminate
pervasive
racism
toward
people
of
color
and
the
urban
poor
n
for
their
part
many
rank
and
file
police
officers
see
the
union
as
an
important
protection
against
endemic
arbitrariness
in
discipline
as
we
discuss
in
part
ii
police
union
leaders
believe
they
are
legally
and
morally
obliged
to
advocate
for
their
members
including
those
accused
of
misconduct
and
to
resist
efforts
to
strengthen
the
power
of
management
to
discipline
officers
in
part
because
union
leaders
are
elected
by
the
membership
many
are
reluctant
to
publicly
question
the
legality
of
their
members
behavior
and
some
dismiss
criticisms
as
reflecting
anti
police
attitudes
if
police
union
officials
have
any
private
reservations
they
feel
constrained
by
their
role
to
remain
publicly
silent
at
the
very
least
and
often
describe
criminal
punishment
of
officers
who
kill
as
being
politically
motivated
efforts
to
scapegoat
individual
officers
for
systemic
problems
n
in
their
view
what
appears
to
outsiders
to
be
egregious
police
violence
is
in
fact
a
justifiable
reaction
to
dangerous
suspects
bad
management
and
difficult
working
conditions
and
the
union
s
role
is
to
protect
hard
working
officers
from
a
witch
hunt
so
that
officers
can
protect
the
public
in
depth
investigations
of
police
departments
in
the
wake
of
highly
publicized
incidents
of
police
violence
since
provide
support
for
the
views
of
both
police
union
critics
and
police
union
leaders
for
instance
in
january
the
department
of
justice
doj
issued
a
scathing
report
doj
chicago
report
finding
among
other
things
that
the
chicago
police
department
cpd
engaged
in
a
pattern
and
practice
of
unreasonable
uses
of
force
and
that
there
is
no
meaningful
systemic
accountability
for
officers
who
use
force
in
violation
of
the
law
or
cpd
policy
n
in
part
these
accountability
failures
are
due
to
collective
bargaining
agreements
between
the
city
and
the
unions
that
contain
provisions
impeding
the
investigation
of
alleged
police
misconduct
n
however
the
doj
concluded
that
the
cpd
bears
some
responsibility
for
these
accountability
failures
among
other
things
the
doj
chicago
report
states
that
the
contracts
allow
cpd
to
override
some
of
the
problematic
contract
provisions
but
management
rarely
does
so
n
the
august
report
of
the
doj
investigation
of
the
baltimore
city
police
department
doj
baltimore
report
faults
both
the
rank
and
file
and
supervisors
for
the
pattern
of
unconstitutional
stops
searches
arrests
and
excessive
force
the
severe
and
unjustified
racial
disparities
harming
african
americans
and
retaliation
against
civilians
and
police
officers
who
speak
out
about
abuses
n
the
doj
baltimore
report
criticizes
certain
statutory
and
contractual
job
protections
which
police
unions
fought
hard
to
attain
and
vigorously
defend
but
it
also
describes
shocking
incidents
of
managerial
neglect
and
retaliation
of
the
sort
that
prompt
employees
to
join
and
defend
unions
in
the
first
place
n
although
the
doj
baltimore
report
takes
no
position
on
that
city
s
police
union
as
we
explain
below
in
section
ii
b
past
doj
civil
rights
interventions
and
consent
decrees
have
encountered
unions
as
obstacles
to
implementation
of
reform
many
proposed
reforms
entail
creating
mechanisms
of
institutionalized
cooperation
between
rank
and
file
and
management
that
unions
may
be
uniquely
capable
of
delivering
as
we
argue
below
in
section
iii
b
such
reforms
will
not
succeed
if
they
fail
to
consider
why
unions
have
not
previously
advocated
such
mechanisms
or
why
they
might
resist
them
the
debates
over
police
unions
are
part
of
a
larger
legal
and
policy
debate
over
whether
public
employee
unions
are
agents
of
or
obstacles
to
government
reform
particularly
because
local
government
employees
including
police
are
among
the
most
densely
unionized
in
the
country
n
a
standard
criticism
of
government
employee
unions
is
that
they
exercise
disproportionate
influence
in
setting
government
policy
n
until
the
passing
of
justice
scalia
the
supreme
court
appeared
to
be
on
the
path
to
reduce
union
power
n
and
the
court
with
justice
gorsuch
is
expected
to
continue
down
that
path
n
moreover
legislatures
in
many
states
have
eliminated
the
ability
of
some
government
employees
to
bargain
collectively
and
narrowed
the
permissible
subjects
of
bargaining
for
those
employees
who
retain
union
rights
at
all
and
these
reductions
in
the
power
of
public
employee
unions
are
often
described
as
being
necessary
to
reduce
the
cost
and
improve
the
quality
of
government
service
n
concern
about
the
influence
of
public
employee
unions
is
not
confined
to
the
political
right
as
activists
and
scholars
have
focused
criticism
on
union
contractual
provisions
protecting
officers
investigated
for
excessive
use
of
force
n
perhaps
no
issue
has
been
more
controversial
in
the
discussion
of
police
union
responses
to
allegations
of
excessive
force
than
statutory
and
contractual
protections
for
officers
accused
of
misconduct
as
critics
have
assailed
such
protections
and
police
unions
defend
them
n
police
in
most
states
enjoy
significantly
more
procedural
and
substantive
protections
against
discipline
for
on
the
job
and
off
the
job
misconduct
than
do
private
sector
employees
as
government
employees
police
have
constitutional
due
process
rights
if
as
a
matter
of
state
or
local
law
or
practice
they
have
an
expectation
of
continued
employment
sufficient
to
create
a
property
interest
in
the
job
n
they
have
constitutional
immunity
from
use
in
a
criminal
prosecution
of
a
statement
made
during
an
internal
administrative
investigation
when
the
officer
was
compelled
to
speak
under
penalty
of
job
discipline
n
they
also
have
a
limited
first
amendment
right
to
be
free
from
retaliation
for
political
activity
off
the
job
unless
the
municipality
has
adopted
a
valid
nondiscriminatory
law
prohibiting
partisan
political
activity
n
in
at
least
sixteen
states
police
additionally
have
statutory
rights
to
certain
procedures
in
the
investigation
of
misconduct
under
law
enforcement
officers
bills
of
rights
leobors
as
well
as
civil
service
protections
in
many
other
states
n
supplementing
these
constitutional
and
statutory
protections
are
police
union
contracts
which
contain
additional
procedural
and
substantive
protections
against
discipline
n
the
public
controversy
gives
new
urgency
to
consideration
of
the
role
of
police
unions
in
promoting
or
thwarting
police
reform
n
scholars
of
policing
have
debated
police
professionalization
and
community
policing
and
have
discussed
the
relationship
between
policing
and
democracy
but
have
as
police
scholar
samuel
walker
put
it
seriously
neglected
police
unions
n
the
substantial
social
science
literature
on
policing
and
police
unions
has
rarely
engaged
with
public
sector
labor
law
other
than
to
note
that
collective
bargaining
rights
are
positively
correlated
with
increased
compensation
and
job
protections
n
although
labor
law
provides
important
opportunities
for
and
constraints
on
organizational
change
in
police
departments
n
police
unions
and
police
union
contractual
protections
have
been
neglected
in
labor
law
scholarship
n
a
particular
concern
of
labor
law
has
been
whether
and
how
unionization
can
improve
the
quality
of
work
for
the
benefit
of
consumers
of
goods
and
services
while
simultaneously
protecting
the
dignity
and
standard
of
living
of
workers
n
but
more
work
remains
to
be
done
in
thinking
about
police
unions
and
public
sector
labor
law
as
offering
leverage
or
resistance
to
change
in
short
although
there
is
a
general
scholarly
consensus
that
police
unions
play
an
important
role
in
policing
and
politics
there
is
no
agreement
concerning
their
proper
role
and
there
has
been
almost
no
sustained
analysis
of
the
role
they
might
play
in
police
reform
n
the
scholarly
deficit
has
substantial
public
policy
consequences
as
groups
ranging
from
black
lives
matter
to
the
u
s
doj
are
proposing
legal
changes
that
will
require
the
cooperation
of
police
labor
organizations
to
implement
notwithstanding
a
long
history
of
police
rank
and
file
resistance
to
imposition
of
reforms
without
their
input
n
in
public
policy
debates
and
in
the
nascent
legal
scholarship
on
policing
in
the
wake
of
the
recent
spate
of
police
violence
that
spawned
the
black
lives
matter
movement
many
have
advocated
restricting
the
job
protections
for
police
officers
in
order
to
facilitate
the
detection
and
punishment
of
criminal
police
violence
reform
is
essential
but
reform
will
not
be
accomplished
simply
by
eliminating
job
protections
even
if
that
were
politically
feasible
without
support
from
unions
and
some
police
rank
and
file
the
kinds
of
reforms
that
are
now
being
proposed
e
g
public
involvement
in
union
management
negotiation
of
disciplinary
procedures
n
are
unlikely
to
be
enacted
or
implemented
rather
police
need
to
be
involved
in
improving
police
practices
and
that
involvement
requires
the
cooperation
of
some
kind
of
police
labor
representative
this
article
explains
how
public
sector
labor
law
might
be
changed
to
enable
activists
outside
of
police
departments
to
find
allies
within
police
departments
to
support
reforms
it
does
not
propose
specific
policy
reforms
about
policing
rather
it
proposes
structural
reform
to
police
union
representation
and
the
duty
to
meet
and
confer
in
order
to
enable
policy
reforms
to
be
adopted
and
importantly
implemented
in
particular
this
article
proposes
that
state
public
sector
labor
law
be
amended
to
require
police
departments
to
meet
and
confer
with
labor
representatives
other
than
the
certified
police
union
this
modified
form
of
minority
union
bargaining
would
ideally
enable
the
minority
of
officers
in
a
department
who
favor
reform
to
discuss
police
practices
even
if
the
majority
union
prefers
not
to
or
is
legally
prohibited
from
negotiating
over
those
practices
the
minority
union
could
be
any
organization
the
officers
choose
to
represent
them
it
might
be
an
existing
police
officers
affinity
group
e
g
the
local
or
national
black
latino
women
s
or
other
officers
association
or
a
black
lives
matter
chapter
or
any
other
group
whom
a
significant
number
of
officers
in
a
department
select
the
scope
of
the
duty
to
confer
would
encompass
topics
that
are
not
mandatory
subjects
of
bargaining
under
most
state
s
labor
law
including
use
of
force
policing
techniques
and
community
relations
the
minority
union
would
have
no
authority
to
modify
the
terms
of
the
collective
bargaining
agreement
negotiated
by
the
majority
union
the
point
of
minority
union
bargaining
would
be
to
give
the
rank
and
file
a
voice
in
policing
policy
without
undermining
the
economic
and
other
terms
that
management
negotiated
with
the
majority
union
n
a
limited
form
of
minority
union
bargaining
a
reform
that
has
been
advocated
in
other
contexts
by
both
the
political
left
and
the
political
right
at
various
points
in
recent
history
would
create
an
institutional
structure
enabling
diverse
representatives
of
police
rank
and

to
meet
and
confer
with
police
management
over

fifty

instances
in
which
cities
have
implemented
reforms
to
reduce
police
violence
and
improve
police
community
relations
all
of
the
proposed

involved
the
cooperation
of
the
rank
and

many
involved
active
cooperation

the

relatively
straightforward
changes

police
departments
and
police
unions
a
the
structure
of
police
departments
and
police
labor
relations
across
the
nation
there
are
approximately
police
agencies
which
together
employ
more
than
million
people
of
whom
are
sworn
officers
n
although
many
small
or
rural
departments
do
not
have
unions
most
large
urban
police
departments
are
unionized
n
the
total
number
of
unionized
officers
is
unknown
and
unions
differ
in
their
structure
priorities
and
degree
of
activity
n
police
departments
are
hierarchical
with
a
chain
of
command
as
in
the
military
n
and
a
sharp
division
between
the
leadership
and
the
rank
and
file
n
the
top
command
consisting
of
the
police
commissioner
and
the
various
chiefs
n
is
responsible
for
official
policymaking
within
the
organization
n
typically
they
have
very
little
personal
contact
with
the
rank
and
file
n
perhaps
in
part
due
to
the
long
dominant
belief
among
police
management
scholars
that
police
departments
are
best
organized
with
strong
top
down
management
n
middle
management
consists
of
captains
lieutenants
sergeants
and
other
equivalent
positions
n
sergeants
make
up
the
lowest
level
of
management
and
serve
as
the
direct
supervisors
of
the
rank
and
file
n
given
their
placement
in
the
management
structure
sergeants
often
are
aligned
more
closely
with
the
rank
and
file
than
with
top
command
n
the
bulk
of
the
department
consists
of
the
rank
and
file
who
sit
at
the
bottom
of
the
organizational
pyramid
n
at
any
given
time
over
sixty
percent
of
officers
within
a
department
are
in
the
patrol
division
n
most
will
remain
at
this
rank
for
their
entire
careers
n
this
hierarchy
has
important
implications
for
unions
we
argue
because
officers
turn
to
unions
to
protect
their
interests
since
they
otherwise
have
little
voice
in
the
operation
of
the
department
under
the
prevailing
quasi
military
style
of
police
department
organization
management
seeks
to
maintain
a
high
level
of
internal
discipline
and
strict
rank
and
file
obedience
to
rules
and
policies
n
the
prevailing
belief
is
that
the
rank
and
file
must
be
strictly
controlled
and
monitored
in
order
to
ensure
compliance
n
police
managers
worry
about
laziness
corruption
racial
profiling
and
excessive
force
and
they
do
not
trust
rank
and
file
officers
on
any
of
those
dimensions
n
in
the
face
of
continued
scandals
and
charges
of
inequity
police
administrators
tend
to
maintain
an
almost
phobic
preoccupation
with
accountability
and
conformity
n
although
management
focuses
intensely
on
control
and
conformity
with
policy
police
work
inevitably
requires
the
exercise
of
discretion
n
the
judgment
and
discretion
that
most
police
officers
and
management
would
agree
is
essential
to
good
policing
means
that
precise
rules
cannot
always
be
followed
general
rules
do
not
provide
meaningful
guidance
n
and
policies
are
therefore
not
consistently
enforced
flexibility
opens
the
door
to
arbitrariness
and
discrimination
this
is
one
reason
why
the
relationship
between
line
officers
and
management
has
been
described
as
one
dominated
by
a
feeling
of
uncertainty
n
rank
and
file
officers
fear
punitive
enforcement
of
policy
and
often
perceive
management
as
being
not
on
the
level
n
using
rules
primarily
to
blame
them
when
things
go
wrong
n
rank
and
file
officers
in
many
departments
do
not
trust
management
to
mete
out
discipline
fairly
in
los
angeles
for
example
in
the
police
protective
league
the
los

police
department
lapd
officers
union
requested
that
law
professor
erwin
chemerinsky
and
a
group
of
civil
rights
lawyers
investigate
a
major
scandal
in
the
rampart
division
n
the
league
did
not
trust
the
lapd
to
conduct
a
fair
and
thorough
investigation
and
feared
the
union
and
some
officers
might
be
scapegoated
for
a
corruption
scandal
that
they
thought
was
a
symptom
of
a
larger
problem
professor
chemerinsky
s
analysis
of
the
lapd
s
report
on
the
rampart
division
found
that
virtually
everyone
except
the
chief
of
police
and
the
board
of
inquiry
is
dissatisfied
with
the
current
disciplinary
system
n
concerns
included
perceptions
that
the
chief
controlled
the
system
and
used
it
to
protect
command
staff
and
persecute
whistleblowers
and
minority
officers
n
nearly
fifteen
years
later
similar
perceptions
persist
in
an
overwhelming
number
of
lapd
rank
and
file
officers
still
believed
that
management
s
disciplinary
decisions
revolved
around
an
officer
s
rank
and
whether
he
or
she
was
well
liked
by
their
superiors
in
the
department
officers
believed
that
c
ommand
level
officers
routinely
received
slaps
on
the
wrist
or
no
punishment
while
lower
ranking
officers
were
suspended
for
similar
misconduct
n
similarly
in
the
doj
found
that
the
baltimore
police
department
failed
to
apply
discipline
consistently
throughout
our
interviews
and
ride
alongs
with
officers
we
heard
officers
express
that
discipline
is
only
imposed
if
an
incident
makes
it
into
the
press
or
if
you
were
on
the
wrong
side
of
a
supervisor
not
because
of
the
magnitude
of
the
misconduct
n
empirical
studies
of
police
stress
find
that
the
indignities
of
poor
employment
practices
arbitrary
decision
making
poor
working
conditions
feeling
lack
of
support
from
supervisors
cause
more
stress
to
officers
than
witnessing
injuries
deaths
or
other
potentially
traumatic
events
involving
police
work
n
recent
commentary
on
police
legitimacy
noted
this
and
giving
the
example
of
new
york
police
officers
who
were
disciplined
and
publicly
reprimanded
for
playing
football
with
youngsters
at
a
fourth
of
july
celebration
at
a
low
income
housing
project
observed
that
police
officers
react
to
arbitrary
power
in
the
same
way
that
citizens
do
when
they
are
policed
with
ambivalence
about
the
institution
and
resistance
or
hostility
toward
the
rules
of
that
institution
n
as
one
policing
scholar
observed
officers
come
to
find
out
that
when
they
are
recognized
it
is
usually
for
something
that
they
have
done
wrong
procedurally
rather
than
for
something
they
have
done
well
substantively
officers
are
constrained
working
within
an
organization
that
demands
that
all
problems
be
handled
on
the
street
with
efficiency
and
certainty
yet
held
to
excessive
scrutiny
by
watchful
administrators
at
a
later
date
n
in
sum
police
scholars
note
that
rank
and
file
officers
often
perceive
their
departments
as
a
mock
bureaucracy
capricious
unpredictable
and
punitive
rather
than
democratic
and
fair
n
although
the
reality
is
that
both
management
and
the
rank
and
file
understand
that
rules
cannot
guide
their
behavior
in
all
instances
any
violation
no
matter
how
small
can
still
result
in
punishment
n
thus
the
rank
and
file
views
management
s
fixation
on
rule
following
in
the
face
of
these
contradictions
as
illegitimate
n
the
result
is
that
management
officers
are
perceived
as
mere
disciplinarians
and
are
often
viewed
by
the
line
personnel
with
distrust
and
even
contempt
n
in
light
of
this
focus
on
control
and
discipline
of
rank
and
file
officers
for
conduct
like
playing
football
with
kids
that
seems
desirable
or
at
least
benign
police
unions
often
focus
their
bargaining
and
contract
enforcement
efforts
toward
protecting
officers
from
discipline
and
arbitrary
work
assignments
fighting
for
compensation
and
ensuring
compliance
with
seniority
rules
among
other
labor
interests
n
although
these
negative
perceptions
of
management
s
motives
could
be
tempered
by
contact
rank
and
file
officers
have
few
opportunities
to
interact
with
top
command
outside
of
the
context
of
punishment
n
they
have
little
direct
communication
with
top
level
management
because
the
information
flow
is
almost
exclusively
downwards
through
the
chain
of
command
and
not
the
opposite
n
this
isolation
from
top
command
increases
the
risk
of
miscommunication
misunderstandings
and
resentment
and
it
also
leads
police
unions
to
adopt
a
highly
defensive
approach
to
union
management
relations
n
the
rank
and
file
s
shared
perception
that
management
s
exercises
of
power
are
illegitimate
coupled
with
their
isolation
from
top
command
facilitates
the
creation
of
a
subculture
amongst
the
rank
and
file
with
its
own
political
life
that
remains
largely
hidden
from
management
n
amongst
the
rank
and
file
there
is
a
rare
degree
of
camaraderie
and
group
loyalty
n
that
is
partly
the
result
of
having
to
confront
unpredictable
and
punitive
supervisory
oversight
n
in
short
scholars
agree
that
management
and
the
rank
and
file
have
their
own
distinct
cultures
n
and
that
the
relationship
between
them
is
often
characterized
by
mutual
suspicion
and
mistrust
n
as
will
be
explored
below
in
section
i
c
police
officers
responded
to
this
kind
of
hierarchical
and
punitive
supervisory
structure
by
forming
unions
and
many
police
officers
are
quite
dedicated
unionists
precisely
because
they
see
the
union
as
necessary
to
protect
their
interests
in
fair
process
and
in
having
a
voice
in
the
workplace
b
from
professionalism
to
community
policing
the
contemporary
emphasis
on
hierarchy
and
adherence
to
rules
was
the
product
of
mid
twentieth
century
reforms
that
attempted
to
combat
police
corruption
by
professionalizing
police
work
in
the
late
nineteenth
century
police
were
closely
tied
to
their
communities
were
under
the
control
of
local
political
machines
engaged
in
foot
patrols
and
often
lived
in
the
communities
they
policed
n
the
close
connection
to
the
community
and
its
political
machinery
was
believed
to
lead
to
police
corruption
n
to
sever
police
hiring
promotion
and
control
from
the
local
political
machine
early
twentieth
century
local
government
reformers
sought
to
professionalize
the
police
n
professionalism
did
not
refer
to
giving
individual
rank
and
file
officers
more
autonomy
and
discretion
n
rather
it
referred
to
reducing
political
influence
over
police
and
improving
police
efficiency
n
a
crucial
aspect
of
the
professionalism
project
was
to
define
the
core
mission
of
the
police
as
crime
control
thereby
insulating
officers
from
political
influence
and
corruption
by
distancing
them
from
the
community
n
once
the
official
function
of
the
police
was
crime
control
departments
moved
away
from
crime
prevention
except
as
an
outcome
of
arrest
peacekeeping
order
maintenance
and
the
provision
of
social
and
emergency
services
n
this
along
with
the
isolation
of
officers
from
citizens
that
was
thought
necessary
to
combat
corruption
contributed
to
what
various
scholars
characterize
as
officer
alienation
from
the
citizens
they
serve
officers
self
conception
as
crime
fighters
and
the
thin
blue
line
and
a
warrior
mentality
n
an
important
goal
of
the
professionalism
era
was
to
control
rank
and
file
officers
leading
to
extensive
and
strict
rules
to
govern
their
conduct
increased
surveillance
and
oversight
of
officers
and
reduced
rank
and
file
officer
discretion
n
the
control
of
the
rank
and
file
did
not
end
with
their
work
related
duties
police
management
also
attempted
to
control
the
personal
lives
of
officers
in
order
to
reduce
the
opportunities
for
corruption
n
officers
were
prohibited
from
living
in
the
areas
they
policed
from
incurring
debts
or
from
being
involved
in
businesses
in
their
areas
as
well
as
required
to
declare
the
business
interests
of
their
families
n
some
departments
went
even
further
to
de
personalize
policing
by
frequently
reassigning
patrol
officers
to
new
neighborhoods
far
removed
from
the
neighborhoods
where
officers
lived
n
these
and
a
host
of
other
controls
helped
spur
the
creation
of
police
unions
n
a
new
model
of
policing
known
as
community
policing
emerged
in
the
late
s
and
early
s
n
to
put
officers
back
into
relationships
with
the
community
and
to
transform
rank
and
file
officers
into
problem
solvers
n
community
policing
is
a
broad
concept
used
to
describe
a
wide
variety
of
policing
approaches
n
two
common
themes
among
them
are
that
power
is
pushed
to
officers
at
the
lower
levels
of
the
organization
and
that
there
is
increased
involvement
with
the
community
n
some
versions
of
community
policing
embrace
the
idea
that
the
social
work
aspects
of
policing
are
important
n
and
encourage
officers
to
attempt
to
determine
the
root
causes
of
crime
and
to
look
beyond
the
criminal
justice
system
to
solve
them
n
today
most
departments
claim
that
they
are
engaged
in
community
policing
n
yet
police
continue
to
follow
professionalism
era
practices
for
a
variety
of
reasons
including
the
growth
in
quantitative
measures
of
job
performance
and
the
so
called
war
on
drugs
n
the
set
of
legal
and
policy
changes
known
as
the
war
on
drugs
sought
to
eliminate
drug
sales
and
use
through
massive
drug
arrests
and
other
proactive
policing
strategies
as
many
scholars
observed
the
war
on
drugs
fueled
racial
disparities
in
arrest
rates
and
exacerbated
negative
relationships
between
the
police
and
communities
of
color
n
both
community
policing
and
the
proactive
policing
strategies
associated
with
drug
enforcement
policy
required
departments
to
gather
information
in
order
to
analyze
problems
and
technological
change
enabled
police
departments
to
collect
data
and
use
data
analysis
in
personnel
management
on
an
unprecedented
scale
n
this
had
significant
consequences
for
how
police
departments
managed
line
officers
and
how
officers
responded
n
quantitative
measures
rapidly
became
one
of
the
most
significant
elements
of
contemporary
evaluation
of
police
officer
job
performance
the
reliance
on
counting
stops
arrests
and
other
measures
of
law
enforcement
vigor
originated
in
new
york
under
the
leadership
of
william
bratton
a
proponent
of
the
broken
windows
theory
of
policing
n
the
broken
windows
idea
was
that
the
police
could
cut
down
on
serious
crimes
by
making
it
clear
that
even
the
trivial
ones
wouldn
t
go
unpunished
n
to
ensure
that
the
rank
and
file
implemented
this
philosophy
especially
in
neighborhoods
inhabited
by
indigent
people
of
color
the
new
york
police
department
nypd
developed
a
management
system
that
kept
careful
track
of
arrest
and
crime
statistics
throughout
the
city
the
system
was
called
compstat
short
for
compare
statistics
n
the
sharp
decline
in
the
number
of
murders
in
new
york
in
the
late
s
coincided
with
the
adoption
of
compstat
and
so
cities
across
the
united
states
embraced
it
and
hired
chiefs
and
consultants
committed
to
implementing
it
with
the
result
that
most
large
american
cities
now
use
some
form
of
compstat
n
although
some
credited
compstat
for
falling
murder
and
violent
crime
rates
by
the
early
s
doubters
began
to
question
whether
broken
windows
policing
and
the
compstat
measure
of
police
work
was
the
cause
and
some
voiced
doubts
about
the
effects
it
had
on
police
behavior
n
eli
silverman
a
police
studies
professor
at
john
jay
college
of
criminal
justice
who
had
been
an
early
supporter
of
compstat
had
received
a
number
of
letters
from
nypd
officers
saying
that
compstat
was
not
all
that
it
seemed
n
silverman
and
a
fellow
criminologist
and
retired
nypd
captain
john
eterno
set
out
to
study
how
the
system
worked
n
they
surveyed
more
than
retired
nypd
officers
in
and
and
found
that
compstat
had
a
substantial
effect
on
police
work
but
it
was
not
uniformly
positive
n
they
learned
that
during
the
compstat
era
officers
were
twice
as
likely
as
their
predecessors
to
say
that
they
had
been
under
pressure
to
increase
arrests
and
three
times
as
likely
to
say
they
experienced
pressure
to
issue
more
summonses
n
most
of
this
activity
took
place
in
minority
neighborhoods
in
predominantly
black
bedford
stuyvesant
brooklyn
for
example
officers
issued
more
than
summonses
a
year
between
and
to
people
riding
their
bicycles
on
the
sidewalk
but
an
average
of
eight
bike
tickets
a
year
in
predominantly
white
and
notably
bike
friendly
park
slope
n
the
new
york
civil
liberties
union
calculated
that
between
and
black
and
hispanic
people
were
more
than
four
times
as
likely
as
whites
to
receive
summonses
for
minor
violations

emphasis
on
evaluating
officers
according
to
arrests

stops

the
perhaps
unintended
consequence
of
dissuading
officers
from
using
innovative
approaches
to
crime
reduction
even
when
the
innovations
appeared
to
work
for

the

more
loosely
to

from

are
typically
not

with
the
rest
of

may
or
may
not
be
certified
as
the
exclusive

they
negotiate

also
belong
to
identity
based
police
organizations

sometimes
have
close
relationships
to
their
civilian
counterparts

groups
do
not
have
the
legal
right
to
bargain
collectively
on

of
their
members
as
a

union
does

they
may
nevertheless
play
an
informal
role
in
speaking
for
their
members

within

publicly
n
police

contractual
and

terms
governing
police
working
conditions
and
the
involvement
of
police
unions
in
the
political
and
policymaking
process
history
of
police
unions
police
officers
in
many
cities
began
joining
unions
in
the
late
nineteenth
and
early
twentieth
centuries
when
workers
in
every
industry
unionized
and
for
the
same
reasons
to
improve
pay
and
working
conditions
and
to
gain
some
measure
of
control
over
their
work
lives
n
police
in
boston
in
for
example
worked
regular
shifts
of
between
seventy
three
and
ninety
eight
hours
a
week
were
sometimes
required
to
remain
on
duty
seventeen
hours
a
day
had
to
buy
their
own
uniforms
and
did
not
receive
a
raise
between
and
even
though
the
cost
of
living
had
doubled
n
station
houses
were
unsanitary
n
supervisors
restricted
where
officers
could
go
on
their
scarce
free
time
n
equally
as
important
to
police
officers
and
government
reformers
was
the
idea
that
unions
might
reduce
endemic
corruption
in
local
government
n
john
commons
the
leading
labor
economist
of
the
early
twentieth
century
found
that
labor
organizing
among
municipal
employees
was
the
leading
antidote
to
political
machines
and
corruption
because
they
aided
reformers
in
local
government
to
set
wages
hours
and
working
conditions
without
regard
to
the
personal
economic
and
political
self
interest
of
city
leaders
n
but
business
and
anti
labor
groups
feared
that
unionized
police
would
strike
and
more
important
would
not
stop
other
employees
from
striking
and
picketing
when
boston
police
formed
a
union
and
affiliated
with
the
american
federation
of
labor
afl
in
august
n
the
chief
of
police
suspended
seventeen
union
leaders
and
two
policemen

chief
mistakenly
believed
were
union
leaders
in
protest
nearly
three
quarters
of
the
boston
police
walked
out
the
next
day
n
violence
and
looting
ensued
n
governor
calvin
coolidge
called
out
troopers
who
after
firing
into
the
crowd
killing
nine
and
wounding
twenty
three
more
stopped
the
looting
and
prevented
support
for
the
striking
police
from
turning
into
a
citywide
general
strike
n
the
violence
caused
a
panic
about
strikes
by
police
or
any
other
government
employees
which
resulted
in
the
collapse
of
all
afl
affiliated
police
union
locals
and
a
huge
backlash
against
government
employee
unions
generally
and
police
unions
in
particular
n
as
a
result
the
unionization
of
government
employees
that
had
begun
in
the
progressive
era
ground
to
a
halt
only
to
really
pick
up
steam
in
the
post
world
war
ii
period
as
government
employees
earnings
were
outstripped
by
factory
and
skilled
labor
earnings
and
the
growth
of
private
sector
unionization
eventually
made
it
seem
that
government
employee
unions
were
both
desirable
and
inevitable
n
police
officers
formed
local
unions
in
various
cities
in
the
s

some
police
unions
affiliated
with
national
labor
federations

some
with

to
enact

the
first

however
well
into
the
s

departments
routinely
fired
officers
who
attempted
to
unionize

and
courts
upheld
the
power
of
cities
to
ban
officers
from
joining
unions
n
in
the
absence
of
any
legal
right
to
unionize
or
bargain
collectively
government
employee
unions
became
adept
at
securing
their
members
interests
through
political
activity
and
negotiating
informal
agreements
with
public
officials
n
unions
finally
succeeded
in
gaining
a
lasting
foothold
in
american
police
departments
in
the
late
s
as
rank
and
file
officers
felt
attacked
by
the
civil
rights
movement
s
focus
on
police
brutality
and
racism
and
by
federal
court
decisions
limiting
police
officers
investigatory
and
arrest
powers
n
officers
also
did
not
have
protection
within
the
department
when
they
were
investigated
or
accused
of
misconduct
and
felt
they
had
no
way
to
present
grievances
to
management
n
furthermore
they
feared
that
civilian
review
boards
would
scapegoat
individual
rank
and
file
officers
for
practices
that
management
encouraged
or
even
required
n
then
as
now
officers
believed
that
discipline
was
meted
out
only
to
those
who
criticized
management
n
not
surprisingly
unions
representing
rank
and
file
officers
negotiated
for
contractual
protections
against
discipline
and
lobbied
legislators
to
incorporate
these
protections
in
legislation
including
leobors
n
they
sought
to
protect
officer
autonomy
effectiveness
and
safety
by
opposing
constitutional
criminal
procedure
restrictions
on
police
conduct
and
by
blocking
civilian
oversight
of
police
discipline
n
the
legacy
of
the
s
is
collective
bargaining
agreements
and
leobors
which
make
it
difficult
to
investigate
and
punish
officers
and
limited
civilian
oversight
all
of
which
can
impede
reform
efforts
n
elements
of
police

contracts
police

contain
provisions
regarding

rights
to
fair
treatment
in

often
included

as
a
matter
of
labor
law
in

states

are
selected
and

of

classification

department
what
is
generally
known
as
a
bargaining
unit
is
the
exclusive
representative
of
all
the
employees
in
that
unit
n
the
purpose
of
majority
rule
and
exclusive
representation
is
to
strengthen
and
legitimize
the
employee
representative
by
enabling
it
to
speak
with
one
voice
and
to
enable
the
employees
within
their
union
to
agree
on
priorities
and
resolve
differences
n
law
limits
the
ability
of
the
majority
representative
to
sacrifice
the
interests
of
the
minority
by
imposing
a
duty
of
fair
representation
which
requires
the
union
to
represent
all
employees
in
the
unit
fairly
and
competently
and
prohibits
the
union
and
its
officers
from
engaging
in
arbitrary
action
or
invidious
discrimination
against
individuals
or
the
minority
n
when
police
officers
gained
the
right
to
unionize
and
bargain
collectively
in
the
s
union
leadership
embraced
the
language
of
professionalism
that
police
management
and
an
earlier
generation
of
police
reformers
had
used
insisting
that
the
purpose
of
the
police
was
to
control
crime
n
however
police
unions
responded
to
the
extensive
rules
and
regulations
controlling
rank
and
file
behavior
by
negotiating
their
own
set
of
rules
and
regulations
to
protect
rank
and
file
officers
from
arbitrary
exercises
of
management
power
n
unions
challenged
exercises
of
managerial
prerogative
through
grievance
arbitration
and
protected
members
economic
interests
and
working
conditions
by
advocating
for
favorable
wages
and
benefits
job
security
hiring
retention
promotion
and
disciplinary
processes
and
access
to
good
jobs
shifts
assignments
and
overtime
n
as
one
labor
lawyer
opined
it
is
nearly
impossible
to
have
a
situation
in
which
a
creative
police
organizer
cannot
find
a
rule
regulation
guideline
budget
provision
benefit
program
rule
or
personnel
procedure
which
cannot
be
exploited
to
significantly
increase
the
rights
and
benefits
of
working
officers
n
professionalism
era
reforms
with
its
host
of
controls
not
only
helped
spur
the
creation
of
police
unions
but
also
were
directly
responsible
for
the
shape
and
functions
of
police
unions
as
well
n
police
collective
bargaining
agreements
look
in
part
like
the
labor
agreements
negotiated
by
a
wide
range
of
public
and
private
sector
unions
they
contain
provisions
governing
economic
terms
of
employment
including
wages
hours
sickness
and
vacation
leave
pensions
health
insurance
death
benefits
and
so
forth
n
there
are
typically
detailed
provisions
governing
overtime
compensation
payment
when
called
to
testify
compensation
for
purchasing
uniforms
and
the
right
to
have
protective
equipment
like
bullet
proof
vests
n
they
prohibit
discrimination
on
the
basis
of
union
membership
race
religion
gender
and
so
on
and
generally
require
just
cause
for
discipline
and
discharge
n
they
create
a
grievance
process
usually
culminating
in
arbitration
n
given
the
history
of
rank
and
file
concern
about
arbitrary
management
discipline
for
violations
of
detailed
rules
it
is
unsurprising
that
many
union
contracts
include
quite
specific
provisions
protecting
police
officers
in
discipline
cases
n
but
union
contracts
have
little
to
say
about
how
police
officers
actually
do
their
job
this
is
in
part
because
police
unions
like
other
public
and
private
sector
unions
in
the
s
focused
on
gaining
the
power
to
bargain
over
economic
issues
promotions
and
discipline
n
but
it
is
also
because
state
legislatures
courts
and
public
employee
relations
boards
insisted
that
it
is
the
province
of
management
to
decide
the
mission
and
methods
of
public
work
and
the
only
things
on
which
labor
has
a
right
to
negotiate
are
pay
promotion
and
protection
against
discipline
n
that
police
unions
adopted
a
narrow
conception
of
the
union
s
role
in
collaborating
with
management
about
policing
policy
and
tactics
is
not
surprising
given
the
dominant
conception
of
policing
and
the
business
unionism
of
the
mid
twentieth
century
the
top
down
hierarchy
in
police
departments
allowed
for
little
input
by
the
rank
and
file
and
labor
law
and
labor
policy
excluded
employees
from
meaningful
voice
in
the
goals
of
the
organization
n
an
example
of
this
hierarchy
in
practice
is
the
meyers
milias
brown
act
mmba
n
the
california
statute
governing
police
labor
relations
that
is
relatively
typical
of
state
labor
relations
statutes
n
the
scope
of
the
union
s
right
to
negotiate
and
represent
public
employees
includes
all
matters
relating
to
employment
conditions
and
employer
employee
relations
including
but
not
limited
to
wages
hours
and
other
terms
and
conditions
of
employment
except
however
that
the
scope
of
representation
shall
not
include
consideration
of
the
merits
necessity
or
organization
of
any
service
or
activity
provided
by
law
or
executive
order
n
the
two
clauses
conflict
read
alone
they
could
respectively
encompass
practically
any
conceivable
bargaining
proposal
or
swallow
the
whole
provision
for
collective
negotiation
and
relegate
determination
of
all
labor
issues
to
the
city
s
discretion
n
even
if
an
employer
s
action
or
policy
has
a
significant
and
adverse
effect
on
the
employees
wages

and
working
conditions
the
employer
may
be
exempt
from
the
duty
to
meet
and
confer
with
the

subject
is

in
the
limitation
on

intended
to
forestall
any
expansion
of
the
language
of
wages
hours
and
working
conditions
to
include
more
general
managerial
policy
decisions
n
police
officers
in
california
therefore
are
able
to
bargain
for
the
right
to
consult
with

union
representative

report

report
concerning
such
incident
because
previous
instances
had
resulted
in
interference
with
the
department
s
investigation
n
the
court
found
the
right
to
consult
was
a
working
condition
under
the
collective
bargaining
agreement
rather
than
a
matter
reserved
for
management
which
would
permit
the
department
to
change
practices
without
prior
written
agreement
or
compliance
with
statutory
meet
and
confer
procedures

however
although
a
police
officer
is
allowed
to
have
a
representative
after
a
shooting
has
occurred

s
issuance
of
a
new
policy
governing
the
use
of
force
without
meeting
and
conferring
with
the
association
did
not
violate
the
mmba

a
change
on
the
policy
governing
a
police
officer
s
ability
to
fire
at
a
suspected
criminal
has
some
effect
on
safety
it
is
equally
true
that
the
use
of
force
policy
is
as
closely
akin
to
a
managerial
decision
as
any
decision
can
be
in
running
a
police
department
surpassed
only
by
the
decision
as
to
whether
force
will
be
used
at
all
n
according
to
the
court
there
are
few
decisions
more
managerial
in
nature
than
the
one
which
involves
the
conditions

which
an
entity

permit

commission
and

of

members
concerning
the

s
position
on

complaints
n
the
court
noted
that
the
police
association
was
fundamentally
challenging
the
announced
policies
of
their
chief
officer
concerning
police
community
relations
and
these
policies
clearly
constitute
management
level
decisions
which
are
not
properly
within
the
scope
of
union
representation
and
collective
bargaining
n
although
a
police
association
is
able
to
bargain
for
the
right
of
an
officer
to
consult
with
a
union
representative
or
attorney
prior
to
making
a
report
concerning
any
shooting
incident
involving
the
officer

a

department
can
prevent
officers
from
huddling
together
before
making
reports
in
ass
n
for
los
angeles
deputy
sheriffs
v
county
of
los
angeles
n
the
department
instituted
an
anti
huddling
policy
where
officers
would
gather
in
groups
of
two
or
more
with
a
union
representation
i
e
two
or
more
deputies
consulting
at
the
same
time
with
the
same
legal
counsel
labor
representative
n
the
city
created
a
policy
where
individuals
involved
including
witnesses
could
not
discuss
the
shooting
amongst
themselves
but
still
had
the
right
to
meet
with
counsel
individually
n
the
court
found
that
the
revision
had
no
effect
on
wages
and
hours
n
in
contrast
the
court
found
that
the
department
s
express
objective
in
implementing
its
policy
revision
was
to
collect
accurate
information
regarding
deputy
involved
shootings
plainly
the
purpose
of
the
policy
revision
was
to
foster
greater
public
trust
in
the
investigatory
process
and
was
a
fundamental
managerial
decision
n
finally
in
a
recent
case
a
county
s
adoption
of
a
policy
to
limit
a
deputy
sheriff
s
access
the
internal
investigative
file
before
being
interviewed
by
an
internal
affairs
investigator
was
found
not
to
be
a
working
condition
subject
to
bargaining
under
the
mmba
n
while
it
is
understandable
that
california
like
other
states
would
want
to
free
police
departments
from
the
leverage
a
union
might
have
to
block
reforms
through
prolonged
bargaining
and
through
inclusion
of
contract
terms
that
could
thwart
new
policies
the
consequence
of
the
limited
duty
to
bargain
has
been
perverse
if
employees
and
their
union
are
excluded
from
participation
in
policy
setting
they
often
feel
compelled
to
oppose
new
policies
for
fear
that
the
policy
will
be
implemented
punitively
or
unfairly
as
a
way
to
discipline
rank
and
file
who
are
unpopular
with
management
n
in
the
case
of
police
as
scholars
have
shown
unions
become
reflexively
opposed
to
policies
when
they
cannot
participate
in
policy
design
and
focus
instead
simply
on
protecting
their
members
from
discipline
for
violating
the
policy
n
thus
both
the
law
and
the
dominant
theory
of
policing
compel
union
leadership
to
focus
their
attention
on
rectifying
the
abuses
of
management
arbitrary
dismissals
scheduling
and
work
assignments
informal
discipline
citation
and
arrest
quotas
cronyism
in
promotions
and
incursions
into
officers
personal
lives
police
unions
and
the
political
process
while
police
unions
adopted
a
narrow
view
of
labor
s
role
in
setting
criminal
justice
policy
in
the
workplace
apart
from
officer
pay
and
discipline
they
embraced
a
broad
view
of
how
they
could
advocate
for
police
officers
interests
as
labor
they
do
not
just
bargain
and
enforce
labor
agreements
they
are
involved
in
electoral
politics
in
litigation
and
in
the
media
attacking
the
restrictions
imposed
on
them
by
the
supreme
court
criticizing
groups
ranging
from
the
black
lives
matter
movement
to
the
communist
party
to
the
american
civil
liberties
union
aclu
and
opposing
civilian
oversight
n
and
in
advocating
for
police
interests
as
labor
to
be
protected
from
civilian
intervention
and
unfair
discipline
of
course
they
did
have
a
substantial
impact
on
criminal
justice
policy
that
is
although
unions
did
not
contest
management
efforts
to
adopt
the
militarized
style
of
urban
policing
instead
of
a
more
social
service
or
community
oriented
style
they
did
demand
that
officers
be
protected
from
discipline
when
that
harsh
style
of
policing
resulted
in
civilian
injuries
or
deaths
police
unions
negotiated
for
contractual
protections
in
the
disciplinary
process
and
also
lobbied
for
state
or
municipal
laws
giving
officers
procedural
protections
during
discipline
n
police
unions
also
actively
opposed
reform
oriented
chiefs
and
civilian
review
boards
both
for
reasons
of
conservative
and
sometimes
racist
ideology
and
to
protect
police
officers
bread
and
butter
interests
like
pay
benefits
and
job
security
n
in
several
cities
police
unions
have
challenged
police
chiefs
brought
in
to
enact
reforms
that
they
consider
threatening
to
officer
safety
or
economic
interests
or
that
they
believe
weaken
public
safety
unions
challenged
city
officials
over
issues
like
staffing
and
job
protection
many
have
taken
openly
partisan
stands
such
as
recent
police
protests
in
new
york
against
politicians
who
they
claim
adopt
policies
that
weaken
public
safety
n
because
police
officers
have
long
felt
at
risk
of
arbitrary
or
unfair
discipline
they
have
fought
hard
to
retain
union
involvement
in
internal
investigations
into
employee
misconduct
and
therefore
have
stymied
efforts
to
reform
police
culture
n
the
january
doj
chicago
report
for
example
noted
that
a
effort
to
use
data
to
identify
patterns
of
problematic
officer
behavior
was
opposed
by
the
union
because
officers
felt
discipline
was
imposed
arbitrarily
and
unfairly
the
system
was
abandoned
after
just
two
years
and
all
the
data
and
reports
it
produced
went
missing
n
a
effort
to
analyze
data
and
create
an
early
intervention
system
is
in
the
works
but
the
doj
chicago
report
stated
the
project
managers
are
taking
guidance
from
the
city
on
how
and
when
to
do
so
and
union
involvement
has
not
yet
occurred
there
is
no
evidence
that
the
city
or
cpd
engaged
with
the
unions
early
on
before
beginning
this
new
effort
to
determine
whether
cpd
s
unions
will
support
the
new
effort
n
as
these
examples
suggest
unions
have
been
blocked
by
labor
law
by
the
hierarchical
management
structure
and
by
short
sighted
union
leaders
own
narrow
conception
of
role
from
adopting
a
more
proactive
and
collaborative
approach
to
management
labor
cooperation
over
police
goals
and
tactics
in
sum
police
unions
see
their
mission
as
protecting
the
interests
of
police
officers
including
protecting
officers
from
discipline
ensuring
good
working
conditions
and
protecting
seniority
when
police
union
leaders
defend
officers
involved
in
what
appear
to
be
egregious
instances
of
violence
toward
suspects
critics
assert
that
the
solidarity
that
enables
a
union
to
function
and
that
is
encouraged
by
the
quasi
militaristic
culture
in
many
police
forces
has
become
pathological
n
whereas

are
thought
by
their
defenders
to
be
an
institutional
mechanism
to
create
and
sustain
workplace
democracy
in
other
work
settings

enforcement
unions
are
perceived
as
irredeemably
oligarchic
and
implacably
opposed
to

reform

to
anything

might
weaken
the
influence
of

police
unions
as
obstacles
to
reform
police
unions
in
new
york
city
ferguson
baltimore
cleveland
chicago
and
other
cities
have
at
least
initially
publicly
come
to
the
defense
of
officers
accused
of
shooting
and
killing
civilians
insisting
that
it
is
important
to
avoid
a
rush
to
judgment
n
reponses
have
gone
beyond
offering
a
public
defense
to
include
fundraising
for
accused
officers
in
ferguson
baltimore
and
cleveland
n
and
in

proclaiming
it
is
time
to

by
recording

uses
extreme
rhetoric
in
his
defense
of
officers

refusing
to
publicly
concede
that
an
officer
was
wrong
even
when
the
officer
in
question
went
to
jail
n
his
milder
statements
about
the
role
of
the
police
union
are
not
unusual
among
police
union
leaders
he
says
what
most
do
our
job
as
an
advocate
for
police
officers
is
to
speak
out
for
them
whether
it
s
getting
them
a
contract
or
defending
them
when
they
re
wrongfully
accused
or
explaining
exactly
how
and
why
we
do
our
job
that
s
our
role
and
we
proudly
do
it
n
although
it
is
understandable
that
elected
union
leaders
come
to
the
defense
of
employees
accused
of
misconduct
the
zeal
and
leverage
that
police
unions
bring
to
the
defense
is
considerable
as
a
result
of
contractual
and
statutory
substantive
and
procedural
protections
the
expense
and
hassle
necessary
to
discipline
an
officer
is
greater
than
if
the
officer
could
be
fired
at
will
n
this
combined
with
the
fact
that
labor
arbitrators
sometimes
reduce
punishment
makes
supervisors
less
likely
to
impose
disciplinary
sanctions
because
while
a
supervisor
faces
a
possible
headache
for
not
disciplining
a
misbehaving
subordinate
they
face
a
certain
headache
if
they
do
n
one
study
of
discipline
imposed
in
the
cpd
in
the
early
s
found
that
arbitrators
routinely
cut
in
half
the
severity
of
discipline
n
experience
with
the
personnel
system
prompted
tom
nolan
a
veteran
of
the
boston
police
department
and
professor
of
criminology
to
say
the
number
one
impediment
to
reforming
policing
in
the
united
states
are
police
unions
n
similarly
in
the
chicago
police
accountability
task
force
issued
a
report
concluding
that
the
collective
bargaining
agreements
between
the
police
unions
and
the
city
have
essentially
turned
the
code
of
silence
into
official
policy
n
as
explained
in
this
part
statutory
and
contractual
protections
for
police
officers
do
have
an
effect
on
police
accountability
and
the
transparency
of
police
disciplinary
systems
n
for
instance
collective
bargaining
agreements
often
contain
provisions
that
protect
officers
accused
of
misconduct
shield
them
from
civilian
oversight
and
limit
the
ability
to
change
officers
conditions
of
employment

also
makes
it
difficult
to
enact
reforms

as

up
early
warning

n
in
the
approximately
twenty
states
with
statutory
leobors
many
of
these
protections
exist
as
a
matter
of
state

is
at
the
core

state
leobors
outline
the
process
for
investigating
allegations

officer
misconduct

the
process
varies

maryland
for
example
provides
that
no
officer
may
be
questioned
without
having
been
given
the
opportunity
to
secure
legal
counsel
and
gives
officers
ten
days
to
do
so
n
this
provision
has
been
criticized
for
giving
officers
plenty
of
time
to
delay
interrogations
and
concoct
an
account
of
the
incident
that
exonerates
the
officer
n
other
provisions
on
officer
interrogation

regulation
of
the
location

of

concerning
those
files
include
whether
the
public
should
have
access
to
any
of
them
and
if
so
what
information
should
be
disclosed
additional
issues
include
whether
records
should
be
expunged
after
a
period
of
time
and
if
so
which
records
and
for
what
length
of
time
n
proposed
legislation
that
failed
to
pass
in
california
in
would
have
increased
public
access
to
police
disciplinary
records
that
have
been
restricted
by
state
law
and
limited
by
court
decisions
n
the
bill
would
have
required
public
access
to
records
of
all
investigations
into
uses
of
force
that
result
in
death
or
serious
injury
n
the
records
would
be
open
even
if
the
officer
involved
eventually
was
found
to
have
complied
with
a
department
s
policy
n
currently
the
lapd
only
releases
summaries
and
some
departments
don
t
even
provide
a
summary

the
bill
would
also
have
required
that
other
reports
and
findings
be
made
public
when
officers
are
found
to
have
engaged
in
misconduct
that
violates
the
legal
rights
of
the
public
n
a
similar
bill
failed
to
pass
in
after
dozens
of
peace
officers
testified
to
lawmakers
that
permitting
public
access
to
police
disciplinary
files
would
endanger
lives

according
to
a
news
report
there
has
been
no
reported
case
where
an
officer
was
harmed
based
on
release
of
this
information
n
other
police
departments
including
baltimore
similarly
do
not
release
notice
of
disciplinary
actions
and
their
disposition
n
in
contrast
at
least
ten
states
including
texas
and
florida
already
provide
public
access
to
investigative
details
findings
and
disciplinary
actions
when
officers
are
found
to
have
acted
improperly

since
dallas
has

of
force
in
response
to
resistance

the
subject
whether
the
subject
was
armed
and
the
name
or
badge
number
race
and
gender
of
the
officers
involved
n
the
challenge
with
public
access
to
disciplinary
records
is
balancing
transparency
with
protection
of
legitimate
privacy
and
safety
interests
of
police
officers
from
one
point
of
view
transparency
is
clearly
desirable
as
the
public
should
be
able
to
monitor
how
public
employees
are
disciplined
and
this
is
especially
important
to
restoring
public
trust
in
police
n
from
another
the
value
of
transparency
is
a
function
of
the
reliability
of
the
records
police
officers
who
feel
that
discipline
is
used
unfairly
to
punish
officers
or
is
meted
out
based
on
favoritism
or
for
other
nonmeritorious
reasons
would
conclude
that
public
accessibility
of
the
records
will
only
compound
the
harm
of
the
unfair
discipline
by
stigmatizing
an
officer
and
might
facilitate
reprisals
if
the
officer
s
name
and
home
address
are
released
n
conversely
officers
who
feel
that
discipline
is
fair
might
still
be
reluctant
to
allow
their
name
to
be
publicized
but
at
least
recognize
that
public
awareness
is
not
unreasonable
or
grossly
unfair
n
as
for
expungement
many
cities
allow
for
expungement
of
complaints
n
baltimore
s
union
contract
allows
officers
to
request
expungement
of
formal
complaints
that
are
found
to
be
unfounded
or
as
to
which
the
officer
was
exonerated
after
three
years
n
some
policing
scholars
assert
that
expungement
of
unfounded
complaints
is
undesirable
because
such
records
are
part
of
early
intervention
systems
mandated
by
doj
consent
decrees
these
systems
create
a
computerized
record
of
multiple
performance
indicators
including
uses
of
force
and
citizen
complaints
that
allow
supervisors
and
oversight
entities
to
have
a
full
picture
of
every
officer
s
job
performance

complaints
and
oversight

and
contracts
impose
short
statutes
of
limitations
on
the
prosecution
of
discipline
n
in
maryland
for
example
no
complaint
alleging
brutality
will
be
investigated
or
be
the
basis
of
discipline
if
filed
more
than
ninety
days
after
the
alleged
incident
n
others
treat
citizen
complaints
differently
than
complaints
initiated
by
other
officers
n
other
provisions
limit
civilian
oversight
n
for
many
police
unions
limiting
civilian
oversight
is
one
of
their
most
important
issues
n
misconduct
investigations
several
types
of
contractual
and
statutory
provisions
governing
investigations
have
been
criticized
one
provision
concerns
the
timing
of
such
investigations
and
who
should
conduct
them
n
other
constellations
of
concerns
focus
on
control
of
the
hearing
boards
that
determine
whether
officers
have
committed
misconduct
n
in
los
angeles
in
the
decades
before
the
rampart
scandal
rank
and
file
officers
believed
that
the
board
of
rights
was
controlled
by
the
chief
who
used
it
to
punish
whistleblowers
and
dissenters
n
in
baltimore
perhaps
for
a
similar
reason
the
union
negotiated
a
contractual
provision
requiring
that
one
member
of
every
hearing
board
be
a
peer
officer
of
the
accused
n
a
critic
however
insisted
that
including
a
peer
officer
as
a
member
of
the
hearing
board
serves
to
protect
misconduct
because
giving
the
rank
and
file
a
direct
voice
in
disciplinary
investigation
necessarily
lowers
the
standards
for
police
conduct
inasmuch
as
officers
have
a
vested
interest
in
shielding
all
officers
from
meaningful
investigations
and
discipline
n
other
provisions
concern
whether
the
public
should
receive
notice
of
the
disposition
of
investigations
n
the
provisions
highlighted
above
can
be
obstacles
to
reforms
in
that
they
make
it
harder
for
supervisors
civilian
oversight
boards
and
the
public
to
determine
the
nature
and
extent
of
police
misconduct
to
develop
early
intervention
systems
to
help
officers
who
are
at
risk
of
committing
future
abuse
and
to
remove
officers
who
have
committed
egregious
misconduct
police
unions
however
have
defended
these
provisions
the
fop
for
example
said
these
types
of
provisions
are
necessary
to
protect
officers
from
unfounded
citizen
complaints
n
as
the
former
president
of
the
federal
agents
police
benevolent
association
and
founder
of
the
national
police
defense
foundation
a
nonprofit
that
provides
legal
services
to
members
of
law
enforcement
put
it
what
is
happening
now
is
police
are
second
guessing
their
instincts
and
training
they
have
because
they
re
scared
to
get
indicted
that
they
may
have
to
go
to
jail
for
doing
their
job
n
this
alleged
reluctance
to
do
the
job
which
some
have
called
the
ferguson
effect
n
is
the
latest
iteration
of
a
longstanding
argument
that
unions
are
necessary
to
protect
police
from
the
anti
police
rhetoric
as
explained
further
in
parts
iii
and
iv
police
unions
have
fought
hard
for
many
of
these
procedural
and
substantive
protections
because
they
do
not
trust
the
process
of
adopting
and
implementing
policies
but
reform
will
not
be
accomplished
simply
by
eliminating
job
protections
even
if
that
were
politically
feasible
nor
will
reform
be
accomplished
simply
by
involving
the
public
in
negotiating
over
job
protections
at
least
so
long
as
the
rank
and
file
retain
the
collective
will
to
resist
reforms
discipline
is
subject
to
grievance
arbitration
and
negotiating
disputes
are
subject
to
interest
arbitration
and
it
is
politically
infeasible
and
may
well
be
unwise
to
eliminate
a
process
to
appeal
discipline
rather
rank
and
file
need
to
be
involved
in
improving
police
practices
and
that
involvement
very
likely
requires
the
cooperation
of
some
kind
of
officer
labor
representative
b
other
limits
on
reform
changing
conditions
of
employment
in
addition
to
protection
against
discipline
accountability
and
transparency
many
states
have
laws
that
require
management
to
collectively
bargain
over
any
changes
to
conditions
of
employment
n
this
requirement
can
also
stymie
reform
efforts
for
instance
federal
law
empowers
the
doj
to
bring
structural
reform
litigation
against
police
departments
engaged
in
a
pattern
or
practice
of
civil
rights
abuses
n
most
of
the
investigations
conducted
by
the
doj
have
resulted
in
consent
decrees
that
are
approved
and
overseen
by
federal
courts
n
an
investigation
of
seventeen
of
these
consent
decrees
negotiated
between
and
found
that
in
at
least
seven
of
them
the
union
contract
with
the
city
hindered
the
reforms
contained
in
the
consent
decree
n
unsurprisingly
unions
and
sometimes
classes
of
union
members
have
filed
grievances
when
these
reforms
change
working
conditions
in
seattle
for
instance
two
police
unions
filed
a
lawsuit
in
arguing
that
certain
topics
that
have
long
been
subjected
to
bargaining
including
conditions
for
employment
could
be
severely
curtailed
by
the
city
s
proposed
police
reform
plan
n
the
plan
included
provisions
that
the
seattle
police
department
spd
would
be
monitored
to
determine
whether
all
use
of
force
is
reported
tracked
and
properly
classified
and
thoroughly
and
objectively
investigated
and
reviewed
to
a
reasonable
and
unbiased
conclusion
and
also
whether
disciplinary
results
on
founded
complaints
reflect
the
seriousness
of
the
underlying
event
with
biased
policing
excessive
force
failure
to
report
force
or
dishonesty
meriting
appropriate
discipline
n
the
lawsuit
asked
the
court
to
permanently
block
the
city
and
court
monitor
from
making
any
changes
to
police
officers
wages
hours
or
working
conditions
n
doj
consent
decrees
aimed
at
reform
of
police
departments
often
include
language
providing
that
any
reforms
can
only
occur
to
the
extent
that
they
do
not
conflict
with
the
union
contract
n
these
provisions
can
delay
or
permanently
hinder
reform
efforts
n
union
structure
unions
are
run
by
an
elected
president
and
board
of
directors
n
in
large
departments
the
individuals
holding
these
full
time
paid
positions
control
a
multimillion
dollar
budget
amassed
from
union
dues
n
this
gives
them
enormous
power
to
influence
public
policy
because
they
can
donate
a
portion
of
these
funds
to
politicians
viewed
as
friendly
to
their
interests
n
a
case
in
point
is
seattle
the
seattle
police
officers
guild
spog
the
union
of
rank
and
file
officers
endorsed
ed
murray
for
mayor
in
and
contributed
to
his
campaign
n
upon
his
taking
office
one
of
his
first
acts
was
to
demote
the
interim
chief
of
the
department
a
man
who
had
enacted
numerous
reforms
that
had
been
praised
in
a
report
by
the
federal
court
monitor
of
the
doj
consent
decree
n
additionally
the
report
praised
an
assistant
chief
who
also
retired
suddenly
n
the
mayor
then
appointed
the
former
vice
president
of
spog
harry
bailey
as
interim
police
chief
n
bailey
immediately
attempted
to
overturn
misconduct
findings
of
numerous
officers
found
guilty
of
using
excessive
force
n
the
perception
that
spog
captured
the
mayor
existed
not
only
amongst
reformers
but
also
amongst
some
members
of
the
rank
and
file
the
mayor
s
actions
created
an
atmosphere
of
fear
n
one
officer
opined
that
the
former
chief
and
assistant
chief
who
the
mayor
forced
out
were
people
who
have
a
deep
institutional
knowledge
of
the
organization
have
been
there
a
long
time
and
earned
their
way
to
the
top
and
have
been
chipping
away
at
deficiencies
for
three
years
after
a
long
struggle
to
make
this
a
better
organization
boom
they
are
all
gone
you
bring
in
new
people
who
are
less
experienced
and
you
give
them
the
same
task
but
you
have
erased
that
last
few
years
of
work
n
another
officer
who
wanted
to
remain
anonymous
to
avoid
the
possibility
of
retribution
stated
if
the
people
who
have
been
opposing
the
federal
court
monitor
and
reform
are
elevated
there
is
a
risk
in
working
hard
to
achieve
reform
it
sends
a
message
that
is
at
best
confusing
about
whether
they
want
reform
to
be
successful
why
would
you
put
the
fox
in
charge
of
the
henhouse
any
risk
they
take
may
piss
off
the
folks
who
are
in
charge
i
think
a
lot
of
us
were
quite
stunned
the
mood
was
shock
complete
shock
because
everyone
who
was
involved
in
reform
was
gone
or
buried
people
just
stopped
talking
n
these
quotes
reveal
how
union
leadership
can
stymie
reform
by
stifling
the
voices
of
rank
and
file
members
who
may
support
reform
efforts
the
perception
that
the
mayor
was
in
bed
with
the
union
and
his
actions
in
demoting
and
forcing
out
individuals
who
were
working
with
the
doj
to
institute
reforms
created
fear
silenced
more
progressive
voices
amongst
the
rank
and
file
and
made
them
reluctant
to
engage
in
reform
oriented
efforts
similar
suppression
of
rank
and
file
voices
occurred
in
san
francisco
according
to
a
blue
ribbon
panel
appointed
by
the
district
attorney
after
it
was
discovered
that
members
of
the
police
department
had
exchanged
racist
and
homophobic
text
messages
n
among
the
panel
s
findings
was
that
the
union
dissuaded
officers
from
speaking
to
the
panel
and
many
who
did
speak
to
the
panel
did
so
anonymously
because
they
feared
retaliation
from
the
union
and
had
concerns
about
their
physical
safety
n
the
union
can
also
hinder
reforms
by
capturing
police
management
thereby
eliminating
any
checks
and
balances
with
the
department
this
arguably
occurred
in
seattle
when
the
former
vice
president
of
the
union
was
elevated
to
the
position
of
police
chief
n
in
san
francisco
the
blue
ribbon
panel
concluded
that
there
was
virtually
no
distinction
between
the
command
staff
of
the
department
and
the
police
officer
s
union
n
this
made
it
difficult
to
engage
in
reforms
because
the
union
was
essentially
running
the
department
and
it
had
historically
taken
antireformist
positions
n
finally
one
way
for
union
leadership
to
maintain
their
power
and
influence
is
to
convince
rank
and
file
officers
to
join
the
union
and
pay
union
dues
as
such
they
must
justify
why
the
union
is
important
for
officers
and
one
persuasive
way
to
do
so
is
to
encourage
the
rank
and
file
to
believe
that
they
cannot
trust
management
and
that
management
is
out
to
get
them
this
narrative
is
easy
to
maintain
because
the
hierarchical
structure
of
most
police
departments
limits
contact
between
command
staff
and
the
rank
and
file
n
in
sum
collective
bargaining
agreements
including
seniority
systems
union
power
over
conditions
of
work
and
the
structure
and
incentives
of
police
unions
can
all
be
barriers
to
reform
n
however
this
does
not
mean
that
unions
and
rank
and
file
officers
always
find
reform
efforts
problematic
next
this
article
provides
evidence
that
unions
can
be
important
partners
in
reform
efforts
iii
police
unions
as
agents
of
police
reform
in
theory
police
unions
could
be
agents
of
reform
in
at
least
two
ways
first
as
representatives
of
the
line
officers
who
have
daily
contact
with
the
community
whom
the
police
are
supposed
to
protect
and
serve
unions
could
help
improve
the
relationship
between
police
and
citizens
and
help
ensure
that
force
is
used
wisely
and
prudently
and
that
arrests
are
made
and
citations
issued
only
when
doing
so
actually
improves
life
for
the
community
second
unions
could
become
intermediaries
to
convey
the
concerns
of
line
personnel
to
management
in
a
way
that
will
improve
policing
but
to
do
either
of
those
unions
would
have
to
develop
genuine
and
sustained
enthusiasm
for
improving
the
quality
of
policing
n
given
the
prevailing
wisdom
that
police
unions
are
irredeemably
opposed
to
reforms
it
is
surprising
to
learn
that
while
unions
fight
hard
to
ward
off
discipline
for
some
members
n
doing
so
does
not
necessarily
equate
with
an
antireformist
position
when
it
comes
to
matters
unrelated
to
officer
discipline
there
is
evidence
of
police
unions
occasionally
working
to
facilitate
reforms
that
improve
the
quality
of
policing
here
we
offer
a
few
examples
and
then
draw
some
generalizations
from
them
a
examples
of
police
unions
as
agents
of
reform
a
number
of
cities
at
various
points
over
the
last
fifty
years
have
implemented
reforms
to
reduce
police
violence
and
improve
police
community
relations
all
of
them
involved
the
cooperation
of
the
rank
and
file
and
many
involved
active
cooperation
with
the
union
an
early
example
is
the
friday
crab
club
of
the
berkeley
police
department
which
was
organized
by
chief
august
vollmer
in
the
early
s
n
this
group
consisted
of
rank
and
file
officers
who
met
with
the
chief
on
a
weekly
basis
to
review
police
actions
including
uses
of
force
n
officers
who
had
used
force
were
required
to
explain
their
behaviors
and
the
group
would
decide
whether
the
force
was
justified
n
the
group
also
invited
experts
and
members
of
the
community
including
those
accused
of
criminal
conduct
to
address
them
n
advocates
of
community
policing
hold
up
the
friday
crab
club
as
a
paradigm
for
collegial
peer
review
that
will
unleash
the
human
potential
that
lies
at
the
core
of
community
policing
and
problem
oriented
policing
n
another
example
occurred
during
the
s
and
s
when
the
oakland
police
department
was
struggling
with
violent
encounters
with
citizens
n
chief
charles
gain
was
a
reformist
chief
who
had
strong
support
from
the
black
community
but
not
much
from
the
union
n
he
pushed
through
many
reforms
despite
union
opposition
n
many
officers
resigned
or
retired
under
his
leadership
and
the
newly
formed
union
issued
a
vote
of
no
confidence
n
despite
his
strong
leadership
style
chief
gain
created
the
violence
prevention
unit
with
the
help
of
social
psychologist
hans
toch
to
address
the
problem
of
violence
prone
officers
n
the
unit
diverged
from
the
otherwise
hierarchical
organization
of
the
police
department
and
chief
gain
maintained
a
hands
off
approach
and
allowed
the
unit
to
function
independently
n
the
unit
was
based
on
two
assumptions
first
that
patrol
officers
could
control
other
officers
and
second
that
those
officers
who
had
been
violent
in
the
past
would
be
in
the
best
position
to
help
officers
who
were
having
problems
in
the
present
n
the
unit
was
successful
in
two
ways
officers
participated
with
great
enthusiasm
and
caring
and
the
work
of
the
panel
reduced
violent
confrontations
between
the
police
and
citizens
n
as
with
many
such
reforms
however
it
was
discontinued
due
to
department
budget
cuts
n
and
almost
as
soon
as
it
was
police
violence
problems
recurred
n
one
more
example
is
from
milwaukee
in
the
s
and
s
despite
the
fact
that
the
police
chief
harold
brier
had
no
interest
in
improving
relations
with
the
black
community
the
union
saw
things
differently
n
the
union
recognized
that
its
members
were
on
the
street
as
line
officers
and
that
they
were
the
ones
who
suffered
from
the
antagonism
from
the
black
community
n
so
the
union
organized
meetings
with
citizen
groups
using
community
relations
techniques
then
in
vogue
n
like
the
oakland
experiment
however
the
program
soon
faded
in
milwaukee
unlike
in
oakland
the
police
department
never
formalized
the
program
and
never
made
funds
available
to
reimburse
officers
for
time
spent
with
citizen
groups
n
although
the
government
s
law
enforcement
administration
assistance
leaa
program
used
to
give
grants
to
police
departments
that
were
interested
in
developing
community
relations
programs
it
excluded
unions
n
in
the
years
since
leaa
has
been
replaced
by
several
funding
bureaus
within
the
doj
but
these
new
bureaus
still
will
not
fund
union
projects
n
the
metro
dade
police
citizen
violence
reduction
project
is
another
example
of
rank
and
file
officer
involvement
in
police
reform
the
project
involved
a
task
force
made
up
of
officers
management
and
others
who
were
tasked
with
reviewing
a
random
sample
of
citizen
complaints
involving
police
abuse
officers
use
of
force
and
officer
injuries
during
police
citizen
interactions
n
based
on
the
lessons
they
learned
from
this
review
a
new
training
program
involving
role
plays
was
developed
and
implemented
n
the
preliminary
results
from
the
training
program
showed
a
thirty
to
fifty
percent
reduction
in
injuries
to
officers
officers
use
of
force
and
citizens
complaints
of
abuse
n
occasionally
police
unions
have
formed
alliances
with
civil
rights
leaders
or
their
organizations
in
los
angeles
the
police
protective
league
ppl
a
notoriously
inward
looking
organization
commissioned
a
report
by
law
professor
and
civil
liberties
activist
erwin
chemerinsky
n
they
did
so
because
the
union
s
members
feared
reprisals
by
the
controversial
new
chief
of
police
bernard
parks
whom
some
league
leaders
believed
would
draw
the
wrong
lessons
from
a
corruption
scandal
in
the
lapd
s
rampart
division
n
in
newark
new
jersey
union
president
james
stewart
helped
the
doj
during
its
investigation
of
the
police
department
according
to
him
the
union
s
attitude
was
come
on
in
and
it
helped
the
doj
uncover
problems
within
the
police
department
including
frequent
pedestrian
stops
that
violated
residents
civil
rights
three
out
of
every
four
times
they
occurred
n
stewart
even
indicated
that
he
approves
of
doj
mandated
reforms
related
to
the
department
s
officer
training
and
community
relations
n
simultaneously
however
stewart
strongly
opposed
any
reforms
that
would
create
a
civilian
review
board
n
the
union
threatened
to
bring
a
lawsuit
arguing
that
changes
to
officer
discipline
must
be
part
of
collective
bargaining
n
in
los
angeles
the
lapd
created
a
community
safety
partnership
unit
that
operates
in
some
of
the
most
dangerous
and
violent
housing
developments
n
the
officers
in
the
unit
patrol
the
neighborhoods
on
foot
and
know
residents
by
name
n
they
also
earn
the
trust
of
the
community
by
providing
social
services
to
residents
as
well
as
participating
in
neighborhood
activities
n
additionally
unlike
the
ubiquitous
practice
of
promoting
officers
based
on
the
numbers
of
arrests
they
make
officers
in
this
unit
are
rewarded
for
diverting
people
from
the
criminal
justice
system
and
fostering
positive
relationships
in
the
community
n
while
it
is
unclear
how
much
the
union
was
involved
in
these
efforts
it
did
not
file
any
grievances
to
stop
the
program
or
dissuade
rank
and
file
officers
from
participating
in
it
surprisingly
the
experience
in
seattle
also
provides
an
example
of
how
unions
can
work
to
facilitate
reforms
in
after
some
of
the
events
discussed
in
section
ii
c
ron
smith
was
elected
as
the
new
president
of
spog
during
his
time
in
office
from
to
spog
continued
to
vociferously
defend
and
protect
officers
who
were
accused
of
misconduct
n
however
smith
simultaneously
worked
closely
and
collaboratively
with
the
new
police
chief
kathleen
o
toole
and
with
reformers
outside
the
department
to
implement
doj
mandated
reforms
n
the
consent
decree
between
the
city
and
the
doj
which
was
in
place
for
two
years
by
the
time
smith
was
elected
required
the
adoption
of
extensive
reforms
to
curb
excessive
force
and
racially
biased
policing
n
in
a
move
that
was
remarkable
to
outside
observers
smith
told
his
membership
that
bias
free
policing
was
important
and
if
they
did
not
like
it
they
could
leave
and
go
to
a
place
that
serves
their
worldview
n
this
is
from
the
same
union
that
had
in
described
efforts
to
combat
racial
profiling
as
socialist
policies
from
the
enemy
and
argued
that
officers
should
be
able
to
call
citizens
bitch
and
n
a
n
negotiations
on
the
collective
bargaining
agreement
between
spog
and
the
city
began
in
n
these
negotiations
had
to
be
completed
before
reforms
under
the
consent
decree
could
continue
because
some
of
the
measures
to
improve
police
accountability
potentially
conflicted
with
the
current
contract
n
during
the
negotiations
spog
president
smith
was
supportive
of
adopting
some
accountability
measures
that
would
lead
to
more
transparency
for
instance
he
supported
changes
to
the
collective
bargaining
agreement
that
would
have
opened
disciplinary
hearings
to
certain
outsiders
including
a
citizen
observer
appointed
by
the
mayor
and
members
of
the
community
police
commission
cpc
n
the
cpc
is
a
group
created
by
the
doj
consent
decree
n
made
up
primarily
of
community
groups
including
the
aclu
and
the
national
association
for
the
advancement
of
colored
people
naacp
that
had
asked
the
doj
to
investigate
the
spd
n
the
cpc
also
has
a
guaranteed
spot
for
a
representative
from
spog
and
from
the
seattle
police
management
association
n
under
smith
s
leadership
spog
did
not
file
any
grievances
or
do
anything
else
to
block
any
of
the
reform
efforts
n
one
of
the
co
chairs
of
the
cpc
lisa
daugaard
noted
that
during
the
reform
process
things
could
have
gone
terribly
with
spog
but
didn
t
n
she
continued
to
the
surprise
of
many
including
me
spog
really
has
not
impeded
the
reform
process
there
were
many
points
along
the
way
when
many
police
unions
might
have
filed
grievances
or
unfair
labor
practice
complaints
about
the
changes
that
have
been
implemented
without
bargaining
they
ve
chosen
not
to
do
that
n
she
concluded
it
s
not
as
simple
as
the
labor
union
being
the
problem
tempting
as
that
idea
is
and
true
as
it
may
have
been
in
the
past
n
and
when
in
rank
and
file
officers
from
the
north
precinct
attempted
to
derail
the
new
use
of
force
policy
adopted
by
the
police
department
by
filing
a
lawsuit
spog
president
smith
publically
voiced
his
disapproval
and
the
union
did
not
join
the
lawsuit
n
the
relationship
between
the
cpc
and
the
police
union
has
been
described
as
among
the
healthiest
between
any
two
parties
in
the
reform
process
n
smith
notes
that
the
cpc
treats
the
spog
representative
with
respect
and
stated
that
while
spog
and
the
cpc
do
not
agree
on
everything
at
least
they
can
talk
to
each
other
n
he
further
shared
that
he
has
a
really
good
relationship
with
cpc
co
chair
lisa
daugaard
n
the
relationship
is
such
that
when
the
federal
district
court
judge
in
charge
of
overseeing
the
consent
decree
suggested
that
any
new
appeal
process
for
police
discipline
cases
created
through
ongoing
collective
bargaining
negotiations
must
get
approval
from
the
court
the
cpc
filed
an
amicus
brief
supporting
spog
s
resistance
to
this
suggestion
n
ironically
observers
note
that
most
of
the
tension
has
been
between
the
cpc
and
other
parties
to
the
consent
decree
namely
the
mayor
s
office
and
the
independent
monitor
team
n
unfortunately
the
rosy
situation
in
seattle
may
have
come
to
an
end
in
early
june
spog
president
ron
smith
resigned
after
a
scandal
involving
a
controversial
facebook
post
in
which
he
blamed
the
dallas
police
officer
shootings
on
what
he
termed
the
minority
movement
n
he
denies
that
he
was
referring
to
the
black
lives
matter
movement
claiming
instead
that
he
was
referring
to
the
small
segment
of
society
which
has
the
propensity
for
violence
toward
law
enforcement
n
however
he
resigned
because
the
negative
publicity
was
pulling
attention
away
from
the
reform
efforts
being
made
in
the
city
n
in
a
later
interview
however
smith
disclosed
that
he
also
resigned
because
the
executive
board
of
the
union
was
going
to
attempt
to
force
him
out
because
of
his
acceptance
of
police
accountability
measures
in
the
proposed
union
contract
and
for
being
too
conciliatory
to
outside
reformers
and
the
police
chief
n
he
had
been
described
as
a
bootlicker
because
of
his
relationship
with
the
chief
despite
the
fact
that
his
collaboration
with
chief
o
toole
was
crucial
to
his
ability
to
negotiate
improvements
to
officer
working
conditions
n
while
he
expected
that
he
could
win
the
fight
and
stay
in
office
because
of
support
he
had
amongst
some
members
of
the
executive
board
and
the
rank
and
file
he
did
not
want
the
controversy
over
his
facebook
post
to
distract
from
the
ongoing
reform
process
n
after
he
resigned
officers
voted
to
to
reject
the
contract
n
one
of
the
reasons
was
the
inclusion
of
civilian
review
in
the
proposed
agreement
n
b
drawing
lessons
from
experiences
one
of
the
most
important
lessons
from
the
examples
above
is
that
while
it
might
be
difficult
to
convince
unions
to
move
away
from
their
core
mission
to
protect
their
membership
from
discipline
their
defense
of
officers
does
not
necessarily
signal
a
lack
of
willingness
to
engage
in
other
reform
efforts
although
reformers
often
view
a
union
s
defense
of
officers
as
a
hindrance
sometimes
this
defense
can
even
facilitate
reforms
by
exposing
institutional
and
systemic
problems
for
instance
as
discussed
in
part
i
broken
windows
policing
the
war
on
drugs
and
compstat
have
together
created
intense
pressures
on
rank
and
file
officers
to
increase
summonses
arrests
and
stops
and
frisks
when
officers
complain
or
fail
to
meet
their
numbers
they
might
be
given
negative
performance
evaluations
affecting
their
ability
to
get
promoted
this
occurred
in
when
some
nypd
officers
believed
that
their
negative
performance
evaluations
were
the
result
of
their
complaints
about
their
precinct
s
quota
system
n
patrick
lynch
the
president
of
the
nypd
s
police
union
the
pba
brought
attention
to
these
problems
when
he
told
newspaper
reporters
that
these
quotas
were
a
department
wide
problem
n
a
new
york
times
magazine
article
on
the
persistence
of
arrest
quotas
reported
that
officers
who
shared
their
belief
that
the
emphasis
on
numbers
resulted
in
unnecessary
arrests
feared
retribution
from
the
brass
one
officer
said
that
the
rank
and
file
were
utterly
demoralized
and
critical
of
the
department
but
they
don
t
have
a
voice
if
they
speak
out
they
get
crushed
n
in
the
pba
challenged
the
department
s
obsession
with
numbers
in
a
case
involving
an
officer
employed
by
the
seventy
fifth
precinct
who
received
a
negative
evaluation
allegedly
based
on
his
failure
to
meet
the
unofficial
quota
n
years
later
on
may
the
pba
took
out
a
newspaper
ad
attacking
the
quotas
which
read
don
t
blame
the
cop
blame
nypd
management
for
pressure
to
write
summonses
and
the
pressure
to
convict
motorists
n
the
ad
claimed
the
department
punished
officers
who
did
not
write
enough
tickets
n
similarly
in
new
jersey
the
union
opposed
orders
from
police
management
to
meet
quotas
which
union
president
stewart
claims
created
pressure
on
officers
to
conduct
baseless
stops
and
strained
relations
with
community
members
n
additionally
a
union
s
defense
of
officers
can
also
facilitate
structural
reforms
for
instance
nypd
officers
who
spoke
out
against
the
department
s
controversial
stop
and
frisk
practices
did
so
anonymously
because
they
feared
retaliation
and
punishment
n
one
officer
said
that
punishments
for
falling
short
of
quotas
ranged
from
losing
a
longtime
partner
low
evaluation
scores
retraining
and
denial
of
days
off
or
overtime
requests
n
other
officers
shared
similar
stories
n
although
it
is
unclear
whether
the
union
played
any
role
in
protecting
these
officers
right
to
speak
out
against
prevailing
management
practices
doing
so
would
certainly
fall
within
the
union
s
function
another
lesson
from
the
examples
is
the
importance
of
giving
voice
to
rank
and
file
officers
in
reform
efforts
however
much
of
the
policing
literature
observes
that
most
reform
efforts
take
a
top
down
approach
police
chiefs
politicians
and
reformers
often
complain
that
the
union
and
the
collective
bargaining
agreement
are
obstacles
to
reform
and
many
police
reformers
have
long
accepted
the
idea
that
reform
can
only
be
accomplished
through
a
top
down
process
n
the
wariness
of
some
reformers
about
the
willingness
of
police
unions
to
embrace
reform
can
be
traced
to
the
political
activism
of
unions
during
the
late
s
n
when
unions
opposed
citizen
review
boards
and
reform
oriented
chiefs
n
in
addition
to
pursuing
improvements
in
wages
benefits
and
seniority
n
police
activism
during
this
time
often
took
the
form
of
rabid
knee
jerk
opposition
to
civilian
oversight
active
participation
in
far
right
wing
organizations
vigilante
attacks
on
black
activists
and
organized
brutality
against
political
protesters
n
today
statements
and
actions
by
police
unions
and
rank
and
file
officers
continue
to
lend
support
to
the
view
that
police
rank
and
file
share
a
monolithic
occupational
mindset
and
subculture
of
paranoia
insularity
and
intolerance
n
it
is
also
undoubtedly
true
that
the
crime
fighting
ideology
of
professionalism
in
policing
and
the
law
and
order
rhetoric
of
the
political
right
had
a
long
term
impact
on
police
officers
and
their
unions
even
though
most
police
union
leaders
now
are
in
the
middle
of
the
political
spectrum
n
additionally
some
resistance
to
reforms
can
be
explained
by
rank
and
file
opposition
to
policies
that
require
them
to
retreat
from
their
traditional
aggressive
crime
control
orientation
this
should
not
be
surprising
however
because
many
likely
joined
the
police
department
relying
upon
the
type
of
policing
that
is
currently
in
vogue
and
taught
in
most
police
academies
and
in
their
departments
thus
changes
to
policing
tactics
might
seem
like
a
bait
and
switch
especially
when
measures
of
officer
success
have
not
kept
pace
with
changes
in
policing
tactics
such
as
community
policing
however
attributing
resistance
solely
to
rank
and
file
intransigence
ignores
how
the
typical
top
down
approach
to
reforms
can
also
predictably
lead
to
resistance
resistance
often
stems
from
people
s
opposition
to
or
frustration
with
enactments
of
power
n
research
from
the
study
of
power
reveals
that
certain
exercises
of
authority
can
breed
deep
resentment
among
lower
level
employees
resulting
in
resistance
to
employer
mandated
policies
and
procedures
one
form
of
power
that
predictably
produces
frustration
is
failing
to
provide
employees
with
a
voice
in
decisionmaking
n
voice
is
important
because
it
expresses
to
workers
that
their
views
are
significant
enough
to
be
considered
n
failing
to
give
employees
voice
or
providing
them
with
illusory
voice
n
not
only
serves
as
a
sign
of
their
low
status
but
also
deprives
them
of
interactions
with
power
holders
that
can
favorably
influence
their
attitudes
n
these
studies
of
the
significance
of
voice
in
the
workplace
correspond
to
studies
of
police
culture
and
suggest
the
importance
of
police
union
involvement
in
police
reform
studies
of
the
successes
and
failures
of
community
policing
models
have
found
that
proper
training
of
officers
and
a
participatory
management
style
are
correlated
with
more
positive
officer
attitudes
about
community
policing
n
for
instance
street
officers
in
chicago
who
feel
well
trained
in
cop
community
oriented
policing
hold
much
more
positive
attitudes
about
their
jobs
than
officers
who
do
not
feel
well
trained
they
are
also
more
optimistic
about
the
impact
of
cop
on
crime
if
they
feel
a
part
of
the
decision
making
process
agencies
that
imposed
community
policing
and
maintained
a
top
down
paramilitary
decision
making
style
tended
to
meet
with
strong
officer
resistance
n
moreover
it
is
likely
that
the
insights
and
creativity
of
rank
and
file
officers
can
revolutionize
policing
line
personnel
are
a
powerful
and
important
resource
to
improve
policing
and
the
relationship
between
police
and
citizens
n
another
example
from
seattle
demonstrates
this
point
in
october
of
seattle
unveiled
an
ambitious
and
unique
four
year
pilot
program
to
address
the
major
problem
of
open
air
drug
markets
in
the
downtown
seattle
corridor
n
the
law
enforcement
assisted
diversion
lead
program
is
a
pre
booking
program
that
gives
police
officers
the
discretion
to
divert
individuals
engaged
in
low
level
drug
and
prostitution
crimes
to
community
based
services
instead
of
jail
and
prosecution
n
the
program
was
the
first
of
its
kind
in
the
country
and
resulted
from
a
successful
collaboration
between
unlikely
partners
including
the
public
defender
s
office
the
prosecutor
s
office
community
groups
nonprofit
organizations
such
as
the
aclu
and
top
command
from
the
spd
n
like
many
other
reform
efforts
that
seek
to
change
street
level
policing
practices
lead
policymakers
followed
a
top
down
approach
they
sought
input
from
high
level
police
officials
social
scientists
advocates
and
community
leaders
n
although
patrol
officers
from
one
precinct
of
the
spd
were
given
significant
responsibility
for
making
the
program
work
their
input
was
never
sought
n
rather
the
reformers
used
the
ubiquitous
top
down
approach
and
worked
only
with
top
command
in
developing
the
policy
n
the
new
program
was
poised
to
be
a
huge
success
n
command
level
officers
within
the
police
department
fully
supported
the
program
n
as
a
result
they
instituted
new
rules
and
policies
for
patrol
officers
to
follow
n
there
was
just
one
problem
despite
the
absence
of
overt
resistance
to
the
program
from
the
rank
and
file
officers
responsible
for
its
implementation
there
was
significant
opposition
behind
the
scenes
n
in
fact
not
only
did
patrol
officers
resent
the
program
but
middle
managers
within
the
department
were
also
suspicious
n
the
unique
and
groundbreaking
cooperation
between
top
command
and
outside
agencies
and
experts
may
have
aggravated
rank
and
file
resentments
as
two
policing
scholars
note
rank
and
file
officers
do
not
appreciate
being
told
what
to
do
by
outsiders
especially
outsiders
whom
they
perceive
as
unacquainted
or
at
least
out
of
touch
with
the
daily
demands
of
their
job
n
consequently
while
these
officers
did
not
publicly
voice
their
disapproval
of
lead
some
quietly
and
covertly
failed
to
implement
it
n
this
hidden
resistance
would
not
have
been
discovered
but
for
the
fact
that
the
program
s
evaluation
process
included
focus
groups
with
middle
management
n
it
is
unsurprising
that
the
rank
and
file
were
suspicious
of
the
policy
although
top
command
was
heavily
involved
in
working
out
its
final
details
this
was
unlikely
to
alleviate
rank
and
file
concerns
n
furthermore
failing
to
give
them
any
voice
likely
fueled
existing
resentments
because
it
communicated
to
them
just
how
unimportant
their
views
were
and
just
how
low
their
status
was
within
the
department
to
make
matters
worse
they
were
one
of
the
only
groups
excluded
from
policymaking
that
would
actually
be
affected
by
the
policy
members
of
the
community
and
other
organizations
throughout
the
city
gave
their
input
n
finally
because
the
rank
and
file
had
no
contact
with
the
civilian
reformers
they
had
no
opportunity
to
develop
a
different
opinion
about
their
motives
n
rank
and
file
resistance
to
lead
was
not
open
and
obvious
there
was
no
public
position
taken
by
the
union
against
the
policy
and
the
officers
did
not
publicly
voice
their
disapproval
rather
they
engaged
in
what
political
scientist
james
scott
refers
to
as
everyday
resistance
acts
of
resistance
that
are
meant
to
frustrate
or
defeat
formal
dictates
in
ways
that
are
designed
not
to
be
discernible
n
their
resistance
was
only
discovered
because
lead
s
evaluation
process
called
for
the
creation
of
focus
groups
made
up
of
sergeants
from
the
department
n
during
discussions
the
sergeants
not
only
disclosed
their
own
reservations
about
the
policy
but
they
also
shared
the
resentments
of
the
rank
and
file
n
these
resentments
and
mistrust
had
led
the
rank
and
file
to
quietly
and
covertly
undermine
the
policy
on
the
street
n
in
response
the
group
began
to
work
closely
with
the
sergeants
and
some
rank
and
file
officers
to
determine
what
the
problems
were
and
how
to
best
address
them
n
this
process
entailed
giving
these
groups
a
voice
and
the
ability
to
make
changes
to
lead
in
response
to
their
concerns
while
the
officers
were
initially
skeptical
about
whether
the
group
was
actually
interested
in
obtaining
their
input
they
slowly
came
around
n
today
not
only
has
the
program
improved
n
but
the
relationships
of
trust
that
were
formed
between
members
of
the
police
department
and
reformers
have
fostered
additional
gains
in
other
areas
importantly
it
is
not
that
all
rank
and
file
officers
bought
into
the
program
but
rather
that
while
some
still
questioned
the
substance
of
the
policy
they
also
worked
towards
improving
its
efficacy
n
giving
genuine
voice
to
officers
and
treating
them
with
respect
affected
their
attitudes
and
behaviors
towards
lead
n
this
occurred
even
though
many
continue
to
disagree
with
the
substance
of
the
policy
n
being
included
in
the
process
rather
than
being
marginalized
and
having
quality
interpersonal
interactions
with
reformers
helped
mitigate
feelings
of
distrust
and
skepticism
from
the
lower
ranks
n
according
to
one
of
the
reformers
who
founded
lead
the
program
is
having
an
important
and
positive
impact
in
the
community
due
to
innovations
from
rank
and
file
police
officers
and
sergeants
n
in
sum
the
seattle
experience
provides
some
evidence
that
rank
and
file
officers
can
play
a
significant
role
in
reform
oriented
policymaking
although
this
role
did
not
involve
the
union
per
se
the
union
also
did
not
file
grievances
and
other
collective
bargaining
challenges
that
they
could
have
brought
furthermore
the
relationships
of
trust
that
developed
between
some
members
of
the
rank
and
file
and
the
outside
reformers
have
facilitated
other
reform
efforts
with
this
type
of
close
contact
reformers
can
gain
a
better
understanding
of
the
major
concerns
of
the
rank
and
file
and
the
union
and
attempt
to
address
them
giving
the
rank
and
file
a
voice
in
implementing
reforms
can
also
facilitate
more
positive
relationships
between
the
rank
and
file
and
police
management
the
more
contact
management
has
with
the
rank
and
file
the
less
likely
union
leadership
can
successfully
paint
a
falsely
negative
picture
of
management
to
ensure
that
rank
and
file
officers
continue
to
join
the
union
increasing
the
power
influence
and
budget
of
union
leadership
policymakers
cannot
afford
to
disregard
the
dynamics
of
power
within
police
departments
for
at
least
two
reasons
first
the
way
that
power
is
exercised
within
departments
can
influence
whether
rank
and
file
officers
view
reforms
as
legitimate
and
entitled
to
deference
or
whether
they
attempt
to
undermine
them
through
acts
of
resistance
policymakers
should
recognize
that
when
they
work
solely
with
the
top
command
levels
of
police
departments
they
might
unintentionally
exacerbate
rank
and
file
frustrations
with
existing
power
arrangements
leading
to
resistance
to
any
new
policies
that
might
be
enacted
n
thus
although
reformers
may
believe
they
have
achieved
success
because
police
management
has
enacted
new
policies
and
procedures
in
response
to
their
concerns
their
failure
to
engage
the
rank
and
file
may
ultimately
doom
their
efforts
second
the
dynamics
of
power
also
reveal
that
resistance
may
occur
without
the
knowledge
of
police
management
or
outside
policymakers
hidden
acts
of
resistance
in
the
face
of
power
are
ubiquitous
because
open
opposition
by
subordinate
groups
often
has
adverse
consequences
especially
in
the
workplace
n
for
instance
an
employee
who
candidly
expresses
her
displeasure
and
disagreement
with
rules
and
policies
directly
to
her
supervisor
may
significantly
reduce
her
opportunities
for
promotion
or
other
discretionary
employment
benefits
because
street
officers
operate
primarily
out
of
sight
of
management
they
have
numerous
opportunities
to
engage
in
covert
resistance
to
reform
oriented
policies
when
resistance
is
subtle
rather
than
overt
management
and
reformers
may
be
unaware
that
the
new
policy
is
not
being
implemented
n
what
the
analysis
thus
far
has
shown
is
that
police
unions
have
strong
incentives
to
resist
policies
imposed
without
their
involvement
in
policy
development
but
also
that
when
they
are
involved
in
policy
development
and
when
the
reforms
are
not
simply
focused
on
harsher
and
swifter
punishment
of
officers
police
unions
have
supported
them
the
question
to
which
this
article
now
turn
is
whether
it
is
feasible
to
use
the
levers
of
labor
law
to
increase
the
incentives
for
departments
and
unions
to
collaborate
in
developing
and
implementing
reforms
iv
changing
police
unions
one
would
search
in
vain
for
any
account
of
the
problems
with
policing
or
the
avenues
for
reform
that
doesn
t
place
substantial
emphasis
on
changing
rank
and
file
police
culture
and
the
supervision
and
training
of
the
rank
and
file
as
the
doj
concluded
in
its
august
report
on
the
baltimore
police
department
bpd
the
constitutional
violations
described
in
the
findings
result
in
part
from
critical
deficiencies
in
the
bpd
s
systems
to
train
equip
supervise
and
hold
officers
accountable
n
doj
found
that
among
other
things
the
bpd
does
not
collect
and
analyze
reliable
data
to
allow
early
interventions
to
deal
with
problematic
officer
conduct
does
not
consistently
accept
investigate
or
respond
to
complaints
of
even
serious
misconduct
and
many
officers
are
reluctant
to
report
misconduct
for
fear
that
doing
so
is
fruitless
and
may
provoke
retaliation
n
the
set
of
best
practices
promulgated
by
the
international
association
of
chiefs
of
police
along
with
empirical
research
on
police
agree
that
rank
and
file
officers
should
be
involved
in
the
development
of
policies
and
in
depth
analyses
of
problematic
police
departments
often
find
that
the
rank
and
file
are
not
involved
in
policymaking
and
resist
the
implementation
of
reforms
n
although
scholars
and
commentators
urge
greater
public
involvement
and
transparency
more
will
be
required
than
just
public
involvement
and
transparency
to
get
police
culture
to
change
n
the
question
this
article
answers
is
whether
changing
certain
institutional
structures
of
employee
representation
including
police
unions
will
promote
rank
and
file
support
for
measures
that
would
improve
community
policing
transparency
and
accountability
in
short
yes
principles
of
labor
law
should
be
used
to
create
leverage
within
police
departments
for
officers
and
supervisors
who
support
reform
in
particular
organizations
of
officers
other
than
the
majority
union
should
be
empowered
to
meet
and
confer
with

leaders

principle
of

section
b
then
addresses
the
specifics
of
the
proposal
this
part
concludes
by
addressing
some
potential
questions
a
why
empower
new
labor
organizations
in
police
departments
the
literature
on
policing
the
investigations
of
particular
police
departments
and
the
news
coverage
of
policing
since
ferguson
suggest
that
officers
throughout
the
hierarchy
in
many
police
departments
are
receptive
to
reform
and
willing
to
report
and
to
try
to
prevent
unconstitutional
conduct
n
but
most
accounts
of
supporters
of
reform
either
make
no
mention
of
the
police
union
or
suggest
that
the
union
was
at
best
indifferent
to
the
problems
and
at
worst
hostile
to
reform
efforts
and
whistleblowers
n
for
example
the
nypd
officer
profiled
in
the
february
new
york
times
magazine
for
his
efforts
to
challenge
the
persistence
of
racial
inequities
in
police
citizen
encounters
described
being
retaliated
against
and
seeking
support
not
from
the
police
union
but
from
an
association
of
black
nypd
officers
and
joining
a
class
action
suit
n
another
nypd
officer
adrian
schoolcraft
was
retaliated
against
by
management
when
he
exposed
the
crime
data
manipulation
occurring
due
to
the
department
s
unofficial
quota
policy
and
the
pba
did
nothing
to
protect
him
n
in
the
lapd
an
association
of
black
officers
supports
black
lives
matter
while
the
union
does
not
n
the
doj
report
on
the
bpd
states
that
investigators
met
with
leadership
of
the
baltimore
city
lodge
no
of
the
fop
which
represents
all
sworn
bpd
officers
and
repeatedly
cites
a
fop
report
critical
of
certain
aspects
of
bpd
the
doj
report
notes
a
few
provisions
of
the
union
contract
that
make
officer
discipline
more
difficult
but
says
relatively
little
about
how
the
fop
could
be
either
an
obstacle
to
or
an
agent
of
reform
n
the
doj
report
on
the
chicago
police
department
states
its
investigators
met
with
representatives
of
the
unions
for
rank
and
file
sergeants
lieutenants
and
captains
and
the
report
notes
that
although
there
are
obstacles
to
accountability
in
the
union
contracts
there
are
also
ways
to
override
these
contractual
impediments
that
the
city
rarely
invokes
n
if
the
reformers
at
the
top
of
a
police
department
had
institutionalized
connections
to
reform
supporters
at
the
bottom
of
the
hierarchy
things
might
change
in
theory
unions
could
facilitate
accountability
by
protecting
rank
and
file
officers
from
unfair
decisions
unions
could
enable
these
officers
to
exercise
discretion
and
judgment
assure
fairness
in
punishing
mistakes
and
enable
whistleblowing
unions
might
prevent
scapegoating
a
single
hapless
officer
when
blame
for
mistreatment
of
citizens
belongs
elsewhere
they
could
also
work
to
counter
management
s
insistence
on
dangerous
policies
such
as
the
case
of
nypd
officer
peter
liang
who
shot
an
unarmed
black
youth
in
a
stairwell
while
on
duty
in
accordance
with
a
policy
of
training
rookie
officers
by
placing
them
in
extremely
dangerous
situations
which
had
previously
been
identified
by
commissioner
bratton
as
a
ticking
time
bomb
n
yet
the
examples
above
and
in
part
ii
suggest
that
unions
do
not
always
play
this
role
changing
demographics
of
large
urban
police
forces
may
provide
a
path
forward
to
create
such
institutionalized
connections
among
reformers
throughout
the
hierarchy
as
police
departments
have
become
more
diverse
identity
based
groups
representing
officers
have
gained
members
and
influence
recent
work
shows
that
a
diverse
police
force
mitigates
group
threat
and
thereby
reduces
the
number
of
officer
involved
killings
n
the
diversity
of
the
police
force
is
thought
to
reduce
excessive
force
through
four
processes
it
increases
legitimacy
of
the
police
among
minority
communities
it
increases
the
number
of
officers
who
may
be
more
compassionate
toward
minority
communities
it
increases
opportunities
for
contact
between
police
and
citizens
and
perhaps
most
important
it
weakens
solidarity
within
the
police
community
when
confronted
with
threats
n
thus
although
data
remain
unclear
on
whether
the
representation
of
african
americans
in
the
police
directly
influences
the
number
of
officer
involved
killings
of
african
americans
it
is
linked
with
various
factors
associated
with
group
threat
and
thereby
eases
the
tensions
between
the
police
and
african
american
communities
n
a
diverse
workforce
is
less
likely
to
have
a
monolithic
attitude
toward
issues
but
it
is
necessary
to
have
a
mechanism
to
translate
the
diversity
of
perspectives
into
policymaking
and
implementation
that
institutional
mechanism
could
be
a
diversity
of
labor
organizations
such
organizations
already
exist
in
many
large
departments
the
next
step
is
to
make
them
more
effective
in
becoming
a
voice
for
reform
that
process
may
already
be
happening
as
some
mainstream
police
unions
are
staving
off
the
threat
to
their
dominance
as
the
police
labor
representative
by
building
their
own
bridges
to
civilian
groups
both
inside
and
outside
the
labor
movement
n
a
second
and
related
way
the
institutionalization
of
alternative
labor
organizations
might
transform
police
departments
is
by
combatting
the
proven
tendency
of
police
unions
toward
oligarchy
the
solidarity
that
is
essential
for
any
union
to
function
is
especially
powerful
in
a
workforce
in
which
officers
can
endanger
each
other
s
safety
by
refusing
to
respond
to
a
call
for
backup
the
duty
of
fair
representation
along
with
union
constitutions
and
bylaws
requiring
regular
democratic
elections
of
leadership
are
supposed
to
temper
the
tendency
toward
oligarchy
and
to
make
the
union
leadership
responsive
to
the
disparate
views
of
the
members
n
yet
as
labor
scholars
have
long
observed
oligarchy
remains
a
significant
issue
for
many
unions
and
police
unions
are
no
exception
n
but
the
problem
is
not
simply
oligarchy
in
the
sense
of
control
of
the
union
by
a
few
but
also
that
union
leadership
in
many
cities
seems
unresponsive
to
the
segment
of
the
rank
and
file
who
favor
greater
engagement
with
minority
communities
especially
for
example
as
discussed
above
in
a
number
of
circumstances
union
leadership
s
embrace
of
reform
elicited
a
threat
from
a
segment
of
the
membership
to
vote
the
reformers
out
of
union
office
as
happened
in
seattle
n
a
boston
police
department
veteran
noted
that
union
leaders
who
might
seek
a
collaborative
role
with
management
in
facilitating
reform
would
not
be
re
elected
to
office
n
alternatively
progressive
forces
within
police
departments
have
struggled
with
more
regressive
union
leadership
nypd
officers
attempted
to
oust
pba
president
lynch
after
his
hostile
comments
following
the
killings
of
eric
garner
and
others
but
they
were
unsuccessful
n
empowering
a
minority
union
might
either
goad
the
majority
union
into
supporting
reform
or
provide
an
alternate
channel
for
reform
oriented
officers
to
meet
and
confer
with
management
about
reform
with
legal
protection
from
retaliation
for
doing
so
third
minority
unionism
might
address
the
major
criticisms
of
public
employee
unions
one
criticism
is
that
they
are
not
responsive
to
the
views
of
the
full
range
of
public
employees
and
they
promote
bad
governance
n
another
is
that
public
employees
and
governments
agree
to
terms
that
are
not
in
the
public
interest
because
taxpayers
are
not
represented
in
bargaining
and
public
employee
unions
are
a
special
interest
with
disproportionate
influence
in
the
political
process
unions
are
able
to
get
legislators
and
executive
branch
officials
elected
and
to
lobby
for
legislation
e
g
the
construction
of
more
prisons
or
harsher
criminal
sentences
that
increase
employment
empirical
support
for
and
modeling
that
attempts
to
prove
this
argument
exist
but
the
evidence
is
mixed
n
these
criticisms
were
explored
in
a
classic
work
written
early
in
the
development
of
public
sector
unions
using
the
example
of
police
clyde
summers
a
thoughtful
scholar
of
labor
law
and
a
proponent
of
the
benefits
of
unionization
observed
that
government
employee
collective
bargaining
is
a
political
policymaking
process
and
that
the
bargaining
process
and
the
subjects
over
which
public
employees
bargain
should
be
regulated
by
law
to
produce
a
desirable
political
framework
in
which
to
make
policy
decisions
n
discussing
police
disciplinary
procedures
summers
postulated
that
a
police
union
probably
represents
the
consensus
of
officers
in
negotiating
to
foreclose
public
review
of
discipline
n
he
suggested
that
a
public
review
board
perhaps
ought
not
be
subject
to
bargaining
because
there
would
not
be
a
fair
airing
of
all
sides
of
the
issue
n
a
public
review
board
he
said
is
unlikely
to
be
opposed
by
those
interested
in
more
police
protection
or
by
the
chief
of
police
and
the
police
commissioners
who
sit
on
the
employer
s
side
of
the
bargaining
table
and
in
bargaining
between
the
union
and
the
brass
no
one
represents
the
interests
of
those
who
fear
that
policemen
will
act
abusively
or
unlawfully
and
that
their
superiors
will
not
take
appropriate
disciplinary
action
n
thus
he
concluded
collective
bargaining
does
not
provide
an
appropriate
political
process
for
full
discussion
of
the
issue
or
for
weighing
and
reconciling
the
competing
interests
n
the
labor
law
doctrinal
response
to
the
summers
argument
would
be
to
declare
that
citizen
review
boards
are
not
a
permissible
subject
of
bargaining
so
that
neither
management
nor
the
union
could
negotiate
away
the
public
s
right
to
review
some
police
policies
yet
for
the
reasons
given
above
and
in
the
literature
on
other
forms
of
institutional
reform
limiting
the
power
of
a
police
union
by
simply
taking
some
issues
off
the
negotiating
table
is
not
a
solution
to
the
problem
of
police
misconduct
it
is
essential
to
marshal
the
support
of
the
labor
force
to
implement
policy
and
the
more
discretion
skill
and
expertise
is
required
for
the
work
the
more
important
it
is
to
ensure
that
police
officers
at
the
bottom
of
the
organization
are
given
an
opportunity
to
voice
their
ideas
and
concerns
moreover
the
evidence
from
states
that
prohibit
public
employee
bargaining
does
not
suggest
that
having
no
union
produces
less
police
abuse
n
the
questions
of
accountability
of
police
officers
to
the
public
and
police
union
leadership
to
the
members
exist
even
where
there
is
no
institutionalized
collective
bargaining
as
in
north
carolina
n
in
north
carolina
which
prohibits
governments
from
collectively
bargaining
with
organizations
representing
public
employees
the
fop
which
claims
members
among
city
police
departments
statewide
decided
to
endorse
the
republican
candidate
for
governor
because
the
democratic
candidate
who
was
the
north
carolina
attorney
general
brought
criminal
charges
against
a
charlotte
mecklenburg
police
officer
who
shot
an
unarmed
black
man
in
n
the
absence
of
institutionalized
negotiating
relationships
in
north
carolina
means
that
the
decision
about
whom
the
fop
will
endorse
is
perhaps
one
of
the
most
important
things
that
the
fop
decides
there
is
no
legal
obstacle
to
police
officers
forming
other
groups
to
represent
a
different
point
of
view
and
collect
contributions
from
their
members
to
spend
on
political
activity
but
the
absence
of
such
a
tradition
and
the
absence
of
institutional
support
for
such
organizations
in
the
states
that
do
allow
public
employee
bargaining
give
the
fop
the
practical
ability
to
speak
for
all
north
carolina
police
officers
in
the
way
news
organizations
cover
the
event
what
if
there
were
an
alternative
organization
that
could
rally
the
members
and
engage
in
discussions
with
management
over
an
alternative
point
of
view
n
to
create
such
an
institutional
mechanism
without
producing
a
cacophony
of
voices
and
chaos
in
negotiations
would
require
some
mechanism
to
cause
organizations
to
merge
or
form
coalitions
in
order
to
match
the
leverage
a
long
established
police
union
can
exert
how
that
can
be
done
is
described
below
b
a
form
of
members
only
bargaining
one
old
criticism
of
unions
that
has
gained
recent
support
especially
among
conservatives
and
libertarians
asserts
that
collective
bargaining
by
a
union
chosen
by
the
majority
violates
the
rights
of
the
minority
who
disagree
with
the
union
s
position
n
this
objection
to
unions
has
particular
salience
in
the
case
of
police
unions
especially
in
departments
where
officers
disagree
about
how
to
police
minority
communities
and
whether
arrests
for
certain
relatively
minor
offenses
serve
the
public
interest
while
for
the
moment
public
employee
unions
chosen
by
the
majority
remain
the
exclusive
representative
of
all
employees
in
the
bargaining
unit
the
recent
litigation
and
legislative
efforts
to
dramatically
curtail
bargaining
rights
of
government
workers
have
invited
consideration
of
alternative
models
n
one
model
is
members
only
union
representation
with
some
kind
of
proportional
representation
rule
this
type
of
system
existed
for
some
government
employees
prior
to
the
development
of
modern
public
sector
labor
law
california
for
example
had
a
proportional
representation
system
for
some
public
employees
from
when
it
enacted
its
first
public
sector
labor
law
statute
to
when
it
adopted
new
public
sector
labor
statutes
providing
for
exclusive
representation
n
the
winton
act
n
as
the
old
statute
was
known
did
not
allow
public
employers
to
recognize
an
exclusive
bargaining
representative
chosen
by
the
majority
n
instead
employee
councils
consisting
of
representatives
from
the
gamut
of
employee
organizations
were
authorized
to
meet
with
employers
n
these
councils
were
ostensibly
to
save
time
for
government
agencies
allowing
them
to
hear
all
opinions
at
once
n
the
council
included
representatives
from
employees
in
the
form
of
organization
representatives
or
even
individuals
n
the
act
permitted
the
majority
employee
organization
to
articulate
the
official
position
of
the
employees
but
provided
a
forum
for
other
minority
organization
representatives
and
individuals
to
express
points
of
view
n
the
suggestions
gleaned
from
these
council
meetings
were
handled
by
the
employer
agency
i
e
the
school
board
because
the
winton
act
applied
to
teachers
n
the
employer
had
the
legal
right
under
the
winton
act
to
make
the
final
decision
on
all
matters
n
the
act
recommended
that
employers
incorporate
agreed
upon
items
into
written
resolutions
regulations
or
policies
but
these
directives
were
implemented
in
various
ways
across
the
state
and
council
procedures
differed
from
one
city
county
or
school
district
to
another
n
this
proportional
representation
system
was
replaced
in
california
in
and
in
other
states
by
the
early
s
for
a
variety
of
good
reasons
it
was
far
from
ideal
it
was
expensive
and
cumbersome
it
did
not
provide
an
organized
system
for
shared
decisionmaking
between
government
employees
and
public
administrators
because
decisionmaking
authority
was
left
in
the
hands
of
the
government
agency
n
it
instead
generated
conflict
among
different
groups
of
employees
and
it
was
an
obstacle
to
uniform
policies
across
governmental
units
n
majority
rule
through
exclusive
representation
in
contrast
can
be
more
efficient
as
a
system
of
governance
which
is
why
it
is
the
rule
in
every
democracy
but
sticking
with
political
analogies
many
parliamentary
democracies
have
governance
systems
that
involve
multiple
parties
that
form
coalitions
to
create
a
majority
and
that
might
be
a
pattern
worth
considering
for
police
unions
if
the
concern
is
that
union
leadership
are
systematically
excluding
voices
within
the
rank
and
file
a
variety
of
issues
would
need
to
be
addressed
depending
on
how
radical
a
change
in
the
existing
system
of
representation
a
state
chose
to
adopt
if
officers
chose
not
to
belong
to
the
existing
union
in
the
twenty
two
states
that
allow
employers
and
unions
to
negotiate
contracts
requiring
payment
of
agency
fees
to
a
recognized
labor
organization
n
would
employees
be
obligated
to
pay
an
agency
fee
to
the
majority
union
or
could
they
instead
pay
fees
to
their
own
would
the
majority
union
retain
the
duty
of
fair
representation
to
all
represented
employees
or
only
some
duty
to
its
members
n
would
the
same
collective
bargaining
agreement
apply
to
all
officers
or
only
to
the
members
for
the
moment
a
modest
change
is
the
best
course
of
action
because
it
is
the
only
one
that
might
conceivably
be
adopted
as
legislative
change
is
likely
necessary
because
it
might
allow
beneficial
changes
without
destroying
the
police
unions
that
function
well
and
because
incremental
changes
might
allow
governments
to
assess
the
impact
and
unintended
consequences
and
make
corrections
before
completely
upending
existing
bargaining
agreements
and
personnel
practices
to
prevent
undue
disruption
to
existing
unions
and
bargaining
relationships
the
same
principles
of
dues
and
fees
as
exist
under
current
law
would
apply
as
would
the
duty
of
fair
representation
and
all
the
labor
law
that
turns
on
the
duty
of
fair
representation
all
that
would
change
is
the
department
would
have
the
duty
to
meet
and
confer
with
a
minority
union
provided
it
demonstrated
a
minimum
level
of
support
say
membership
of
twenty
percent
or
more
of
the
officers
in
the
department
the
minimum
threshold
of
support
would
ideally
minimize
the
burden
on
police
departments
to
meet
and
confer
with
too
many
groups
and
would
provide
incentives
for
groups
of
employees
to
band
together
to
make
their
voices
heard
the
scope
of
that
duty
to
meet
and
confer
would
extend
to
any
topic
relating
to
conditions
of
police
employment
other
than
terms
in
the
existing
contract
in
labor
law
terms
the
duty
to
confer
would
cover
matters
of
policy
that
are
not
mandatory
subjects
of
bargaining
under
existing
law
the
purposes
of
this
limit
are
several
it
would
theoretically
reduce
majority
union
opposition
to
the
proposal
it
would
avoid
destabilizing
existing
bargaining
agreements
and
the
department
s
and
government
s
budget
expectations
resting
on
them
it
would
prevent
departments
from
cutting
officer
pay
and
benefits
by
trading
off
responsiveness
to
minority
unions
about
policing
practices
and
community
relations
for
economic
and
job
protections
enjoyed
by
all
officers
the
purpose
of
this
limited
duty
to
confer
is
to
create
an
institutional
mechanism
for
police
officers
to
be
involved
in
policymaking
and
problem
solving
n
that
is
why
the
scope
of
the
new
duty
omits
the
wages
and
working
conditions
as
to
which
public
sector
labor
law
currently
imposes
a
duty
to
bargain
but
it
is
not
intended
to
weaken
the
economic
and
disciplinary
protections
for
which
police
unions
have
bargained
the
proposal
resembles
some
that
have
been
made
for
the
reform
of
teaching
another
area
of
public
sector
employment
with
high
union
density
and
substantial
controversy
about
whether
unionization
serves
the
interests
of
the
government
employees
and
the
public
n
it
also
more
generally
resembles
proposals
to
create
institutions
of
labor
management
cooperation
that
have
been
made
many
times
for
different
industries
in
that
it
provides
a
framework
for
collective
discussion
of
issues
of
mutual
concern
outside
the
context
of
union
management
negotiations
over
wages
and
working
conditions
n
it
echoes
criticisms
of
labor
law
scholars
including
martin
malin
and
joseph
slater
concerning
the
scope
of
the
duty
to
meet
and
confer
in
the
public
sector
n
according
to
professor
malin
there
is
a
lot
of
evidence
that
when
workers
through
their
unions
are
given
a
voice
in
areas
where
they
have
no
right
to
bargain
the
union
s
role
is
transformed
and
better
policies
result
for
example
when
school
boards
unilaterally
impose
performance
standards
it
is
not
a
surprise
that
unions
do
what
they
can
to
protect
teachers
from
adverse
actions
based
on
failing
to
meet
those
standards
when
school
boards
opt
instead
to
work
with
the
union
to
develop
those
standards
and
use
peer
review
to
implement
them
the
unions
become
the
protectors
of
the
standards
rather
than
knee
jerk
opponents
union
involvement
in
teacher
peer
review
leads
to
greater
levels
of
attrition
among
poor
performers
than
traditional
methods
of
principal
observation
and
discipline
or
dismissal
for
failure
to
meet
the
standards
n
a
similar
phenomenon
occurred
in
the
s
when
president
clinton
by
executive
order
created
partnership
councils
and
thereby
spurred
the
creation
of
a
very
successful
partnership
between
the
customs
service
n
and
the
national
treasury
employees
union
that
represented
customs
agents
n
data
showed
a
substantial
improvement
in
job
performance
even
by
metrics
such
as
increased
drug
and
currency
seizures
n
similar
results
were
seen
in
oakland
when
the
police
department
developed
a
peer
review
system
for
reviewing
officer
uses
of
force
n
as
indicated
above
during
the
pendency
of
the
project
the
department
experienced
a
reduction
in
officer
use
of
force
n
this
proposal
also
incorporates
suggestions
that
labor
law
scholars
have
made
to
incorporate
identity
based
groups
into
unionized
workplaces
as
a
way
of
ensuring
that
the
majority
union
does
not
systematically
overlook
the
interests
of
minorities
n
officers
could
belong
both
to
the
minority
union
and
to
the
majority
union
so
that
they
would
not
have
to
give
up
the
benefits
of
majority
union
membership
including
the
ability
to
vote
on
leadership
and
contract
ratification
and
the
right
to
receive
insurance
and
legal
representation
paid
for
by
union
dues
officers
also
could
gain
the
benefits
of
membership
in
the
minority
union
principally
the
ability
to
have
a
voice
in
the
minority
union
s
governance
and
priority
setting
policies
this
proposal
solves
many
of
the
unique
problems
associated
with
police
unions
in
the
quest
for
reform
police
unions
have
been
isolated
from
the
rest
of
the
labor
movement
in
many
ways
but
particularly
in
their
disconnectedness
from
the
social
movement
unionism
principles
and
practices
that
have
reinvigorated
many
other
unions
a
police
minority
group
that
shares
a
self
interest
with
black
lives
matter
or
moral
mondays
is
ideally
situated
to
start
trying
to
transform
the
culture
of
the
police
department
and
the
police
union
a
minority
union
might
find
allies
among
the
activists
of
black
lives
matter
and
other
groups
which
might
empower
the
minority
union
to
stand
up
to
what
might
be
considerable
pressure
from
the
police
union
that
is
a
type
of
protection
for
whistleblowing
that
simply
cannot
be
legislated
or
enforced
by
contract
and
it
might
create
momentum
that
would
attract
quiescent
dissenters
from
among
the
rank
and
file
to
abandon
their
reflexive
support
for
the
union
and
its
defense
of
miscreant
officers
n
c
will
this
version
of
members
only
unionism
weaken
public
sector
unions
and
is
that
a
bad
thing
there
are
certain
large
and
small
objections
to
any
proposal
to
adopt
any
form
of
members
only
bargaining
even
one
as
minor
as
this
we
address
two
clusters
of
the
most
important
objections
below
one
major
concern
is
that
the
proposal
does
too
little
it
is
not
clear
that
adopting
this
limited
duty
to
meet
and
confer
with
minority
organizations
will
change
very
much
police
officers
have
shown
themselves
to
be
quite
loyal
to
their
unions
n
this
proposal
leaves
the
majority
union
in
charge
of
the
economic
contract
terms
and
the
disciplinary
system
at
least
in
the
jurisdictions
where
the
disciplinary
system
is
in
the
contract
rather
than
written
into
statute
n
these
are
the
two
top
priorities
for
police
n
and
the
disciplinary
system
is
the
biggest
concern
of
police
reformers
n
moreover
many
protections
are
written
into
statutes
and
no
system
of
union
representation
will
change
that
unless
the
majority
union
is
weakened
to
the
point
that
it
cannot
block
legislative
change
n
but
the
modesty
of
this
proposal
should
be
seen
as
a
feature
rather
than
a
bug
at
least
to
those
who
favor
some
reform
but
fear
that
radical
change
is
either
politically
impossible
or
would
wreak
havoc
on
public
employee
labor
relations
and
thereby
do
more
harm
than
good
as
a
modest
development
it
would
not
change
too
much
too
fast
which
might
allow
for
innovation
in
the
fertile
pockets
of
progressive
police
activism
that
do
exist
without
destabilizing
existing
bargaining
relationships
in
departments
that
are
not
already
dysfunctional
a
second
major
concern
is
that
the
minority
union
would
be
easily
undermined
given
the
radioactive
nature
of
some
of
the
issues
the
minority
union
might
wish
to
discuss
with
management
e
g
civilian
review
boards
the
officers
practice
of
huddling
before
making
reports
on
violence
racial
disparities
in
arrests
for
minor
infractions
n
a
minority
union
would
face
considerable
pressure
from
the
majority
union
and
its
members
unlike
those
faced
by
other
caucuses
within
unionized
workplaces
in
some
low
wage
workers
unions
for
example
few
members
of
the
union
show
up
at
meetings
because
union
meetings
take
free
time
that
many
workers
juggling
jobs
and
family
do
not
have
and
many
probably
do
not
care
much
about
non
core
contractual
issues
n
but
one
can
imagine
police
having
intense
interest
in
these
non
core
contractual
issues
once
minority
unions
have
real
power
unlike
the
minority
caucuses
now
it
is
easy
to
imagine
a
police
minority
union
being
quickly
co
opted
or
sabotaged
by
internal
union
confederates
minority
unions
would
under
this
proposal
have
the
right
and
responsibility
to
discuss
contentious
issues
like
use
of
force
statistical
measures
of
police
productivity
and
other
policing
tactics
that
have
become
extremely
divisive
one
could
imagine
officers
who
are
hostile
to
reform
having
intense
interest
in
preventing
the
minority
union
from
persuading
management
to
make
any
significant
changes
officers
opposed
to
reform
might
sign
up
en
masse
to
join
the
minority
union
precisely
to
take
it
over
and
kill
it
or
minority
union
members
might
face
intense
pressure
to
defect
to
the
majority
union
so
that
the
minority
union
would
dissolve
there
are
ways
to
design
a
minority
union
system
to
address
these
concerns
perhaps
minority
union
membership
could
be
confidential
leaving
the
job
of
physically
meeting
and
conferring
with
the
brass
to
the
most
courageous
few
who
felt
they
could
publicly
stand
the
pressure
or
the
minority
union
might
rely
on
the
labor
law
principles
that
have
allowed
unions
to
fire
stewards
when
they
believe
the
steward
has
become
ideologically
opposed
to
the
union
n
public
sector
labor
law
in
most
jurisdictions
already
protects
union
activists
from
retaliation
or
harassment
n
and
such
protection
would
need
to
be
extended
to
supporters
of
the
minority
union
as
well
as
the
majority
union
to
the
extent
that
a
system
of
representation
gained
traction
it
could
produce
the
kind
of
chaos
and
cacophony
that
led
to
criticisms
of
the
proportional
representation
system
in
california
before
n
it
could
lead
to
expensive
and
slow
discussions
rather
than
any
real
change
in
policy
management
could
play
the
two
unions
off
against
each
other
thus
weakening
both
those
concerns
could
be
ameliorated
by
careful
design
the
system
could
be
limited
to
just
one
majority
and
one
minority
union
moreover
to
the
extent
that
the
change
gave
a
minority
union
power
to
negotiate
any
kind
of
binding
agreement
on
any
terms
currently
subject
to
the
duty
to
bargain
with
the
exclusive
representative
some
complex
problems
would
arise
courts
or
public
employee
relations
boards
would
have
to
decide
how
to
recalibrate
the
mandatory
subjects
of
bargaining
to
enable
participation
of
the
minority
union
significantly
they
would
have
to
decide
whether
discipline
remains
a
mandatory
subject
of
bargaining
because
so
much
of
the
controversy
over
police
violence
focuses
on
the
appropriate
disciplinary
process
if
it
is
they
would
have
to
determine
how
to
allow
the
minority
union
to
play
a
role
in
negotiation
over
the
disciplinary
system
if
the
minority
union
were
empowered
to
be
at
the
bargaining
table
over
design
of
the
disciplinary
system
then
questions
would
arise
over
how
to
involve
the
minority
union
in
the
interest
arbitration
or
fact
finding
process
that
often
resolves
bargaining
disputes
over
mandatory
subjects
of
bargaining
d
the
benefits
of
the
proposal
outweigh
the
risks
the
advantage
this
proposal
has
over
most
others
being
offered
is
that
this
one
has
the
possibility
of
garnering
support
from
some
rank
and
file
police
officers
who
are
dissatisfied
with
their
union
but
see
a
wholesale
assault
on
police
unionism
as
worse
than
the
status
quo
of
course
if
even
the
mildest
version
of
this
proposal
were
offered
as
legislation
it
may
be
impossible
to
enact
or
implement
precisely
to
the
extent
it
would
weaken
extant
unions
in
when
wisconsin
eliminated
bargaining
rights
for
most
public
sector
employees
it
did
not
eliminate
such
rights
for
public
safety
employees
n
ohio
in
contrast
tried
to
eliminate
bargaining
for
every
public
employee
and
the
voters
repealed
the
law
by
referendum
n
both
of
these
are
reminders
of
the
power
of
public
safety
unions
even
in
climates
that
have
a
strong
antiunion
strain
advocates
of
the
benefits
of
police
unions
to
police
reform
in
the
s
insisted
that
police
unions
could
train
officers
in
the
values
of
democracy
and
could
remedy
the
alienated
and
repressive
mentality
of
the
police
by
involving
as
many
policemen
as
possible
in
decision
making
on
all
aspects
of
the
department
s
job
n
creating
an
institutional
mechanism
that
gives
space
for
minority
unions
to
voice
their
concerns
would
create
incentives
for
existing
unions
to
account
for
these
opposing
views
this
might
facilitate
the
development
of
the
values
of
trust
cooperation
communication
leadership
and
respect
n
working
through
inevitable
disagreements
would
provide
opportunities
for
officers
to
learn
these
important
values
n
officers
might
gain
maturity
patience
and
tolerance
for
different
points
of
view
that
can
translate
into
better
relationships
and
engagements
with
the
communities
they
serve
n
additionally
deliberating
through
disputes
and
coming
to
a
successful
resolution
will
involve
creativity
and
problem
solving
skills
that
are
consonant
with
abilities
they
will
have
to
develop
to
successfully
engage
in
community
policing
n
the
reasons
for
encouraging
a
multitude
of
voices
in
reform
oriented
policymaking
is
not
simply
to
increase
buy
in
and
reduce
resistance
rather
their
contributions
can
help
make
the
reforms
themselves
more
effective
n
there
are
two
reasons
for
this
first
policymakers
both
within
and
outside
the
department
often
believe
that
their
expertise
makes
them
better
equipped
than
the
rank
and
file
to
determine
what
reforms
are
necessary
and
how
best
to
bring
them
to
fruition
they
may
be
completely
unaware
of
their
own
limitations
and
information
gaps
this
fallacy
of
expertise
n
causes
policymakers
to
overlook
the
benefits
of
obtaining
input
from
the
individuals
who
will
be
tasked
with
executing
their
vision
n
however
as
previously
discussed
rank
and
file
officers
will
have
insights
to
share
based
upon
their
day
to
day
engagement
in
street
policing
involving
top
command
in
policymaking
is
not
an
adequate
substitute
for
the
expertise
and
knowledge
of
the
rank
and
file
because
high
level
police
managers
might
have
lost
touch
with
changed
circumstances
on
the
street
furthermore
top
command
officers
may
be
disconnected
from
the
actual
experiences
of
officers
on
the
street
and
thus
may
be
unaware
of
the
challenges
posed
by
the
reform
to
street
officers
daily
work
it
would
be
more
efficient
to
identify
these
issues
prior
to
implementation
rather
than
after
policies
and
procedures
have
been
changed
the
second
reason
to
create
mechanisms
to
ensure
that
a
multitude
of
voices
are
heard
is
that
involvement
of
the
rank
and
file
in
decisionmaking
can
help
mitigate
inevitable
misunderstandings
and
miscommunications
that
occur
when
new
policies
are
explained
to
them
the
rank
and
file
will
undoubtedly
encounter
unexpected
problems
during
the
process
of
implementation
this
implementation
gap
n
can
occur
even
if
officers
are
attempting
to
apply
the
reform
in
good
faith
policymakers
cannot
anticipate
every
circumstance
that
officers
will
confront
when
they
attempt
to
put
a
new
policy
into
practice
thus
they
cannot
possibly
create
rules
that
govern
every
situation
n
as
a
consequence
officers
inevitably
interpret
and
modify
policy
n
this
process
of
interpretation
can
have
both
unforeseen
and
unintended
consequences
not
contemplated
by
the
reformers
n
also
if
officers
were
not
involved
in
conceiving
the
policy
they
may
not
appreciate
its
goals
and
intent
hence
their
choices
and
judgments
will
not
be
informed
by
a
deep
understanding
of
the
policy
s
purpose
as
a
result
of
the
implementation
gap
policies
may
not
work
as
reformers
intended
even
when
the
rank
and
file
are
doing
their
best
to
abide
by
them
if
the
rank
and
file
are
not
given
a
voice
reformers
may
not
find
out
about
the
problems
furthermore
top
command
and
policymakers
may
attribute
the
gap
between
theory
and
practice
to
rank
and
file
obstinacy
n
in
response
top
command
may
increase
rank
and
file
surveillance
in
order
to
control
their
behavior
and
punish
them
for
transgressions
not
realizing
that
the
problems
are
due
to
their
own
inability
to
anticipate
how
the
policy
would
actually
work
in
practice
n
ironically
this
increased
surveillance
and
control
can
lead
to
resistance
that
may
not
have
existed
in
the
first
place
n
thus
the
failure
to
involve
the
rank
and
file
not
only
deprives
the
reform
of
being
more
effective
but
it
may
also
have
the
unintended
effect
of
generating
resistance
as
reformers
attribute
the
failure
of
the
policy
solely
to
rank
and
file
resistance
two
scholars
observe
all
too
often
this
whole
process
becomes
reiterative
the
reforms
meet
with
police
skepticism
the
way
the
police
respond
to
them
generates
unintended
consequences
the
negative
consequences
then
inspire
another
set
of
reforms
that
again
meets
with
local
skepticism
and
so
on
the
continuous
process
of
reform
soon
will
reach
a
point
where
police
are
so
weary
of
reform
that
they
become
increasingly
immovable
constant
reform
undermines
morale
and
breeds
ever
greater
skepticism
about
reform
n
engaging
the
rank
and
file
in
policymaking
could
help
to
avoid
some
of
the
problems
caused
by
the
fallacy
of
expertise
and
the
implementation
gap
with
involvement
rank
and
file
officers
could
make
reformers
aware
of
the
challenges
posed
by
the
policies
both
ex
ante
and
ex
post
rank
and
file
officers
inevitably
make
policy
on
the
street
through
their
day
to
day
interactions
with
the
public
n
involving
the
rank
and
file
in
formal
policymaking
might
enhance
the
effectiveness
of
the
reform
by
improving
information
flows
and
rank
and
file
compliance
n
this
proposal
can
also
help
to
change
the
notoriously
entrenched
culture
of
police
departments
n
research
suggests
that
people
often
engage
in
behaviors
that
they
believe
others
are
also
engaged
in
n
in
other
words
people
imitate
those
around
them
psychologists
refer
to
this
as
social
proof
n
however
often
assumptions
about
another
s
beliefs
are
based
on
inaccurate
information
n
one
way
to
overcome
mistaken
beliefs
about
what
others
are
thinking
is
to
make
other
views
salient
and
public
minority
union
representation
will
show
rank
and
file
officers
that
their
potentially
more
open
minded
and
progressive
views
are
shared
by
others
additionally
this
minority
unionism
would
give
outside
reformers
the
opportunity
to
understand
that
there
are
officers
within
the
department
who
support
their
proposals
and
this
could
lead
to
the
forging
of
partnerships
between
police
reformers
and
officers
within
the
department
that
can
facilitate
reforms
moreover
if
decisionmakers
are
truly
considering
input
from
the
rank
and
file
it
is
likely
that
the
policies
that
are
eventually
enacted
will
incorporate
some
of
their
suggestions
rank
and
file
officers
have
knowledge
and
expertise
to
share
given
their
familiarity
with
the
street
n
they
will
have
ideas
that
policymakers
did
not
consider
and
they
can
also
highlight
unanticipated
problems
additionally
reformers
may
be
unaware
that
their
ideas
as
initially
proposed
are
simply
unworkable
for
a
variety
of
reasons
from
the
mundane
to
the
insurmountable
n
thus
rank
and
file
officers
can
help
fill
the
gap
between
theory
and
practice
mechanisms
to
improve
labor
management
cooperation
are
essential
to
police
reform
it
is
misguided
to
suggest
that
the
solution
is
simply
to
make
it
easier
for
departments
to
fire
or
discipline
officers
without
changing
the
way
that
management
relates
to
the
rank
and
file
for
at
least
three
reasons
first
it
may
be
politically
impossible
to
significantly
reduce
contractual
or
statutory
protections
for
officers
accused
of
misconduct
second
and
by
far
more
important
even
if
every
officer
who
kills
a
civilian
unjustifiably
were
fired
promptly
and
criminally
prosecuted
it
is
an
empirical
question
whether
police
violence
would
decline
through
the
operation
of
specific
or
general
deterrence
n
if
some
number
of
unjustified
police
shootings
are
the
result
of
poor
training
or
bad
management
one
puts
a
great
deal
of
faith
in
enlightened
police
management
to
assume
that
eliminating
job
protections
for
rank
and
file
officers
will
allow
management
to
dramatically
alter
patrol
officers
behavior
to
better
safeguard
the
public
even
if
police
union
contracts
and
statutory
leobors
were
revised
to
provide
a
speedier
and
more
transparent
disciplinary
process
that
would
make
it
easier
to
terminate
the
employment
of
officers
found
to
have
used
improper
force
still
policing
behavior
might
not
change
dramatically
if
police
management
encourages
practices
that
lead
to
excessive
force
arrests
for
minor
infractions
or
other
kinds
of
law
enforcement
strategies
that
harm
minority
communities
conclusion
the
prevailing
narrative
suggests
that
rank
and
file
officers
in
general
and
police
unions
in
particular
are
obstacles
to
reforms
that
would
make
policing
more
transparent
accountable
and
legitimate
to
the
citizenry
while
there
is
certainly
strong
evidence
to
support
this
view
this
article
highlights
examples
of
rank
and
file
officers
acting
individually
and
some
unions
acting
representatively
as
key
partners
in
reform
efforts
that
can
improve
the
quality
of
policing
the
essential
question
is
how
to
increase
the
opportunities
for
officers
to
be
a
positive
force
for
the
improvement
of
police
services
discussions
of
the
need
for
police
reform
understandably
focus
on
problematic
officers
and
on
unions
that
appear
to
be
irredeemably
opposed
to
any
reform
oriented
policies
what
is
lost
in
these
discussions
is
the
recognition
of
the
officers
who
could
be
partners
in
reform
efforts
and
who
do
not
have
a
mechanism
for
making
their
voices
heard
within
the
department
especially
when
the
police
union
for
whatever
reason
either
does
not
support
their
views
or
does
not
take
their
views
into
account
minority
unionism
in
police
departments
gives
these
officers
a
voice
by
creating
an
institutional
mechanism
to
ensure
that
their
views
are
heard
this
proposal
expands
the
duty
of
management
to
meet
and
confer
with
the
police
union
to
include
subjects
relating
to
reform
it
prevents
the
minority
union
from
renegotiating
the
economic
terms
and
disciplinary
system
created
by
the
majority
union
in
the
collective
bargaining
agreement
or
invoking
the
interest
arbitration
system
used
to
resolve
bargaining
disputes
between
the
majority
union
and
the
department
thus
departments
and
police
unions
should
support
this
reform
as
it
respects
their
interests
the
proposal
moreover
is
built
on
successful
labor
management
partnerships
that
have
been
used
in
both
federal
and
state
systems
and
that
demonstrably
improved
productivity
morale
and
the
quality
of
service
provided
by
government
agencies
in
which
these
types
of
labor
management
councils
have
been
implemented
alternative
proposals
such
as
increasing
public
scrutiny
of
police
discipline
and
reducing
job
protections
for
police
officers
may
not
achieve
greater
accountability
or
reduce
unwarranted
police
violence
while
it
is
important
to
increase
public
scrutiny
of
police
actions
doing
so
will
not
necessarily
further
the
goals
of
police
accountability
for
instance
civilian
members
of
panels
that
review
the
disciplinary
decisions
of
lapd
police
chief
beck
were
more
likely
than
officers
to
oppose
the
chief
s
discipline
recommendations
n
furthermore
if
eliminating
job
protections
for
officers
would
reduce
police
violence
then
it
should
be
done
however
this
proposal
addresses
the
normative
question
of
what
kinds
of
procedural
protections
police
officers
should
have
when
accused
of
misconduct
n
allowing
a
diverse
set
of
officers
to
participate
in
reform
oriented
policymaking
would
force
the
primary
union
to
account
for
minority
voices
force
management
to
account
for
a
diversity
of
views
and
help
management
and
rank
and
file
officers
to
develop
trust
providing
them
voice
and
accounting
for
their
input
shows
them
respect
gives
them
a
sense
of
ownership
n
and
will
likely
increase
their
perceptions
of
the
department
s
legitimacy
the
benefits
of
experimenting
with
giving
diverse
voices
a
say
in
reform
oriented
policymaking
is
well
worth

levine
supra
note
at
as
noted
in
the
doj
chicago
report
some
barriers
to
accountability
for
misconduct
are
also
created
by
management
without
apparent
legislative
or
union
negotiated
pressure
the
doj
stated
our
investigation
revealed
that
the
city
fails
to
conduct
any
investigation
of
nearly
half
of
police
misconduct
complaints
and
that
a
number
of
institutional
barriers
contribute
to
this
fact
there
are
provisions
in
the
city
s
agreements
with
the
unions
that
impede
the
investigative
process
such
as
the
general
requirement
that
a
complainant
sign
a
sworn
affidavit
and
limitations
on
investigating
anonymous
complaints
and
older
incidents
of
misconduct
that
said
the
union
agreements
contain
override
provisions
for
some
of
these
provisions
that
the
city
rarely
utilizes
other
barriers
have
been
created
solely
by
the
city
such
as
internal
policies
allowing
investigative
agencies
to
truncate
investigations
of
serious
misconduct
through
mediation
administratively
close
complaints
deemed
less
serious
and
ignore
mandatory
investigations
into
uses
of
force
that
could
identify
misconduct
or
faulty
training
issues
doj
chi
rep
supra
note
at
the
doj
also
found
procedures
used
in
the
circumstances
where
investigations
are
conducted
hampered
the
search
for
truth
and
its
description
of
those
procedures
makes
clear
that
blame
for
them
is
widespread
witnesses
and
accused
officers
are
frequently
not
interviewed
at
all
or
not
interviewed
until
long
after
the
incident
when
memories
have
faded
when
interviews
do
occur
questioning
is
often
biased
in
favor
of
officers
and
witness
coaching
by
union
attorneys
is
prevalent
and
unimpeded
a
dynamic
neither
we
nor
our
law
enforcement
experts
had
seen
to
nearly
such
an
extent
in
other
agencies
investigators
routinely
fail
to
collect
probative
evidence
the
procedures
surrounding
investigations
allow
for
ample
opportunity
for
collusion
among
officers
and
are
devoid
of
any
rules
prohibiting
such
coordination
we
found
that
a
lack
of
resources
and
investigative
training
contribute
to
these
investigative
problems
we
also
found
that
investigations
foundered
because
of
the
pervasive
cover
up
culture
among
cpd
officers
which
the
accountability
entities
accept
as
an
immutable
fact
rather
than
something
to
root

sounding

of

throughout

only
portend
greater
anxiety
about
digital
robots
replacing
humans
in
the
governmental
sphere
a
few
administrative
agencies
have
already
begun
to
adopt
this
technology
while
others
have
clear
potential
in
the
near
term
to
use
algorithms
to
shape
official
decisions
over
both
rulemaking
and
adjudication
it
is
no
longer
fanciful
to
envision
a
future
in
which
government
agencies
could
effectively
make
law
by
robot
a
prospect
that
understandably
conjures
up
dystopian
images
of
individuals
surrendering
their
liberty
to
the
control
of
computerized
overlords
should
society
be
alarmed
by
governmental
use
of
machine
learning
applications
we
examine
this
question
by
considering
whether
the
use
of
robotic
decision
tools
by
government
agencies
can
pass
muster
under
core
time
honored
doctrines
of
administrative
and
constitutional
law
at
first
glance
the
idea
of
algorithmic
regulation
might
appear
to
offend
one
or
more
traditional
doctrines
such
as
the
nondelegation
doctrine
procedural
due
process
equal
protection
or
principles
of
reason
giving
and
transparency
we
conclude
however
that
when
machine
learning
technology
is
properly
understood
its
use
by
government
agencies
can
comfortably
fit
within
these
conventional
legal
parameters
we
recognize
of
course
that
the
legality
of
regulation
by
robot
is
only
one
criterion
by
which
its
use
should
be
assessed
agencies
should
not
apply
algorithms
cavalierly
even
if
doing
so
might
not
run
afoul
of
the
law
in
some
cases
safeguards
may
be
needed
for
machine
learning
to
satisfy
broader
good
governance
aspirations
yet
in
contrast
with
the
emerging
alarmism
we
resist
any
categorical
dismissal
of
a
future
administrative
state
in
which
algorithmic
automation
guides
and
even
at
times
makes
key
decisions
instead
we
urge
that
governmental
reliance
on
machine
learning
should
be
approached
with
measured
optimism
about
the
potential
benefits
such
technology
can
offer
society

introduction
algorithms
are
not
new
for
decades
they
have
served
as
integral
components
of
every
computer
program
n
but
today
advanced
machine
learning
algorithms
are
creating
a
vastly
automated
society

many
facets

to
deliver
astonishing
forecasting
power
and
speed
today
s
algorithms
are
digital
robots
n
that
possess
effectively
autonomous
abilities
to
adapt
and
learn
n
as
this
type
of
artificial
intelligence
becomes
more
intricately
woven
into
the
economy
a
new
kind
of
information
revolution
is
beginning
that
may
lead
to
fundamental
changes
in
society
n
the
ability
of
increasingly
intelligent
systems
to
replace
human
workers
for
instance
has
prompted
widespread
concern
about
the
impact
of
machine
learning
on
employment
opportunities
across
a
variety
of
occupational
and
professional
fields
n
according
to
some
projections
artificial
intelligence
threatens
to
displace
workers
in
all
routinized
jobs
and
skill
based
jobs
that
require
the
ability
to
perform
diverse
kinds
of
cognitive
labor
from
physicians
to
reporters
to
stockbrokers
n
even
more
ominously
some
commentators
worry
about
potentially
new
forms
of
human
oppression
that
could
stem
from
greater
reliance
on
artificial
intelligence
high
tech
entrepreneur
elon
musk
for
example
has
warned
that
artificial
intelligence
presents
the
biggest
existential
threat
to
society
likening
it
to
summoning
the
demon
n
renowned
physicist
stephen
hawking
has
eerily
forecasted
that
t
he
development
of
full
artificial
intelligence
could
spell
the
end
of
the
human
race
n
new
york
times
reporter
john
markoff
summarizes
the
views
of
a
growing
number
of
observers
who
worry
that
emerging
smart
machines
risk
constituting
a
new
set
of
masters
controlling
humanity
n
these
worries
about
artificial
intelligence
s
impact
on
human
liberty
have
surfaced
over
the
use
of
machine
learning
by
private
sector
institutions
such
as
banks
and
media
companies
but
presumably
the
prospect
of
governmental
reliance
on
autonomous
self
learning
robots
only
magnifies
any
perceived
risks
of
digital
oppression
machine
learning
uses
by
defense
homeland
security
and
criminal
law
enforcement
authorities
have
understandably
begun
to
trigger
alarm
and
prompt
serious
ethical
consideration
waging
war
through
robots
for
example
presents
obviously
novel
concerns
n
the
use
of
algorithms
to
analyze
telephone
records
and
other
personal
information
has
also
sparked
extensive
public
controversy
over
privacy
issues
n
similar
controversies
surround
law
enforcement
agencies
use
of
machine
learning
to
detect
respond
to
and
perhaps
even
predict
crime
n
notwithstanding
the
extensive
attention
given
to
the
use
of
machine
learning
algorithms
by
national
security
and
criminal
law
enforcement
agencies
the
use
of
such
artificial
intelligence
by
other
governmental
institutions
in
the
day
to
day
operation
of
government
has
escaped
sustained
analysis
granted
commentators
have
occasionally
speculated
about
a
fanciful
future
in
which
institutions
like
the
supreme
court
n
or
the
presidency
n
might
be
replaced
by
artificial
intelligence
but
such
speculations
are
usually
intended
as
absurdities
most
people
believe
that
core
governmental
institutions
and
their
decisions
must
be
grounded
in
judgments
made
by
real
human
beings
a
government
of
the
people
by
the
people
n
even
if
machine
learning
algorithms
come
to
be
widely
accepted
as
substitutes
for
human
control
over
automobiles
or
other
functions
in
private
life
a
deeper
more
fundamental
suspicion
about
artificial
intelligence
will
presumably
remain
about
the
use
of
machine
learning
in
the
governmental
sphere
when
it
comes
to
making
laws
and
other
governmental
decisions
the
notion
of
using
algorithms
as
substitutes
for
human
decisions
would
appear
to
create
a
serious
threat
to
democratic
governance
conjuring
images
of
unaccountable
computerized
overlords
n
and
yet
despite
dire
warnings
about
the
dangers
of
runaway
algorithmic
governance
many
aspects
of
public
administration
could
undoubtedly
benefit
from
the
application
of
machine
learning
algorithms
both
today
and
in
years
to
come
the
vast
work
of
administrative
agencies
with
their
many
routine
regulatory
responsibilities
and
adjudicatory
processes
would
seem
ripe
to
benefit
from
such
automation
these
agencies
fulfill
important
oversight
responsibilities
over
vital
aspects
of
everyday
life
from
regulating
the
safety
of
the
food
we
eat
to
setting
the
rules
by
which
financial
markets
operate
officials
in
these
agencies
must
make
an
array
of
crucial
judgments
on
a
daily
basis
that
are
not
unlike
the
kinds
of
judgments
that
machine
learning
has
so
clearly
helped
improve
in
the
private
sector
n
moreover
with
the
private
sector
increasingly
relying
on
algorithms
to
make
faster
more
precise
decisions
the
increased
speed
and
complexity
of
economic
activity
in
the
machine
learning
era
surely
demands
that
government
agencies
keep
pace
and
make
use
of
the
same
analytic
tools
in
order
to
regulate
the
private
sector
more
effectively
n
if
machine
learning
can
help
regulatory
agencies
make
smarter
more
accurate
decisions
the
benefits
to
society
could
be
considerable
but
can
the
prospect
of
the
government
regulating
by
robot
or
adjudicating
by
algorithm
be
accommodated
within
prevailing
legal
norms
fitting
machine
learning
into
the
regulatory
state
may
turn
out
to
be
one
of
the
most
fundamental
challenges
facing
the
u
s
governmental
system
in
the
decades
to
come
regulating
by
robot
would
hardly
seem
at
first
glance
to
fit
naturally
within
prevailing
principles
of
administrative
law
that
law
after
all
is
built
on
the
assumption
that
governmental
decisions
will
be
made
by
humans
such
an
assumption
has
led
to
a
variety
of
legal
constraints
aimed
at
ensuring
administrative
decisions
are
democratically
accountable
and
fair
indeed
even
with
humans
at
the
helm
administrative
agencies
are
already
thought
to
constitute
a
vast
bureaucratic
machinery
of
government
with
an
ever
present
potential
to
grow
detached
from
and
unaccountable
to
the
rest
of
society
n
if
many
bureaucrats
jobs
come
to
be
replaced
by
automated
systems
the
likelihood
of
an
even
more
detached
possibly
despotic
administrative
government
would
only
seem
to
increase
n
when
contemplating
the
use
of
robotic
algorithms
public
officials
lawyers
and
judges
should
ask
how
well
the
use
of
machine
learning
will
conform
to
well
established
legal
principles
of
constitutional
and
administrative
law
in
this
article
we
address
significant
but
previously
unanalyzed
legal
questions
raised
by
machine
learning
in
particular
we
consider
how
nonhuman
decision
tools
would
have
to
be
used
to
comport
with
the
nondelegation
doctrine
and
with
rules
about
due
process
antidiscrimination
and
governmental
transparency
although
administrative
agencies
are
still
only
beginning
to
use
machine
learning
algorithms
today
s
widespread
concern
about
the
robotic
control
of
other
facets
of
life
makes
it
opportune
to
examine
carefully
the
potential
for
machine
learning
s
use
by
government
agencies
n
given
the
relative
complexity
of
modern
machine
learning
algorithms
we
begin
in
part
i
by
providing
a
brief
non
technical
summary
of
how
these
algorithms
operate
drawing
on
this
background
we
also
identify
existing
and
likely
future
applications
of
machine
learning
within
the
administrative
state
in
part
ii
we
provide
a
legal
analysis
of
such
algorithmic
applications
by
federal
administrative
agencies
considering
whether
various
methods
of
implementing
machine
learning
will
likely
offend
principles
of
nondelegation
due
process
antidiscrimination
and
transparency
we
conclude
that
government
agencies
should
be
able
to
rely
on
autonomous
learning
decision
tools
without
running
afoul
of
legal
standards
contrary
to
popular
perceptions
machine
learning
will
not
lead
to
a
runaway
government
as
a
series
of
technical
limitations
preclude
a
future
in
which
complete
regulatory
or
adjudicatory
power
can
be
ceded
to
autonomous
algorithms
over
which
humans
exert
little
control
when
used
thoughtfully
these
machine
learning
applications
should
not
offend
the
core
legal
foundations
of
the
regulatory
state
after
analyzing
the
administrative
law
implications
of
machine
learning
we
step
back
in
part
iii
to
reflect
on
the
policy
merits
of
applying
machine
learning
to
administrative
tasks
we
do
recognize
that
machine
learning
could
be
implemented
irresponsibly
in
ways
that
even
though
legal
might
still
offend
more
conventional
notions
of
good
government
n
as
with
any
tool
artificial
intelligence
could
be
misused
and
by
no
means
should
anyone
think
that
machine
learning
constitutes
a
panacea
for
government
the
use
of
machine
learning
in
specific
settings
and
for
particular
purposes
may
well
prove
inadvisable
once
all
things
are
considered
the
way
algorithms
are
used
will
matter
too
and
at
times
some
safeguards
may
need
to
be
implemented
to
ensure
consonance
with
the
broader
purposes
standing
behind
the
administrative
law
doctrines
we
consider
here
in
general
though
governmental
decision
making
in
the
machine
learning
era
can
and
in
appropriate
circumstances
should
take
advantage
of
the
enhanced
public
value
that
can
be
achieved
from
regulating
by
robot
and
adjudicating
by
algorithm
our
detailed
examination
of
the
legal
issues
and
policy
tradeoffs
leads
us
to
be
reasonably
optimistic
about
machine
learning
and
the
instrumental
role
it
can
play
in
making
a
more
promising
future
for
administrative
government
i
machine
learning
and
its
administrative
applications
some
of
the
most
prominent
examples
of
private
sector
growth
today
from
amazon
n
to
zillow
n
depend
on
the
use
of
machine
learning
to
optimize
production
processes
supply
chains
marketing
and
the
pricing
of
goods
and
services
machine
learning
undergirds
future
growth
across
a
wide
range
of
sectors
from
the
introduction
of
fintech
firms
in
the
financial
industry
n
to
advances
in
healthcare
delivery
via
precision
medicine
n
machine
learning
s
main
attraction
stems
from
how
well
it
outperforms
human
intelligence
n
as
private
firms
pursue
significant
efficiency
gains
through
the
kind
of
smarter
and
more
contextualized
decisions
made
possible
by
algorithmic
analysis
of
big
data
the
government
will
undoubtedly
need
to
follow
suit
not
merely
to
keep
up
with
new
risks
these
private
sector
uses
of
machine
learning
might
bring
but
also
to
improve
government
s
ability
to
address
a
host
of
existing
risks
and
regulatory
problems
n
machine
learning
promises
to
make
the
government
like
the
private
sector
smarter
and
more
efficient
in
this
part
we
introduce
machine
learning
and
discuss
how
government
agencies
are
already
beginning
to
explore
its
use
to
optimize
administrative
tasks
an
endeavor
that
is
likely
to
grow
both
in
size
and
scope
in
the
years
ahead
we
first
explain
what
machine
learning
is
and
describe
its
distinguishing
features
we
then
discuss
how
agencies
are
already
using
machine
learning
finally
we
show
how
this
technology
could
in
the
future
potentially
transform
the
administrative
state
through
what
we
call
rulemaking
by
robot
and
adjudicating
by
algorithm
a
what
is
machine
learning
fundamentally
machine
learning
algorithms
are
used
to
make
predictions
this
emphasis
on
prediction
contrasts
markedly
with
traditional
statistical
techniques
which
seek
to
model
underlying
data
generating
processes
in
the
real
world
although
traditional
statistical
techniques
can
also
generate
predictions
they
do
so
only
when
the
model
created
by
the
analyst
fits
well
with
the
underlying
processes
being
modeled
these
traditional
techniques
require
the
analyst
first
to
specify
a
mathematical
equation
expressing
an
outcome
variable
as
a
function
of
selected
explanatory
variables
put
together
in
a
particular
way
and
then
to
see
how
well
the
data
fit
with
the
analyst
s
choices
for
example
when
analysts
employ
the
traditional
techniques
of
ordinary
least
squares
regression
or
logistic
regression
they
specify
equations
that
represent
their
a
priori
beliefs
about
the
functional
relationships
that
exist
between
independent
or
explanatory
and
dependent
or
outcome
variables
what
regression
does
in
essence
is
estimate
the
magnitude
and
direction
of
these
relationships
between
the
two
types
of
variables
that
are
selected
and
specified
by
the
analyst
the
relationships
in
the
statistical
model
ostensibly
represent
the
relationships
in
the
real
world
which
is
why
regression
results
are
often
used
to
support
causal
inferences
by
contrast
machine
learning
is
nonparametric
in
that
it
does
not
require
the
researcher
to
specify
any
particular
functional
form
of
a
mathematical
model
in
advance
instead
these
algorithms
allow
the
data
themselves
to
dictate
how
information
contained
in
input
variables
is
put
together
to
forecast
the
value
of
an
output
variable
n
machine
learning
algorithms
do
not
generate
quite
the
same
kind
of
information
on
the
magnitude
or
direction
of
the
effects
that
might
be
associated
with
any
single
input
variable
on
the
output
variable
controlling
for
the
other
variables
the
functional
relationships
in
machine
learning
are
not
necessarily
the
complete
set
of
those
in
nature
s
true
data
generating
process
as
a
result
no
claim
can
be
made
that
the
machine
learning
process
represents
any
set
of
true
relationships
in
the
world
and
thus
none
of
the
causal
inferences
that
typically
characterize
statistical
modeling
can
be
applied
to
results
of
machine
learning
in
short
with
machine
learning
results
causal
relationships
between
inputs
and
outputs
may
simply
not
exist
no
matter
how
intuitive
such
relationships
might
look
on
the
surface
if
a
machine
learning
algorithm
tends
to
forecast
that
older
individuals
commit
fewer
crimes
than
younger
individuals
for
example
it
cannot
be
claimed
on
the
basis
of
the
machine
learning
process
that
older
age
causes
any
reduction
in
the
propensity
to
commit
crimes
n
nevertheless
from
a
technical
standpoint
machine
learning
s
distinctive
predictive
and
nonparametric
focus
turns
out
to
be
paramount
to
its
impressive
usefulness
in
generating
reliable
forecasts
also
of
central
importance
and
what
gives
machine
learning
its
name
is
how
such
algorithms
mathematically
learn
to
generate
their
predictions
there
are
many
machine
learning
algorithms
that
do
so
in
different
mathematical
ways
but
they
all
attempt
as
one
textbook
explains
to
optimize
a
performance
criterion
using
example
data
or
past
experience
n
in
other
words
these
algorithms
make
repeated
passes
through
data
sets
progressively
modifying
or
averaging
their
predictions
to
optimize
specified
criteria
to
illustrate
this
functioning
consider
a
common
application
of
machine
learning
that
has
proven
critical
to
improvements
in
the
government
s
handling
of
postal
mail
and
other
paperwork
processing
tasks
the
recognition
and
classification
of
handwritten
digits
n
in
this
simple
application
an
algorithm
s
performance
criterion
or
objective
function
is
classification
accuracy
that
is
how
often
it
correctly
recognizes
say
a
handwritten
number
two
as
a
two
to
perform
this
classification
an
algorithm
must
learn
what
aspects
of
a
handwritten
digit
make
it
likely
to
be
a
two
over
the
course
of
iterative
passes
through
the
data
such
an
algorithm
tries
to
use
many
different
mathematical
descriptions
of
shapes
as
well
as
relationships
of
shapes
in
the
pictures
of
handwritten
digits
to
make
its
classifications
if
a
particular
descriptive
method
is
optimal
the
algorithm
will
be
rewarded
with
a
low
error
rate
if
the
descriptions
are
not
optimal
the
algorithm
will
be
punished
with
a
high
error
rate
it
can
learn
for
example
that
a
handwritten
digit
is
likely
to
be
a
two
if
the
topmost
section
of
the
digit
depicted
is
semicircular
and
facing
downward
ultimately
the
algorithm
will
seek
to
make
classifications
based
on
mathematical
descriptions
of
shapes
that
yield
the
lowest
error
rates
n
this
handwriting
recognition
example
provides
an
illustration
of
machine
learning
algorithms
applied
to
classification
problems
where
the
goal
is
to
sort
objects
into
classes
but
classification
problems
represent
only
some
of
the
diverse
applications
of
machine
learning
techniques
machine
learning
algorithms
can
also
be
used
to
predict
numerical
values
such
as
house
prices
or
stock
market
index
values
endeavors
that
are
often
termed
regression
problems
n
they
also
can
be
applied
to
scenarios
such
as
playing
chess
where
an
algorithm
can
be
used
to
determine
the
optimal
sequence
of
actions
n
variety
in
the
types
of
machine
learning
algorithms
means
that
they
can
be
used
in
a
wide
variety
of
predictive
endeavors
admittedly
many
non
learning
techniques
have
long
been
used
to
pursue
these
same
endeavors
for
example
ordinary
least
squares
regression
can
estimate
numerical
outcomes
and
logistic
regression
is
commonly
used
as
a
binary
classifier
given
the
existence
of
these
alternative
statistical
techniques
what
advantages
do
machine
learning
algorithms
offer
put
simply
they
outperform
standard
procedures
in
terms
of
predictive
accuracy
and
statistical
efficiency
that
is
the
increased
ability
to
obtain
predictions
with
both
low
bias
and
low
variance
n
furthermore
many
phenomena
that
analysts
want
to
forecast
are
extraordinarily
complex
and
analysts
often
lack
the
a
priori
knowledge
necessary
to
specify
an
accurately
forecasting
conventional
model
by
eschewing
this
dependency
on
existing
knowledge
and
the
need
to
identify
the
functional
form
of
any
relationships
machine
learning
can
apply
to
a
wider
range
of
problems
and
yield
vastly
enhanced
accuracy
over
its
alternatives
whether
human
intuition
expert
judgment
or
traditional
statistical
techniques
n
learning
algorithms
can
also
adapt
more
dynamically
as
new
data
become
available
they
can
search
for
new
patterns
and
thereby
improve
forecasting
accuracy
although
machine
learning
algorithms
are
known
and
prized
for
their
accuracy
this
benefit
does
come
at
an
interpretive
cost
this
cost
is
frequently
invoked
by
references
to
machine
learning
algorithms
as
black
box
procedures
n
the
black
box
nature
of
machine
learning
holds
important
implications
for
administrative
law
so
to
understand
this
feature
of
machine
learning
consider
again
the
classification
of
handwritten
digits
we
said
that
an
algorithm
might
learn
that
certain
geometric
characteristics
of
the
shapes
of
handwritten
digits
are
useful
for
determining
which
digits
they
represent
yet
we
cannot
really
know
what
precise
characteristics
any
machine
learning
algorithm
is
keying
in
on
machine
learning
algorithms
transform
a
series
of
inputs
to
a
series
of
outputs
by
optimizing
a
performance
criterion
but
that
is
where
the
analyst
s
easy
ability
to
interpret
the
algorithms
workings
comes
to
an
end
the
user
of
an
algorithm
cannot
really
discern
which
particular
relationships
between
variables
factor
into
the
algorithm
s
classification
or
at
which
point
in
the
algorithm
they
do
nor
can
the
user
determine
how
exactly
the
algorithm
puts
together
various
relationships
to
yield
its
classifications
n
for
this
reason
machine
learning
algorithms
are
often
described
as
transforming
inputs
to
outputs
through
a
black
box
an
analyst
cannot
look
inside
the
black
box
to
understand
how
that
transformation
occurs
or
describe
the
relationships
with
the
same
intuitive
and
causal
language
often
applied
to
traditional
statistical
modeling
n
despite
this
interpretive
limitation
machine
learning
algorithms
have
been
implemented
widely
in
private
sector
settings
companies
desire
the
savings
in
costs
and
efficiency
gleaned
from
these
techniques
and
the
lack
of
intuitive
interpretability
is
of
little
concern
in
endeavors
where
accuracy
not
causality
is
the
valued
metric
netflix
for
instance

a
form
of
machine
learning
called
artificial
neural
networks
to
suggest
entertainment
options
to
its
customers

on
their
prior
viewing
habits

machine
learning
to

machine
learning
has
also
shown
great
utility
in
the
financial
sector
where
it
is
employed
to
predict
the
value
of
investments

financial
instruments
n
the
benefits
of
learning
algorithms
have
also
promoted
their
adoption
in
academic
research
in
disciplines
closely
connected
to
policymaking
where
predictive
accuracy
is
critical
for

embraced
machine
learning

machine
learning
applications
in
a
wide
variety
of
settings
are
already
actively
shaping
society
b
existing
administrative
applications
for
much
the
same
reason
that
machine
learning
has
been
exploited
in
the
private
sector
its
use
holds
potentially
great
value
to
government
agencies
we
have
already
noted
that
national
security

enforcement
agencies
are
starting
to
rely
on
machine
learning
to
support
functions
as
varied
as

crime

delivery
systems

have
also
begun
to
explore
uses
of
machine
learning
revealing
growing
recognition
of
its
promise
across
a
variety
of
policy
settings

at
all
levels
of
government
n
although
we
mainly
focus
in
this
article
on
the
use
of
machine
learning
by
the
federal

the
nation

have
received
much
attention
so
far
for
their
embrace
of

its
potential
to
improve
governmental

learning
came

of
thousands

also
to
make

more
readily
analyzable
one
example
can
be
found
in
the
creation
of
the

legal

development
n
having
such
a
unique
identifier

enhance

ability

identify

instantly
and
precisely
allowing
the

to
apply
machine

n
agencies
are
also
actively
working
toward
development
of
the
cloud
storage
systems
necessary
to
exploit
the
power
of
machine
learning
n
such
storage
that
takes
place
via
distributed
networks
of
computers
proves
to
be
better
suited
to
running
computationally
intensive
algorithms
and
its
availability
better
facilitates
interagency
sharing
of
big
data
the
fda
for
example
has
leveraged
cloud
computing
to
store
information
on
foodborne
pathogens
giving
the
agency
the
ongoing
simultaneous
capacity
to
collect
control
and
analyze
enormous
data
sets
n
similarly
the
epa
created
a
cross
agency
data
analytics

program
intended
to
foster
the
creation
of
databases
that
will
permit
the
analysis
of
data

many
different

the

implementing
cloud
computing
to
store

process
its
one
billion
daily

stamped
to

microsecond
allowing
the

to
perform

at
a
time
n
the
proliferation
of
such
efforts
to
capture
share
and
analyze
vast
quantities
of
data
makes
it
easy
to
envision
for
example
an
extension
of
the
sec
s
cloud
computing
program
that
would
eventually
allow
agency
computers
to
monitor
trading
activities
in
real
time
predicting
in
milliseconds
whether
a
financial
transaction
is
the
result
of
insider
trading
and
then
automatically
stopping
or
reversing
trades
based
on
those
predictions
n
with
these
various
efforts
underway
the
government
is
well
on
its
way
into
the
era
of
machine
learning
before
turning
to
the
legal
implications
of
this
new
era
we
next
develop
more
precisely
what
machine
learning
portends
for
government
agencies
and
why
its
use
might
raise
questions
under
prevailing
administrative
law
doctrines
c
adjudicating
by
algorithm
rulemaking
by
robot
what
exactly
might
be
problematic
about
an
era
in
which
government
embraces
machine
learning
up
to
this
point
in
our
discussion
perhaps
the
answer
will
not
be
obvious
were
it
not
for
dire
warnings
in
the
popular
press
of
impending
artificially
intelligent
oppression
it
might
seem
that
machine
learning
simply
represents
a
more
sophisticated
data
rich
and
predictively
useful
version
of
the
kind
of
analytic
methods
that
government
agencies
have
long
used
if
that
is
what
machine
learning
is
and
if
government
can
use
new
statistical
techniques
to
improve
its
performance
of
various
functions
from
weather
forecasting
to
identifying
potentially
hazardous
chemicals
then
presumably
a
machine
learning
era
in
government
should
not
only
be
completely
unproblematic
but
also
positively
encouraged
three
principal
properties
of
machine
learning
combine
however
to
distinguish
it
from
other
analytical
techniques
and
give
rise
to
potential
concerns
about
the
greater
reliance
on
machine
learning
by
governmental
authorities
the
first
is
machine
learning
s
self
learning
property
the
results
of
algorithms
do
not
depend
on
humans
specifying
in
advance
how
each
variable
is
to
be
factored
into
the
predictions
indeed
as
long
as
learning
algorithms
are
running
humans
are
not
really
controlling
how
they
are
combining
and
comparing
data
these
algorithms
effectively
look
for
patterns
on
their
own
the
second
key
property
is
machine
learning
s
black
box
nature
the
results
of
machine
learning
analysis
are
not
intuitively
explainable
and
cannot
support
causal
explanations
of
the
kind
that
underlie
the
reasons
traditionally
offered
to
justify
governmental
action
finally
machine
learning
as
with
other
computational
strategies
in
today
s
digital
era
can
be
fast
and
automatic
supporting
uses
in
which
the
algorithm
produces
results
that
can
shorten
or
potentially
bypass
human
deliberation
and
decision
making
all
three
of
these
factors
combine
to
make
machine
learning
techniques
appear
qualitatively
more
independent
from
humans
when
compared
to
other
statistical
techniques
to
illustrate
these
features
of
machine
learning
and
what
they
portend
for
government
consider
the
challenges
the
u
s
pipeline
and
hazardous
materials
safety
administration
phmsa
faces
in
deciding
how
to
allocate
limited
inspection
resources
to
oversee
the
many
thousands
of
miles
of
gas
oil
and
chemical
pipelines
throughout
the
united
states
major
leaks
as
well
as
explosions
from
leaky
pipelines
in
recent
years
have
made
palpable
the
significance
of
effective
governmental
oversight
of
pipeline
safety
n
in
recent
years
phmsa
has
explored
using
a
traditional
regression
approach
to
predict
risks
of
pipeline
accidents
and
decide
how
to
target
the
agency
s
inspections
n
although
such
an
attempt
to
engage
in
quantitative
decision
making
is
certainly
laudable
much
more
efficient
inspection
targeting
could
result
if
phmsa
generated
its
risk
predictions
using
machine
learning
this
could
be
possible
in
the
near
future
once
big
data
sets
are
shared
in
real
time
between
different
agencies
and
information
streams
could
be
provided
by
remote
sensing
technologies
instead
of
being
limited
to
analyzing
a
dozen
or
so
variables
that
phmsa
s
analysts
have
predetermined
should
be
included
in
their
regression
analysis
machine
learning
algorithms
could
work
their
way
through
massive
amounts
of
data
containing
hundreds
of
potentially
predictively
useful
variables
ranging
from
pipeline
operators
tax
returns
to
their
firms
workforce
diversity
the
resulting
predictions
of
pipeline
accident
risk
could
be
used
not
only
to
target
inspections
but
also
potentially
if
such
an
algorithm
could
be
supplied
with
real
time
data
from
remote
sensors
to
order
preemptive
shutdowns
of
pipeline
segments
that
the
algorithm
predicts
are
at
risk
of
imminent
failure
to
the
extent
that
modern
pipeline
systems
are
equipped
with
computerized
remote
shut
off
capabilities
a
machine
learning
algorithm
could
even
be
programmed
to
send
an
automatic
order
to
pipeline
operator
s
system
calling
for
an
immediate
automatic
shutdown
of
a
section
of
pipeline
based
on
real
time
forecasts
produced
by
machine
learning
all
potentially
without
any
human
intervention
machine
learning
is
well
suited
for
automating
these
kinds
of
decisions
given
its
emphasis
on
accuracy
and
the
government
s
overwhelming
need
to
use
its
limited
resources
to
prevent
dangers
from
arising
but
notice
that
a
shift
to
a
machine
learning
approach
in
this
context
could
come
along
with
some
qualitative
loss
of
human
involvement
under
machine
learning
phmsa
analysts
would
no
longer
predetermine
which
variables
should
be
included
in
the
agency
s
risk
models
indeed
they
would
not
even
create
any
risk
models
at
all
in
the
sense
of
building
equations
specifying
exactly
how
various
variables
might
impact
pipeline
risk
machine
learning
also
does
not
afford
a
ready
means
of
explaining
why
any
section
of
pipeline
should
be
inspected
or
shut
down
the
computerized
nature
of
machine
learning
also
means
that
it
can
automate
decisions
currently
made
by
humans
such
as
the
dispatching
of
inspectors
or
even
the
inspections
themselves
it
is
not
difficult
to
imagine
a
future
in
which
a
machine
learning
system
based
in
phmsa
s
headquarters
in
washington
d
c
could
be
used
to
automatically
dispatch
agency
drones
distributed
throughout
the
country
having
them
fly
over
sections
of
pipeline
to
take
video
images
or
collect
air
quality
samples
thereby
removing
altogether
the
need
to
send
human
inspectors
to
the
scene
admittedly
even
with
this
potential
future
scenario
in
mind
it
still
might
not
be
self
evident
why
machine
learning
may
be
problematic
after
all
machines
have
long
supported
governmental
functions
in
the
administrative
state
although
not
flown
by
drones
machines
currently
collect
air
quality
samples
in
a
network
of
fixed
sites
around
the
country
informing
state
and
federal
environmental
regulatory
decision
making
n
moreover
when
it
comes
to
inspecting
potentially
hazardous
sites
eliminating
the
need
for
humans
to
enter
high
risk
areas
should
surely
be
a
positive
advance
not
a
reason
for
alarm
n
furthermore
decisions
about
the
allocation
of
inspection
resources
have
long
been
treated
as
a
matter
of
well
accepted
law
as
falling
entirely
within
an
agency
s
discretion
n
if
agencies
can
legally
allocate
inspection
resources
by
the
flip
of
a
coin
that
is
sending
inspectors
to
sites
at
random
as
some
agencies
do
then
they
should
be
able
legally
to
rely
on
more
sophisticated
algorithms
that
deploy
scarce
inspection
resources
automatically
but
more
efficiently
n
for
this
reason
we
foresee
comparatively
little
resistance
as
a
matter
of
law
to
applications
of
machine
learning
that
aim
to
make
more
efficient
use
of
scarce
inspection
resources
many
uses
of
machine
learning
by
administrative
agencies
will
be
like
the
use
of
machine
learning
to
decide
where
to
send
inspectors
in
that
they
will
inform
actions
committed
to
agency
discretion
most
of
these
uses
will
be
unproblematic
from
the
standpoint
of
administrative
law
n
surely
the
u
s
postal
service
s
reliance
on
machine
learning
algorithms
to
sort
mail
hardly
constitutes
any
grave
threat
to
society
either
existential
or
constitutional
in
addition
even
when
agency
officials
use
learning
algorithms
to
support
actions
that
are
not
committed
to
agency
discretion
if
they
use
them
simply
to
inform
their
own
independent
judgments
this
too
should
be
unremarkable
such
use
would
be
indistinguishable
from
any
other
research
support
or
informational
input
into
agency
decision
making
the
non
shaded
parts
of
table
highlight
several
general
types
of
agency
uses
of
machine
learning
that
should
easily
be
viewed
as
beyond
reproach
at
least
from
the
standpoint
of
existing
general
principles
of
structural
law
governing
the
administrative
state
the
domains
in
which
machine
learning
might
be
of
concern
at
least
as
a
prima
facie
matter
will
be
those
in
which
artificial
intelligence
is
used
more
for
determining
rather
than
just
supporting
decisions
that
are
not
otherwise
committed
to
agency
discretion
by
law
as
shown
in
the
shaded
portions
of
table
that
leaves
two
important
realms
in
which
machine
learning
could
be
incorporated
into
the
administrative
state
adjudicating
by
algorithm
and
rulemaking
by
robot
n
one
example
of
adjudicating
by
algorithm
would
be
our
posited
phmsa
pipeline
safety
machine
learning
system
that
automatically
issues
shut
off
orders
when
the
system
forecasts
a
heightened
risk
it
is
not
difficult
to
imagine
other
examples
of
adjudicatory
decisions
that
could
be
automated
by
algorithms
n
especially
when
the
relevant
criteria
for
an
adjudicatory
action
are
forward
looking
and
thus
dependent
on
accurate
predictions
at
some
point
for
example
the
faa
might
be
able
to
license
pilots
through
an
entirely
automated
process
relying
on
risk
based
machine
learning
forecasts
of
individual
applicants
overall
level
of
safety
n
the
federal
trade
commission
or
the
department
of
justice
s
antitrust
division
might
conceivably
come
to
rely
on
machine
learning
to
predict
what
effects
a
proposed
merger
would
have
on
future
competition
and
market
pricing
perhaps
entirely
automating
the
antitrust
review
process
table
applications
of
machine
learning
in
the
administrative
state
when
it
comes
to
rulemaking
by
robot
we
need
not
rely
entirely
on
the
imagination
the
city
of
los
angeles
current
traffic
signaling
system
illustrates
a
very
simple
but
still
real
world
application
of
rulemaking
by
robot
although
deciding
the
color
of
traffic
lights
may
seem
like
a
trivial
example
a
traffic
signal
does
determine
what
rule
applies
to
anyone
who
wants
to
drive
along
a
city
street
at
a
given
period
of
time
yet
with
the
system
in
place
in
los
angeles
just
as
no
human
determines
when
a
traffic
light
should
be
red
or
green
no
government
official
can
really
explain
why
the
city
s
machine
learning
system
sets
any
given
traffic
light
that
is
rule
when
it
does
we
can
expect
it
will
not
be
long
before
more
government
authorities
at
the
local
and
federal
levels
will
be
able
to
develop
similar
systems
in
their
own
domains
that
are
conceptually
equivalent
to
los
angeles
traffic
control
system
it
is
not
difficult
to
imagine
more
complex
and
consequential
examples
of
regulating
by
robot
consider

are
forward
looking

they
also
involve

requires
making

conduct

tells
these

of
the

machine

cannot
directly
make

about
these
different
aspects

s
content
not
only
because
some
of
these
choices
are
normative
ones

also
because

are
merely
predictive
and
thus
unable
to
overlay
causal
interpretations
on
the

between

the
justification
for
new
rules
depends
after
all
on
the

are
likely
to
cause

nevertheless
it
may
be
possible
for
machine

agent
based
modeling
refers
to
the
use
of
an
algorithm
consisting
of
a
mathematically
defined
environment
that
includes
agents
that
observe
the
overall
environment
and
take
actions
designed
to
reach
a
specified
goal
n
multi
agent
systems
are
similar
to
agent
based
models
but
with
multiple
autonomous
agents
interacting
with
each
other
n
with
either
of
these
agent
based
techniques
the
agents
which
in
the
rulemaking
context
would
include
the
regulator
and
the
regulated
entities
must
have
some
defined
decision
making
processes
that
allow
them
to
translate
observations
of
the
environment
into
actions
these
decision
making
processes
can
be
specified
a
priori
by
the
researcher
or
regulatory
official
but
such
a

knowledge
often
does
not
exist
or
is
not
sophisticated
enough
to
mimic
how
real

agents
make
their

machine

called

how
the

osha
might
proceed
if
it
were
to
create
an
automated
process
for
determining
whether
to
implement
a
new
workplace
safety
regulation
osha
could
implement
an
algorithm
in
which
the
modeled
agents
are
the
employers
being
regulated
the
environment
in
which
these
agents
operate
would
include
mathematically
specified
factors
capable
of
influencing
agent
behavior
including
a
possible
regulation
the
employer
agents
in
the
model
would
observe
the
environment
which
would
include
different
regulatory
alternatives
including
an
environment
with
no
regulation
and
then
take
actions
such
as
complying
with
the
regulation
to
reach
their
own
goals
perhaps
defined
as
profit
maximization
now
although
osha
would
like
to
use
this
agent
based
model
to
see
how
employers
respond
to
the
potential
new
regulation
and
consequently
what
effects
the
regulation
may
have
osha
does
not
know
a
priori
how
employers
will
decide
how
to
respond
to
any
regulation
the
agent
based
model
would
therefore
use
a
machine
learning
technique
to
select
employers
optimal
responses
to
the
regulation
given
their
profit
maximization
goal
this
example
suggests
how
osha
might
use
machine
learning
embedded
within
an
agent
based
model
of
the
effects
of
a
proposed
regulation
but
the
techniques
real
potential
to
inform
the
content
of
regulations
comes
from
the
ability
of
osha
to
include
an
agent
representing
itself
in
the
abm
this
mathematically
represented
agent
would
issue
multiple
different
possible
regulations
formulated
in
advance
by
human
programmers
and
then
select
the
regulatory
alternative
that
yields
those
effects
as
defined
in
relation
to
observable
components
of
the
environment
that
maximize
an
objective
function

goal
established
by
the

osha
the
possible
regulations
analyzed
in
this
fashion
could
assume
any

of

targets

consequences
with
the
forecasted
effect
of
these
regulations
on
the
actions
of
regulated
entities
being
observed
through
the
modeling
exercise
unlike
in
the
adjudicatory
context
where
machine
learning
directly
makes
individualized
forecasts
and
where
an
adjudication
can
be
determined
simply
by
whether
an
algorithm
forecasts
risks
or
other
outcomes
above
a
threshold
level
in
the
rulemaking
context
machine
learning
would
need
to
be
nested
within
a
larger
decision
making

to
support
automated
regulatory
decisions
machine
learning
predictions
would
within
an
agent
based
simulation
inform
agents
actions
which
in

would
generate
predicted
outcomes
from
different
regulatory
permutations
this
fusion
of
agent
based
or
multi
agent
models
with
machine
learning
may
hold
great
potential
for
assisting
in
certain
kinds
of
rulemaking
but
even
with
this
fusion
governmental
reliance
on
algorithms
would
still
not
cede
entirely
the
involvement
of
humans
as
already
indicated
at
a
foundational
level
humans
will
still
need
to
choose
and
then
input
into
embedded
machine
learning
systems
the
data
as
well
as
overarching
goals
to
be
maximized
and
constraints
to
be
minimized
moreover
due
to
data
limitations
as
well
as
core
uncertainties
many
rulemaking
decisions
will
still
by
necessity
call
for
human
judgment
and
thus
be
incapable
of
automation
as
with
any
statistical
technique
the
algorithms
that
could
be
embedded
in
automated
rulemaking
models
will
require
data
because
all
historical
data
arise
within
a
world
with
a
different
rule
than
the
one
proposed
even
if
that
is
no
rule
at
all
regulators
will
seldom
if
ever
find
enough
data
to
correspond
to
all
possible
forms
a
future
regulation
and
resulting
environmental
state
might
take
this
is
often
a
challenge
in
applications
of
agent
based
models
in
other
contexts
such
as
healthcare
provision
in
those
other
contexts
the
lack
of
data
is
often
addressed
through
the
creation
of
simulated
environmental
data
n
generation
of
simulated
data
however
requires
that
the
architecture
of
the
environment
being
modeled
and
the
relationships
between
components
of
that
environment
be
sufficiently
well
known
a
priori
as
to
be
specifiable
embedded
machine
learning
techniques
have
been
successfully
developed
for
applications
like
modeling
how
infectious
patients
should
be
moved
around
a
hospital
n
in
that
context
the
environment
of
interest
can
be
reasonably
well
specified
the
actors
and
parameters
are
limited
for
example
healthcare
professionals
infected
patients
uninfected
patients
and
rooms
and
the
analyst
knows
a
priori
enough
about
how
diseases
are
transmitted
to
generate
simulated
data
using
probabilities
of
infection
based
on
proximity
and
time
spent
near
infected
patients
this
kind
of
a
priori
knowledge
would
seem
to
be
less
likely
to
exist
in
the
more
complex
or
uncertain
situations
that
many
regulators
address
where
the
relevant
causal
relationships
do
not
stem
from
processes
as
law
like
as
biological
disease
transmission
if
the
system
being
modeled
is
extremely
complex
as
with
many
forms
of
regulation
whether
of
complex
financial
instruments
or
advanced
industrial
operations
n
the
regulator
may
not
know
enough
about
the
underlying
causal
architecture
to
generate
simulated
environmental
data
bearing
any
resemblance
to
real
world
data
of
course
despite
these
difficulties
the
conditions
for
using
embedded
machine
learning
for
rulemaking
may
still
sometimes
exist
in
a
comment
letter
to
the
sec
for
example
academic
and
business
experts
in
agent
based
modeling
and
financial
markets
have
advocated
the
use
of
such
models
in
regulating
equity
markets
arguing
that
algorithms
in
this
context
would
be
sufficiently
specifiable
n
although
we
take
no
position
on
these
specific
claims
we
raise
them
to
suggest
the
plausibility
of
using
embedded
machine
learning
to
automate
the
process
of
selecting
and
designing
regulations
in
some
settings
agency
officials
will
need
to
determine
the
applicability
of
any
embedded
machine
learning
rulemaking
tool
on
a
case
by
case
basis
our
point
is
to
show
that
even
if
many
applications
of
machine
learning
will
be
completely
benign
as
a
matter
of
administrative
law
agencies
may
soon
be
able
for
the
first
time
to
set
the
content
of
certain
types
of
rules
by
automated
artificial
intelligence
techniques
whether
in
making
individualized
forecasts
or
in
feeding
into
more
generalized
modeling
results
machine
learning
algorithms
have
the
potential
to
transform
key
governmental
functions
in
ways
that
not
only
augment
human
judgment
but
replace
it
with
automated
algorithmic
analysis
for
some
observers
this
prospect
will
trigger
loud
alarm
bells
of
the
kind
set
off
by
the
use
of
artificial
intelligence
more
generally
at
a
minimum
the
prospect
of
either
robotic
rulemaking
or
algorithmic
adjudication
raises
important
questions
about
whether
such
automated
techniques
can
be
squared
with
core
principles
of
constitutional
and
administrative
law
ii
the
legality
of
machine
learning
in
the
administrative
state
as
government
agencies
continue
on
the
path
toward
increased
reliance
on
machine
learning
in
administrative
decision
making
public
officials
lawyers
and
scholars
will
confront
choices
about
whether
to
encourage
or
constrain
this
technology
making
these
choices
will
depend
at
least
in
the
first
instance
on
assessing
how
agency
use
of
machine
learning
would
conform
to
the
cornerstones
of
constitutional
and
administrative
law
principles
of
nondelegation
due
process
antidiscrimination
and
transparency
n
these
core
legal
principles
against
which
we
assess
machine
learning
in
this
part
present
issues
that
arise
from
the
mathematical
distinctiveness
of
machine
learning
in
particular
its
self
learning
black
box
and
automated
properties
especially
when
machine
learning
is
used
to
determine
outcomes
that
are
judicially
reviewable
its
properties
combine
to
surface
some
first
order
questions
stemming
from
a
legal
system
that
has
been
historically
premised
on
the
existence
of
governmental
decision
makers
who
are
human
beings
our
answers
to
the
legal
questions
presented
in
this
part
must
by
necessity
assume
a
degree
of
generality
machine
learning
is
not
a
singular
entity
with
one
prescribed
method
of
implementation
so
we
cannot
pretend
to
offer
a
definitive
legal
analysis
of
all
possible
applications
of
artificial
intelligence
in
the
administrative
process
how
machine
learning
will
come
to
be
used
in
particular
contexts
by
particular
agencies
will
no
doubt
prove
pivotal
to
determining
its
legality
under
certain
doctrines
neither
the
technique
of
machine
learning
nor
its
uses
are
completely
uniform
even
while
sharing
general
properties
and
even
some
of
those
general
properties
are
far
from
absolute
still
learning
algorithms
do
exhibit
to
a
sufficient
degree
some
core
features
that
make
it
possible
to
offer
some
overarching
conclusions
for
example
even
though
algorithms
can
learn
on
their
own
and
support
automated
decisions
humans
still
must
decide
how
algorithms
are
specified
deployed
and
integrated
into
broader
administrative
processes
machine
learning
algorithms
are
thus
autonomous
only
in
the
sense
that
they
can
run
continuously
and
have
the
potential
to
translate
their
outputs
automatically
into
regulatory
actions
n
they
do
not
set
their
own
objective
functions
nor
are
they
completely
outside
human
control
an
algorithm
by
its
very
definition
must
have
its
parameters
and
uses
specified
by
humans
and
this
property
will
likely
prove
pivotal
in
the
legal
assessment
of
specific
applications
of
artificial
intelligence
by
federal
administrative
agencies
a
nondelegation
military
weapons
systems
driven
by
algorithms
raise
serious
concerns
because
with
these
systems
decisions
possessing
life
and
death
consequences
may
no
longer
be
made
directly
by
humans
n
for
similar
reasons
concerns
could
be
raised
about
administrative
agencies
use
of
artificial
intelligence
although
officials
at
administrative
agencies
do
not
fire
missiles
they
are
responsible
for
choices
that
can
carry
equally
important
consequences
such
as
determining
the
safety
of
food
water
and
drugs
if
concerns
exist
over
delegating
too
much
control
to
non
humans
in
the
military
context
then
perhaps
at
least
a
prima
facie
case
exists
against
the
use
of
algorithms
to
make
administrative
and
regulatory
decisions
the
u
s
constitution
provides
that
a
ll
legislative
powers
of
the
federal
government
shall
be
vested
in
congress
n
courts
have
long
accepted
that
congress
can
within
limits
delegate
authority
to
administrative
agencies
headed
by
appointed
officers
who
although
unelected
are
overseen
in
various
ways
by
members
of
congress
and
the
president
n
yet
the
nondelegation
doctrine
still
a
fixture
in
american
constitutional
and
administrative
law
places
some
theoretical
limits
on
those
delegations
which
must
for
example
be
accompanied
by
an
intelligible
principle
although
this
doctrine
has
long
accepted
even
broad
delegations
of
authority
to
administrative
agencies
the
law
has
always
assumed
that
the
recipient
of
that
authority
would
be
a
human
being
such
as
an
officer
of
the
united
states
or
on
occasion
a
private
individual
or
group
of
individuals
as
machine
learning
becomes
more
advanced
and
government
agencies
use
it
more
extensively
decision
making
authority
could
effectively
become
delegated
still
further
to
computerized
algorithms
yet
if
government
actions
should
be
undertaken
by
humans
then
delegation
to
autonomously
learning
machines
could
potentially
transfer
governmental
power
outside
the
bounds
that
the
constitution
permits
such
an
objection
under
the
nondelegation
doctrine
has
never
been
squarely
contemplated
under
previous
judicial
rulings
but
it
bears
clear
conceptual
affinity
with
the
spirit
and
tradition
of
the
nondelegation
doctrine
the
underlying
concern
is
the
same
the
improper
transfer
of
legislative
authority
given
that
the
nondelegation
doctrine
has
traditionally
governed
the
granting
of
authority
by
congress
to
agencies
we
confront
two
possible
scenarios
the
first
assumes
that
congress
has
granted
authority
to
an
agency
to
deploy
machine
learning
algorithms
to
make
administrative
decisions
the
second
is
a
scenario
in
which
congress
has
delegated
some
kind
of
administrative
authority
to
the
head
of
an
agency
in
a
conventional
manner
but
the
relevant
agency
official
then
seeks
out
and
relies
upon
a
machine
learning
system
to
exercise
that
authority
we
will
address
both
of
these
possible
situations
in
turn
even
though
the
second
scenario
might
be
the
one
that
is
more
likely
to
arise
in
practice
given
that
statutes
have
not
been
drafted
with
algorithmic
administration
in
mind
however
the
second
scenario
raises
different
even
if
related
questions
of
statutory
interpretation
namely
whether
a
statute
granting
an
agency
certain
governmental
authority
precludes
the
agency
from
subdelegating
its
decision
making
to
machine
learning
algorithms
n
we
will
put
such
a
statutory
question
to
the
side
initially
focusing
on
the
first
scenario
in
which
congress
delegates
authority
to
agencies
to
regulate
by
robot
this
scenario
allows
us
to
focus
directly
on
the
constitutional
question
raised
by
what
justice
mariano
florentino
cu
llar
has
dubbed
the
problem
of
cyberdelegation
n
cyberdelegation
the
answer
to
the
constitutional
question
of
cyberdelegation
should
not
be
difficult
and
not
merely
because
the
nondelegation
doctrine
has
been
widely
recognized
to
have
had
only
one
good
year
n
a
congressional
authorization
of
rulemaking
by
robot
should
not
offend
the
nondelegation
doctrine
because
presumably
such
an
authorization
would
be
made
with
the
understanding
that
algorithmic
policy
determinations
depend
inherently
on
well
specified
objective
functions
it
seems
unlikely
that
any
congress
that
would
expressly
contemplate
the
use
of
artificial
intelligence
by
agencies
would
not
also
include
in
legislation
authorizing
such
use
a
sufficiently
intelligible
principle
that
would
satisfy
the
demands
of
the
nondelegation
doctrine
under
this
doctrine
rulemaking
authority
can
be
delegated
to
agencies
only
if
congress
provides
in
its
authorizing
legislation
an
intelligible
principle
channeling
and
constraining
the
exercise
of
that
delegated
authority
n
as
every
lawyer
today
knows
the
level
of
intelligibility
demanded
by
the
courts
has
hardly
been
substantial
the
courts
have
recognized
that
agencies
can
be
delegated
power
under
broad
general
directives
n
that
facilitate
governmental
efficacy
in
our
increasingly
complex
society
replete
with
ever
changing
and
more
technical
problems
n
as
a
result
congress
must
delegate
in
ways
delineat
ing
the
general
policy
the
public
agency
which
is
to
apply
it
and
the
boundaries
of
this
delegated
authority
n
courts
have
even
upheld
delegations
of
authority
directing
explicitly
only
that
agencies
must
act
in
the
public
interest
n
to
say
that
an
intelligible
principle
must
guide
agency
actions
is
to
say
that
those
actions
must
be
aligned
with
a
goal
or
in
mathematical
terms
a
type
of
objective
function
an
objective
function
is
an
essential
prerequisite
for
the
use
of
machine
learning
and
it
will
by
necessity
provide
sufficient
intelligibility
to
withstand
the
test
embedded
in
the
nondelegation
doctrine
if
a
goal
as
broad
and
qualitative
as
acting
in
the
public
interest
is
legally
sufficient
then
goals
defined
in
precise
quantifiable
and
measurable
ways
must
be
so
as
well
a
congress
that
deliberately
contemplated
and
authorized
an
agency
to
use
machine
learning
would
presumably
also
understand
the
need
to
provide
guidance
about
the
necessary
objective
function
for
algorithms
to
optimize
and
it
would
be
more
likely
than
usual
to
articulate
a
sufficiently
clear
set
of
goals
that
would
pass
the
intelligibility
muster
what
about
the
recipients
of
the
authority
to
whom
congress
delegates
typically
these
recipients
have
been
agency
officials
but
on
occasion
congress
has
tried
to
delegate
certain
kinds
of
authority
to
private
actors
when
congress
has
delegated
lawmaking
power
to
private
entities
the
supreme
court
has
declared
such
arrangements
to
be
legislative
delegation
in
its
most
obnoxious
form
n
the
court
s
disapproval
of
congressional
authorization
of
private
decision
making
with
legal
implications
raises
a
key
question
about
the
possibility
of
congressional
authorization
of
algorithmic
decision
making
if
delegating
outside
the
government
to
the
private
sector
is
so
disfavored
then
presumably
a
delegation
of
rulemaking
authority
still
further
not
even
to
a
human
being
but
to
a
machine
would
seem
more
extreme
and
objectionable
we
think
courts
would
be
unlikely
to
equate
delegation
to
machines
with
delegation
to
private
individuals
or
entities
for
three
reasons
first
machine
learning
algorithms
lack
the
essence
of
what
makes
a
delegation
to
private
individuals
so
obnoxious
the
self
interest
of
those
private
parties
private
parties
have
their
own
biases
and
interests
that
lead
them
to
make
privately
optimal
decisions
that
may
not
be
socially
optimal
n
by
contrast
what
machine
learning
algorithms
will
optimize
are
the
objectives
that
those
deploying
them
specify
should
be
optimized
as
long
as
this
specification
is
done
by
authorized
government
officials
the
concerns
about
bias
or
self
interest
that
animate
the
constitutional
prohibition
on
delegations
to
the
private
sector
should
not
exist
second
even
when
they
rely
on
machine
learning
human
governmental
officials
will
retain
ultimate
control
over
the
specification
of
algorithms
and
the
translation
of
their
outputs
to
regulatory
actions
that
the
government
maintains
such
a
level
of
direction
and
control
has
made
it
sufficient
for
courts
to
uphold
delegations
to
private
parties
as
long
as
a
private
party
s
participation
in
rulemaking
falls
short
of
possessing
the
ultimate
decisional
control
courts
have
allowed
delegations
to
the
private
sector
the
supreme
court
has
deemed
constitutional
for
example
legislation
providing
industry
with
a
role
in
policymaking
by
a
government
commission
because
private
firms
only
function
ed
subordinately
to
the
commission
n
more
generally
the
court
has
permitted
delegation
to
private
parties
when
their
actions
are
limited
to
advisory
decisions
rather
than
ones
that
are
binding
on
others
n
the
kind
of
rulemaking
by
robot
that
we
described
in
section
i
c
and
even
just
the
phrase
rulemaking
by
robot
might
at
first
glance
suggest
a
role
for
machines
that
exceeds
the
limits
established
for
delegations
to
private
entities
yet
even
though
machine
learning
systems
are
more
autonomous
from
humans
than
are
conventional
statistical
techniques
their
autonomy
is
still
far
from
the
constitutionally
impermissible
kind
even
if
rulemaking
were
to
be
fully
automated
the
underlying
algorithms
just
to
function
correctly
must
still
be
so
well
specified
that
important
discretion
would
remain
with
the
human
creators
and
overseers
of
the
algorithms
as
previously
discussed
algorithms
could
not
themselves
craft
regulatory
content
de
novo
humans
must
specify
the
targets
commands
and
consequences
of
potential
rules
from
which
an
embedded
machine
learning
system
might
choose
the
best
n
more
importantly
humans
can
at
any
time
choose
to
reject
a
machine
chosen
rule
alter
an
algorithm
s
specifications
or
even
pull
the
plug
on
the
system
entirely
if
nothing
else
as
long
as
rules
need
to
be
officially
signed
or
approved
by
a
human
official
then
humans
will
retain
ultimate
control
n
finally
although
algorithms
can
act
faster
than
humans
which
might
imply
a
lack
of
control
ultimately
algorithms
are
mere
measurement
tools
which
the
courts
widely
accept
as
legally
permissible
the
objection
of
course
would
be
that
humans
cannot
as
a
practical
matter
exercise
meaningful
control
over
automated
rulemaking
systems
in
high
speed
settings
in
these
and
perhaps
other
situations
it
may
simply
not
be
practical
for
human
officials
to
monitor
algorithms
output
in
real
time
and
exercise
their
abilities
to
approve
or
reject
rules
or
even
pull
the
plug
on
the
system
these
officials
would
of
course
still
retain
the
ability
to
disable
or
modify
a
rulemaking
by
robot
system
retroactively
although
it
might
be
reasonable
in
some
circumstances
to
demand
more
than
retroactive
review
in
most
instances
automated
artificial
intelligence
systems
once
constructed
by
humans
will
typically
function
as
legally
permissible
measurement
tools
in
prometheus
radio
project
v
fcc
the
fcc
relied
on
a
private
company
arbitron
to
measure
local
radio
station
audiences
and
these
measurements
provided
critical
inputs
to
rules
on
station
ownership
that
were
required
to
serve
the
public
interest
in
part
by
ensuring
competition
n
the
court
ruled
that
reliance
on
arbitron
was
not
an
unconstitutional
delegation
of
legislative
power
noting
arbitron
will
only
provide
a
mechanism
for
measuring
market
concentration
because
the
commission
remains
the
sole
arbiter
of
whether
a
proposed
radio
station
combination
serves
the
public
interest
no
improper
delegation
will
occur
n
thus
because
the
commission
specified
the
kind
of
rule
whether
an
ownership
pattern
is
legal
and
the
goal
to
be
served
by
the
rule
a
radio
station
combination
ensuring
diversity
and
competition
sufficient
to
serve
the
public
interest
private
parties
were
allowed
to
control
the
methods
used
to
measure
diversity
and
competition
and
provide
measurements
that
were
then
translated
into
rules
analogously
if
an
agency
creates
an
embedded
machine
learning
system
by
supplying
the
possible
rule
options
and
the
objective
function
the
implementation
of
an
algorithm
that
maximizes
that
objective
function
and
immediately
promulgates
the
resulting
rule
should
be
sustained
against
nondelegation
objections
because
it
is
functionally
serving
just
as
a
measurement
tool
from
the
standpoint
of
the
nondelegation
doctrine
the
use
of
machine
learning
is
not
conceptually
any
different
than
the
constitutional
use
of
other
machines
or
instruments
when
fda
officials
use
measuring
devices
like
thermometers
to
determine
the
optimal
temperature
at
which
to
store
fish
they
are
no
more
delegating
impermissibly
to
those
devices
than
if
they
were
to
rely
on
machine
learning
algorithms
for
these
reasons
not
only
would
legislation
authorizing
machine
learning
applications
be
unlikely
to
offend
the
intelligible
principle
requirement
it
also
should
not
constitute
a
prohibited
delegation
of
authority
to
an
entity
outside
of
government
cyberdelegation
might
well
look
somewhat
novel
but
it
is
not
unlike
government
reliance
on
measurement
devices
and
thus
unlikely
to
exceed
constitutional
constraints
on
the
delegation
of
governing
authority
statutory
subdelegation
having
concluded
that
congressional
authorization
of
rulemaking
by
robot
is
unlikely
to
offend
the
nondelegation
doctrine
we
return
to
the
issue
of
subdelegation
we
noted
at
the
outset
of
this
section
that
the
subdelegation
issue
involves
in
the
first
instance
answering
a
statutory
interpretation
question
specifically
would
an
agency
head
s
reliance
on
machine
learning
algorithms
exceed
authority
delegated
by
congress
via
statutory
language
specifically
authorizing
the
administrator
or
the
secretary
to
act
it
should
be
evident
that
for
reasons
similar
to
those
we
have
just
presented
about
delegations
to
private
entities
subdelegations
to
machines
pose
no
categorical
legal
concerns
administrators
do
not
exceed
their
statutory
authority
by
relying
on
thermometers
or
other
measurement
devices
nor
do
they
transgress
their
statutory
authority
by
relying
on
aides
and
subordinate
officials
because
ultimate
decision
making
authority
in
such
cases
is
never
completely
or
irrevocably
subdelegated
given
administrators
need
to
endorse
or
their
ability
to
override
what
their
subordinates
do
n
the
same
would
be
true
of
reliance
on
machine
learning
algorithms
despite
demonstrating
that
regulating
by
robot
is
unlikely
to
violate
the
nondelegation
doctrine
our
analysis
should
not
of
course
be
taken
to
imply
that
agency
actions
will
never
be
struck
down
on
grounds
related
to
delegation
delegations
for
example
may
be
constrained
by
how
much
judicial
deference
courts
give
to
agencies
interpretations
of
ambiguous
statutes
admittedly
chevron
n
deference
would
appear
to
be
considerable
as
courts
are
generally
instructed
to
defer
to
agencies
reasonable
interpretations
of
ambiguous
statutes
n
for
this
reason
we
find
it
difficult
to
see
how
an
agency
s
decision
to
use
machine
learning
even
if
central
to
an
agency
s
statutory
construction
could
rise
to
the
level
of
unreasonableness
typically
required
for
courts
to
reject
agency
interpretations
nonetheless
given
that
judges
have
yet
to
face
robotic
rulemaking
processes
like
those
we
described
in
section
i
c
there
remains
a
possibility
that
they
may
in
certain
situations
view
administrative
algorithms
with
a
particular
aversion
furthermore
given
what
seems
to
be
a
growing
currency
of
arguments
that
courts
have
been
overly
or
inappropriately
deferential
to
agencies
n
the
possibility
of
future
changes
in
deference
standards
cannot
be
overlooked
it
is
also
possible
of
course
for
congress
in
the
future
simply
to
prohibit
an
agency
or
perhaps
all
agencies
from
subdelegating
to
automated
systems
based
on
machine
learning
algorithms
despite
these
future
possibilities
arising
on
statutory
grounds
or
potential
changes
to
the
chevron
doctrine
when
it
comes
to
the
core
constitutional
question
we
do
not
foresee
delegation
considerations
posing
any
substantial
legal
hurdle
to
regulatory
applications
of
machine
learning
b
due
process
if
the
prospect
of
rulemaking
by
robot
might
animate
concerns
about
the
nondelegation
doctrine
the
prospect
of
adjudicating
by
algorithm
will
no
doubt
raise
due
process
concerns
administrative
agencies
after
all
are
expected
to
provide
adequate
procedural
due
process
when
taking
actions
that
could
deprive
individuals
or
entities
of
protected
liberty
interests
or
property
rights
and
entitlements
n
these
deprivations
can
occur
whenever
agencies
exercise
their
adjudicatory
authority
such
as
when
the
epa
orders
businesses
to
engage
in
the
costly
cleanup
of
hazardous
waste
for
which
they
are
deemed
responsible
n
or
the
social
security
administration
terminates
financial
payments
of
governmental
benefits
to
individuals
deemed
to
be
no
longer
eligible
n
in
the
machine
learning
era
would
an
agency
s
reliance
on
an
automated
machine
learning
system
to
make
such
adjudicatory
decisions
constitute
a
violation
of
an
individual
s
constitutional
right
to
due
process
as
we
noted
at
the
outset
of
this
part
much
will
turn
on
how
machine
learning
is
used
and
how
adjudications
by
algorithm
are
conducted
machine
learning
systems
could
be
used
as
discussed
in
section
i
c
simply
to
generate
inferences
that
constitute
but
one
of
several
inputs
into
an
independent
judgment
made
by
human
officials
or
they
could
be
used
to
make
automatic
decisions
about
deprivations
of
protected
rights
and
interests
this
latter
approach
involving
automated
algorithmic
decisions
in
adjudicatory
matters
would
seem
the
most
likely
to
deny
individuals
their
due
process
right
to
a
hearing
one
of
the
canonical
tenets
of
procedural
due
process
n
even
so
we
will
explain
why
even
such
machine
learning
based
decisions
are
in
no
way
uniquely
barred
from
satisfying
due
process
after
reaching
this
conclusion
though
we
will
highlight
an
area
of
tension
in
current
case
law
that
may
make
it
difficult
to
for
agencies
to
determine
when
procedural
protections
are
needed
in
an
age
of
algorithmic
adjudication
tests
for
due
process
the
landmark
case
of
goldberg
v
kelly
is
usually
recognized
for
establishing
that
due
process
protections
extend
to
recipients
of
government
welfare
benefits
which
previously
had
been
considered
privileges
that
did
not
afford
the
same
protection
as
constitutional
rights
n
although
goldberg
is
often
cited
for
the
court
s
rejection
of
the
right
privilege
distinction
just
as
central
to
the
court
s
decision
was
the
importance
of
welfare
recipients
having
the
ability
to
appear
in
person
before
the
government
official
who
makes
the
decision
about
whether
to
terminate
individual
benefits
n
the
court
rejected
a
process
that
was
based
on
written
documentation
finding
that
it
was
even
insufficient
for
a
human
caseworker
to
present
the
case
on
behalf
of
the
welfare
recipient
n
six
years
later
in
mathews
v
eldridge
the
supreme
court
held
that
in
the
context
of
social
security
disability
benefits
the
government
could
structure
a
process
based
solely
on
paperwork
review
and
without
offering
the
recipients
of
disability
benefits
a
pre
termination
hearing
before
an
administrative
official
n
the
court
did
not
overturn
goldberg
but
instead
it
offered
the
now
canonical
balancing
test
involving
three
factors
that
must
be
weighed
in
determining
whether
due
process
has
been
satisfied
first
the
private
interest
that
will
be
affected
by
the
official
action
second
the
risk
of
an
erroneous
deprivation
of
such
interest
through
the
procedures
used
and
the
probable
value
if
any
of
additional
or
substitute
procedural
safeguards
and
finally
the
government
s
interest
including
the
function
involved
and
the
fiscal
and
administrative
burdens
that
the
additional
or
substitute
procedural
requirement
would
entail
n
the
mathews
court
explicitly
noted
that
d
ue
process
is
flexible
and
calls
for
such
procedural
protections
as
the
particular
situation
demands
n
with
mathews
balancing
now
defining
procedural
due
process
we
conclude
that
algorithmic
adjudication
would
appear
to
fare
suitably
well
in
most
instances
even
if
goldberg
might
still
preclude
reliance
on
machine
learning
in
the
context
of
state
welfare
benefits
of
course
given
that
the
mathews
standard
calls
for
balancing
it
is
impossible
to
make
sweeping
generalizations
about
how
machine
learning
algorithms
would
fare
when
used
by
agencies
making
specific
kinds
of
decisions
but
at
least
one
thing
should
be
clear
no
agency
should
categorically
rule
out
the
use
of
machine
learning
algorithms
to
support
adjudicatory
decisions
among
the
areas
of
the
law
in
which
it
depends
would
seem
to
be
the
best
answer
this
is
definitely
one
mathews
s
first
factor
the
private
interest
at
stake
is
something
entirely
exogenous
to
machine
learning
but
the
last
two
factors
could
very
well
be
affected
perhaps
dramatically
so
in
some
cases
by
the
use
of
algorithms
when
used
to
administer
extremely
large
programs
machine
learning
could
save
the
government
a
substantial
amount
of
money
by
forgoing
pre
deprivation
hearings
thereby
significantly
increasing
the
weight
of
the
third
factor
in
favor
of
machine
learning
in
any
due
process
balancing
it
is
the
second
factor
then
that
will
likely
prove
critical
in
determining
the
constitutional
validity
of
automated
adjudications
namely
how
well
machine
learning
stacks
up
against
alternative
non
machine
based
procedures
in
terms
of
avoiding
erroneous
deprivations
agencies
will
need
to
be
justifiably
confident
that
automatic
algorithmic
deprivations
have
sufficiently
low
error
rates
to
weigh
heavily
against
the
need
for
pre
deprivation
hearings
before
human
officials
we
cannot
of
course
determine
ex
ante
what
will
constitute
sufficiently
low
rates
for
all
uses
given
that
the
nature
of
a
balancing
test
like
that
in
mathews
requires
case
by
case
determinations
we
see
little
reason
to
write
off
all
adjudicatory
algorithms
as
unable
to
conform
to
due
process
expectations
on
the
contrary
because
algorithms
can
reduce
the
possible
introduction
of
negative
features
of
human
judgment
such
as
prejudice
bias
and
mistakes
we
have
reason
to
expect
that
the
use
of
machine
learning
by
government
can
advance
due
process
values
n
evaluating
adjudicatory
algorithms
when
agencies
seek
to
assess
the
superiority
of
their
machine
learning
in
terms
of
error
avoidance
the
second
mathews
factor
two
conditions
must
be
met
error
rates
truly
representing
the
decision
processes
accuracy
must
be
available

those
error
rates
must
prove
to
be
acceptable
in
the
overall
balance
of
factors
the
first
of
these
two
conditions
should
easily
be
met
by
virtue
of
machine
learning
being
a
purely
mathematical
decision
making
process
unlike
qualitative
methods
for
determining
the
factual
bases
of

mathematical
classification
systems
provide
estimates
of
their
error
rates

they
are
actually
implemented

obtain
from
machine

algorithms

a

the

these
error
rates
can
be
generalized
to

the
second
condition
an
error
rate
s
acceptability
might
be
determined
by
reference
to
a
body
of
case
law
that
characterizes
acceptable
error
rates
for
other
types
of
procedures
relying
on
comparisons
of

be
in

with

emphasis
whenever
possible
in
applying

reasonably
look

look
favorably
on

automatic

adjudications
with
similar
error
rates
should
be
likely
to
pass
constitutional
muster

will
reveal
on
the
one
hand
low
error
rates
that
courts
have
deemed
acceptable
in
mathews
the
risk
of
erroneous
deprivation
as
measured
by
reversals
upon
appeal
was
percent
n
and
the

noted
that
with
such
a
low

rate
t
he
potential
value
of
an
evidentiary
hearing
or
even
oral
presentation
to
the
decision
maker
is
substantially
less
in
this
context
than
in
goldberg
n
error
rates
lower
than
percent
have
been
similarly
treated
as
acceptable
n
in
general
electric
co
v
jackson
the
district
court
even
held
that
an
error
rate
of

was
deemed
an
acceptable
rate
of

n
notwithstanding
the
court
s
recognition
that
the
private
interest
s
were
significant
n
at
the
other
end
of
the
continuum
courts
have
concluded
that
high
error
rates
that
represent
predictions
no
better
or
perhaps
even
worse
than
guessing
by
chance
are
unacceptable
and
necessitate
additional
due
process
protections
to
reduce
these
rates
for
example
error
rates
of
percent
n
and
percent
n
have
been
deemed
a
substantial
risk
n
and
an
error
rate
of
percent
has
been
labeled
unacceptably
high
n
between
these
extremes
court
decisions
reveal
less
agreement
over
the
risk
that
more
moderate
error
rates
pose
and
in
some
of
these
cases
the
error
rate
is
not
treated
as
a
particularly
weighty
or
controlling
balancing
factor
at
all
an
error
rate
of
percent
for
example
was
deemed
to
constitute
a
very
high
error
rate
for
purposes
of
mathews
v
eldridge
n
although
an
percent
error
rate
was
considered
a
slight
n
risk
of
error
despite
in
a
different
case
a
court
treating
an
error
rate
of
percent
as
a
high
risk
of
error
n
as
a
result
despite
the
precision
that
judicial
notice
of
error
rates
to
two
decimal
places
might
imply
no
fixed
percentage
can
be
found
in
the
case

demarcating
a
clean
line
between
acceptable
and
unacceptable
levels
of
error
in
addition
to
a
lack
of
a
clear
fixed
threshold
of
acceptability
past
precedents
present
another
challenge
in
that
reversal
rates
are
not
necessarily
a
complete
or
accurate
measure
of
error
in
the
particular
context
of
mathews
the
court
noted
that
the
administrative
review
system
operated
on
an
open
file
basis
n
meaning
that
those
denied
disability
benefits
could
at
any
point
following
their
deprivations
submit
new
evidence
that
could
result
in
additional
medical
examinations
individuals
who
availed
themselves
of
these
procedures
to
have
an
initial
denial
changed
were
not
included
in
the
percent
reversal
rate
because
their
cases
were
never
appealed
n
similarly
and
relevant
to
measurements
in
all
scenarios
reversal
rates
may
fail
to
capture
those
who
are
erroneously
denied
benefits
but
who
choose
for
various
unrelated
reasons
not
to
file
an
appeal
that
would
lead
to
an
evidentiary
hearing
and
reversal
for
these
reasons
the
actual
rate
of
error
in
administrative
systems
will
presumably
be
higher
than
indicated
by
a
rate
of
reversal
n
these
deficiencies
in
measuring
error
risk
based
on
reversal
rates
may
pose
a
challenge
to
an
agency
s
search
for
judicial
guidance
on
automatic
algorithmic
deprivations
algorithms
test
data
error
rates
are
mathematically
computed
in
a
way
that
makes
it
difficult
to
compare
them
directly
to
the
reversal
rates
currently
relied
upon
within
the
case
law
although
the
case
law
seems
to
indicate
that
reversal
rates
under
percent
should
be
sufficient
to
avoid
the
need
for
pre
deprivation
hearings
agencies
will
be
unable
to
determine
ex
ante
what
any
particular
algorithm
s
mathematical
error
rate
equates
to
in
terms
of
a
reversal
rate
as
a
more
accurate
estimate
of
the
total
error
in
a
system
will
likely
be
higher
than
any
reversal
rate
an
algorithm
s
error
rate
might
be
higher
too
even
when
reliance
on
the
algorithm
actually
results
in
a
less
error
prone
process
still
if
an
algorithm
s
error
rate
itself
fell
below
percent
then
agencies
relying
on
the
algorithm
for
adjudication
could
presumably
predict
that
the
courts
would
deem
this
rate
to
be
acceptable
if
nothing
else
agencies
could
structure
algorithmic
adjudication
systems
to
produce
data
on
reversal
rates
by
incorporating
a
delay
period
between
the
time
when
an
algorithmic
prediction
is
made
and
when
any
corresponding
deprivation
of
rights
occurs
affected
individuals
or
entities
would
have
the
opportunity
to
request
a
hearing
thus
generating
over
time
some
data
on
reversals
these
delay
periods
could
accompany
a
phase
in
or
piloting
of
an
automated
adjudicatory
system
providing
agencies
with
the
data
needed
to
establish
how
their
test
data
error
rates
correspond
with
reversal
rates
as
long
as
these
error
rates
prove
sufficiently
low
we
anticipate
no
categorical
reason
why
courts
would
reject
adjudication
by
algorithm
merely
due
to
its
digitized
and
automated
nature
cross
examination
of
adjudicatory
algorithms
perhaps
the
more
substantial
due
process
question
presented
by
automated
adjudication
stems
from
how
such
a
system
would
affect
an
aggrieved
party
s
right
to
cross
examination
claimants
presumably
should
have
a
right
to
understand
and
provide
comment
on
the
design
of
any
algorithm
as
well
as
the
underlying
data
used
n
unfortunately
it
will
seldom
if
ever
be
readily
discern
able
why
any
particular
prediction
resulted
from
machine
learning
and
consequently
it
will
not
be
easy
to
determine
what
evidence
would
be
needed
to
rectify
errors
n
any
of
the
variables
could
have
been
predictively
important
ones
and
any
of
those
variables
could
have
been
the
one
or
ones
that
contained
the
error
probably
the
only
meaningful
way
to
identify
errors
would
be
to
conduct
a
proceeding
in
which
an
algorithm
and
its
data
are
fully
explored
this
could
be
accomplished
through
agency
rulemaking
establishing
an
automated
adjudicatory
system
in
the
first
place
and
in
specifying
the
underlying
algorithm
s
parameters
it
might
also
be
raised
in
individual
hearings
or
appeals
seeking
to
analyze
separately
an
algorithm
s
forecast
in
each
case
probing
for
sources
of
error
in
the
data
and
specifications
underlying
those
individual
predictions
n
given
that
this
thorough
examination
of
algorithmic
error
will
entail
sophisticated
deconstructions
of
data
quality
and
methodology
few
individual
claimants
will
readily
possess
the
mathematical
and
analytical
ability
to
conduct
such
an
investigation
without
assistance
n
even
with
the
appointment
of
counsel
or
with
a
requirement
that
a
hearing
examiner
effectively
act
as
counsel
claimants
may
not
be
able
to
receive
a
fair
hearing
about
the
choices
embedded
in
and
the
data
used
by
algorithmic
adjudication
most
potential
counsel
or
agency
hearing
examiners
do
not
possess
the
necessary
skills
to
interrogate
machine
learning
systems
an
expert
must
have
a
good
degree
of
statistical
knowledge
to
understand
how
for
example
variables
importance
values
are
interpreted
and
what
consequences
those
interpretations
hold
for
the
effects
of
possible
erroneous
variable
measurements
on
predictions
adjudicating
by
algorithm
may
thus
necessitate
the
establishment
of
a
body
of
neutral
and
independent
statistical
experts
to
provide
oversight
and
review
or
more
likely
a
prior
rulemaking
process
informed
by
an
expert
advisory
committee
or
subjected
to
a
peer
review
process
fortunately
such
procedural
steps
are
well
established
and
have
been
long
used
in
other
complex
administrative
matters
n
in
the
end
whether
any
particular
algorithmic
system
will
satisfy
the
standards
of
due
process
will
depend
on
how
well
that
system
works
and
on
the
adequate
validation
of
its
performance
but
nothing
in
principle
stands
in
the
way
of
satisfying
the
demands
of
due
process
even
for
automated
adjudication
by
algorithm
especially
given
the
flexibility
courts
have
long
granted
agencies
in
crafting
adjudicatory
procedures
furthermore
given
the
well
established
biases
and
errors
that
can
creep
into
human
judgment
and
recognizing
that
machine
learning
algorithms
have
demonstrated
superiority
over
human
decisions
in
other
contexts
n
it
is
reasonable
to
conclude
that
agencies
will
be
able
to
satisfy
the
demands
of
due
process
even
in
the
machine
learning
era
n
c
antidiscrimination
as
agencies
face
choices
about
how
to
design
machine
learning
algorithms
in
the
service
of
adjudication
and
rulemaking
they
will
need
to
decide
what
kinds
of
variables
should
be
included
in
the
data
these
algorithms
use
to
make
predictions
they
may
have
at
their
disposal
data
on
demographic
variables
representing
membership
in
legally
protected
classes
and
inclusion
of
these
variables
in
algorithms
could
increase
their
predictions
accuracy
and
potentially
reduce
disparities
in
accuracy
across
classes
n
but
including
them
and
then
basing
action
on
the
resulting
predictions
raises
serious
concerns
about
illegal
discrimination
especially
if
those
predictions
lead
to
differential
effects
on
members
of
a
protected
class
as
a
white
house
report
on
big
data
has
warned
p
owerful
algorithms
can
unlock
value
in
the
vast
troves
of
information
available
but
also
raise
the
potential
of
encoding
discrimination
in
automated
decisions
n
in
this
section
we
take
up
the
question
of
whether
inclusion
of
class
related
input
variables
in
federal
agencies
algorithms
would
render
them
unconstitutional
for
equal
protection
reasons
we
find
that
although
consideration
of
suspect
class
membership
is
almost
universally
struck
down
for
contravening
equal
protection
in
traditional
decision
making
processes
quantitative
or
otherwise
some
of
the
unique
attributes
of
how
machine
learning
operates
may
shield
agencies
from
a
finding
of
unconstitutionality
this
is
not
to
say
that
the
use
of
machine
learning
algorithms
by
federal
agencies
will
always
be
unproblematic
under
equal
protection
on
the
contrary
the
use
of
algorithms
could
be
driven
by
manifest
easily
discoverable
animus
or
discriminatory
intent
as
much
as
any
other
decision
process
our
suggestion
is
simply
that
potential
equal
protection
challenges
to
agency
use
of
machine
learning
will
likely
face
a
high
bar
if
officials
in
these
agencies
employ
algorithms
responsibly
and
in
good
faith
building
a
suitable
record
to
demonstrate
the
propriety
of
their
design
and
use
under
the
fifth
amendment
agencies
must
respect
the
equal
protection
rights
of
those
affected
by
their
actions
n
federal
agencies
though
do
not
violate
those
rights
solely
because
an
action
has
a
disproportionate
impact
on
a
protected
class
such
as
race
or
religion
n
rather
to
show
a
violation
of
equal
protection
by
the
federal
government
a
purpose
to
discriminate
must
be
present
n
in
other
words
agency
action
that
purposefully
discriminates
based
on
a
protected
class
that
is
action
that
engages
in
disparate
treatment
will
be
legally
suspect
and
subject
to
heightened
scrutiny
n
at
the
end
of
this
section
we
will
briefly
suggest
that
regulatory
decisions
made
by
machine
learning
could
in
many
instances
withstand
heightened
scrutiny
but
of
course
we
recognize
that
evaluation
under
such
a
heightened
standard
of
review
will
ultimately
be
highly
fact
dependent
our
principal
argument
in
this
section
is
that
algorithms
that
include
variables
indicating
protected
class
membership
will
seldom
if
ever
trigger
heightened
scrutiny
at
least
in
the
absence
of
any
explicit
showing
of
discriminatory
intent
or
animus
equal
protection
challenges
to
machine
learning
will
in
short
likely
fail
at
the
first
step
of
analysis
that
demands
a
finding
that
algorithms
that
include
or
analyze
class
related
variables
are
intentionally
discriminatory
suspect
classifications
because
we
assume
that
there
will
rarely
exist
direct
evidence
that
a
decision
maker
in
this
case
an
algorithm
s
programmers
or
their
superiors
consciously
intended
to
discriminate
on
the
basis
of
a
protected
class
evidence
of
any
such
intent
would
need
to
be
found
indirectly
and
circumstantially
we
will
address
this
kind
of
search
for
inferences
of
discrimination
in
the
next
section
where
we
explain
why
machine
learning
is
unlikely
to
give
rise
to
such
inferences
but
first
we
take
up
the
typical
way
that
claimants
alleging
disparate
treatment
succeed
in
showing
that
governmental
action
deserves
heightened
scrutiny
namely
by
demonstrating
that
an
agency
action
involves
a
suspect
classification
such
classifications
are
automatically
subject
to
heightened
scrutiny
n
courts
will
likely
find
it
difficult
to
conclude
that
agency
algorithms
that
analyze
class
related
variables
entail
suspect
classifications
n
for
one
thing
the
supreme
court
has
never
clearly
defined
what
constitutes
a
suspect
classification
n
its
attitude
has
been
relatively
consistent
when
the
only
variable
contributing
to
a
governmental
decision
is
membership
in
a
protected
class
and
where
such
membership
universally
leads
to
disadvantaged
outcomes
such
decision
schemes
are
clearly
suspect
classifications
and
must
be
subjected
to
heightened
scrutiny
n
beyond
such
manifestly
problematic
scenarios
the
court
s
criteria
for
suspect
classifications
have
been
murkier
still
the
court
has
subjected
to
heightened
scrutiny
decision
processes
in
which
membership
in
a
protected
class
was
but
one
of
many
variables
considered
by
government
decision
makers
n
it
might
therefore
be
assumed
that
any
inclusion
of
class
membership
or
even
the
mere
consideration
of
a
protected
class
would
suffice
to
conclude
that
a
decision
making
process
depends
on
a
suspect
classification
n
if
this
were
the
case
then
any
machine
learning
algorithm
that
analyzes
data
containing
variables
for
membership
in
a
protected
class
would
surely
receive
heightened
scrutiny
yet
as
others
have
suggested
governmental
actions
that
are
class
conscious
but
do
not
classify
on
the
basis
of
group
membership
may
be
exempt
from
heightened
scrutiny
n
in
other
words
government
might
consider
a
suspect
class
without
necessarily
resulting
in
a
classification
how
class
membership
is
considered
beyond
merely
the
fact
that
it
is
can
matter
greatly
when
it
comes
to
determining
if
a
government
action
rests
on
a
suspect
classification
previous
scholarship
has
put
forward
five
such
aspects
of
a
classification
an
official
government
label
proclaiming
or
identifying
the
class
of
a
particular
individual
which
is
then
the
basis
for
allocating
benefits
or
imposing
burdens
on
the
person
classified
n
the
machine
learning
algorithms
we
envision
would
certainly
contain
an
official
government
label
indicating
particular
individuals
class
memberships
it
is
less
clear
however
that
these
algorithms
would
allocate
benefits
or
burdens
on
the
basis
of
class
membership
in
the
same
way
as
have
almost
every
decision
scheme
that
to
date
has
been
subjected
to
heightened
scrutiny
by
courts
decision
schemes
previously
reviewed
by
the
courts
have
universally
exhibited
what
we
label
categorically
different
treatment
based
on
class
membership
in
the
past
when
an
individual
s
race
has
been
factored
into
a
decision
being
a
member
of
a
given
race
has
caused
individuals
of
that
race
to
have
their
predicted
outcomes
affected
in
a
consistently
and
categorically
different
way
than
individuals
of
another
race
in
these
situations
being
a
member
of
a
given
race
has
always
been
across
individuals
of
that
race
either
advantageous
or
disadvantageous
when
compared
to
being
a
member
of
a
different
race
n
yet
with
machine
learning
many
if
not
most
algorithms
will
not
lead
to
categorically
different
treatment
even
when
they
include
consideration
of
variables
for
race
and
other
protected
classes
concern
about
categorically
different
treatment
on
the
basis
of
class
membership
underlies
many
supreme
court
decisions

the
equal

belonging
to
underrepresented
minority
groups
in
a
point
based
admissions
system
resulting
in
a
suspect
classification
n
in
grutter
v
bollinger
a
law
school
used
a
more
holistic
admissions
process
that
did
not
distribute
points
but
this
process
was
still
deemed
a
suspect
classification
when
race
did
factor
into
an
admissions
decision
membership
in
an
underrepresented
minority
group
was
universally
given
a
degree
of
preference
for
admission
over
lack
of
such
membership
n
the
court
has
similarly
held
that
heightened
scrutiny
is
warranted
due
to
categorically
different
treatment
arising
from
a
public
school
board
s
method
for
determining
teacher
layoffs
that
gave
preferential
treatment
to
minority
teachers
n
another
school
district
s
process
of
assigning
students
to
schools
triggered
heightened
scrutiny
because
for
each
school
it
gave
preference
to
students
of
certain
races
whose
assignment
would
place
the
school
s
racial
makeup
closer
to
that
of
the
school
s
district
n
in
each
of
these
cases
a
public
decision
process
treated
membership
in
certain
races
as
advantageous
while
treating
membership
in
others
as
disadvantageous
these
are
just
a
few
examples
but
they
demonstrate
the
pervasiveness
of
categorically
different
treatment
of
class
membership
traditionally
taking
race
or
other
protected
class
characteristics
into
account
meant
drawing
a
distinction
that
leads
to
one
class
being
advantaged
to
some
degree
over
another
class
by
being
more
likely
to
receive
benefits
or
avoid
burdens
the
court
s
reasoning
in
its
equal
protection
cases
underscores
how
doctrinally
important
this
categorically
different
treatment
of
class
membership
is
to
finding
a
reliance
on
a
suspect
classification
in
fullilove
v
klutznick
the
supreme
court
applied
strict
scrutiny
precisely
because
the
legislative
scheme
gave
and
withheld
preference
based
on
ethnic
membership
n
similarly
in
wygant
v
jackson
board
of
education
the
court
stated
that
the
challenged
teacher
layoffs
operate
d
against
whites
and
in
favor
of
certain
minorities
and
therefore
constitute
d
a
classification
based
on
race
n
more
recently
the
court
emphasized
its
concern
in
fisher
v
university
of
texas
at
austin
about
a
state
considering
racial
minority
status
as
a
positive
or
favorable
factor
in
a
university
s
admissions
process
n
the
court
reasoned
that
t
he
principle
of
equal
protection
admits
no
artificial
line
of
a
two
class
theory
that
permits
the
recognition
of
special
wards
entitled
to
a
degree
of
protection
greater
than
that
accorded
others
n
in
other
words
equal
protection
law
singles
out
for
heightened
scrutiny
those
classifications
that
arise
when
government
draws
lines
that
categorically
favor
some
classes
and
disfavor
others
n
what
makes
explicit
consideration
of
class
membership
odious
and
offensive
to
equal
protection
principles
is
not
just
the
government
officials
consideration
of
race
and
other
protected
classes
but
their
use
of
class
status
as
part
of
a
classification
when
a
membership
in
one
class
is
consistently
treated
as
advantageous
or
disadvantageous
compared
to
membership
in
another
class
when
it
comes
to
the
use
of
machine
learning
algorithms
however
consideration
of
class
membership
will
not
necessarily
or
even
often
give
rise
to
categorically
different
treatment
we
can
expect
that
most
machine
learning
applications
will
be
used
to
forecast
complex
phenomena
such
as
tax
fraud
or
disability
eligibility
that
are
not
easily
predicted
by
standard
less
powerful
statistical
techniques
such
complex
phenomena
are
complex
precisely
because
their
causes
are
not
uniform
and
homogenous
across
the
population
when
machine
learning
is
applied
to
predict
such
phenomena
its
nonparametric
nature
and
incorporation
of
multidimensional
interaction
effects
allow
this
heterogeneity
to
be
manifested
and
more
fully
exploited
for
predictive
benefit
n
what
this
means
for
equal
protection
analysis
is
that
if
machine
learning
algorithms
incorporate
an
input
variable
representing
individual
membership
in
a
particular
class
it
is
highly
unlikely
that
the
effect
of
that
variable
on
predicted
outcomes
will
be
consistently
advantageous
or
disadvantageous
for
the
multitude
of
individuals
in
that
class
such
algorithms
will
be
designed
after
all
to
optimize
for
accuracy
in
making
predictions
of
fraud
or
benefits
eligibility
not
for
giving
preferential
treatment
based
on
race
or
other
class
characteristics
a
learning
algorithm
will
generally
be
able
to
improve
its
accuracy
through
more
data
and
additional
variables
of
all
types
the
forecasts
an
algorithm
generates
will
likely
support
favorable
treatment
for
some
members
of
a
class
and
unfavorable
treatment
for
other
members
of
that
same
class
as
these
forecasts
depend
on
complex
non
linear
interactions
of
multiple
variables
n
in
sum
determining
that
machine
learning
algorithms
create
a
suspect
classification
will
hardly
be
a
clear
cut
task
even
when
government
agencies
include
class
related
variables
in
their
data
sets
until
now
explicit
consideration
of
individuals
memberships
in
protected
classes
has
virtually
always
been
labeled
as
a
classification
because
of
the
categorically
different
treatment
that
accompanies
such
consideration
we
recognize
that
for
this
reason
some
courts
may
instinctually
incline
toward
treating
as
a
suspect
classification
the
mere
consideration
of
class
related
variables
by
learning
algorithms
yet
what
truly
makes
such
consideration
a
classification
and
thus
constitutionally
suspect
is
the
attendant
attachment
of
advantage
to
one
class
and
of
disadvantage
to
another
by
the
officials
who
are
collecting
and
analyzing
data
in
traditional
ways
an
attachment
that
will
neither
necessarily
nor
usually
be
present
with
the
use
of
machine
learning
the
courts
heightened
scrutiny
of
suspect
classifications
exists
not
to
prevent
any
and
all
governmental
considerations
of
class
characteristics
rather
it
exists
to
constrain
governments
from
stereotyping
and
treating
individuals
as
if
they
were
defined
by
their
status
within
a
particular
class
n
traditional
schemes
such
as
admitting
minority
students
or
retaining
minority
teachers
invariably
do
stereotype
when
they
categorically
assign
a
different
weight
in
the
government
s
decision
analysis
based
on
class
membership
by
contrast
machine
learning
algorithms
especially
those
we
have
in
mind
for
use
in
solving
complex
forecasting
problems
are
far
less
likely
to
do
so
as
courts
begin
to
encounter
governmental
use
of
artificial
intelligence
they
should
recognize
that
classification
is
not
a
synonym
for
explicit
consideration
of
an
individual
s
class
membership
n
at
least
not
when
applied
to
learning
algorithms
that
analyze
data
that
may
contain
class
related
variables
machine
learning
algorithms
do
not
operate
by
giving
categorically
different
treatment
based
on
class
membership
as
such
absent
animus
or
other
explicit
intentionality
about
class
in
the
selection
of
optimization
parameters
machine
learning
s
use
should
not
contravene
the
foundational
principles
underlying
the
supreme
court
s
invocation
of
suspect
classifications
inferring
discriminatory
intent
even
if
algorithms
do
not
implicate
suspect
classifications
opponents
of
certain
machine
learning
applications
might
still
argue
that
they
should
be
subjected
to
heightened
scrutiny
by
invoking
circumstantial
evidence
to
convince
courts
to
infer
discriminatory
intent
n
such
opponents
might
claim
that
the
mere
inclusion
of
a
variable
such
as
race
in
an
algorithmic
analysis
even
if
it
does
not
result
in
consistently
advantageous
or
disadvantageous
predictions
still
demonstrates
an
a
priori
intent
to
give
disparate
treatment
or
produce
a
disparate
outcome
they
might
argue
that
conscious
decisions
by
a
regulatory
agency
to
include
such
variables
in
a
machine
learning
analysis
represent
the
kind
of
specific
events
leading
up
to
the
challenged
decision
n
that
provide
circumstantial
evidence
of
discriminatory
intent
whatever
surface
appeal
such
arguments
might
hold
we
think
they
will
almost
surely
fail
in
the
context
of
machine
learning
the
black
box
nature
of
this
analysis
means
that
the
act
of
including
a
variable
does
not
by
itself
provide
much
insight
into
what
an
algorithm
user
might
have
hoped
to
gain
by
including
that
variable
additional
direct
or
circumstantial
evidence
would
be
needed
to
connect
the
inclusion
of
a
variable
to
discriminatory
intent
yet
perhaps
machine
learning
opponents
will
argue
that
government
officials
should
reasonably
foresee
that
the
inclusion
of
variables
related
to
a
protected
class
could
create
a
disparate
impact
and
thus
officials
persistence
in
including
those
variables
evidences
intent
to
discriminate
n
such
a
claim
would
be
dubious
given
how
machine
learning
analysis
works
on
a
black
box
basis
it
is
virtually
impossible
for
anyone
to
know
a
priori
what
a
given
variable
s
likely
importance
in
the
algorithm
will
be
or
what
its
ultimate
effects
will
be
on
any
disparities
of
predictions
n
many
machine
learning
algorithms
incorporate
stochastic
processes
that
randomly
decide
if
and
when
a
given
variable
factors
into
the
classifications
and
there
are
often
complex
and
unpredictable
interaction
effects
between
different
variables
that
may
cause
the
inclusion
of
a
protected
trait
related
variable
to
decrease
rather
than
increase
the
disparity
of
outcomes
even
after
an
algorithm
is
implemented
its
black
box
nature
prevents
anyone
from
determining
the
effects
of
that
variable
on
any
resulting
disparity
of
the
outcomes
whether
it
may
have
worsened
or
lessened
those
disparities
n
machine
learning
opponents
might
attempt
alternatively
to
argue
that
although
disparate
impacts
cannot
be
expected
a
priori
a
decision
maker
with
discriminatory
intent
could
run
an
algorithm
multiple
times
with
different
variables
included
determine
ex
post
whether
including
a
variable
representing
a
protected
trait
produces
greater
disparity
of
outcomes
and
then
choose
to
implement
an
algorithm
including
such
a
variable
if
it
produces
relatively
greater
disparity
n
the
legitimacy
of
such
a
claim
however
is
questionable
due
to
the
unknowable
generalizability
of
the
outcomes
of
any
single
machinelearning
analysis
it
is
common
practice
to
build
an
algorithm
using
a
random
sample
of
an
entire
data
set
called
the
training
data
and
to
then
evaluate
the
algorithm
s
predictions
in
a
different
random
sample
of
that
data
set
called
the
test
data
n
this
allows
an
analyst
to
obtain
some
sense
of
how
the
algorithm
may
perform
in
new
realizations
of
the
data
as
changes
may
result
whenever
an
algorithm
is
used
in
novel
predictive
endeavors
one
problem
common
to
any
statistical
analysis
is
that
the
analyst
cannot
know
how
close
the
test
data
are
to
new
realizations
of
data
and
thus
cannot
predict
how
a
model
or
algorithm
will
perform
in
the
real
world
if
the
entire
data
set
from
which
the
test
data
were
randomly
sampled
was
itself
a
random
sample
from
the
real
world
population
then
the
test
data
and
novel
realizations
may
well
be
similar
but
it
is
unlikely
even
if
an
agency
is
working
with
randomly
sampled
data
for
the
population
from
which
data
are
sampled
to
be
the
same
population
for
which
generalizations
are
desired
to
be
made
take
for
instance
an
irs
algorithm
used
to
predict
tax
fraud
this
algorithm
s
underlying
data
may
have
come
from
prior
years
audits
and
their
outcomes
but
that
population
is
not
the
same
as
the
population
of
interest
which
would
presumably
comprise
all
individuals
filing
tax
returns
not
just
those
audited
in
the
present
year
temporal
differences
between
test
data
and
real
world
data
can
matter
as
differences
in
the
economy
between
prior
years
and
the
current
year
may
impact
the
likelihood
of
individuals
to
engage
in
fraudulent
tax
practices
thus
even
if
an
agency
analyst
were
to
choose
an
algorithm
that
included
a
variable
representing
a
protected
class
such
as
race
a
disparate
impact
is
not
foreseeable
due
to
the
inability
of
knowing
the
likelihood
that
disparate
outcomes
observed
in
test
data
would
be
borne
out
in
real
world
data
for
these
reasons
plaintiffs
attempting
to
show
circumstantial
evidence
of
discriminatory
intent
in
the
use
of
machine
learning
will
surely
face
a
steep
uphill
climb
withstanding
standards
of
review
thus
far
we
have
explained
why
administrative
agencies
use
of
machine
learning
algorithms
that
analyze
class
related
variables
are
unlikely
to
give
rise
to
heightened
scrutiny
despite
a
lack
of
clear
settled
judicial
guidance
in
this
area
it
seems
safe
to
conclude
that
learning
algorithms
mathematical
properties
likely
will
preclude
the
courts
from
labeling
the
use
of
protected
class
data
in
these
algorithms
as
a
suspect
classification
or
inferring
any
circumstantial
discriminatory
intent
yet
if
a
court
nevertheless
did
subject
agencies
machine
learning
tools
to
heightened
scrutiny
this
does
not
automatically
mean
that
courts
will
find
that
the
agencies
have
denied
individuals
of
the
equal
protection
of
the
law
whether
a
decision
process
deemed
to
be
discriminatory
could
survive
heightened
scrutiny
will
depend
to
a
great
degree
on
factors
exogenous
to
the
nature
of
machine
learning
specifically
the
nature
of
the
government
objective
and
the
state
interest
motivating
the
process
n
presumably
regulatory
agencies
that
use
machine
learning
in
the
service
of
policy
objectives
such
as
public
health
protection
or
market
stability
would
have
strong
arguments
that
they
are
seeking
to
advance
compelling
state
interests
although
a
full
consideration
of
how
applications
of
machine
learning
would
fare
under
heightened
scrutiny
will
be
highly
fact
dependent
government
should
be
able
to
overcome
at
least
one
aspect
of
heightened
scrutiny
analysis
the
prohibition
on
overbroad
generalizations
about
different
classes
n
this
specific
equal
protection
concern
has
been
raised
in
the
context
of
evidence
based
sentencing
in
which
checklists
used
to
inform
criminal
sentencing
include
gender
coding
variables
weighted
on
the
basis
of
past
regression
analyses
n
for
example
sonja
starr
has
put
forward
a
compelling
argument
for
why
in
that
context
inclusion
of
class
related
variables
unconstitutionally
capitalizes
on
overbroad
generalizations
about
class
membership
checklists
take
gender
into
account
only
by
assigning
uniform
weights
to
one
gender
thereby
subjecting
all
individuals
to
group
based
treatment
instead
of
treating
them
truly
as
individuals
a
core
value
embodied
by
the
equal
protection
clause
n
this
criticism
though
is
unlikely
to
carry
the
same
weight
in
the
context
of
administrative
agencies
use
of
machine
learning
algorithms
if
gender
for
instance
were
included
in
an
algorithm
it
would
not
be
the
case
that
say
all
females
would
have
their
predictions
affected
in
the
same
way
simply
because
they
were
female
rather
the
effects
of
gender
on
the
predictions
would
vary
across
individuals
and
would
depend
on
interactions
between
the
gender
variable
and
all
other
input
variables
effects
that
would
again
be
unpredictable
and
heterogeneous
across
individuals
n
opponents
might
argue
that
machine
learning
nonetheless
creates
a
problematic
statistical
generalization
of
its
own
because
algorithms
generate
predictions
about
what
individuals
will
do
based
on
what
similar
individuals
have
done
in
the
past
n
admittedly
machine
learning
does
rely
on
analysis
of
training
data
sets
however
such
reliance
on
the
past
behavior
of
similar
individuals
occurs
at
a
fundamentally
different
and
much
more
individualized
level
in
the
algorithmic
context
than
in
the
context
of
checklists
in
the
latter
generalizations
are
made
about
what
females
as
a
broad
group
have
historically
done
in
the
former
generalizations
will
be
made
about
the
past
behaviors
of
say
females
of
a
certain
age
with
a
certain
educational
background
living
in
a
particular
area
paying
a
given
amount
of
taxes
driving
a
certain
type
of
car
and
so
forth
thus
even
though
starr
has
provided
compelling
reasons
to
believe
that
checklist
generalizations
may
be
unconstitutionally
overbroad
the
same
assertion
of
excessive
breadth
will
be
much
less
tenable
with
respect
to
machine
learning
algorithms
we
reiterate
that
challenges
to
agencies
algorithms
will
not
likely
reach
the
stage
where
these
considerations
will
be
relevant
the
usual
rationales
for
heightened
scrutiny
are
not
likely
to
apply
to
machine
learning
accordingly
the
applicable
standard
for
equal
protection
purposes
will
likely
be
rational
basis
review
which
generally
results
in
the
validation
of
state
action
n
rational
basis
review
merely
requires
that
a
governmental
action
be
rationally
related
to
furthering
a
legitimate
state
interest
n
assuming
that
the
governmental
interest
to
which
an
agency
s
machine
learning
algorithm
is
applied
is
legitimate
it
should
be
quite
difficult
for
that
algorithm
to
be
struck
down
on
equal
protection
grounds
an
algorithm
s
objective
function
will
itself
provide
a
concrete
mathematical
embodiment
of
the
agency
s
goal
sufficient
to
demonstrate
a
rational
relationship
between
the
algorithm
and
the
governmental
interest
at
stake
one
of
the
few
ways
in
which
government
actions
can
be
struck
down
under
rational
basis
review
is
through
the
finding
of
a
motivating
animus
toward
a
certain
group
n
the
supreme
court
has
yet
to
offer
clear
guidance
for
determining
the
presence
of
animus
or
how
exactly
such
a
presence
should
affect
judicial
review
n
nevertheless
we
can
surmise
that
animus
can
be
found
either
through
direct
evidence
or
via
inference
n
direct
evidence
typically
takes
the
form
of
statements
whether
by
legislators
n
or
private
individuals
whose
views
are
given

by

showing
sentiments
of
hostility
stereotype
bias
or
bigotry
such
manifest
indications
of
animus
might
well
surround
specific
uses
of
machine
learning
algorithms
but
nothing
unique
about
machine
learning
makes
it
any
more
vulnerable
to
explicit
animus
than
any
other
decision
making
process
or
governmental
action
claims
of
indirect
inferences
of
animus
might
conceivably
be
advanced
by
calling
attention
to
disparate
outcomes
yet
at
least
with
respect
to
machine
learning
any
such
inferences
would
be
hard
to
justify
although
animus
has
not
been
unambiguously
defined
inferences
of
it
would
likely
entail
making
a
situation
dependent
search
for
some
kind
of
logical
connection
between
the
consideration
of
class
and
the
government
interest
being
served
the
absence
of
which
might
plausibly
support
an
inference
of
animus
n
if
an
algorithm
s
supplementary
diagnostic
output
somehow
indicated
that
a
class
related
variable
was
relatively
important
for
the
accuracy
of
the
algorithm
s
predictions
then
it
would
appear
easy
to
claim
that
that
variable
is
connected
to
a
valid
governmental
interest
an
interest
in
taking
action
aimed
at
a
legitimate
purpose
in
the
most
efficient
and
accurate
way
possible
alternatively
if
a
class
related
variable
could
be
shown
to
be
not
predictively
important
then
the
consideration
of
class
would
likely
not
be
driving
the
discrimination
complained
of
but
rather
it
would
be
other
non
class
related
variables
that
would
underlie
the
outcomes
opponents
of
machine
learning
might
argue
that
these
other
variables
form
in
combination
a
proxy
for
class
and
this
could
be
true
but
then
the
inclusion
of
those
variables
would
carry
the
same
logical
connection
to
the
government
s
interest
as
would
the
inclusion
of
important
class
related
variables
the
non
class
related
variables
would
be
contributing
noticeably
to
the
algorithm
s
accuracy
for
these
reasons
even
when
some
evidence
might
be
put
forward
as
to
the
predictive
power
of
certain
variables
it
is
unlikely
that
agencies
algorithms
will
be
particularly
vulnerable
to
indirect
inferences
of
animus
that
could
lead
them
to
be
struck
down
under
rational
basis
review
another
potential
argument
opponents
might
make
is
that
animus
arises
if
an
agency
implements
an
algorithm
and
finds
that
it
yields
vastly
disproportionate
outcomes
for
individuals
of
a
particular
class
but
then
the
agency
fails
to
take
any
steps
to
alleviate
these
disparate
outcomes
n
after
all
a
series
of
novel
statistical
methods
are
emerging
that
can
minimize
the
disparate
impact
of
algorithms
n
these
methods
though
come
at
the
expense
of
forecasting
accuracy
which
means
that
an
agency
s
failure
to
adopt
them
may
not
necessarily
imply
animus
the
agency
may
simply
be
seeking
to
ensure
that
accurate
predictions
underlie
its
actions
furthermore
any
steps
an
agency
might
take
to
rectify
disparate
impacts
after
an
algorithm
s
implementation
could
itself
constitute
unconstitutional
disparate
treatment
n
overall
our
analysis
indicates
that
agencies
seeking
to
use
machine
learning
to
advance
their
public
missions
should
not
be
put
off
by
the
potential
for
equal
protection
challenges
n
we
expect
that
the
courts
will
permit
these
agencies
to
include
class
related
variables
in
their
algorithms
for
the
sake
of
accuracy
and
even
for
trying
to
mitigate
disparate
impacts
although
the
inclusion
of
race
and
other
class
characteristics
in
decision
making
supported
by
machine
learning
may
seem
to
run
afoul
of
the
court
s
historical
aversion
to
explicit
considerations
of
protected
classes
we
have
explained
why
the
algorithmic
consideration
of
class
unlike
the
consideration
in
traditional
decision
processes
is
unlikely
to
yield
categorically
different
treatment
based
on
class
membership
agencies
algorithms
are
unlikely
to
be
deemed
suspect
classifications
triggering
heightened
scrutiny
due
to
the
distinctive
mathematical
properties
of
machine
learning
agencies
will
also
likely
escape
heightened
scrutiny
based
on
circumstantial
evidence
of
intent
absent
direct
evidence
of
animus
machine
learning
should
be
easily
sustained
under
rational
basis
review
even
if
subjected
to
heightened
scrutiny
machine
learning
should
at
least
in
some
settings
also
withstand
challenge
our
conclusions
about
agencies
ability
to
use
machine
learning
in
ways
that
avoid
equal
protection
problems
should
hardly
be
construed
as
giving
our
blessing
to
the
careless
or
indiscriminate
use
of
machine
learning
principles
of
good
government
still
necessitate
whenever
feasible
the
avoidance
of
possible
discriminatory
outcomes
even
when
such
steps
are
not
demanded
by
the
constitution
indeed
one
important
reason
for
agency
experimentation
with
machine
learning
is
to
find
ways
to
reduce
or
eliminate
the
errors
and
biases
that
creep
into
human
decisions
although
agency
officials
should
be
fully
cognizant
of
potential
equal
protection
objections
to
their
efforts
to
engage
in
algorithmic
adjudication
or
robotic
rulemaking
these
legal
risks
appear
quite
manageable
and
should
hardly
stand
in
the
way
of
responsible
attempts
to
use
machine
learning
especially
when
doing
so
will
reduce
discrimination
that
would
otherwise
be
introduced
by
human
decision
makers
and
their
often
inescapable
sometimes
unconscious
prejudices
n
d
transparency
up
to
this
point
we
have
considered
choices
that
agencies
will
face
when
deciding
to
implement
algorithmic
tools
now
we
turn
to
the
question
of
how
could
and
should
regulators
ensure
proper
transparency
about
their
choices
some
observers
already
fear
that
an
era
of
artificial
intelligence
may
render
too
much
of
society
and
its
workings
opaque
n
the
legitimacy
of
agencies
choices
about
algorithms
will
therefore
depend
on
accountability
and
transparency
n
principles
of
transparency
undergird
much
of
administrative
law
finding
expression
in
statutes
such
as
the
freedom
of
information
act
n
and
various
requirements
under
the
administrative
procedure
act
n
taken
together
these
statutes
provide
a
fundamental
means
for
citizens
to
know
what
their
government
is
up
to
n
the
legitimacy
of
rules
issued
by
administrative
agencies
requires
that
those
being
regulated
have
access
to
information
showing
how
and
why
rules
were
adopted
particularly
transparency
requires
that
agencies
ensure
that
their
decisions
are
clearly
articulated
and
the
rationales
for
these
decisions
are
fully
explained
and
the
evidence
on
which
the
decisions
are
based
is
publicly
accessible
n
in
the
united
states
transparency
and
reason
giving
are
embedded
in
a
wide
variety
of
statutory
and
court
constructed
principles
regulatory
agencies
must
for
example
allow
for
public
comment
on
proposed
rules
and
final
rules
must
be
published
in
the
federal
register
along
with
a
separate
statement
providing
clear
justification
of
agencies
policy
choices
n
agencies
also
must
generally
disclose
information
to
the
public
upon
request
n
and
agencies
headed
by
multiple
commissioners
must
generally
make
their
decision
making
meetings
open
to
the
public
n
all
of
these
requirements
have
applied
without
much
interfering
with
traditional
administrative
practices
including
those
in
which
qualitative
decision
processes
by
humans
are
supplemented
with
conventional
quantitative
techniques
by
contrast
basing
regulatory
decisions
on
machine
learning
might
be
viewed
by
some
observers
as
taking
a
step
backwards
and
creating
obfuscation
because
of
learning
algorithms
complexity
and
black
box
nature
how
can
the
seemingly
ineffable
qualities
of
algorithmic
analysis
be
squared
with
principles
of
open
government
if
an
agency
decides
to
adopt
a
rule
because
its
machine
learning
algorithm
said
so
will
that
by
itself
constitute
adequate
justification
when
the
functioning
of
the
algorithm
cannot
be
intuitively
explained
this
section
takes
up
these
and
related
questions
we
conclude
that
well
informed
responsible
use
of
machine
learning
can
be
compatible
with
long
established
principles
of
accountable
and
transparent
administrative
decision
making
even
if
some
algorithmic
components
may
be
exempt
from
public
disclosure
before
delving
into
our
main
argument
though
let
us
briefly
confront
head
on
any
notion
that
the
black
box
nature
of
machine
learning
necessarily
condemns
it
as
being
unlawfully
opaque
although
such
an
initial
conclusion
might
seem
reasonable
from
the
words
black
box
such
a
label
is
a
bit
of
a
misnomer
in
this
context
to
say
that
machine
learning
has
a
black
box
nature
does
not
mean
it
is
completely
impenetrable
to
human
examination
rather
as
discussed
in
section
i
a
it
means
that
machine
learning
methods
for
transforming
inputs
to
outputs
are
not
as
intuitively
interpretable
as
more
traditional
forms
of
data
analysis
n
this
is
different
than
saying
that
no
one
can
know
at
all
how
algorithms
generate
their
predictions
which
we
would
agree
would
undermine
the
transparency
of
any
technique
underlying
administrative
action
machine
learning
can
be
understood
and
explained

can
and
do
possess
full
knowledge
of
algorithms
inner
workings
and
they
can
mathematically
explain
how
these
algorithms
optimize
their
objective
functions
what
they
lack
is
simply
an
interpretive
ability
to
describe
this
optimization
in
conventional
intuitive
terms
they
cannot
say
that
a
machine
learning
analysis
shows
that
x
causes
y
and
therefore
a
government

aiming
to
reduce

this
core

in

the
shift
in
how
easy
it
is
to
grasp
intuitively
the
results
of
machine

algorithms
might
seem
to
mark
an
important
qualitative
change
in
how
governmental
decisions
can
be
explained
when
they
are
based
on
artificial
intelligence
given
the
way
courts
often
defer
to
agency
expertise
in
cases
involving
complex
scientific
and
mathematical
analysis
however
decisions
that
rely
on
machine
learning
are
unlikely
to
be
rejected
by
the
courts
as
insufficiently
reasoned
to
be
sure
administrative
law
has
long
compelled
reason
giving
by
agency
officials
especially
for

a
cornerstone
of
an
accountable

in

the
court
offered
what
is
now
the
canonical
test
for

capricious
review

an

be
arbitrary

capricious
if
the

expect
a

that

the
policy
decision
remains
with
the
agency
rather
than
the

n
thus
in
administrative
applications
of
machine
learning
agencies
will
need
to
disclose
algorithmic
specifications

the

purport

give
agencies
explanations
a
substantial
inquiry
one
that
is
thorough
and
probing
n
consequently
some
uncertainty
especially
in
complex
rulemakings
may
always
exist
over
whether
a
court
will
ultimately
find
an
agency
s
explanations
satisfactory
and
such
uncertainty
may
exist
as
well
when
agencies
engage
in
rulemaking
by
robot
or
adjudication
by
algorithm
still
courts
are
usually
deferential
to
agencies
explanations
especially
when
they
involve
complex
expert
judgments
a
year
after
state
farm
for
example
the
court
reviewed
a
highly
complex
rule
developed
by
the
nuclear
regulatory
commission
nrc
in
which
the
agency
effectively
assumed
that
long
term
storage
of
radioactive
wastes
would
pose
no
environmental
impact
the
court
upheld
the
nrc
action
reasoning
that
a
reviewing
court
must
remember
that
the
commission
is
making
predictions
within
its
area
of
special
expertise
at
the
frontiers
of
science
when
examining
this
kind
of
scientific
determination
as
opposed
to
simple
findings
of
fact
a
reviewing
court
must
generally
be
at
its
most
deferential
n
subsequent
lower
court
decisions
have
exemplified
this
degree
of
deference
to
agencies
scientific
and
mathematical
analyses
for
example
a
district
court
recently
noted
that
t
he
most
important
thing
to
remember
is
that
even
if
plaintiffs
can
poke
some
holes
in
the
agency
s
models
that
does
not
necessarily
preclude
a
conclusion
that
these
models
are
the
best
available
science
some
degree
of
predictive
error
is
inherent
in
the
nature
of
mathematical
modeling
n
similarly
another
district
court
involved
in
a
recent
review
of
an
agency
s
conventional
mathematical
model
noted
that
w
hile
there
seems
to
be
a
reasonable
difference
of
opinion
regarding
whether
the
model
accurately
predicted
concentrations
of
the
chemical
at
issue
it
is
not
within
the
purview
of
this
court
to
weigh
the
evidence
supporting
these
extremely
divergent
scientific
opinions
and
decide
which
of
them
is
correct
n
in
these
and
other
cases
of
dueling
arguments
over
complex
models
agency
expertise
usually
wins
out
and
will
likely
continue
to
do
so

as
machine
learning
becomes
the
more
common

made
the
machine
learning
procedure
known
as
random
forests
truly
innovative
is
not
what
it
maximizes
but
how
it
does
so
when
this
procedure
is
applied
to
predict
the
mean
of
a
quantitative
variable
its
objective
or
loss
function
is
mathematically
identical
to
that
of
an
ordinary
least
squares
regression
n
but
the
unique
methods
for
optimizing
that
loss
function
result
from
years
of
research
similar
methods
developed
by
private
firms
and
applied
to
particular
governmental
loss
functions
can
easily
be
repurposed
to
optimize
other
loss
functions
in
a
way
that
furthers
the
production
of
a
trade
commodity
thereby
rendering
those
optimization
processes
information
relating
to
the
productive
process
itself
n
and
thus
protected
from
disclosure
under
foia
if
these
optimization
processes
are
withheld
but
the
objective
functions
being
optimized
are
disclosed
it
will
be
possible
for
the
public
to
know
the
why
but
not
necessarily
or
fully
the
how
of
the
agencies
underlying
analyses
rules
could
be
adopted
because
the
analysis
shows
that
their
modeled
consequences
result
in
maximization
of
an
agency
s
goals
but
how
exactly
that
maximization
was
computed
could
remain
undisclosed
in
these
ways
when
agencies
attempt
to
exploit
the
predictive
benefits
of
machine
learning
they
may
rely
on
methods
that
can
protect
some
information
from
disclosure
but
these
practices
and
the
resulting
limits
on
disclosure
associated
with
them
are
hardly
unique
or
distinctive
to
machine
learning
even
if
arguably
they
might
become
more
prevalent
with
the
routine
use
of
machine
learning
agencies
would
do
well
when
using
algorithms
to
follow
good
supplementary
disclosure
practices
even
if
they
are
not
compelled
to
do
so
one
such
practice
would
be
the
disclosure
of
all
iterations
of
an
algorithm
or
alternative
algorithms
that
were
considered
their
predictions
and
their
corresponding
specifications
assuming
that
those
specifications
are
not
exempt
from
disclosure
the
end
goal
of
an
algorithm
is
accurate
prediction
via
optimization
of
an
objective
function
determining
which
algorithm
and
specifications
yield
the
most
accurate
predictions
is
often
a
matter
of
trial
and
error
various
algorithms
perform
differently
in
data
sets
and
a
whole
host
of
factors
can
affect
their
accuracy
including
how
many
times
an
algorithm
is
run
before
compiling
results
from
all
runs
what
variables
are
included
in
the
algorithm
and
other
tuning
parameters
that
vary
depending
on
the
algorithm
in
other
words
the
road
to
a
final
algorithm
is
paved
with
many
others
whose
results
ultimately
inform
properties
of
the
final
algorithm
disclosing
the
earlier
runs
would
be
advisable
because
they
would
indicate
that
the
ultimate
methodology
was
chosen
wisely
and
with
consideration
of
possible
alternatives
n
volunteering
how
those
previous
algorithms
were
specified
and
tuned
should
not
reveal
information
that
needs
to
be
exempted
from
disclosure
and
yet
it
would
give
some
insights
into
agencies
deliberative
processes
perhaps
more
importantly
it
would
signal
the
adoption
of
a
presumption
in
favor
of
disclosure
that
exemplifies
good
governmental
practice
n
agencies
could
also
generate
and
release
additional
forms
of
algorithmic
output
that
reveal
information
about
the
structural
properties
of
data
sets
and
the
relationships
among
variables
without
disclosing
exempted
information
such
outputs
might
include
for
example
partial
dependence
plots
which
reveal
the
functional
forms
of
relationships
albeit
with
no
implication
of
causality
between
predictor
variables
and
the
outcome
variable
as
well
as
predictor
importance
plots
which
indicate
roughly
speaking
how
important
each
predictor
variable
is
for
resulting
predictions
n
such
plots
are
tangential
to
the
metric
that
is
key
to
policymaking
based
on
algorithms
predictive
accuracy
and
thus
they
are
not
likely
to
factor
into
rules
in
any
dispositive
way
that
would
make
them
legally
subject
to
disclosure
but
they
can
offer
supplementary
commentary
that
would
further
transparency
by
allowing
interested
parties
to
accrue
some
knowledge
of
information
contained
in
withheld
data
sets
or
algorithms
perhaps
more
importantly
output
such
as
partial
dependence
plots
n
might
provide
some
more
intuitive
explanations
as
to
why
an
algorithm
s
predictions
resulted
which
may
be
valuable
to
courts
or
members
of
the
public
accustomed
to
decisions
based
on
causal
reasoning
n
ultimately
transparency
in
administrative
rulemaking
is
essential
to
avoid
the
creation
of
secret
law
n
and
to
ensure
an
informed
citizenry
vital
to
the
functioning
of
a
democratic
society
needed
to
check
against
corruption
and
to
hold
the
governors
accountable
to
the
governed
n
when
regulations
are
made
based
on
algorithmic
predictions
transparency
of
decision
making
requires
as
much
disclosure
about
the
algorithm
s
specifications
and
its
underlying
data
as
possible
n
however
as
noted
foia
may
often
allow
the
withholding
of
some
data
on
commercial
confidentiality
or
related
grounds
rendering
complete
reproducibility
of
results
difficult
but
if
algorithmic
specifications
can
be
disclosed
so
as
to
make
results
at
least
theoretically
reproducible
then
the
fundamental
goal
of
knowing
how
and
why
decisions
resulted
might
be
satisfied
of
course
those
specifications
themselves
in
particular
the
mathematical
optimization
processes
used
in
a
machine
learning
analysis
could
be
exempted
from
disclosure
as
well
if
they
support
law
enforcement
or
are
developed
by
private
contractors
but
these
are
all
legally
permissible
exemptions
that
have
been
invoked
by
agencies
time
and
again
outside
the
context
of
algorithmic
regulation
as
agencies
move
into
the
era
of
machine
learning
they
may
continue
to
avail
themselves
of
these
same
exemptions
but
would
still
be
required
or
at
least
advised
to
release
an
appropriate
amount
of
information
to
illuminate
what
may
initially
seem
to
be
an
opaque
analytical
process
and
satisfy
prevailing
norms
of
open
government
in
these
ways
agencies
will
also
be
able
to
justify
their
actions
with
sufficient
reasons
to
withstand
charges
that
agencies
have
acted
in
an
arbitrary
or
capricious
manner
iii
the
merits
of
machine
learning
in
the
regulatory
state
the
legal
analysis
presented
in
the
previous
part
indicates
that
when
federal
agencies
use
artificial
intelligence
to
automate
regulatory
and
adjudicatory
decisions
they
will
likely
face
little
difficulty
in
making
machine
learning
practices
fit
within
existing
administrative
and
constitutional
constraints
n
this
analysis
has
taken
place
against
a
backdrop
of
growing
concern
over
the
proliferation
of
machine
learning
and
artificial
intelligence
which
may
make
our
conclusions
surprising
if
not
a
bit
disquieting
to
some
readers
after
all
as
we
noted
at
the
outset
of
this
article
technologists
and
sociologists
alike
worry
about
the
consequences
of
algorithmic
automation
spreading
throughout
society
bringing
with
it
the
possibility
that
highly
skilled
jobs
will
be
taken
over
by
machines
n
as
super
intelligent
computers
surpass
the
capacities
of
humans
n
these
anxieties
will
undoubtedly
grow
only
more
fevered
when
artificial
intelligence
falls
into
the
hands
of
government
officials
such
as
when
it
is
used
in
predictive
policing
n
or
in
what
has
been
called
the
crossing
of
a
moral
rubicon
in
target
selecting
military
drones
n
if
the
significant
governmental
power
wielded
by
administrative
agencies
could
also
be
taken
over
by
autonomous
algorithms
then
surely
society
would
face
a
grave
specter
of
lives
and
livelihoods
being
regulated
by
robots
notwithstanding
these
ominous
warnings
actual
technological
capabilities
are
hardly
so
threatening
for
much
the
same
reason
that
science
alone
can
never
make
policy
decisions
n
machine
learning
algorithms
need
humans
to
specify
their
objective
functions
and
construct
the
mathematical
processes
that
will
maximize
them
n
although
machine
learning
could
replace
or
supplement
many
routine
governmental
tasks
the
oversight
and
direction
of
the
government
will
remain
in
human
hands
even
in
the
machine
learning
era
society
s
most
consequential
regulatory
decisions
are
not
routine
and
therefore
will
almost
surely
prove
to
be
unsuitable
candidates
for
automation
these
most
significant
regulatory
policy
decisions
present
complexities
uncertainties
and
value
judgments
that
will
resist
the
kind
of
specification
needed
to
embed
them
in
mathematical
objective
functions
machine
learning
analysis
will
be
able
to
assist
only
by
informing
the
most
significant
of
regulatory
choices
not
by
determining
them
n
the
more
routine
decisions
that
algorithms
will
be
able
to
make
will
surely
affect
people
s
lives
and
livelihoods
but
in
these
cases
machine
learning
applications
will
be
designed
to
meet
human
officials
specifications
and
will
ultimately
remain
under
human
control
autonomous
robots
will
not
be
wielding
regulatory
power
on
their
own
for
the
reasons
we
have
explained
nothing
about
algorithms
makes
them
uniquely
or
automatically
unsuitable
for
use
by
administrative
agencies
in
terms
of
their
ability
to
comport
with
core
legal
principles
although
machine
learning
systems
can
fit
quite
comfortably
within
existing
constitutional
and
administrative
law
this
does
not
mean
that
their
use
will
always
be
warranted
n
it
especially
does
not
mean
that
agencies
should
use
machine
learning
in
a
haphazard
or
irresponsible
manner
agencies
will
have
to
act
with
care
and
in
designing
and
implementing
their
algorithms
consider
potential
pitfalls
and
areas
of
concern
in
the
following
two
sections
we
briefly
discuss
how
several
key
policy
issues
and
good
government
principles
apply
to
machine
learning
applications
the
policy
issues
relate
to
the
four
legal
doctrines
discussed
earlier
nondelegation
due
process
antidiscrimination
and
transparency
the
other
principles
of
good
government
apply
more
generally
to
the
exploitation
of
algorithms
by
those
in
positions
of
power
only
by
engaging
in
a
thorough
case
by
case
evaluation
of
such
non
binding
but
vital
considerations
will
agencies
ensure
that
their
use
of
machine
learning
conforms
not
just
to
the
law
but
also
to
foundational
principles
of
sound
and
legitimate
public
policy
a
related
public
policy
concerns
in
the
previous
part
we
demonstrated
that
in
principle
agencies
machine
learning
algorithms
should
withstand
legal
challenges
based
on
doctrines
of
nondelegation
due
process
antidiscrimination
and
transparency
of
course
an
escape
from
judicial
censure
does
not
necessarily
guarantee
that
the
algorithms
will
be
fully
consonant
with
the
public
policy
principles
underlying
those
doctrines
some
of
the
policy
concerns
animating
the
legal
doctrines
discussed
in
part
ii
still
deserve
attention
if
agencies
are
to
use
machine
learning
in
a
responsible
manner
for
instance
we
noted
that
one
of
the
nondelegation
doctrine
s
motivating
goals
ensuring
political
accountability
has
prompted
some
scholars
to
advocate
that
the
courts
should
give
more
deference
when
an
agency
head
makes
the
key
decision
than
when
decisions
are
made
by
subordinate
officials
n
the
courts
have
not
embraced
such
a
graduated
approach
but
its
suggestion
should
prompt
agency
officials
to
consider
how
machine
learning
may
affect
the
locus
of
decision
making
inside
their
agencies
when
rules
are
intimately
tied
to
the
outputs
of
an
algorithm
the
programming
of
that
algorithm
will
be
a
consequential
task
one
that
presumably
should
not
be
assigned
exclusively
to
a
lowerlevel
analyst
as
traditional
statistical
analyses
may
be
today
assigning
responsibility
to
lower
level
analysts
without
adequate
input
and
oversight
could
run
the
risk
that
higher
level
officials
those
who
are
more
directly
accountable
to
the
political
branches
of
government
and
to
the
public
will
not
fully
understand
critical
details
about
an
already
ostensibly
opaque
rulemaking
process
perhaps
worse
the
lower
level
analysts
could
make
choices
about
an
algorithm
s
specifications
and
tuning
without
realizing
potentially
far
reaching
impacts
of
their
decisions
n
for
these
reasons
agencies
should
be
mindful
of
who
within
an
agency
actually
wields
algorithm
specifying
power
and
how
well
high
level
officials
understand
the
methods
of
regulating
by
robot
or
adjudicating
by
algorithm
our
discussion
of
due
process
similarly
suggests
that
there
is
no
reason
to
view
adjudicatory
algorithms
as
uniquely
threatening
to
fair
hearings
still
agencies
will
need
to
proceed
thoughtfully
and
with
care
n
agencies
may
need
to
delay
the
deployment
of
their
algorithms
to
get
a
sense
of
how
well
the
test
data
error
rates
correspond
with
decision
reversal
rates
the
metric
underlying
the
existing
body
of
relevant
case
law
furthermore
agencies
should
increasingly
seek
out
and
engage
neutral
statistical
experts
to
provide
dispassionate
assessments
of
consequential
uses
of
algorithms
individuals
challenging
an
agency
s
deprivation
of
their
rights
or
property
cannot
be
expected
to
mount
a
sufficiently
probing
search
for
an
algorithm
s
potential
inadequacies
and
biases
either
on
their
own
or
with
the
help
of
skilled
but
mathematically
na
xef
ve
counsel
even
if
not
legally
required
agencies
should
still
undertake
the
kind
of
probing
inquiry
needed
to
minimize
possible
errors
and
biases
associated
with
any
algorithms
they
use
agencies
must
also
take
note
of
the
potential
for
their
algorithms
to
cause
a
disproportionate
impact
on
members
of
certain
classes
or
groups
despite
the
probable
constitutionality
under
the
fifth
amendment
of
the
use
of
such
algorithms
n
of
all
the
policy
concerns
related
to
the
legal
doctrines
discussed
in
this
article
the
possibility
of
disproportionate
impacts
may
be
the
most
acute
in
the
popular
and
academic
media
commentators
have
noted
the
ways
in
which
algorithmic
bias
can
manifest
itself
n
a
series
of
violent
interactions
between
police
and
african
americans
over
the
last
few
years
has
prompted
public
worry
of
pervasive
discrimination
by
governmental
authorities
n
agencies
should
thus
seek
ways
of
mitigating
algorithms
disparate
impact
but
they
should
do
so
not
just
as
a
response
to
this
public
alarm
but
also
as
a
matter
of
ethical
governance
if
discrimination
no
matter
how
unintentional
can
be
avoided
it
should
be
recent
advances
in
statistics
as
noted
earlier
may
provide
agencies
with
powerful
mitigating
tools
but
agencies
will
still
need
to
balance
tradeoffs
with
forecasting
accuracy
n
finally
we
have
shown
that
agencies
should
have
no
problem
disclosing
sufficient
information
to
meet
the
reason
giving
and
transparency
requirements
of
the
apa
and
foia
n
nevertheless
disclosing
the
bare
minimum
probably
just
the
objective
functions
and
limited
aspects
of
algorithms
specifications
should
not
be
the
ultimate
goal
of
an
open
forthcoming
administrative
state
agencies
should
begin
developing
practices
for
documenting
retaining
and
disclosing
developmental
algorithm
specifications
and
final
algorithm
supplemental
output
to
increase
transparency
and
facilitate
peer
review
n
b
other
good
government
principles
in
addition
to
policy
concerns
related
to
the
four
legal
doctrines
analyzed
in
part
ii
several
other
good
government
principles
should
be
considered
by
agencies
when
using
machine
learning
these
principles
relate
to
challenges
associated
with
quantification
permissible
error
lack
of
empathy
job
losses
and
privacy
first
agencies
should
recognize
that
the
use
of
algorithms
will
often
compel
agency
decision
makers
to
engage
in
quantitative
coding
of
value
judgments
that
have
typically
been
made
qualitatively
for
example
machine
learning
algorithms
often
permit
the
specification
of
their
cost
ratios
the
ratio
of
false
positives
to
false
negatives
n
this
is
a
concrete
unambiguous
quantification
of
agencies
relative
normative
values
of
their
errors
for
agencies
not
accustomed
to
making
moral
valuations
through
any
kind
of
formal
process
let
alone
one
that
assigns
them
numbers
machine
learning
algorithms
will
necessitate
addressing
questions
of
organizational
and
democratic
decision
making
who
should
have
the
power
to
transform
qualitative
moral
judgments
into
a
cost
ratio
should
agencies
involve
the
public
or
at
least
make
interested
parties
aware
of
a
transformation
from
qualitative
to
a
quantitative
assessment
of
errors
and
algorithmic
tradeoffs
is
such
a
transformation
even
possible
or
are
human
deliberations
over
morality
too
nuanced
to
be
reduced
to
a
matrix
of
error
rates
n
agencies
will
have
to
confront
not
only
the
challenges
of
making
accurate
quantifications
of
error
rates
but
also
contend
with
a
host
of
relevant
normative
questions
about
quantification
as
they
proceed
into
the
machine
learning
era
second
agencies
will
have
to
decide
what
constitutes
acceptable
algorithmic
error
rates
this
will
go
beyond
the
due
process
related
assessment
of
whether
courts
will
consider
algorithm
error
rates
acceptable
instead
it
requires
agencies
to
ask
how
large
gains
in
accuracy
must
be
to
offset
other
difficulties
in
implementing
algorithmic
systems
such
issues
would
likely
arise
in
the
context
of
benefit
cost
analyses
that
agencies
conduct
prior
to
taking
important
actions
for
example
how
much
would
say
a
five
percent
increase
in
accuracy
when
predicting
hazardous
waste
pipeline
incidents
save
an
agency
in
inspection
costs
would
these
savings
be
worth
the
necessary
investments
in
human
capital
and
data
infrastructure
and
beyond
the
internal
difficulties
faced
by
agencies
would
the
public
demand
particularly
large
increases
in
accuracy
to
compensate
for
the
novelty
and
potentially
alarming
nature
of
robotic
systems
of
regulation
or
adjudication
n
is
a
marginal
improvement
over
the
status
quo
acceptable
or
should
agencies
strive
for
something
more
third
we
should
consider
what
happens
to
human
contact
in
a
world
of
robotic
regulators
and
algorithmic
adjudicators
citizens
expect
their
government
to
be
competent
and
efficient
but
they
also
tend
to
view
governmental
institutions
as
more
legitimate
when
these
institutions
operate
with
understanding
and
empathy
n
the
idea
of
the
government
reducing
individuals
to
data
points
that
are
then
fed
into
an
algorithm
will
seem
disconcertingly
impersonal
even
if
ultimately
more
accurate
and
efficient
administrative
officials
that
use
algorithms
should
seek
to
listen
to
interested
members
of
the
public
as
they
design
systems
for
rulemaking
by
robot
or
adjudicating
by
algorithm
these
officials
should
also
encourage
participation
through
interactive
methods
that
treat
beneficiaries
targets
of
regulation
and
all
other
affected
parties
with
respect
and
dignity
n
fourth
government
should
not
turn
a
blind
eye
to
the
possibility
that
widespread
use
of
algorithms
will
put
many
government
workers
out
of
their
jobs
n
the
extent
to
which
agencies
workforces
will
shrink
as
a
result
of
adopting
machine
learning
is
unclear
as
we
have
noted
human
input
will
still
be
necessary
at
many
steps
of
regulatory
and
adjudicatory
processes
even
when
automated
n
but
there
can
be
little
doubt
that
the
structures
of
agencies
workforces
will
change
if
day
to
day
operations
begin
to
take
drastically
different
forms
due
to
automated
decision
making
with
over
million
full
time
employees
in
the
executive
branch
of
the
federal
government
n
and
many
more
working
for
government
contractors
large
scale
automation
efforts
may
be
appropriately
combined
with
proactive
job
training
for
workers
who
might
seek
positions
in
the
future
in
algorithm
support
responsibilities
finally
although
throughout
this
article
we
have
self
consciously
eschewed
a
discussion
of
privacy
concerns
for
reasons
noted
earlier
n
agencies
still
must
never
overlook
these
concerns
administrative
agencies
are
poised
to
collect
more
data
on
individuals
with
each
passing
day
agencies
must
properly
and
securely
store
these
data
to
minimize
threats
to
privacy
intrusions
especially
when
many
administrative
applications
of
machine
learning
will
require
inter
agency
sharing
through
the
cloud
n
agencies
may
also
increasingly
seek
individuals
data
from
sources
outside
of
the
united
states
which
will
require
careful
consideration
of
jurisdictional
questions
n
c
a
path
forward
the
issues
we
have
raised
in
the
preceding
two
sections
should
be
addressed
as
part
of
agencies
case
by
case
assessments
and
benefit
cost
analyses
of
specific
applications
of
machine
learning
agency
and
cross
agency
decisions
about
when
and
how
to
implement
machine
learning
will
benefit
from
clear
guidance
on
how
to
assess
machine
learning
s
merits
n
the
administrative
conference
of
the
united
states
the
national
academy
of
public
administration
or
the
national
academy
of
sciences
might
be
able
to
help
in
developing
guidelines
when
agencies
ultimately
apply
such
guidelines
and
conduct
benefit
cost
analysis
of
specific
machine
learning
applications
we
can
expect
administrative
algorithms
will
prove
extremely
promising
in
some
instances
and
less
advantageous
in
others
n
agencies
should
be
suitably
discerning
and
pursue
machine
learning
applications
when
they
can
lead
to
meaningful
improvements
in
procedural
and
substantive
outcomes
recognition
of
the
need
for
careful
consideration
and
reasonable
safeguards
when
agencies
use
algorithms
should
not
lead
to
any
presumption
against
using
machine
learning
entirely
these
techniques
are
becoming
ubiquitous
in
private
industry
for
good
reason
their
ability
to
make
accurate
predictions
of
complex
phenomena
can
render
decision
making
vastly
more
effective
and
efficient
and
it
would
be
wise
for
administrative
agencies
also
to
seek
these
benefits
n
still
accountable
managers
must
carefully
oversee
their
use
of
algorithms
even
in
the
private
sector
n
and
they
must
take
possible
unintended
consequences
into
account
n
the
same
can
be
said
of
all
innovative
practices
the
need
to
weigh
the
pros
and
cons
of
algorithms
is
in
no
way
qualitatively
different
than
the
weighing
of
benefits
and
costs
needed
to
inform
other
administrative
choices
n
including
those
prompted
by
other
technological
advancements
n
thoughtful
implementation
is
always
advisable
for
the
adoption
of
any
new
administrative
technology
or
process
deciding
how
and
when
to
use
machine
learning
may
not
come
easily
which
may
make
agency
efforts
to
facilitate
public
participation
in
decisions
about
the
use
of
machine
learning
even
more
important
it
would
certainly
be
better
to
take
additional
time
to
engage
in
robust
public
consultation
and
make
thoughtful
decisions
about
machine
learning
s
use
than
to
dismiss
algorithms
out
of
hand
over
exaggerated
fears
about
unleashing
artificial
intelligence
demons
n
technological
and
analytical
advances
are
continually
invented
and
adopted
because
despite
their
potential
limitations
they
offer
the
possibility
to
transform
society
for
the
better
the
implementation
of
machine
learning
algorithms
by
administrative
agencies
certainly
possesses
such
potential
with
proper
forethought
and
care
guided
by
the
kind
of
analysis
we
have
provided
throughout
this
article
an
administrative
state
on
the
cutting
edge
of
statistical
innovation
can
be
legally
and
responsibly
realized
moving
in
this
direction
can
deliver
marked
improvements
in
overall
well
being
especially
as
the
government
faces
new
challenges
in
overseeing
a
private
sector
that
has
already
entered
the
machine
learning
era
conclusion
we
have
considered
a
future
american
administrative
state
increasingly
driven
by
machine
learning
algorithms
such
a
future
may
not
look
like
the
glamorously
or
ominously
automated
picture
painted
by
popular
media
coverage
of
artificial
intelligence
but
it
nonetheless
could
entail
significant
changes
in
how
the
government
functions
whether
in
making
certain
rules
or
in
applying
and
enforcing
them
administrative
agencies
have
begun
to
take
steps
toward
such
a
future
and
our
analysis
offers
support
to
agencies
that
seek
to
venture
further
into
this
new
era
of
administration
agencies
that
rely
on
machine
learning
algorithms
are
unlikely
to
face
unique
insurmountable
legal
barriers
at
least
not
under
the
key
legal
principles
of
the
administrative
state
that
we
have
assessed
here
by
establishing
the
legality
of
the
use
of
machine
learning
we
believe
our
analysis
clears
away
one
of
the
more
significant
hurdles
to
its
further
implementation
of
course
although
our
legal
analysis
supports
agency
use
of
machine
learning
we
recognize
that
agencies
will
need
as
with
any
management
or
policy
choice
to
exercise
care
in
how
and
when
they
deploy
new
technology
and
will
need
to
build
the
human
capital
and
information
technology
infrastructure
to
support
rulemaking
by
robot
and
adjudication
by
algorithm
n
to
admit
the
need
for
such
diligence
in
execution
however
is
no
reason
for
preemptively
shying
away
from
the
benefits
from
government
agencies
deployment
of
the
latest
statistical
advancements
if
agencies
encounter
public
hesitancy
about
governmental
use
of
artificial
intelligence
perhaps
that
anxiety
will
stem
from
a
perception
of
machine
learning
algorithms
as
fundamentally
different
in
kind
from
existing
decisionmaking
processes
something
about
the
phrase
black
box
a
common
description
of
machine
learning
techniques
may
make
machine
learning
sound
incompatible
with
notions
of
accountable
government
but
it
would
be
more
accurate
to
view
machine
learning
algorithms
or
any
other
statistical
procedures
not
as
complete
black
boxes
but
rather
as
extensions
of
existing
human
decision
making
after
all
human
cognition
and
computerized
algorithms
may
process
information
in
certain
foundationally
similar
ways
n
the
latter
are
black
box
in
nature
simply
because
they
are
qualitatively
speaking
more
complex
and
less
intuitively
understandable
than
conventional
techniques
perhaps
also
much
like
human
decision
making
democratic
government
itself
in
a
collective
sense
is
decision
making
according
to
the
algorithm
of
majority
rule
the
constitution
s
establishment
of
a
bicameral
legislature
and
a
system
of
checks
and
balances
established
a
complex
decision
making
algorithm
involving
hundreds
of
officials
elected
by
millions
of
voters
with
the
passage
of
time
congress
presidents
and
agencies
have
imposed
their
own
layers
of
procedures
for
their
work
that
are
arguably
as
complex
and
counterintuitive
as
any
machine
learning
algorithm
n
just
as
some
messiness
and
ineffability
in
collective
decision
making
may
be
the
price
of
the
benefits
of
democracy
difficulty
intuiting
machine
learning
results
may
be
a
relatively
small
price
to
pay
for
more
accurate
and
effective
decisions
in
the
administrative
state
with
the
advent
of
artificial
intelligence
s
widespread
application
throughout
all
other
realms
of
society
it
will
not
be
long
before
the
administrative
state
moves
headlong
to
confront
the
questions
we
have
analyzed
in
this
article
for
administrative
agencies
what
will
distinguish
the
machine
learning
era
is
not
a
substitution
of
human
judgment
with
some
foreign
and
unfamiliar
methodology
but
rather
an
evolution
of
human
judgment
to
incorporate
fundamentally
similar
albeit
more
accurate
and
often
practically
more
useful
processes
of
decision
making
made
possible
by
advances
in
statistical
knowledge
data
storage
and
digital
computing
the
analysis
offered
here
provides
an
antidote
to
visceral
reactions
against
the
use
of
artificial
intelligence
in
the
public
sector
reactions
we
hope
will
give
way
to
a
measured
optimism
capable
of
guiding
and
improving

future

the

process
and
the
good
cause
exception
to
it
is
provided
at
u
s
c
it
is
important
to
recognize
that
we
have
adopted
a
formulation
of
algorithm
created
rules
resembling
that
of
rules
as
they
exist
today
an
algorithm
would
promulgate
rules
specifying
a
particular
course
of
action
a
particular
safety
standard
a
particular
acceptable
emissions
level
or
so
forth
under
this
formulation
any
changes
to
an
algorithm
that
result
in
a
different
prescription
including
merely
re
running
the
algorithm
as
specified
on
new
data
would
necessitate
a
new
rulemaking
process
absent
a
good
cause
exemption
but
because
machine
learning
is
likely
to
be
of
most
utility
when
engaged
to
regulate
dynamic
time
sensitive
environments
it
is
probable
that
such
an
exemption
could
often
or
even
categorically
be
claimed
an
alternative
formulation
might
be
one
in
which
rules
state
merely
that
an
algorithm
will
be
used
to
promulgate
prescriptions
continuously
instead
of
a
rule
reciting
a
particular
course
of
action
or
safety
standard
on
the
basis
of
algorithmic
output
the
rule
would
say
that
a
future
algorithm
will
run
continuously
and
be
updated
dynamically
to
decide
the
appropriate
course
of
action
or
safety
standard
in
the
future
cf
coglianese
supra
note
at
noting
the
possibility
of
a
reconceptualization
of
the
form
in
which
rules
are
promulgated
such
a
formulation
probably
would
not
necessitate
that
a
new
rulemaking
be
commenced
whenever
the
algorithm
is
updated
but
it
might
be
legally
problematic

the
need
for

transparency

natural

probably
write

could
plausibly

we
also
do
not
focus
on
privacy
concerns
because
they
are
not
unique
to
administrative
agencies
use
of
machine

our
principal
concern
here
is
with
issues
that
are
distinctively
applicable
to
the
use
of
machine
learning
in
the
administrative
state
furthermore
many
of
machine
learning
s
privacy
implications
could
be
more
accurately
characterized
as
implications
of
the
use
of
big
data
although
algorithms
themselves
may
make
possible
new
kinds
of
inferences
this
ability
is
manifested
only
in
large
data
sets
so
the
underlying
privacy
problems
that
others
have
flagged
appear
to
have
been
raised
more
by
the
collection
of
big
data
than
by
the
use
of
machine
learning
algorithms
per
se
n
note
that
this
limited
autonomy
also
implies
given
our
description
of
how
machine
learning
operates
the
potential
for
algorithms
to
yield
unexpected
seemingly
original
outcomes
also
although
we
have
chosen
to
use
and
qualify
the
term
autonomy
other
legal
literature
on

refers
with
good

to
similarly

receive

they
argued
that

more

to
arise
when

have
a

if

followed
their
approach
in
cases
challenging
a
subdelegation
to
a
machine

perhaps
such
a
system
should
receive
additional
scrutiny
when
only
low

agency

specify
the
objective
functions
and
other
normative
choices
embedded

such
an
approach
would
calibrate

an

however
this

it

whether
within

we

categorically
different

in
contexts
where
one
class
is
advantaged
it
is
awarded
benefits
or
allowed
to
avoid

another
is

but
the
underlying
conceptual
formulation
of
categorically
different
treatment
also
applies
to
instances
in
which
the
attached
benefits

burdens
of
governmental
treatment
are

evident

the

with

mates
of

no
prisoners
of
particular
races
were
burdened
any
more
than
others
but
the
court
explicitly
stated
that
allowing
this
action
to
escape
strict
scrutiny
ignores
our
repeated
command
that
racial
classifications
receive
close
scrutiny
even
when
they
may
be
said
to
burden
or
benefit
the
races
equally
johnson

u

it
should
be

that
this

categorically
different

even

categorically
different
allocation
of

which
the
feared
equal
protection
violation
would
result
from
a
prohibition
not
of
disparate
impacts
but
of
animus
nonetheless
the
court
s
general
hesitancy
to
allow
ex
post
disparate
treatment
calls
into
question
whether
ex
post
rectifications
of
an
algorithm
s
disparate
impacts
would
be
permissible
n
in
reaching
this
conclusion
we
have
noted
several
uncertainties
that
exist
from
a
lack
of
clarity
surrounding
the
meaning
of
suspect
classification
to
the
uncertain
acceptability
of
ex
post
modifications
of
algorithms
with
disparate
impacts
such
uncertainties
are
representative
of
the
broader
ferment
that
has
characterized
and
continues
to
characterize
equal
protection
doctrine
and
it
is
in
the
context
of
this
ferment
that
our
conclusion
should
be
understood
perhaps
these
difficulties
in
obtaining
clarity
about
the
meaning
of
equal
protection
are
not
due
to
any
easily
rectifiable
inadequacies
in
law
but
simply
to
the
problem
of
defining
in
a
more
normative
sense
what
equality
actually
means
for
example
many
conceptions
of
equality
rest
on
the
notion
that
persons
similarly
circumstanced
shall
be
treated
alike
f
s
royster
guano
co
v
virginia
u
s
but
some
scholarship
has
argued
that
such
a
statement
is
circular
and
devoid
of
any
real
moral
thrust
the
only
coherent
way
to
define
two
individuals
as
being
alike
may
not
be
to
say
that
they
are
alike
in
any
empirical
way
but
to
say
that
they
are
morally
alike
in
that
they
should
be
treated
alike
but
then
a
determination
of
who
should
be
treated
alike
is
external
to
equality
and
must
be
derived
from
conceptions
of
rights
or
other
moral
principles
see
peter
westen
the
empty
idea
of
equality
harv

rev
this
difficulty
of
defining
equality
has
practical
implications
not
only
for
understanding
equal
protection
doctrine
but
also
for
the
ways
that
agencies
should
implement
machine
learning
to
counter
potential
problems
of
unfairness
mathematical
definitions
of
equality
must
be
grounded
in
a
moral
definition
of
equality
to
be
responsive
to
moral
concerns
about
discrimination

said
commander
jorge

rodriguez
from
the
los

police
department
lapd
comdr
rodriguez
was
a
guest
speaker
yesterday
at
the
interpol
world
congress
he
shared
the
lapd
s
experience
by
presenting
a
case
study
highlighting
the
use
of
predpol
a
predictive
policing
software
that
pinpoints
crime
hot
spots
based
on
historical
data
like
crime
type
location
and

comdr
rodriguez
who
heads
eight
police
stations
in
los
angeles
california
had
told
the
straits
times
a
day
earlier
that
predictive
policing
helps
narrow
the
likelihood
of
a
crime
occurring
in
areas
depicted
by
a
feet

box
which
works

he
said
so
what
we
tell
our
officers
as
they
re
driving
from
point
a

point
b
through
the
city
is
know
where
these
boxes
are

them

you
can

at

los

police
divisions
property
crimes
decreased
he
said
but
he
emphasised
that
predpol
should
be
used
only
to
augment
police
operations
comdr
rodriguez
who
became
a
police
officer
in
said
no
matter
what
technology
you
have
or
how
advanced
you
get
you
ll
still
need
the
human
element
and
cooperation
from
the
community
human
intel
cannot
be
replaced
by
anything
else
while
there
are
fears
that
predictive
policing
might
infringe
on
civil
liberties
the
greater
concern
now
facing
the
lapd
is
perhaps
the
increase
in
violent
crimes
a
los
angeles
times
report
last
december
stated
that
violent
crime
figures
had
risen
for
a
third
straight
year
in
the
wake
of
homicides
and
gang
related
shootings
which
resulted
in
people
being
killed
in
the
city
though
the
number
is
lower
when
compared
with
the
killed
a
decade
ago
unfortunately
property
crime
figures
have
gone
up
too
comdr
rodriguez
attributed
the
rise
to
the
decriminalisation
of
some
offences
he
added
a
lot
of
crime
penalties
have
been
lowered
from
felonies
to
misdemeanours
for
property
crimes
these
individuals
know
the
time
they
re
going
to
get
is
minimal
when
it
comes
to
sentencing
right
now
the
biggest
problem
we
have
is
the
drug
problem
with
the
legalisation
of
marijuana
in
states
like
colorado
oregon
and
california
crime
figures
are
expected
to
rise
more
he
said
you

despite
hegel

premise
it
never
seemed
inevitable
that
the
emergence
of
mass
incarceration
as
a
proper
historical
subject
would
occur
simultaneously
with
its
institutional
and
political
demise
history
as
a
scientific
and
humanistic
tradition
with
its
own
methodologies
sources
and
conventions
inevitably
keeps
some
distance
on
the
present
typically
a
generation
or
two
has
passed
before
a
truly
significant
political
development
like
the
new
deal
or
the
cold
war
escapes
the
pull
of
presentist
hagiography
or
demonology
and
comes
under
the
full
possession
of
professional
historical
gaze
after
journalism
and
political
science
have
had
their
varying
efforts
at
neutralizing
the
present
in
contrast
the
point
at
which
a
significant
political
phenomenon
has
lost
its
dominance
over
the
present
is
a
much
less
regular
or
inevitable
pattern
n
and
yet
the
recent
wave
of
historical
analysis
of
mass
incarceration
a
development
that
began
in
the
s
happens
to
be
emerging
at
a
moment
of
political
questioning
more
profound
than
at
any
time
since
the
late
s
and
early
s
from
the
supreme
court
s
powerful
condemnation
of
california
s
overcrowding
n
to
the
black
lives
matter
movement
s
growing
presence
in
the
streets
and
voting
booths
of
major
cities
the
contemporary
carceral
state
is
under
attack
while
there
is
no
guarantee
that
we
will
in
fact
see
substantial
institutional
change
in
the
size
and
nature
of
the
carceral
state
the
emerging
historiography
of
mass
incarceration
has
been
shaped
by
the
very
possibility
of
that
change
and
has
lessons
that
could
be
crucial
in
strengthening
the
growing
movement
for
reform
elizabeth
hinton
s
impeccably
researched
study
of
federal
crime
policy
from
the
kennedy
through
reagan
administrations
is
the
most
telling
account
yet
of
this
new
history
of
the
american
carceral
state
n
this
has
been
a
topic
of
considerable
interest
to
political
scientists
and
criminologists
since
the
s
n
but
hinton
is
able
to
draw
on
confidential
memos
and
other
materials
from
the
national
archives
and
presidential
libraries
to
draw
a
far
more
precise
picture
than
ever
before
of
what
national
leaders
believed
they
knew
about
crime
and
how
they
intended
to
act
on
the
problem
her
account
likely
to
be
the
most
definitive
one
for
years
to
come
confirms
the
centrality
of
political
considerations
to
the
shaping
of
mass
incarceration
as
urged
by
earlier
studies
while
giving
us
a
much
more
detailed
and
pointed
analysis
of
what
those
political
considerations
were
in
particular
hinton
s
analysis
places
concern
over
the
political
and
social
threat
of
collective
violence
by
black
youth
growing
up
in
segregated
neighborhoods
of
concentrated
poverty
at
the
very
heart
of
crime
as
a
national
problem
n
and
as
the
focal
point
of
increasingly
punitive
solutions
from
kennedy
to
bush
i
and
if
her
history
continued
through
both
bushes
n
trying
to
prevent
black
youth
from
turning
to
crime
and
contain
those
involved
with
crime
with
aggressive
policing
and
excessive
incarceration
became
in
many
respects
america
s
chief
domestic
objective
from
the
vietnam
war
to
the
wars
in
iraq
and
afghanistan
n
this
obsessive
fear
of
black
youth
and
totalizing
national
commitment
to
their
surveillance
and
control
makes
all
of
the
contemporary
talk
from
national
leaders
about
trying
to
rebuild
trust
between
police
and
young
people
of
color
ludicrous
so
long
as
the
war
on
crime
continues
hinton
s
study
comes
at
a
time
when
most
of
the
action
from
scholars
in
trying
to
explain
mass
incarceration
has
moved
to
state
and
even
local
levels
n
while
the
carceral
state
in
our
federalist
system
is
primarily
one
of
state
and
local
governments
hinton
s
account
begins
during
a
period
when
the
federal
government
particularly
its
executive
branch
made
a
concerted
effort
to
alter
the
size
and
character
of
local
criminal
justice
agencies
including
police
departments
courts
and
correctional
systems
throughout
the
united
states
n
premised
on
what
was
depicted
as
a
serious
and
growing
threat
of
violent
crime
localized
in
large
cities
throughout
the
nation
the
war
on
crime
involved
the
dispersal
of
billions
of
dollars
nearly
two
billion
per
year
in
contemporary
dollars
three
quarters
of
which
went
into
policing
between
and
n
as
well
as
the
creation
of
model
laws
and
policies
that
the
money
helped
to
promote
policies
that
had
previously
been
considered
unwise
or
unconstitutional
including
preventive
pretrial
detention
and
mandatory
minimum
sentences
n
political
scientists
studying
the
war
on
crime
in
its
early
stages
already
concluded
it
had
largely
failed
in
its
goals
of
improving
the
effectiveness
of
law
enforcement
or
reducing
crime
something
hinton
s
research
reaffirms
n
but
as
hinton
documents
it
was
an
enormously
successful
exercise
in
state
building
n
creating
fear
as
a
byproduct
of
its
success
at
putting
crime
at
the
very
center
of
american
life
the
war
on
crime
became
self
perpetuating
and
continued
during
the
first
two
decades
of
this
century
even
as
crime
indexes
dropped
to
historic
lows
n
and
fear
of
crime
largely
diminished
as
a
national
political
issue
only
today
a
half
century
after
the
key
events
and
decisions
that
produced
the
war
on
crime
and
in
the
face
of
repeated
scandals
of
racism
inhumanity
and
failure

the

although
historiographical
research
time
frames
based
in
large
part
on
archival
access
policies
determine
that
her
narrative
ends
some
twenty
five
years
prior
to

n
hinton
s
themes
connect
directly
to
the
growing
discontent
with
the
systems
of
punitive
policing
and
mass
incarceration

carry
clear
implications
for
those
who
would
seek
to
reform
or
radically
change
those
systems
chillingly
for
reformers
and
radicals
alike
almost
all
of
the
ideas
being
circulated
in
the
name
of
reforming
the
carceral
state
today
were
already
parts
of
the
thinking
that
shaped
the
war
on
crime
and
are
thus
quite
unlikely
to
alter
its
fundamental
character
after
reviewing
hinton
s
major
findings
this
book
review
turns
first
to
hinton
s
historiographical
contributions
and
second
to
her
lessons
for
those
who
would
like
to
make
history
by
ending

incarceration
i
from
war
on
poverty
to
war
on
crime
in
hinton
s
convincing
account
the
road
from
a
federal
campaign
to
eliminate
entrenched
poverty
in
the
united
states
to
a
much
larger
one
aimed
at
fighting
crime
by
policing
and
punishing
people
in
poverty
was
a
remarkably
short
one
and
the
long
war
on
crime
and
drugs
pursued
since
then
has
been
a
boringly
repetitive
one
n
from
its
beginnings
in
the
kennedy
administration
the
war
on
poverty
was
braided
closely
with
questions
of
crime
and
particularly
delinquency
n
the
latter
was
taken
to
be
a
product
of
lacking
opportunities
for
integration
into
the
mainstream
of
social
and
economic
life
in
combination
with
the
reinforcing
stigma
of
criminalization
and
punishment
n
the
attempted
solutions
were
efforts
to
accelerate
the
exposure
of
these
same
youths
to
mainstreaming
opportunities
the
upbeat
name
for
this
concept
was
mobilization
for
youth
a
program
aimed
at
young
people
generally
in
poor
neighborhoods
n
at
its
most
ambitious
level
and
never
in
more
than
a
small
portion
of
the
nation
s
needy
areas
this
effort
placed
federal
grants
into
the
hands
of
frontline
antipoverty
organizations
and
community
organizers
community
action
workers
in
the
terminology
of
the
moment
to
socially
organize
and
politically
empower
poor
families
and
communities
n
five
years
later
in
the
johnson
administration
and
despite
that
president
having
made
an
even
louder
commitment
to
waging
war
on
poverty
than
his
predecessor
efforts
to
mobilize
youth
in
poverty
had
been
substantially
superseded
and
assimilated
into
a
far
larger
effort
to
maintain
surveillance
and
control
over
black
youth
living
in
neighborhoods
of
concentrated
poverty
n
this
newly
dubbed
war
on
crime
was
to
be
run
through
the
law
enforcement
oriented
department
of
justice
and
its
foot
soldiers
rather
than
community
action
workers
were
big
city
police
forces
n
perhaps
the
most
antiblack
organized
force
in
america
in
those
years
of
still
expanding
civil
rights
its
goals
remained
mixed
at
first
to
mainstream
youth
perceived
as
at
risk
of
becoming
involved
in
crime
but
also
to
confront
arrest
and
punish
those
black
youths
whose
potentiality
for
crime
crossed
over
into
criminal
behavior
n
even
before
the
feverish
year
of
and
nixon
s
dog
whistling
law
and
order
campaign
n
the
die
was
largely
cast
poverty
elimination
would
have
to
wait
for
a
successful
effort
to
reestablish
urban
social
control
over
segregated
neighborhoods
of
concentrated
poverty
the
nixon
administration
would
accelerate
this
already
rapid
shift
by
introducing
model
laws
for
the
district
of
columbia
aimed
at
increasing
police
power
and
the
punitive
potential
of
criminal
convictions
and
pivoting
from
johnson
s
overwhelming
investment
in
policing
toward
a
more
balanced
portfolio
of
police
courts
and
corrections
departments
n
ford
and
carter
would
bring
important
innovations
toward
ever
lengthening
prison
sentences
and
an
increasingly
fortified
urban
suburban
landscape
n
yet
all
of
this
remains
largely
in
the
tight
operating
principles
of
the
war
on
crime
logic
that
hinton
sees
in
place
of
the
very
appointment
of
the
johnson
administration
s
much
vaunted
national
commission
on
law
enforcement
and
the
administration
of
justice
n
what
happened
hinton
places
even
more
emphasis
than
previous
accounts
have
on
the
political
significance
of
the
pattern
of
urban
riots
or
uprisings
that
beginning
with
the
watts
riots
in
los
angeles
in
shook
america
s
large
and
medium
sized
cities
and
the
political
landscape
through
most
of
the
summers
into
the
early
s
n
unlike
the
more
generalized
idea
of
crime
in
the
streets
into
which
they
obviously
played
urban
riots
galvanized
very
specific
concerns
of
collective
violence
directed
against
white
society
and
its
governmental
forces
particularly
the
police
in
fact
to
the
extent
that
these
events
had
a
political
logic
it
was
one
very
much
aimed
against
big
city
police
whose
forms
of
order
maintenance
had
always
involved
routine
racial
harassment
and
in
the
increasingly
turbulent
s
were
becoming
more
violent
and
confrontational
n
ironically
the
major
solution
the
johnson
administration
promoted
notwithstanding
much
talk
of
investment
and
rebuilding
was
even
larger
better
equipped
and
more
lethal
police
forces
n
if
riots
could
be
seen
as
protests
of
the
inadequate
pace
of
antipoverty
policy
and
the
unmediated
tyranny
of
virtually
all
white
urban
police
forces
and
the
often
white
supremacist
political
machines
to
which
they
were
attached
they
were
an
even
more
potent
weapon
in
the
hands
of
those
who
argued
that
criminality
arising
from
the
tangle
of
pathologies
associated
with
segregated
neighborhoods
of
concentrated
poverty
was
a
threat
to
national
security
n
even
the
sympathetic
liberals
of
the
johnson
administration
saw
the
riots
as
signs
that
antipoverty
programs
at
least
at
the
individualized
behavioral
level
to
which
post
new
deal
liberal
politics
consigns
them
might
not
stem
the
tide
of
black
violence
in
time
to
prevent
if
not
a
revolution
at
least
a
fatal
rupture
of
support
for
the
johnson
agenda
nationally
n
much
like
the
increasingly
grim
conflict
in
vietnam
to
which
a
wide
variety
of
observers
drew
parallels
n
the
war
on
crime
would
have
to
reestablish
a
coercive
balance
of
control
before
more
hopeful
efforts
to
win
the
hearts
and
minds
of
young
residents
of
segregated
neighborhoods
of
concentrated
poverty
could
be
attempted
the
strategy
would
prove
futile
in
both
domestic
and
foreign
policy
but
it
would
take
far
longer
to
declare
the
war
on
crime
a
failure
the
riots
were
important
also
because
they
reinforced
the
racialized
criminology
that
formed
the
core
intellectual
framework
for
the
war
on
crime
in
this
analysis
drawn
from
the
midcentury
and
at
least
initially
from
liberal
social
scientists
like
daniel
p
moynihan
james
q
wilson
and
edward
banfield
crime
as
a
problem
stemmed
from
the
transformations
of
the
modern
city
and
the
rise
of
what
a
later
generation
would
call
the
underclass
n
captured
perhaps
most
enduringly
by
moynihan
s
imagistic
concept
of
the
tangle
of
urban
pathologies
read
urban
as
black
this
theory
saw
the
deformed
black
family
produced
by
the
aftermath
of
slavery
and
more
recently
the
great
migration
single
parent
female
headed
as
the
key
source
of
a
demographic
and
cultural
tide
of
nonconformity
and
violence
that
threatened
american
society
and
certainly
the
claims
of
liberalism
to
govern
it
n
the
riots
proved
that
this
tide
was
already
present
and
capable
of
overwhelming
the
local
police
forces
many
if
not
most
of
the
riots
involved
national
guards
force
being
mobilized
by
the
governor
and
in
some
cases
federal
troops
ordered
by
the
president
n
to
avoid
a
military
commitment
perhaps
many
times
the
scale
of
vietnam
it
would
be
necessary
to
permanently
bolster
the
scale
and
military
capacity
of
local
police
while
counterbalancing
the
dangerous
population
through
aggressive
use
of
arrest
and
imprisonment
n
as
much
as
this
is
a
book
about
mass
incarceration
it
is
also
a
book
about
policing
and
particularly
the
way
that
expanding
policing
in
the
s
and
s
paved
the
road
to
a
larger
prison
population
in
the
s
and
s
it
is
essential
that
we
link
mass
incarceration
to
the
kind
of
aggressive
preemptive
policing
that
has
been
a
major
product
of
the
war
on
crime
and
that
forms
the
core
of
what
today
is
becoming
intolerable
to
many
americans
about
our
carceral
state
johnson
and
nixon
shared
an
obsession
with
growing
and
transforming
american
police
forces
which
both
presidents
saw
as
the
frontline
troops
who
could
contain
the
crime
threat
of
alienated
black
youth
n
in
addition
to
expanding
the
size
of
police
forces
and
giving
them
the
kind
of
military
equipment
necessary
for
fighting
vietnam
like
counterinsurgency
wars
n
the
war
on
crime
early
on
embraced
a
transformation
of
policing
toward
preemptive
confrontation
with
the
enemy
an
enemy
increasingly
defined
as
all
black
young
men
in
segregated
neighborhoods
of
concentrated
poverty
the
enormous
influence
of
george
kelling
and
james
q
wilson
s
broken
windows
article
has
led
to
the
association
of
this
kind
of
policing
with
that
decade
and
since
n
but
hinton
draws
direct
lines
from
the
johnson
nixon
war
on
crime
centers
in
the
justice
department
to
this
new
model
n
it
is
from
these
origins
in
the
intersection
between
the
war
on
poverty
and
the
war
on
crime
that
the
new
policing
received
its
indelible
ambiguity
as
to
whether
it
is
about
policing
that
is
responsive
to
minority
communities
community
policing
problem
centered
policing
n
or
whether
it
is
about
policing
that
is
responsive
to
technocratically
set
management
objectives
compstat
predictive
policing
hotspots
policing
n
it
has
always
been
both
but
with
the
heaviest
commitment
to
the
latter
this
new
policing
model
largely
superseded
a
model
that
had
just
recently
been
invented
under
the
modernizing
influence
of
two
influential
chiefs
that
typified
midcentury
commitments
to
professionalization
of
policing
william
parker
of
los
angeles
and
o
w
wilson
of
chicago
and
based
on
more
efficient
and
rational
management
of
car
based
patrols
n
this
approach
was
intended
to
increase
response
time
and
recapture
discretionary
hours
left
to
police
conduct
in
area
based
patrols
even
if
it
did
not
do
much
to
reduce
crime
by
increasing
arrests
motorized
patrol
in
time
might
have
had
a
good
influence
on
police
racism
and
violence
against
people
of
color
since
it
subjected
police
to
the
centralized
controls
of
dispatchers
n
instead
the
new
imperatives
of
the
war
on
crime
made
what
had
seemed
modern
outmoded
and
allowed
a
radically
transformed
version
of
the
old
time
foot
patrol
model
to
return
in
the
form
of
a
deeply
hostile
sort
of
counterinsurgency
policing
n
some
of
hinton
s
best
work
is
tracing
ideals
forged
in
washington
to
their
implementation
in
places
like
detroit
los
angeles
and
other
large
cities
experiencing
the
dislocations
of
deindustrialization
and
middle
class
suburbanization
even
as
the
great
migration
continued
to
bring
blacks
from
the
south
to
cities
in
the
midwest
and
west
n
some
of
these
programs
funded
by
the
law
enforcement
assistance
administration
leaa
and
based
on
this
preemptive
model
like
detroit
s
stress
program
for
stop
the
robberies
enjoy
safe
streets
and
los
angeles
crash
for
community
resources
against
street
hoodlums
and
the
federal
government
s
office
of
drug
abuse
law
enforcement
odale
have
been
discussed
by
previous
studies
of
the
crime
war
n
but
never
with
as
much
detail
and
connection
between
model
and
outcome
in
retrospect
the
contradictions
of
these
programs
were
hiding
in
the
plain
sight
of
their
acronyms
who
was
supposed
to
enjoy
the
safe
streets
produced
by
stress
certainly
not
the
young
men
of
color
who
were
confronted
humiliated
and
sometimes
killed
outright
the
community
whose
resources
would
be
used
to
attack
street
hoodlums
obviously
did
not
include
young
black
men
living
in
segregated
neighborhoods
of
concentrated
poverty
if
police
were
the
foot
soldiers
of
america
s
parallel
vietnam
then
young
black
men
living
in
segregated
neighborhoods
of
concentrated
poverty
were
the
viet
cong
the
enemy
the
question
of
how
many
of
them
were
hardcore
combatants
whose
security
could
only
be
achieved
through
death
or
incapacitation
and
how
many
of
them
were
alienated
youths
who
could
be
nudged
back
into
channels
of
social
integration
created
a
space
for
some
contestation
within
the
overall
war
on
crime
paradigm
but
the
consensus
was
clear
on
the
question
of
dangerousness
of
this
population
and
agreed
that
this
danger
lay
in
the
traits
low
income
urban
youth
had
as
a
population
and
not
in
their
individual
characteristics
n
in
the
johnson
administration
youth
service
bureaus
were
imagined
to
be
institutional
substitutes
for
parents
where
police
officers
could
help
replace
the
lost
normative
force
of
proper
two
parent
households
n
by
the
ford
administration
the
focus
would
be
more
on
targeting
hard
core
youth
offenders
for
permanent
incapacitation
through
federal
prosecution
and
long
term
imprisonment
n
yet
throughout
liberals
and
conservatives
agreed
that
this
population
and
public
safety
would
be
best
served
through
exposure
to
ever
greater
treatments
of
aggressive
policing
n
the
chapters
on
the
ford
and
carter
administrations
were
some
of
the
most
rewarding
for
this
author
i
had
naively
suggested
in
my
own
study
of
the
war
on
crime
that
these
post
watergate
years
saw
some
relaxation
on
the
grip
of
battling
crime
by
the
american
presidency
and
its
pentagon
like
department
of
justice
n
in
fact
both
accelerated
the
war
on
crime
even
while
seeking
to
bring
a
more
technocratic
and
less
ideological
tone
to
it
consistent
with
both
trends
the
ford
administration
sought
to
increase
the
focus
on
particularly
dangerous
persons
supposed
career
criminals
or
at
least
those
with
a
long
record
of
being
arrested
for
crimes
or
gang
members
that
offered
the
prospect
of
a
more
efficient
war
on
crime
although
this
focus
was
mostly
added
on
to
existing
criminalization
marking
perhaps
the
beginning
of
the
new
penology
as
feeley
and
i
described
the
trend
toward
risk
rationalization
inside
the
carceral
state
n
hinton
s
story
of
the
path
toward
mass
incarceration
is
so
bleak
and
so
determined
that
it
is
difficult
to
notice
that
she
also
points
frequently
to
the
paths
not
taken
and
now
long
covered
by
the
success
of
mass
incarceration
as
a
project
n
the
kerner
commission
appointed
by
president
johnson
after
the
detroit
and
newark
riots
in
described
the
emerging
war
on
crime
as
heading
toward
a
spiral
of
segregation
violence
and
police
force
suggesting
that
only
a
substantial
effort
to
break
the
back
of
urban
segregation
could
escape
that
cycle
n
inside
the
segregated
neighborhoods
of
concentrated
poverty
activists
like
the
black
panthers
proposed
their
own
versions
of
antipoverty
and
crime
programs
n
either
of
these
projects
might
have
had
just
as
much
success
against
crime
and
collective
violence
as
the
war
on
crime
which
had
very
little
while
having
the
great
benefit
of
not
leading
us
inexorably
toward
mass
incarceration
in
retrospect
it
seems
difficult
to
believe
that
any
of
these
projects
could
have
moved
fast
enough
to
head
off
the
urban
riots
of
the
late
s
which
were
anchored
in
the
increasingly
violent
attacks
of
racist
big
city
police
forces
against
black
communities
a
violence
anchored
in
turn
in
police
resistance
to
changing
social
norms
brought
on
by
the
rise
of
the
civil
rights
movement
this
is
especially
true
when
you
consider
how
much
federal
policy
outside
the
crime
arena
was
altering
the
fate
of
the
great
cities
these
policies
including
promoting
the
movement
of
the
middle
class
to
segregated
all
white
suburbs
carving
freeways
through
dense
urban
corridors
to
facilitate
suburbanization
and
interstate
markets
the
deindustrialization
of
the
major
northern
cities
facilitated
by
that
subsidized
transportation
network
and
the
antiunion
tilt
of
federal
labor
law
after
the
s
left
central
cities
in
a
precarious
state
on
the
eve
of
the
s
n
the
emerging
post
modern
city
was
an
awkward
balance
between
fortified
central
business
districts
dependent
on
freeways
and
suburban
shoppers
and
segregated
neighborhoods
of
concentrated
poverty
places
inherently
susceptible
to
crime
and
difficult
to
police
based
on
traditional
foot
patrol
or
modern
car
patrol
linked
to
dispatch
methods
n
hinton
adopts
a
thoroughly
and
justifiably
skeptical
view
of
crime
statistics
in
this
period
convinced
crime
was
rising
rapidly
especially
in
the
large
cities
national
leaders
made
improving
the
collection
of
crime
reports
a
major
priority
for
improving
the
police
of
course
this
led
to
rises
sometimes
substantial
rises
in
reported
crime
rates
precisely
the
outcome

what

policing
strategy

was
uncertain

by
a

at

while
hinton
s
approach
is
the
right
one
for
a
history
of

we
still
lack
a
proper
history
of
the

on

from
the
popular
perspective
the
wave
of
urban
histories
of
the
post

period
has
given
us
a
clear
view
of
the
disarray
created
even
before
reported

rates
began
to
go
up

hinton
has
given
us
a
newly
precise
picture
of
how
washington
based
planners
saw
their
objectives
and
obstacles
from
the
pentagon
of
the

on

we

ii
historiography
of

we
are
in
the
midst
of
a
wave
of
mass
incarceration
history
hinton
s
study
of
the
war
on
crime
comes
several
years
after
a
widely
discussed
special
issue
of
the
journal
of
american

devoted
to
the
history
of
mass

n

influence
on

american
carceral
state

published
in
august
of
n
all
of
these
differ
from
earlier
histories
of
particular
prisons
or
even
state
prison
systems
because
they
make
mass
incarceration
as
such
the
subject
and
attempt
to
increase
our
understanding
of
both
the
causal
mechanisms
that
triggered
and
sustained
it
and
the
lost
possibilities
for
a
different
present
covered
over
by
the
success
of
mass
incarceration
hinton
s
study
exemplifies
many
features
that
are
crucial
to
doing
the
history
of
broad
governmental
programs
like
the
war
on
crime
that
can
get
lost
between
the
appeals
of
social
history
on
the
one
hand
and
more
traditional
history
of
legislation
on
the
other
a
the
importance
of
ideas
and
specific
intellectuals
ideas
and
the
academic
entrepreneurs
behind
them
matter
greatly
in
hinton
s
analysis
looming
especially
large
is
the
trio
of
james
q
wilson
edward
banfield
and
daniel
moynihan
the
first
two
were
political
scientists
banfield
was
wilson
s
doctoral
supervisor
n
both
interested
primarily
in
race
and
the
governance
of
the
post
war
cities
especially
in
policing
banfield
is
best
remembered
for
his
sulfurous
but
fascinating
portrait
of
the
contradictions
underlying
urban
social
policy
in
the
s
n
wilson
the
student
would
be
much
more
important
to
the
actual
policy
stream
promoting
the
idea
that
a
modest
but
significant
increase
in
the
actual
use
and
length
of
imprisonment
could
substantially
reduce
then
rising
rates
of
reported
crime
and
later
the
idea
of
broken
windows
policing
n
later
still
in
the
s
wilson
promoted
racialized
ideas
about
what
had
driven
the
high
reported
crime
rates
of
the
late
s
n
and
in
the
work
of
one
of
his
students
john
dilulio
promoted
the
most
ideological
of
all
the
war
on
crime
constructions
the
super
predators
juveniles
who
were
brought
up
in
the
female
headed
homes
common
in
segregated
neighborhoods
of
concentrated
poverty
n
moynihan
a
sociologist
who
would
become
a
central
domestic
policy
advisor
to
both
the
johnson
and
nixon
administrations
and
eventually
a
long
serving
u
s
senator
from
new
york
authored
the
famous
internal
memo
known
as
the
moynihan
report
which
blamed
high
crime
levels
on
long
term
damage
done
to
the
black
family
structure
by
slavery
and
its
aftermaths
n
while
somewhat
different
in
their
specific
projects
wilson
and
moynihan
shared
a
common
focus
on
the
black
family
and
what
moynihan
called
the
tangle
of
pathology
that
tied
blacks
living
in
segregated
neighborhoods
of
concentrated
poverty
to
crime
n
hinton
argues
that
the
common
policy
conclusion
was
an
ever
tightening
noose
of
policing
and
prison
around
the
necks
of
young
black
males
living
in
these
pathology
tangled
neighborhoods
n
hinton
s
thorough
exploration
of
the
intellectual
grounds
of
the
war
on
crime
highlights
many
other
significant
social
science
interventions
not
all
of
them
as
intentionally
oriented
toward
enhancing
the
scale
of
the
carceral
state
as
the
previous
three
wilson
moynihan
and
dilulio
in
the
early
days
of
what
became
the
war
on
poverty
the
work
of
sociologists
lloyd
ohlin
and
richard
cloward
promoted
the
idea
of
direct
interventions
aimed
at
reversing
the
social
and
economic
isolation
that
channeled
youth
in
segregated
neighborhoods
of
concentrated
poverty
toward
crime
n
while
not
aimed
at
promoting
law
enforcement
strategies
the
underlying
theory
that
conditions
associated
with
black
segregated
neighborhoods
were
criminogenic
underscored
the
potential
threat
if
antipoverty
approaches
failed
hinton
persuasively
suggests
that
there
was
little
to
prevent
this
logic
from
supporting
a
police
first
approach
to
controlling
poverty
based
crime
n
one
of
the
most
important
and
under
recognized
social
scientists
that
hinton
covers
here
was
the
late
marvin
wolfgang
of
the
university
of
pennsylvania
whose
ideas
have
not
been
nearly
as
controversial
as
wilson
s
but
pointed
toward
the
same
racial
strategy
and
whose
statistical
studies
of
the
distribution
of
arrests
among
a
cohort
of
philadelphia
boys
born
in
the
baby
boomers
helped
to
crystalize
the
threat
posed
by
black
youth
n
wolfgang
s
headline
finding
that
a
small
percentage
of
the
youth
accounted
for
more
than
half
the
total
arrests
in
the
cohort
has
shaped
many
dreams
since
of
targeting
imprisonment
on
a
group
of
career
criminals
high
rate
offenders
or
super
predators
n
wolfgang
s
research
and
its
reception
crystalizes
many
of
hinton
s
themes
his
funding
was
coming
from
the
war
on
crime
and
his
uncritical
reliance
on
police
arrests
allowed
the
filter
of
police
selection
and
distribution
to
shape
who
the
dangerous
high
rate
persistent
youth
would
be
black
males
from
segregated
neighborhoods
of
concentrated
poverty
n
hinton
highlights
some
moments
when
social
science
offered
truth
telling
that
might
have
provided
reasons
to
resist
the
embrace
of
mass
incarceration
most
notable
are
two
policy
experts
who
combined
law
and
criminology
an
interdisciplinarity
rare
at
that
time
and
now
james
vorenberg
n
of
harvard
law
school
and
frank
zimring
n
then
of
chicago
and
more
recently
of
u
c
berkeley
both
criticized
efforts
at
prediction
and
preemption
as
misbegotten
and
likely
to
reinforce
patterns
of
racial
disadvantage
while
both
were
funded
by
war
on
crime
research
funds
their
policy
warnings
were
largely
ignored
n
of
course
the
ideas
that
triumphed
turned
out
to
be
highly
productive
precisely
because
they
promoted
forms
of
governmental
action
against
the
crime
threat
as
it
was
coming
to
be
politically
defined
without
creating
the
direct
public
strategy
on
the
economic
and
social
isolation
of
these
communities
that
the
kerner
commission
called
for
in
its
enrichment
strategy
n
yet
it
would
be
a
mistake
to
see
these
intellectual
interventions
as
serving
simply
an
ideological
purpose
of
providing
a
patina
of
social
science
respectability
to
a
control
agenda
forged
on
other
ground
and
by
other
strategists
although
some
examples
like
the
super
predator
concept
that
emerged
from
wilson
s
thought
via
dilulio
clearly
fit
an
ideological
role
these
intellectual
interventions
were
politically
effective
because
they
offered
anticrime
strategies
that
provided
real
objectives
for
federal
investments
to
shape
local
policing
and
imprisonment
strategies
around
in
that
sense
social
scientists
in
the
war
on
crime
are
examples
of
what
michel
foucault
called
specific
intellectuals
in
contrast
to
the
universal
intellectual
whose
broad
ideas
reshape
fundamental
principles
n
specific
intellectuals
robert
oppenheimer
was
one
of
foucault
s
memorable
examples
n
use
their
theoretical
knowledge
to
forge
practical
projects
around
which
governmental
capacities
can
be
concentrated
like
the
manhattan
project
n
while
based
on
a
shockingly
thin
empirical
basis
the
winning
ideas
behind
the
war
on
crime
created
practical
linkages
between
the
crime
threat
and
ways
of
redeploying
and
expanding
existing
governmental
capacities
policing
and
incarceration
n
viewed
as
a
legal
phenomenon
law
breaking
war
on
crime
is
an
impossible
metaphor
to
realize
reconstructed
as
a
sociological
phenomenon
black

in
segregated
neighborhoods
of
concentrated
poverty
a
war
on
crime
was
all
too
practical
b
technologies
of
carceral
power
another
strength
of
hinton
s
historiographical
strategy
is
its
description
of
the
way
administrative
policies
and
legal
amendments
created
new
and
unprecedented
governmental
capacities
to
surveil
and
incarcerate
citizens
two
of
the
most
important
were
stop
and
frisk
policing
and
mandatory
minimum
sentences
n
the
first
was
a
modification
of
the
motorized
patrol
approach
to
policing
that
was
being
promoted
as
a
modern
bureaucratic
alternative
to
the
old
foot
patrol
policing
when
the
war
on
crime
began
now
instead
of
responding
to
dispatched
calls
for
assistance
police
in
cars
or
on
foot
would
use
their
own
authority
to
engage
individuals
that
they
suspected
of
being
involved
in
crime
generally
on
starkly
racial
grounds
n
along
with
even
more
aggressive
methods
like
the
use
of
undercover
police
as
decoys
the
new
methods
decoupled
convictions
and
thus
potential
imprisonments
from
the
responses
of
ordinary
residents
and
produced
a
flow
of
potential
prisoners
far
larger
than
could
be
produced
by
solving
the
kinds
of
serious
crimes
people
report
to
the
police
the
supreme
court
removed
any
potential
legal
impediments
through
its
decisions
upholding
virtually
complete
police
discretion
to
use
any
kind
of
criminal
violation
as
the
basis
for
their
stops
removing
any
potential
judicial
check
on
aggressive
police
use
of
this
power
n
mandatory
minimums
an
idea
developed
in
the
first
nixon
crime
bills
n
expanded
in
the
reagan
years
and
heavily
promoted
to
the
states
n
distorted
the
whole
structure
of
sentencing
upward
in
many
instances
they
were
built
into
complex
matrix
systems
fixing
a
sentencing
range
based
on
crime
level
and
criminal
history
score
these
systems
were
designed
originally
to
assure
horizontal
equity
among
individuals
but
now
incorporated
extreme
punishments
with
no
judicial
discretion
to
respond
to
significant
individual
differences
as
hinton
notes
a
certain
kind
of
color
blind
antidiscrimination
principle
had
become
a
core
part
of
the
national
canon
in
the
s
and
mandatory
sentences
could
be
seen
as
protecting
individuals
from
disparate
judicial
treatment
due
to
race
although
it
did
nothing
to
control
prosecutorial
selection
n
c
resistance
hinton
s
story
although
anchored
in
the
strategies
of
the
federal
government
does
not
ignore
the
role
of
resistance
we
have
already
discussed
her
focus
on
urban
uprisings
as
even
more
than
any
perceived
rise
in
individual
violent
crimes
helping
to
define
the
war
on
crime
n
most
of
the
riots
began
as
collective
protest
action
against
the
existing
indignities
imposed
by
the
policing
of
the
s
generally
triggered
by
an
in
itself
not
extraordinary
attempt
to
exercise
police
arrest
powers
n
the
result
was
a
further
strengthening
of
the
most
offensive
elements
of
that
policing
model
political
activists
within
the
black
community
like
the
black
panthers
tried
to
discipline
resistance
to
police
violence
into
sustainable
legal
practices
but
were
met
with
criminalization
and
sometimes
murder
n
they
also
offered
alternative
security
proposals
for
segregated
neighborhoods
of
concentrated
poverty
that
did
not
rely
on
enhanced
policing
but
instead
on
community
organization
n
these
stories
of
resistance
long
covered
over
by
the
success
of
the
mass
incarceration
project
are
important
to
recover
as
we
consider
what
should
succeed
it
the
black
panthers
appeal
to
create
popular
patrols
to
protect
black
neighborhoods
from
both
crime
and
police
may
have
new
relevance
as
we
consider
the
paradox
that
despite
extraordinary
levels
of
public
spending
on
police
most
homicides
go
unsolved
in
segregated
neighborhoods
of
concentrated
poverty
iii
ending
mass
incarceration
hinton
s
account
is
both
sobering
and
inspiring
for
those
of
us
who
want
to
see
the
current
interest
in
criminal
justice
reform
achieve
enough
momentum
to
undo
the
tremendous
changes
in
the
american
carceral
state
wrought
by
the
war
on
crime
era
her
comprehensive
account
of
the
now
forgotten
first
half
of
the
war
on
crime
the
clinton
era
would
add
another
layer
including
more
urban
police
n
raises
serious
questions
about
whether
many
of
the
most
popular
reform
approaches
can
truly
break
with
the
past
yet
in
capturing
the
criminological
climate
of
the
mid
s
with
some
nuance
hinton
reminds
us
that
significant
reductions
in
the
use
of
imprisonment
and
the
need
for
major
reforms
of
policing
both
seemed
possible
even
urgent
on
the
eve
of
the
war
on
crime
despite
rising
crime
rates
a
evidence
based
law
enforcement
one
of
the
most
resonant
themes
in
criminal
justice
reform
today
is
refocusing
policing
and
incarceration
based
on
empirically
tested
strategies
n
in
part
the
emphasis
on
recidivism
and
how
to
reduce
it
is
a
counterbalance
to
the
extremism
of
the
s
when
laws
like
california
s
three
strikes
gave
prosecutors
largely
unaccountable
discretion
to
decide
when
to
use
life
sentences
n
but
establishing
empirical
evidence
for
effective
policing
and
rehabilitative
programs
was
also
a
major
goal
of
federal
funding
during
the
first
half
of
the
war
on
crime
n
this
wave
of
research
tended
to
reproduce
the
patterns
established
by
police
and
prosecutorial
discretion
in
the
form
of
arrest
and
conviction
statistics
and
to
undermine
hopes
for
alternatives
like
rehabilitation
n
an
important
component
of
these
evidence
based
strategies
is
their
focus
on
statistical
risk
assessment
in
the
face
of
chronic
overcrowding
in
many
of
the
nation
s
prison
systems
including
the
federal
system
and
jails
actuarial
risk
assessment
is
being
reexamined
with
enthusiasm
by
reformers
as
a
way
to
reduce
incarcerated
populations
while
rationalizing
a
system
that
from
the
pretrial
phase
to
the
distribution
of
lengthy
prison
sentence
enhancements
has
little
rational
relationship
to
risk
n
the
revival
of
what
malcolm
feeley
and
i
called
the
new
penology
is
another
sign
of
how
deeply
the
legitimacy
of
the
u
s
carceral
state
has
been
shaken
n
yet
as
hinton
s
history
reminds
us
this
refocusing
of
law
enforcement
and
custody
on
high
risk
categories
of
people
who
can
reliably
be
identified
using
ready
at
hand
bureaucratic
information
is
the
repetition
of
a
theme
that
has
run
throughout
the
war
on
crime
period
that
of
beating
crime
by
incapacitating
its
most
active
participants
repeatedly
and
despite
relying
on
somewhat
different
theories
and
methods
this
search
for
the
dangerous
has
always
rediscovered
the
priority
of
maintaining
surveillance
and
control
over
young
black
people
especially
men
living
in
segregated
neighborhoods
of
concentrated
poverty
there
is
every
reason
to
fear
that
renewed
actuarialism
would
rediscover
the
same
priorities
after
all
as
hinton
argues
throughout
the
intensification
of
policing
of
these
suspect
classes
in
these
neighborhoods
has
produced
in
criminal
records
a
knowledge
foundation
for
an
enduring
indeed
inescapable
racial
profile
n
b
war
on
violence
another
way
that
reformers
are
seeking
to
save
the
carceral
state
from
its
current
legitimacy
crisis
by
rationalizing
it
is
by
refocusing
the
war
on
crime
to
violence
by
abandoning
the
war
on
drugs
which
was
a
diversion
n
in
fact
the
system
has
steadily
been
deemphasizing
the
war
on
drugs
since
the
end
of
the
s
although
as
a
legal
matter
it
remains
fully
in
place
and
weaponized
n
and
our
long
experiment
in
incentivizing
policing
drug
seizures
almost
certainly
was
a
diversion
from
solving
serious
and
violent
crimes
not
to
mention
alienating
most
of
the
community
members
whose
cooperation
would
be
necessary
to
solve
those
crimes
yet
as
hinton
s
account
deftly
shows
the
war
on
drugs
was
always
bound
up
with
the
same
racialized
construction
of
the
serious
crime
problem
that
has
been
growing
in
political
and
scientific
authority
since
the
kennedy
administration
n
the
war
on
drugs
was
always
rationalized
as
a
way
to
harness
federal
funds
and
legal
authority
to
go
after
local
persons
that
were
believed
to
be
involved
in
serious
and
violent
crime
n
as
defenders
of
broken
windows
policing
continue
to
argue
even
now
aggressive
policing
against
drugs
and
other
low
level
crimes
can
provide
a
lever
on
serious
crime
through
various
theoretical
mechanisms
of
deterrence
and
incapacitation
n
moreover
a
refocusing
on
violent
crime
is
almost
certain
to
retain
the
racialized
concentration
of
policing
and
the
racial
makeup
of
the
carceral
population
while
naturalizing
a
punitive
sentencing
structure
that
makes
little
sense
in
terms
of
penological
objectives
c
supervision
the
very
disrepute
that
incarceration
especially
imprisonment
now
endures
is
such
that
a
tempting
pathway
of
reform
is
to
substitute
forms
of
carceral
supervision
over
people
convicted
or
convictable
of
crimes
as
an
alternative
to
incarceration
historically
probation
as
an
alternative
or
sequel
to
jail
or
as
a
substitute
for
imprisonment
when
it
follows
prison
carceral
supervision
it
is
often
known
as
parole
but
terminology
differs
from
state
to
state
has
meant
being
subject
to
special
conditions
more
or
less
active
supervision
by
a
correctional
agent
and
the
possibility
of
deeper
sanctioning
including
incarceration
based
on
a
summary
administrative
procedure
n
it
has
often
been
associated
with
efforts
to
help
those
being
supervised
achieve
a
sustainable
crime
free
life
in
the
community
but
with
deeply
inadequate
resources
to
make
a
credible
job
of
that
n
politically
shifting
from
incarceration
to
supervision
avoids
crossing
the
potential
red
line
of
declaring
these
highly
criminalized
people
no
longer
a
presumptive
menace
to
society
and
therein
lies
its
true
failing
as
a
solution
to
the
present
crisis
as
hinton
shows
carceral
supervision
either
by
police
or
probation
or
the
whole
of
what
victor
rios
calls
the
youth
control
complex
n
has
been
the
overarching
goal
of
the
federal
government
s
war
on
crime
n
these
methods
go
back
to
the
progressive
era
when
they
were
imagined
as
a
necessary
extension
of
social
control
over
immigrants
and
minority
citizens
whose
capacity
for
self
government
was
doubted
by
the
scientific
racism
then
part
of
the
dominant
intellectual
framework
of
state
power
n
the
war
on
crime
brought
the
federal
government
and
its
financing
and
expertise
into
expanding
this
sector
the
emphasis
on
incarceration
was
a
distinct
part
of
this
overall
strategy
a
shift
back
to
greater
reliance
on
supervision
may
save
the
system
some
money
and
avoid
some
of
the
inhumanity
brought
on
by
overcrowding
of
prisons
but
it
leaves
whole
communities
in
daily
exposure
to
degrading
treatment
by
the
carceral
state
almost
anyone
living
in
a
segregated
neighborhood
of
concentrated
poverty
is
exposed
to
having
their
home
searched
or
car
stopped
because
they
are
or
are
near
someone
under
correctional
supervision
carceral
supervision
also
remains
a
major
pathway
to
incarceration
d
abolition
if
recovering
the
fuller
history
of
the
war
on
crime
requires
us
to
abandon
some
of
the
narrowest
understandings
of
mass
incarceration
and
therefore
question
the
adequacy
of
some
of
the
politically
easiest
approaches
to
reforming
the
american
carceral
state
it
also
invites
us
to
consider
whether
a
far
more
substantial
departure
might
be
possible
as
hinton
shows
the
consensus
within
the
carceral
state
and
its
related
fields
of
expertise
on
the
eve
of
the
war
on
crime
was
for
substantial
shifts
in
the
dominant
twentieth
century
models
of
carceral
control
n
urban
police
professionalization
oriented
police
executives
imagined
a
new
more
modern
and
organizational
model
of
policing
built
around
the
automobile
and
radio
dispatch
by
pulling
police
out
of
their
embedded
positions
in
neighborhood
precincts
the
new
approach
promoted
in
los
angeles
and
chicago
sought
to
shorten
response
times
and
arrest
more
suspects
in
action
rather
than
waiting
for
victims
to
discover
crimes
often
hours
after
the
events
n
this
model
also
was
used
to
break
up
an
older
model
based
on
local
police
stations
and
foot
based
patrols
that
was
long
associated
with
both
corruption
and
racial
arbitrariness
n
it
was
also
promoted
as
capable
of
deterring
crime
through
shortening
response
times
and
increasing
the
chances
of
police
observing
a
crime
in
progress
n
by
the
s
it
would
be
framed
as
the
failed
old
order
against
which
a
neotraditionalist
model
of
problem
oriented
community
policing
was
posed
as
an
answer
n
in
retrospect
this
reform
view
appears
to
have
overstated
the
degree
to
which
this
model
was
ever
fully
implemented
or
tested
and
understated
how
much
it
was
overtaken
by
a
war
on
crime
that
promoted
more
aggressive
neighborhood
policing
that
could
be
disguised
as
community
policing
going
forward
we
could
do
worse
things
than
reinvent
mid
twentieth
century
efforts
to
make
police
truly
modern
and
bureaucratic
as
an
organization
policing
never
has
been
made
fully
bureaucratic
in
the
weberian
sense
of
being
subject
to
rules
and
accountability
as
police
shootings
in
questionable
circumstances
n
and
continuing
scandals
around
homophobic
and
racist
text
messages
in
san
francisco
exemplify
n
returning
police
to
a
more
responsive
role
and
using
technologies
to
break
up
racialized
presumptions
that
shape
law
enforcement
through
forms
of
randomization
might
provide
at
least
a
valuable
interim
approach
to
breaking
the
hold
of
racial
profiling
on
contemporary
policing
conclusion
observers
frequently
mistake
the
policies
of
the
federal
government
as
the
story
of
government
in
our
nation
this
is
especially
true
of
criminal
law
and
punishment
where
government
is
particularly
inapt
the
vast
majority
of
prisoners
are
under
state
custody
and
the
laws
and
policies
that
imprisoned
them
are
the
products
of
state
legislatures
county
prosecutors
and
local
police
indeed
it
takes
a
concerted
multifront
campaign
for
the
federal
government
to
influence
let
alone
transform
something
as
intrinsically
state
and
local
as
the
american
carceral
state
elizabeth
hinton
s
from
the
war
on
poverty
to
the
war
on
crime
the
making
of
mass
incarceration
provides
a
far
more
detailed
account
and
strong
interpretation
of
the
extraordinary
campaign
led
by
a
series
of
presidential
administrations
of
both
parties
and
importantly
championed
by
the
presidents
themselves
and
their
attorneys
general
this
project
of
reversing
the
presumptive
rise
in
crime
especially
in
american
cities
seemed
unlikely
from
the
start
given
that
the
kinds
of
crimes
receiving
political
attention
robberies
burglaries
and
homicides
are
among
the
most
local
of
activities
and
as
noted
completely
under
local
authorities
to
recognize
or
not
and
respond
to
although
this
project
never
succeeded
by
its
own
terms
in
reducing
crime
rates
which
didn
t
begin
to
fall
significantly
until
the
mid
s
and
then
appeared
unrelated
to
war
on
crime
innovations
it
did
work
to
transform
the
american
carceral
state
into
the
punitive
juggernaut
it
had
become
by
the
turn
of
the
twentieth
century
and
largely
remains
that
it
worked
is
a
triumph
of
soft
power
in
the
interest
of
hard
power
the
power
of
incentives
ideas
and
identities
to
drive
a
vast
investment
of
state
and
local
dollars
in
prisons
and
the
infrastructure
of
criminal
courts
necessary
to
keep
them
filled
the
first
step
in
this
one
taken
early
in
the
johnson
administration
was
to
make
police
officers
the
key
recruiters
for
participants
in
the
federal
government
s
effort
to
pacify
the
big
cities
ahead
of
multiple
uprisings
or
even
a
sustained
insurgency
n
with
federal
funds
supporting
the
hiring
of
more
police
officers
and
providing
more
hardware
for
them
to
use
to
suppress
rioting
and
arrest
criminal
suspects
the
scale
of
urban
policing
expanded
enormously
in
the
decade
between
the
mid
s
and
mid
s
this
happened
despite
grave
concerns
within
the
federal
government
itself
about
the
incompetence
and
racism
of
local
police
forces
and
with
no
substantial
commitment
to
reform
them
under
nixon
this
criminalization
wave
was
reinforced
and
the
goal
of
turning
those
arrests
into
successful
prosecutions
and
convictions
and
imposing
longer
prison
sentences
was
firmly
established
as
best
practice
n
by
the
time
ford
took
over
from
nixon
after
the
latter
s
own
conduct
became
subject
to
criminal
accusations
and
the
likelihood
of
impeachment
increased
mass
incarceration
as
a
project
was
already
fully
weaponized
and
ready
to
go
firmly
embraced
by
both
parties
with
a
few
issues
like
the
death
penalty
subject
to
party
debate
by
the
time
presidents
reagan
and
george
h
w
bush
renewed
the
war
on
drugs
brand
and
tied
it
to
the
new
folk
devils
of
urban
decline
crack
cocaine
dealers
and
users
prison
populations
in
the
states
were
rising
rapidly
and
the
core
focus
on
youth
of
color
in
segregated
neighborhoods
of
concentrated
poverty
was
firmly
established
n
the
reagan
bush
rhetoric
made
it
easy
for
contemporaneous
observers
to
blame
the
increasingly
visible
problem
of
prison
population
growth
on
right
wing
politics
and
its
obsession
with
the
dangers
and
moral
impurities
of
drugs
hinton
s
meticulous
recovery
of
the
first
phase
of
the
war
on
crime
arrives
at
a
perfect
time
to
help
ground
the
debate
about
future
criminal
justice
reform
many
of
the
most
promising
and
politically
popular
reforms
involve
rolling
back
the
war
on
drugs
that
reagan
and
bush
branded
and
which
president
clinton
sustained
with
his
eager
expansion
of
the
police
force
n
many
of
these
proposals
if
implemented
more
fully
would
move
us
back
toward
the
war
on
crime
strategies
of
the
ford
and
carter
years
that
might
remove
the
most
discredited
and
indefensible
features
of
mass
incarceration
but
it
would
leave
the
basic
political
project
of
governing
american
cities
through
the
surveillance
and
carceral
control
of
the

and

leading
a
new
five
year
program
to
test
and
improve
predictive

and

for

predictive

to
predict
times
and
places
that
serious
crimes
will
occur
based
on
historical
crime
data
in

spoke
to

about
improving

and
how
the

used
could
translate

aspects
of
city
life
in
the
future
how
has
predictive

been

so
far
and
how
can
it
be
improved
predictive
policing
has
been
used
in
california
to
identify
crime
hotspots
where
serious
crime
is
more
likely
to
occur
for
example
there
s
the
broken
window
effect
where
areas
of
the
city
that
are
not
looked
after
are
more
attractive
for
certain
crimes
these
models
are
based
on
crime
data
and
seem
to
work
well
but
we
can
make
improvements
to
provide
greater
levels
of
statistical
validity
of
model
based
predictions
with
more
powerful
models
we
can
start
to
predict
not
just
where
but
when
and
what
type
of
crime
is
likely
to
occur
we
also
need
to
quantify
the
amount
of
uncertainty
in
any
of
these
predictions
so
that
police
and
policymakers
can
take
these
into
account
when
deciding
whether
to
allocate
resources
based
on
them
where
the
uncertainty
is
high
they
might
want
to
rely
more
on
their
previous
experience
and
knowledge
of
the
situation
who
are
you
working
with
on
this
project
we
re
partnering
with
the
universities
of
oxford
manchester
and
strathclyde
along
with
the
met
west
midlands
scotland
and
new

police
forces
we
also
have
on
board
software
companies
and
the
home
office
who
are
very
interested
in
issues
related
to
crime
and
security
once
we
have
some
software
to
trial
we
hope
to
deploy
prototypes
this
is
why
we
have
a
range
of
collaborating
police
forces
to
cover
the
uk
these
police
forces
came
to
us
the
police
forces
across
the
country
are
looking
at
efficiencies
in
operations
so
this
work
is
very
important
it
s
a
great
opportunity
to
do
some
fantastic
maths
but
also
to
roll
it
out
and
have
impact
on
uk
policing
it
sounds
like
a
great
tool
but
are
there
potential
pitfalls
to
predictive
policing
there
are
certainly
ethical
issues
to
take
into
account
for
example
some
police
forces
would
like
to
be
able
to
predict
who
might
become
a
serial
offender
and
make
an
intervention
at
an
early
stage
to
change
the
path
followed
the
ethical
issues
are
really
huge
there
should
we
even
be
thinking
about
such
interventions
the
alan
turing
institute
have
established
a
data
ethics
group
so
we
ve
set
up
an
initiative
with
them
and
west
midlands
police
to
actually
look
at
these
particular
issues
there
are
also
cultural
differences
for
example
between
the
us
and
the
uk
that
need
to
be
taken
into
account
when
predicting
crime
we
can
t
just
be
mathematicians
working
on
theorems
and
proofs
we
ve
brought
in
psychologists
and
social
scientists
specifically
so
that
we
understand
what
psychological
processes
are
at
play
what
we
re
hoping
to
do
is
have
that
inform
the
models
that
we
build
i
guess
if
we
were
working
in
some
totalitarian
state
we
wouldn
t
be
worried
about
the
ethics
of
using
data
to
profile
people
as
to
whether
they
were
going
to
be
serial
criminals
or
not
thankfully
we
don
t
and
therefore
this
is
a
much
more
constrained
issue
and
we
really
need
to
embed
all
of
that
in
the
mathematical
models
we
develop
what
else
could
the
tools
be
used
for
in
future
cities
we
aim
to
focus
on
crime
and
policing
for
the
first
two
years
of
the
grant
but
after
that
we
could
expand
the
models
use
to
other
areas
of
the
city
for
example
we
have
been
approached
by
a
leisure
chain
that
has
essentially
the
same
problem
as
the
police
force
when
do
we
need
more
staff
and
where
with
powerful
enough
models
this
could
be
predicted
on
an
hourly
basis
models
could
also
be
used
to
assess
the
local
economic
impact
of
new
developments
in
a
city
for
example
imperial
s
new
white
city
campus
and
its
associated
infrastructure
we
could
ask
questions
about
what
should
go
alongside
if
a

chain
was
thinking
about
opening
up
an
outlet
there
for

what
size
should
it

a

at

that
uk

professor

hayley
dunning
spoke
to

girolami
about
improving
predictive
policing
and
how
the
maths
used
could
translate
to
other
aspects
of
city
life
in
the
future
how
has
predictive
policing
been
used
so
far
and
how
can
it
be
improved
predictive
policing
has
been
used
in
california
to
identify
crime
hotspots
where
serious
crime
is
more
likely
to
occur
for
example
there
s
the
broken
window
effect
where
areas
of
the
city
that
are
not
looked
after
are
more
attractive
for
certain
crimes
these
models
are
based
on
crime
data
and
seem
to
work
well
but
we
can
make
improvements
to
provide
greater
levels
of
statistical
validity
of
model
based
predictions
with
more
powerful
models
we
can
start
to
predict
not
just
where
but
when
and
what
type
of
crime
is
likely
to
occur
we
also
need
to
quantify
the
amount
of
uncertainty
in
any
of
these
predictions
so
that
police
and
policymakers
can
take
these
into
account
when
deciding
whether
to
allocate
resources
based
on
them
where
the
uncertainty
is
high
they
might
want
to
rely
more
on
their
previous
experience
and
knowledge
of
the
situation
who
are
you
working
with
on
this
project
we
re
partnering
with
the
universities
of
oxford
manchester
and
strathclyde
along
with
the
met
west
midlands
scotland
and
new
york
police
forces
we
also
have
on
board
software
companies
and
the
home
office
who
are
very
interested
in
issues
related
to
crime
and
security
once
we
have
some
software
to
trial
we
hope
to
deploy
prototypes
this
is
why
we
have
a
range
of
collaborating
police
forces
to
cover
the
uk
these
police
forces
came
to
us
the
police
forces
across
the
country
are
looking
at
efficiencies
in
operations
so
this
work
is
very
important
it
s
a
great
opportunity
to
do
some
fantastic
maths
but
also
to
roll
it
out
and
have
impact
on
uk
policing
it
sounds
like
a
great
tool
but
are
there
potential
pitfalls
to
predictive
policing
there
are
certainly
ethical
issues
to
take
into
account
for
example
some
police
forces
would
like
to
be
able
to
predict
who
might
become
a
serial
offender
and
make
an
intervention
at
an
early
stage
to
change
the
path
followed
the
ethical
issues
are
really
huge
there
should
we
even
be
thinking
about
such
interventions
the
alan
turing
institute
have
established
a
data
ethics
group
so
we
ve
set
up
an
initiative
with
them
and
west
midlands
police
to
actually
look
at
these
particular
issues
there
are
also
cultural
differences
for
example
between
the
us
and
the
uk
that
need
to
be
taken
into
account
when
predicting
crime
we
can
t
just
be
mathematicians
working
on
theorems
and
proofs
we
ve
brought
in
psychologists
and
social
scientists
specifically
so
that
we
understand
what
psychological
processes
are
at
play
what
we
re
hoping
to
do
is
have
that
inform
the
models
that
we
build
i
guess
if
we
were
working
in
some
totalitarian
state
we
wouldn
t
be
worried
about
the
ethics
of
using
data
to
profile
people
as
to
whether
they
were
going
to
be
serial
criminals
or
not
thankfully
we
don
t
and
therefore
this
is
a
much
more
constrained
issue
and
we
really
need
to
embed
all
of
that
in
the
mathematical
models
we
develop
what
else
could
the
tools
be
used
for
in
future
cities
we
aim
to
focus
on
crime
and
policing
for
the
first
two
years
of
the
grant
but
after
that
we
could
expand
the
models
use
to
other
areas
of
the
city
for
example
we
have
been
approached
by
a
leisure
chain
that
has
essentially
the
same
problem
as
the
police
force
when
do
we
need
more
staff
and
where
with
powerful
enough
models
this
could
be
predicted
on
an
hourly
basis
models
could
also
be
used
to
assess
the
local
economic
impact
of
new
developments
in
a
city
for
example
imperial
s
new
white
city
campus
and
its
associated
infrastructure
we
could
ask
questions
about
what
should
go
alongside
if
a
restaurant
chain
was
thinking
about
opening
up
an
outlet
there
for
example
what
size
should
it
be
and
where
should

overall
crime
in
los

has
nearly
leveled
off
at
the
midyear
mark
police
chief
charlie
beck
said
thursday
calling
s
numbers
a
sign
that
police
are
making
progress
against
the
city
s
stubborn
uptick
in
crime
as
of
july
overall
crime
was
up
less
than
when
compared
with
the
first
six
months
of
notably
lower
than
the
increase
the
lapd
reported
halfway
through
and
the
jump
the
year
before
beck
announced
the
figures
at
the
weekly
meeting
of
his
civilian
bosses
on
the
police
commission
he
later
credited
the
progress
to
a
variety
of
factors
shifting
department
resources
to
target
violent
crime
improving
predictive
policing
to
help
stem
property
crime
adapting
to
changes
in
legislation
and
a
relentless
focus
on
crime
from
lapd
brass
beck
also
said
he
hoped
that
by
the
end
of
the
year
the
city
would
see
crime
drop
if
overall
crime
ultimately
falls
this
year
it
will
mark
the
first
such
decrease
since
i
am
cautiously
optimistic
beck
said
but
we
ll
see
the
most
significant
change
this
year
has
been
in
violent
crime
which
beck
said
has
risen
about
in
both
and
the
lapd
reported
double
digit
increases
in
violent
crime
at
the
midyear
mark
still
homicides
increased
about
in
the
first
six
months
of
this
year
beck
said
which
he
attributed
in
part
to
a
jump
in
gang
related
killings
the
number
of
gunshot
victims
across
the
city
rose
by
roughly
aggravated
assaults
he
added
were
about
even
beck
said
the
department

efforts
to
target

which
largely
have
hinged
on
shifting

officers
concentrating
on
areas
where
gangs
were
active

where

had
recently
flared
much
like
anything
in
life
it
s
the
constant
application
of
things
that
you
believe
in
and
that
work
beck
said
sometimes
they
re
more
effective
than
others
but
over
time
they
will
always
succeed
the
president
of
the
union
representing
rank
and
file
officers
noted
however
that
violent
crime
was
still
significantly
higher
than
it
was
in
the
leveling
off
is
nothing
to
get
too
excited
about

protective

with

that

now
is
not
the
time
for
anyone
to
pat
themselves
on
the
back

rather
now
is
the
time
for

to
sharpen
his

are
enjoying
a
vacation
miles
away
as
the
thief
is
about
to
break
the
lock
he
hears
police
sirens
and
approaching
cops
what
happened
here
the
thief
will
wonder
maybe
he
was
not
aware
of
big
data
powered
predictive
policing
which
will
soon
become
a
norm
in
india
the
big
question
here
is
will
such
usage
of
technology
help
the
cops
to
control
crime
rate
in
india
big
data
to
predict

the
indian
way
national
crime
records
bureau
which
is
responsible
for
collecting
and
storing
crime
related

all
over
india
has
decided
to
use
the
power
of
information
and
data
for
the
implementing
the
next
generation
of
crime
control
tactics
welcome
to
predictive
policing
which
has
made
some
great
inroads
in
countries
like
usa
and
is
about
to
break
the
backs
of
indian
criminals
by
march
national
crime
records
bureau
will
start
executing
big
data
based
predictive
policing
in
states
of
kerala
odisha
maharashtra
haryana
and
tripura
and
by
end
of
whole
of
india
will
be
covered
hyderabad
based
advanced
data
research
institute
adrin
is
right
now
creating
a
software
which
can
predict
crime
before
it
happens
using
the
enormous
amount
of
data
stored
with
national
crime
records
bureau
ncrb
predictive
policing
how
will
it
work
criminal
activities
are
often
interconnected
with
several
common
traits
and
the
new
software
will
pick
up
those
common
traits
and
predict
the
future
of
crime
for
instance
in
a
town
of
people
the
software
will
observe
that
maximum
number
of
burglaries
happen
between
st
and
th
which
are
the
pay
days
most
number
of
crimes
occur
between
pm
and
pm
between
the
bridge
and
the
main
junction
this
information
can
be
used
to
predict
further
crimes
in
future
multiply
it
with
millions
of
data
points
and
we
get
a
comprehensive
picture
a
source
said
it
is
basically
use
of
big
data
analytics
to
predict
geographical
areas
where
crime
is
most
likely
to
take
place
after
taking
into
account
various
factors
followed
by
analysis
based
on
this
information
police
can
step
up
surveillance
enforce
more
manpower
and
basically
stop
the
crime
before
it
happens
factors
like
geographical
location
of
the
crime
population
race
lifestyle
social
issues
etc
can
be
combined
and
big

and
analyzed
by

they

took
the

bureau
with
rising

in

and
the

sherman
said
he
s
determined
to
use
all
available
tools
to
get
the
community
involved
to
fight
crime
while
deploying
the
valley
bureau
s
police
officers
most
effectively
i
m
an
enthusiastic
kind
of

said
sherman
who
was
raised
in
reseda
from
his

at
the

in

on
tuesday
i
hope
to
bring
that
enthusiasm
and
energy
to
the

and
help
keep
our
officers
going
in
the
right
direction
and
mobilize
our
community
even
further
the
valley
saw
some
crimes
last
year
up
from
about
crimes
in
following
years
of
declines
according
to
police
data
part
of
sherman
s
challenge
is
getting
the
public
to
lock
car
doors
not
leave
keys
or
other
valuables
inside
their
vehicles
and
encouraging
residents
to
talk
to
their
neighbors
he
said
our
biggest
numbers
are
property
crimes
he
explained
our
achilles
heel
is
when
people
break
into
cars
steal
cars
or
break
into
homes
violent
crime
is
down
in
the
valley
about
percent
so
far
this
year
sherman
said
but
property
crimes
are
up
about
percent
today
there
are
more
ways
for
the
public
to
become
involved
to
safeguard
their
neighborhoods
including
facebook
groups
as
well
as
social
networks
like
nextdoor
where
neighbors
can
exchange
information
and
tips
he
said
the
seven
los
angeles
police
stations
in
the
valley
also
are
using
predictive
policing
to
help
put
officers
in
areas
where
there
is
a
high
probability
that
property
crimes
will
occur
next

as
a
lieutenant
at
the
devonshire
division
in
before
serving
as
a

in
colorado
for
years
because
police
today
work
in
a
very
difficult
environment
sherman
said
he
aims
to
encourage
the
heart
of
his
officers
we
are
thrown
in
the

of
all
sorts
of
challenges
in
the

of

july
county
government
is
increasingly
leading
the
way
when
it
comes
to
deploying
technologies
that
matter
to
everyday
citizens
where
innovation
and
out
of
the
box
thinking
used
to
fall
to
bigger
better
funded
state
it
agencies
and
the
private
sector
regional
governments
have
turned
their
focus
to
being
more
adaptable
and
responsive
to
the
technology
needs
of
their
constituents
but
this
year
the
theme
among
the
five
first
place
winners
is
not
so
much
about
a
shiny
new
technology
as
much
as
it
is
about
knowing
when
and
how
to
introduce
it
whether
investing
in
new
tools
like
predictive
analytics
going
mobile
or
opening
data
to
the
public
these
organizations
are
making
very
real
differences
in
the
communities
they
serve
this
year
s
th
annual
digital

its

to
regional
government
it
in
recent
years
county
cio
bill
kehoe
said
efforts
to
tie
everything
back
to
the
big
picture
it
strategy
have
resulted
in
better
efficiencies
and
a
more
deliberate
deployment
of
necessary
tools
that
s
the
movement
that
i
have
seen
in
the
last
few
years
the
organization
and
the
county
have
gone
mainly
from
operational
and
transactional
to
more
of
a
strategic
and
innovative
approach
he
said
we
still
have
a
way
to
go
but
the
culture
is
changing
in
that
direction
there
is
also
a
lot
at
stake
in
the
county
not
only
because
of
the
expectations
put
on
modern
digital
government
but
also
the
proximity
to
companies
like
amazon
and
microsoft
whenever
it
comes
to
rolling
out
new
tech
for
their
internal
customer
departments
kehoe
said
the
process
of
engaging
with
county
staff
and
educating
them
is
imperative
to
long
term
success
the
solution
tailor
made
classes
designed
to
fit
the
individual
customer
needs
we
threw
a
lot
of
new
technology
at
our
customers
over
the
last
five
to
seven
years
because
the
state
of
the
technology
in
the
county
coming
out
of
the
recession
was
very
outdated
both
from
a
basic
infrastructure
to
just
a
lot
of
outdated
technology
he
said
what
it
did
was
really
overloaded
some
of
our
customers
with
new
technology
that
they
didn
t
necessarily
know
how
to
use
despite
the
digital
counties
recognition
the
cio
said
they
still
have
their
eyes
turned
to
the
big
picture
issues
such
as
cybersecurity
and
the
growing
demand
for
data
services
within
the
larger
king
county
community
meeting
the
call
for
greater
digital
equity
and
social
justice
continue
to
percolate
in
the
minds
of
leadership
and
the
it
team
the
expectation
is
a
lot
higher
and
the
accountability
is
a
lot
higher
which
is
good
but
i
wouldn
t
say
that
it
is
looked
at
as
you
guys
are
doing
great
and
don
t
need
to
improve
he
said
i
think
we
are
always
looking
to
improve
and
really
understand
where
our
customers
pain
points
are
and
new
ways
to
engage
with
them
as
well

county
cio
john
mccaffrey
isn
t
afraid
to
say
no
when
those
tools
don
t
add
value
to
the
county
s
overall
mission
in
recent
years
mccaffrey
has
noticed
the
growing
role
westchester
s
it
department
plays
in
the
daily
decision
making
process
rather
than
the
it
team
thinking
of
itself
as
customer
service
oriented
the
cio
said
they
are
now
considered
strategic
partners
they
consider
us
at
every
turn
where
technology
will
help
where
technology
should
lay
one
of
my
mantras
is
no
technology
for
technology
sake
he
said
sometimes
someone
is
trying
to
create
a
technology
project
around
something
that
shouldn
t
be
it
s
just
a
process
perhaps
where
it
s
skillset
is
most
valuable
is
in
the
business
process
improvement
arena
and
in
looking
at
the
way
departments
are
attacking
their
daily
workloads
from
weeding
out
duplicative
processes
to
implementing
a
new
solution
mccaffrey
said
his
it
staff
have
become
the
trusted
voice
when
it
comes
to
the
best
way
get
services
to
the
citizens
occasionally
he
joked
this
process
doesn
t
require
new
technology
at
all
just
a
new
way
to
use
it
one
of
our
things
that
we
have
been
getting
good
recognition
on
is
a
contract
reform
process
and
a
lot
of
it
is
around
workflow
and
document
management
and
the
process
itself
of
eliminating
paperwork
and
eliminating
procedures
that
were
just
duplicative
but
it
s
not
new
technology
per
se
in
looking
to
the
future
the
cio
said
he
would
like
to
see
the
county
expand
the
data
it
uses
to
make
informed
decisions
the
ever
expanding
internet
of
things
and
new
partnerships
could
soon
improve
the
ability
to
pinpoint
vital
service
deployments
across
all

in

and
relevant
tools
to
the
hands
of
their

customers
as
senior
it
manager
craig
vacura
explained
the
strategy
in
douglas
county
is
not
so
much
about
pouring
money
into
new
technology
as
it
is
about
building
from
a
good
foundation
like
their
colleagues
in
washington
s
king

the

team
in
douglas
county
serves
a
tech
savvy
constituency
some
of
whom
work
for
the
region
s
technology
companies
from
a
county
perspective
our
leadership
really
believes
in
technology
and
is
invested
in
technology
not
just
core
systems
but
in
areas
that
are
more
innovative
and
require
research
he
said
one
of
the
areas
that
was
really
invested
in
recently
is
open
data
and
shared
systems
and
partnering
with
other
counties
but
perhaps
as
important
as
providing
working
tools
to
the
personnel
and
departments
that
need
them
is
the
idea
of
breaking
down
the
barriers
between
departments
and
neighboring
county
partners
vacura
said
the
county
s
efforts
to
partner
with
other
jurisdictions
have
netted
some
great
returns
especially
with
regard
to
public
safety
moving
forward
vacura
said
the
county
is
looking
to
continue
its
work
with
gis
and
building
what
he
calls
a
fundamental
base
for
new
applications
but
they
also
will
be
continuing
efforts
to
look
deeper
into
the
capabilities
of
predictive
analytics
one
project
he
said
douglas
county
officials
are
excited
about
is
the
possibility
of
using
predictive
analytics
to
better
serve
child
welfare
and
human
services
functions
of
the
county
as
it
stands
the
county
is
collaborating
with
the
state
of
colorado
and
academic
partners
to
determine
if
and
how
such
a
tool
could
be
utilized
realistically

d
c
said
thinking
about
and
acting
on
technology
is
not
something
that
happens
in
a
vacuum
instead
he
explained
it
happens
in
the
communities
it
will
ultimately
affect
what
we
see
technology
as
is
really
an
enabler
and
what
we
try
to
do
in

work
the

are
up
and
the

are
secure
and
all
that
that
s
it
he
said
what
we
are
trying
to
do
is
advance
the
discussion
about
what
the
future
may
hold
for
the
community
he
calls
this
process
shaping
the
county
s
digital
destiny
regular

team
to
respond
with
solutions
that
fit
within

what
we
ve
done
is
elevate

should
we

there

going

be
a
rise
in

he
said
maybe
we
need
to
understand
the
considerations
around
that
and
maybe
we
need
to
think
about
more
parks
and
less

opportunities
for
improvement
one
area
that
drives
the
county
s
evolution
is
their
cloud
and
mobile
first
strategy
by
aiming
to
host
applications
and
services
in
the
cloud
the
county
is
already
working
with
a
forward
thinking
industry
cloud
infrastructure
also
cuts
costs
of
onsite
storage
and
allows
for
flexibility
by
not
having
to
divert
employee
time
to
maintenance
of
systems
it
s
no
secret
that
smartphones
have
changed
the
way
residents
across
the
country
connect
to
the
internet
for
lower
income
families
phones
are
often
the
only
connection
they
have
to
the
web
so
prioritizing
those
users
for
dekalb
gets
at
the
hardest
to
reach
populations
when
the
county
redesigned
its
website
in
november
it
was
optimized
for
mobile
users
using
responsive
design
in
drupal
in
conjunction
with
a
targeted
social
media
campaign
across
all
major
platforms
and
the
county
s
agendas
were
made
publicly
available
through
granicus
perhaps
the
largest
gains
have
been
from
dekalb
s
efforts
toward
increasing
cybersecurity
and
protecting
valuable
data
the
county
introduced
a
suite
of
cyberapplications
including
intrusion
detection
systems
and
intrusion
prevention
systems
ids
ips
to
help
manage
threats
analytics
dashboards
are
also
reviewed
daily
to
evaluate
the
state
of
the
system
intrusion
attempts
vectors
and
targets
are
monitored
continuously
with
alerts
set
up
for

summer
of

valley
calif
was
chosen
as
one
of
google

kickoff
sites
for
its

innovation
lab
the
goal
was
to
import
some
of
the
company
s
trademark
moonshot
thinking
and
apply
it
to
local
government
problems
if
returning
to
the
top
of
the
digital

survey
is
any
indication
then
the
workshop
was
a
booming
success
one
of
the
major
goals
addressed
in
the
county
was
maintaining
a
well
trained
and
committed
workforce
sitting
adjacent
to
silicon
valley
the
it
department
suffered
from
tough
competition
but
through
a
series
of
internships
and
reforms
to
the
hiring
process
the
county
was
able
to
make
tremendous
strides
in
workforce
acquisition
and
retention
the
other
main
goal
for
county
officials
was
implementing
a
no
youth
in
the
justice
system
program
focusing
on
the
high
rate
of
recidivism
the
county
developed
a
program
that
utilized
technology
to
create
a
data
sharing
tool
that
provides
timely
identification
and
analysis
of
data
that
is
related
to
law
enforcement
dealings
with
youth
this
tool
and
data
will
be
used
across
departments
to
guide
placement
link
community
support
services
and
inform
the
virtual
team

the
goal
of
reducing

to
see
why
for

assistance
from
the

taking
part
in
an
artificial

statewide
historical
data

being
analyzed
to
determine
whether

can
be
identified
in
the
data
and
is
being
cross
checked
with
actual

assessment
results
to
help
shape
the

the
county
also
maintains
strong
open

and
transparency
initiatives
including
making
data
that
was
commonly
requested
by
constituents
open
to
the
public
and
enabling

directly
within

innovative
ways
of
reducing

one
example
is
through
regional
cost
sharing
hamilton
and
several
neighboring

have
a
cross
jurisdictional
agreement
to
cover
the
cost
of
aerial

each
municipality
pays
for
the
acreage
within
their
jurisdiction
and
the
final
photography
is
shared
across
all
agencies
hamilton
has
also
outsourced
several
tasks
rather
than
devoting
scarce
resources
to
an
issue
and
has
reaped
significant
cost
savings
according
to
county
officials
outsourcing
tends
to
be
less
costly
faster
to
implement
and
more
robust
compared
to
a
building
custom
application
leveraging
vendors
for

feel
toward
its

interests
and
popular
subject
matter
one
thing
officials
gleaned
from
the

was
the
frequency
with
which
constituents
were
requesting
gis
layers
and
shapefiles
and
after
releasing
the
county
s
entire
gis
data
library
free
to
the
public
officials
went
further
and
created

impressive
is
the

expansion
of
its
opengov
platform

well
as

the
it
department
used
linkedin
recruiter
to
hire
a
systems
architect
from
florida
and
a
systems
engineer
from

perhaps
most
noteworthy
however
is
the
implementation
of
the
sheriff
s
office
s
automatic
injury
detection
aid
system
which
relies
on
plastic
panels
slipped

highlight
abstract
in
police
reform
circles
many
scholars
and
policymakers
diagnose
the
frayed
relationship
between
police
forces
and
the
communities
they
serve
as
a
problem
of
illegitimacy
or
the
idea
that
people
lack
confidence
in
the
police
and
thus
are
unlikely
to
comply
or
cooperate
with
them
the
core
proposal
emanating
from
this
illegitimacy
diagnosis
is
procedural
justice
a
concept
that
emphasizes
police
officers
obligation
to
treat
people
with
dignity
and
respect
behave
in
a
neutral
nonbiased
way
exhibit
an
intention
to
help
and
give
them
voice
to
express
themselves
and
their
needs
largely
in
the
context
of
police
stops
this
essay
argues
that
legitimacy
theory
offers
an
incomplete
diagnosis
of
the
policing
crisis
and
thus
de
emphasizes
deeper
structural
group
centered
approaches
to
the
problem
of
policing
the
existing
police
regulatory
regime
encourages
large
swaths
of
american
society
to
see
themselves
as
existing
within
the
law
s
aegis
but
outside
its
protection
this
essay
critiques
the
reliance
of
police
decision
makers
on
a
simplified
version
of
legitimacy
and
procedural
justice
theory
it
aims
to
expand
the
predominant
understanding
of
police
mistrust
among
african
americans
and
the
poor
proposing
that
legal
estrangement
offers
a
better
lens
through
which
scholars
and
policymakers
can
understand
and
respond
to
the
current
problems
of
policing
legal
estrangement
is
a
theory
of
detachment
and
eventual
alienation
from
the
law
s
enforcers
and
it
reflects
the
intuition
among
many
people
in
poor
communities
of
color
that
the
law
operates
to
exclude
them
from
society
building
on
the
concepts
of
legal
cynicism
and
anomie
in
sociology
the
concept
of
legal
estrangement
provides
a
way
of
understanding
the
deep
concerns
that
motivate
today
s
police
reform
movement
and
points
toward
structural
approaches
to
reforming

that
the
court
s
decision
which
further
weakened
the
power
of
the
exclusionary
rule
to
deter
unconstitutional
police
conduct
n
sent
a
message
particularly
to
people
of
color
that
you
are
not
a
citizen
of
a
democracy
but
the
subject
of
a
carceral
state
just
waiting
to
be
cataloged
n
justice
sotomayor
laments
treating
members
of
our
communities
as
second
class
citizens
n
yet
despite
the
boldness
of
her
statements
in
some
ways
justice
sotomayor
might
not
have
gone
quite
far
enough
in
articulating
the
troubling
implications
of
our
fourth
amendment
jurisprudence
justice
sotomayor
s
analysis
understates
the
problem
on
two
fronts
first
in
addition
to
the
jurisprudential
message
that
poor
people
of
color
are
subject
s
of
a
carceral
state
or
second
class
citizens
research
in
sociology
criminology
political
science
and
other
fields
suggests
that
these
groups
often
see
themselves
as
essentially
stateless
unprotected
by
the
law
and
its
enforcers
and
marginal
to
the
project
of
making
american
society
even
as
criminal
procedure
jurisprudence
sets
the
parameters
of
what
police
may
do
under
the
law
it
simultaneously
leaves
large
swaths
of
american
society
to
see
themselves
as
anomic
subject
only
to
the
brute
force
of
the
state
while
excluded
from
its
protection
the
message
conveyed
in
policing
jurisprudence
is
not
only
one
of
oppression
but
also
one
of
profound
estrangement
a
second
understatement
relates
to
the
understanding
of
whose
safety
is
at
risk
when
the
fourth
amendment
insufficiently
checks
the
power
of
the
police
justice
sotomayor
uses
the
second
person
pronoun
you
to
convey
to
a
public
audience
both
the
universality
and
the
personal
proximity
of
the
risk
of
police
control
n
yet
this
literary
technique
though
effective
obscures
the
reality
that
the
sense
of
alienation
in
a
carceral
regime
emanates
not
only
from
what
police
might
do
to
you
but
from
what
they
might
do
to
your
friends
your
intimate
partners
your
parents
your
children
to
people
of
your
race
or
social
class
and
to
people
who
live
in
the
neighborhood
or
the
city
where
you
live
in
other
words
estrangement
from
the
american
citizenry
is
not
merely
an
individual
feeling
to
which
people
of

tend
to
succumb
more
readily
than

era
has
catalyzed
meaningful
discussion
about
the
tense
relationship
between
the

many
racially

about

african

and
the
police
what
is
the
nature
of
these
relationships
how
can
scholars
and
policymakers
more
roundly
understand
their
contours
and
potential
strategies
for
change
many
scholars
and
policymakers
have
settled
on
a
legitimacy
deficit
as
the
core
diagnosis
of
the
frayed
relationship
between
police
forces
and
the
communities
they
serve
the
problem
this
argument
goes
is
that
people
of
color
and
residents
of
high
poverty
communities
do
not
trust
the
police
or
believe
that
they
treat
them
fairly
and
that
therefore
these
individuals
are
less
likely
to
obey
officers
commands
or
assist
with
investigations
n
this
argument
took
its
most
prominent
position
in
the
may
final
report
of
the
white
house
task
force
on
st
century
policing
the
report
sets
forth
the
goal
of
building
trust
and
legitimacy
as
both
the
first
pillar
of
its
proposed
approach
to
police
reform
and
as
the
foundational
principle
underlying
the
task
force
s
inquiry
into
the
nature
of
relations
between
law
enforcement
and
the
communities
they
serve
n
trust
is
a
broad
term
but
the
report
and
much
of
the
policymaking
energy
surrounding
shifts
in
police
governance
adopt
an
understanding
of
trust
that
treats
it
as
virtually
synonymous
with
legitimacy
n
ample
empirical
evidence
supports
the
idea
that
african
americans
and
residents
of
predominantly
african
american
neighborhoods
are
more
likely
than
whites
to
view
the
police
as
illegitimate
and
untrustworthy
along
several
axes
n
empirical
evidence
suggests
that
feelings
of
distrust
manifest
themselves
in
a
reduced
likelihood
among
african
americans
to
accept
law
enforcement
officers
directives
and
cooperate
with
their
crime
fighting
efforts
n
according
to
much
of
this
line
of
scholarship
the
primary
tool
to
achieve
greater
obedience
to
the
law
and
law
enforcement
regardless
of
race
is
procedural
justice
police
officers
treating
people
with
dignity
and
respect
behaving
in
a
neutral
nonbiased
way
exhibiting
an
intention
to
help
and
giving
people
voice
to
express
themselves
and
their
needs
in
interactions
n
yet
many
reformers
would
likely
disagree
that
obedience
to
law
enforcement
is
the
central
concern
in
america
s
current
conversation
on
police
reform
indeed
in
many
of
the
cases
that
have
most
catalyzed
the
black
lives
matter
movement
the
victims
of
police
violence
were
not
disobeying
the
law
n
were
complying
with
officers
demands
n
or
were
suspected
of
violating
petty
laws
that
are
likely
unworthy
of
strong
enforcement
efforts
or
penalties
n
a
large
body
of
scholarship
on
criminal
justice
attempts
to
denaturalize
the
assumed
link
between
obeying
the
law
and
criminal
justice
contact
n
scholars
have
shown
that
recent
trends
in
criminal
justice
such
as
pervasive
stop
and
frisk
increased
misdemeanor
prosecution
and
mass
incarceration
are
not
primarily
consequences
of
increases
in
criminal
offending
instead
these
scholars
suggest
that
the
american
criminal
justice
system
has
dual
purposes
only
one
of
which
is
crime
response
and
reduction
its
other
more
insidious
function
is
the
management
and
control
of
disfavored
groups
such
as
african
americans
latin
americans
the
poor
certain
immigrant
groups
and
groups
who
exist
at
the
intersection
of
those
identities
n
from
a
social
control
perspective
increasing
compliance
and
cooperation
with
law
enforcement
may
well
be
valuable
aims
but
they
should
not
be
at
the
root
of
police
reform
efforts
deploying
legitimacy
theory
and
procedural
justice
as
a
diagnosis
and
solution
to
the
current
policing
crisis
might
even
imply
at
some
level
that
the
problem
of
policing
is
better
understood
as
a
result
of
african
american
criminality
than
as
a
badge

to

threaten
to
send
the

to
chicago
to
respond
to
shootings
which
generally
fall
within
the
jurisdiction
of

trump
floated
a

would
seek

eliminate

for

the

funding
local

may
lack
the
staffing

alleged
goal

measures
recent
executive
orders
on
criminal
justice
issued
just
one
day
after
the
senate
confirmed
trump
s
attorney
general
jeff
sessions
continue
in
the
ambiguous
vein
of
supporting

gently
alluding
to
ways
that
impulse
might
conflict
with
responding

the
concerns
that

authorizes
the
task
force
to
propose
new
legislation

could
be
enacted
to
improve
public
safety

language
that
sounds
supportive
of
increased
criminalization
and
expansion
of
the
carceral
state
n
another
which
purports
to
prevent
violence
against
police
officers
similarly
proposes
new
federal
crimes
and
increase
d
penalties
for
existing
federal
crimes
against
officers
n
in
the
context
of
recent
debates
over
police
legitimacy
and
police
community
relations
these
orders
implicitly
paint
the
challenges
facing
criminal
justice
as
stemming
solely
from
criminality
they
ignore
the
institutional
failures
of
certain
police
departments
and
erase
the
structural
underpinnings
of
tense
police
community
relations
specifically
racial
isolation
and
class
marginalization
the
appointment
of
jeff
sessions
as
united
states
attorney
general
suggests
that
the
justice
department
s
civil
rights
division
will
end
its
investigations
of
local
departments
n
as
it
did
under
attorneys
general
alberto
gonzales
and
michael
mukasey
during
the
second
george
w

it
is
also
likely
that

funding
support
for
the
national
initiative
for
building
community
trust
justice
founded
on
legitimacy
and
procedural
justice
principles
will
end
n
yet
given
the
wide
embrace
of
procedural
justice
on
a
local
level
and
through
national
policing
organizations
it
would
not
be
surprising
if
procedural
justice
remained
the
prevailing
approach
even
if
the
federal
government
steps
back
from
actively
pushing
it
n
choosing
a
theory
of
the
policing
crisis
and
its
solutions
is
critical
for
advancing
meaningful
effective
reform
in
the
world
of
police
governance
and

perhaps
more
than
in
other
spheres

determining
what

getting
the

central
to
the
practical
project

this
essay
broadens
the
usual
lens
by
proposing
legal
estrangement
as
a
corrective
to
the
prevailing
legitimacy
perspective
on
police
reform
like
justice
sotomayor
in
strieff
n
the
legal
scholars
who
are
setting
the
police
reform
agenda
have
not
fully
captured
the
nature
of
the
distrustful
relationship
between
the
police
and
poor
and
african
american
communities
the
theory
of
legal
estrangement
provides
a
rounder
more
contextualized
understanding
of
this
relationship
that
examines
the
more
general
disappointment
and
disillusionment
felt
by
many
african
americans
and
residents
of
high
poverty
urban
communities
with
respect
to
law
enforcement
nearly
twenty
years

about

phenomenon

i
introduce
the
concept
of
legal
estrangement
to
capture
both
legal
cynicism
the
subjective
cultural
orientation
among
groups
in
which
the
law
and
the
agents
of
its
enforcement
such
as
the
police
and
courts
are
viewed
as
illegitimate
unresponsive
and
ill
equipped
to
ensure
public
safety
n
and
the
objective
structural
conditions
including
officer
behaviors
and
the
substantive
criminal
law
that
give
birth
to
this
subjective
orientation
the
concept
of
legal
estrangement
has
the
power
to
reorient
police
reform
efforts
because
it
clarifies
the
real
problem
of
policing
at
both
an
interactional
and
structural
level
current
regimes
can
operate
to
effectively
banish
whole
communities
from
the
body
politic
the
legal
estrangement
perspective
treats
social
inclusion
as
the
ultimate
end
of
law
enforcement
this
view
extends
and
reformulates
the
legitimacy
perspective
which
tends
to
present
inclusion
primarily
as
a
pathway
toward
deference
to
legal
authorities

legal
estrangement
approach

the
blight
of
police
distrust
in
african
american
communities
for
as
long
as
scholars
have
studied
the
relationship
between
african
americans
and
criminal
justice
they
have
documented
deep
distrust
of
the
system
in
the
early
twentieth
century
w
e
b
du
bois
was
likely
the
first
scholar
to
empirically
document
this
distrust
n
as
part
of
a
series
of
studies
of
african
american
life
du
bois
and
his
collaborators
collected
survey
interview
and
administrative
data
on
crime
arrest
and
incarceration
n
they
found
among
other
things
that
white
officials
and
black
men
had
greatly
divergent
perspectives
on
the
possibilities
of
justice
for
african
americans
in
georgia
courts
n
du
bois
reasoned
that
punishment
practices
prevalent
at
the
time
such
as
lynching
spread
among
black
folk
the
firmly
fixed
idea
that
few
accused
negroes
are
really
guilty
n
he
also
condemned
the
relative
lack
of
legal
protection
for
african
americans
as
well
as
criminal
justice
practices
such
as
the
leasing
of
convicts
that
sent
a
message
to
african
americans
that
the
purpose
of
the
system
was
to
make
money
for
the
state
rather
than
to
rehabilitate
supposed
lawbreakers
n
du
bois
s
research
was
prescient
at
least
with
respect
to
the
direction
of
research
and
scholarship
on
african
americans
relationship
to
the
crime
control
system
over
the
next
century
a
high
watermark
was
the
kerner
commission
report
commissioned
by
the
johnson
administration
in
the
wake
of
twenty
three
episodes
of
urban
unrest
during
the
mid
and
late
s
n
the
report
concluded
that
for
many
african
americans
the
police
have
come
to
symbolize
white
power
white
racism
and
white
repression
n
like
du
bois
s
georgia
study
the
report
documented
tension
and
hostility
between
law
enforcement
and
urban
african
americans
blaming
the
abrasive
relationship
on
a
combination
of
increased
demands
for
protection
and
service
and
the
police
practices
thought
necessary
to
provide
those
services

in
the
south
and
in
the
northeastern
and
midwestern
rust
belt
cities
where
many
african
americans
relocated
during
the
second
great
migration
police
forces
often
functioned
to
maintain
the
expulsion
of
african
americans
from
the
center
of
social
and
political
life
at
times
violating
the
law
in
service
of
racial
control

despite
pervasive
harsh
policing
that
ostensibly
was
intended
to
suppress
and
deter
crime
african
americans
felt
inadequately
protected
n
the
litany
of
evidence
confirming
the
existence
of
a
tense
and
distrustful
relationship
between
african
americans
and
law
enforcement
mounted
steadily
over
the
ensuing
decades
john
hagan
and
celesta
albonetti
for
example
used
data
from
a
national
survey
conducted
in
the
late
s
to
conclude
that
although
african
americans
were
more
likely
than
whites
to
see
all
aspects
of
the
criminal
justice
system
as
unjust
they
perceived
the
police
as
the
most
unjust
aspect
of
the
criminal
justice
system
n
drawing
from
nationally
representative
survey
data
from
the
late
s
tracey
meares
argued
that
many
african
americans
experience
dual
frustration
with
drugs
on
the
one
hand
and
with
harsh
courts
and
law
enforcement
on
the
other
n
more
recently
lawrence
bobo
and
victor
thompson
reached
similar
conclusions
finding
that
while
sixty
eight
percent
of
white
respondents
expressed
at
least
some
or
a
lot
of
confidence
in
the
police
only
eighteen
percent
of
black
respondents
would
say

same

have
shed
new
light
on
longstanding
tensions
between
african
americans
and
law
enforcement
n
newer
research
embeds
the
problem
of
police
distrust
within
a
larger
framework
of
race
and
class
based
marginalization
examining
a
range
of
police
practices
and
neighborhood
conditions
n
much
of
this
research
documents
african
american
distrust
or
dissatisfaction
with
the
law
and
law
enforcement
without
clearly
articulating
the
meaning
of
distrust
or
the
precise
content
of
dissatisfaction
this
omission
could
exist
in
part
because
the
sources
of
distrust
and
dissatisfaction
are
seen
as
relatively
obvious
a
large
body
of
historical
research
has
documented
the
entanglement
of
police
in
the
long
running
national
project
of
racial
control
n
yet
our
failure
to
be
specific
about
the
meaning
origins
and
content
of
distrust
has
produced
a
worrisome
incompleteness
in
the
diagnosis
of
the
problem
and
thus
in
the
prognosis
and
program
of
treatment
n
trust
is
a
multidimensional
difficult
to
define
concept
that
scholars
operationalize
using
myriad
approaches
n
yet
in
the
world
of
policing
scholarship
the
leading
scholar
and
definer
of
trust
is
tom
tyler
rather
than
understanding
trust
and
legitimacy
as
synonymous
tyler
conceptualizes
trust
as
part
of
the
larger
umbrella
of
legitimacy
theoretically
tyler
defines
legitimacy
as
a
person
s
perceived
obligation
to
obey
the
law
n
or
the
belief
that
legal
authorities
are
entitled
to
be
obeyed
and
that
the
individual
ought
to
defer
to
their
judgments
n
different
surveys
and
experiments
define
legitimacy
in
distinctive
ways
but
the
core
formulation
considers
people
s
sense
of
obligation
to
follow
the
law
their
sense
of
whether
the
law
operates
to
protect
the
advantaged
which
tyler
and
huo
call
cynicism
about
the
law
n
their
trust
in
legal
institutions
specifically
police
officers
and
judges
and
their
favorability
toward
the
police
and
the
courts
in
their
city
n
the
conceptual
distinctions
between
all
of
the
manifestations
of
trust
that
appear
in
the
large
body
of
legitimacy
scholarship
can
become
blurry
and
it
is
beyond
the
scope
of
this
essay
to
reconcile
all
of
these
iterations
the
core
insight
to
keep
in
mind
is
that
in
the
version
of
legitimacy
theory
that
policing
policymakers
have
adopted
most
completely
trust
between
police
and
communities
is
understood
as
a
problem
of
illegitimacy
the
key
concern
is
the
degree
to
which
people
will
choose
to
obey
the
law
and
its
enforcers
much
literature
has
shown
that
regardless
of
how
trust
is
measured
or
conceived
african
americans
particularly
those
who
are
poor
or
who
live
in
high
poverty
or
predominantly
african
american
communities
tend
to
have
less
trust
not
only
in
police
but
also
in
other
governmental
institutions
in
their
neighbors
and
even
in
their
intimate
partner
relationships
in
comparison
to
other
racial
and
ethnic
groups
in
the
united
states
n
the
picture
that
emerges
from
the
full
body
of
research
on
race
and
trust
is
one
of
profound
marginalization
a
social
diminishment
that
while
not
encapsulating
the
fullness
of
the
african
american
experience
indicates
that
poor
african
americans
as
a
whole
tend
to
have
a
social
experience
distinctive
from
those
of
other
ethnic
and
class
groups
in
the
united
states
structural
disadvantage
yields
a
broader
cultural
structure
of
mistrust
most
discussions
of
african
american
distrust
of
the
police
only
skirt
the
edges
of
a
deeper
well
of
estrangement
between
poor
communities
of
color
and
the
law
and
in
turn
society
ii
two
diagnoses
a
a
crisis
of
legitimacy
the
most
widely
accepted
diagnosis
of
the
cleavage
between
the
police
and
african
americans
particularly
poor
african
americans
centers
on
legitimacy
scholars
argue
that
african
americans
are
less
likely
than
other
groups
to
see
the
police
as
legitimate
authorities
meaning
that
as
a
group
they
are
less
likely
to
have
a
feeling
of
obligation
to
obey
the
law
and
to
defer
to
the
decisions
made
by
legal
authorities
n
although
trust
and
legitimacy
are
distinct
concepts
scholars
and
policymakers
tend
to
treat
the
ideas
as
functionally
equivalent
for
reform
purposes
the
core
determinant
of
whether
law
enforcement
is
perceived
as
legitimate
and
thus
worthy
of
obedience
and
assistance
is
whether
police
officers
behave
in
a
procedurally
just
manner
n
procedural
justice
is
believed
to
encapsulate
several
components
including
treating
people
with
dignity
and
respect
voice
which
can
include
citizen
participation
and
allowing
individuals
to
express
their
concerns
neutrality
freedom
from
bias
and
conveying
trustworthy
motives
explaining
how
the
police
are
helping
reach
an
important
social
goal
n
tyler
and
his
colleagues
were
not
the
first
to
articulate
a
socio
legal
rationale
for
procedural
justice
n
but
their
formulation
has
had
the
greatest
influence
over
the
push
toward
procedural
justice
in
policing
an
overview
of
the
genealogy
of
police
legitimacy
theory
is
helpful
for
distinguishing
it
from
legal
estrangement
although
the
research
on
police
legitimacy
primarily
draws
from
social
psychology
the
theoretical
underpinnings
of
the
concept
like
much
of
the
scholarship
on
legal
legitimacy
across
domains
n
usually
derive
from
the
work
of
sociologist
max
weber
n
from
weber
s
standpoint
legitimation
is
a
subjective
process
it
does
not
inhere
in
an
authority
s
procedures
or
existence
but
is
continuously
negotiated
with
subjects
talcing
into
account
their
views
n
weber
classified
the
types
of
authority
that
legitimate
orders
tend
to
exhibit
into
three
ideal
types
n
charismatic
authority
or
authority
based
on
perceived
personal
divinity
or
exemplariness
traditional
authority
based
on
custom
and
epitomized
by
the
king
and
legal
rational
authority
the
form
of
authority
found
most
frequently
in
modern
advanced
society
which
is
based
on
process
and
consent
n
weber
believed
that
legal
rational
authority
the
focus
of
nearly
all
research
on
legitimacy
today
is
in
some
ways
the
preferred
version
of
legitimation
because
this
legitimation
strategy
makes
clear
that
in
choosing
government
through
transparent
rational
means
human
beings
are
exercising
their
autonomy
and
free
will
n
while
the
threat
of
violence
from
the
state
always
lurks
the
state
s
authority
over
its
citizens
primarily
comes
from
the
state
s
adherence
to
process
n
in
the
legal
and
political
realms
n
the
purpose
of
legitimacy
theory
is
to
understand
how
the
state
from
a
moral
perspective
justifies
its
power
and
how
as
an
empirical
matter
it
most
effectively
exercises
power
over
its
subjects
n
state
power
is
the
ultimate
focal
point
of
legitimacy
analysis
n
the
question
then
becomes
how
does
the
state
attain
power
over
its
subjects
theorists
such
as
habermas
refined
the
concept
of
legitimacy
to
emphasize
consent
adding
a
layer
of
deliberation
and
positing
that
legitimacy
can
be
built
through
dialogue
among
equal
citizens
n
along
these
lines
but
with
concern
about
the
normative
implications
of
consent
gramsci
argued
that
governments
and
more
precisely
capitalist
governments
gained
legitimacy
through
ideological
and
cultural
hegemony
legitimation
is
a
bundle
of
processes
that
elites
use
to
procure
public
buy
in
to
oppressive
systems
n
regardless
of
the
normative
valence
of
consent
its
emphasis
in
the
study
of
legitimacy
has
led
social
psychology
research
to
focus
largely
on
what
makes
people
voluntarily
obey
and
help
the
state
n
this
consent
based
conception
of
legitimacy
falls
in
line
with
a
focus
among
policymakers
on
how
to
increase
voluntary
adherence
to
the
law
n
the
empirical
work
also
tries
to
ascertain
how
the
circumstances
under
which
the
community
sees
legal
authority
as
legitimate
might
vary
across
groups
this
focus
on
consent
has
produced
some
insights
about
the
nature
of
racial
divergence
in
police
legitimacy
two
insights
have
been
most
central
first
across
racial
ethnic
groups
people
tend
to
view
police
as
legitimate
when
they
are
procedurally
just
and
people
tend
to
interpret
fairness
similarly
across
eth
no
racial
divides
n
second
the
primary
reason
african
americans
do
not
see
police
as
legitimate
is
because
they
tend
to
have
more
personal
experiences
in
which
police
officers
treat
them
in
a
procedurally
unjust
manner
n
although
little
is
known
about
the
specific
behaviors
and
practices
that
people
consider
fair
or
unfair
n
the
police
legitimacy
literature
empirically
shows
that
people
want
the
same
type
of
treatment
from
police
regardless
of
their
race
or
class
this
conclusion
means
that
african
americans
greater
distrust
of
the
police
results
not
from
supposed
subcultural
values
or
bad
culture
but
instead
arises
as
the
product
of
negative
personal
experiences
this
insight
has
driven
legal
scholarship
in
several
directions
n
most
central
to
the
analysis
of
this
essay
police
legitimacy
scholarship
encouraged
legal
scholars
to
explore
ways
that
the
law
might
better
facilitate
procedurally
just
policing
and
respond
to
procedurally
unjust
policing
policies
and
practices
steven
schulhofer
tom
tyler
and
aziz
huq
present
one
of
the
most
fully
elaborated
applications
of
legitimacy
theory
to
policing
applying
the
theory
to
both
conventional
and
counterterrorism
policing
n
they
set
forth
three
policy
goals
that
should
emanate
from
the
procedural
justice
policing
model
training
officers
to
treat
force
as
a
last
resort
and
to
view
every
citizen
contact
as
an
opportunity
to
build
legitimacy
through
the
tone
and
quality
of
the
interaction
n
eschewing
regulation
of
the
police
through
the
blunt
instruments
of
the
law
for
example
the
exclusionary
rule
in
favor
of
internal
department
management
policies
designed
to
positively
motivate
police
to
treat
the
public
fairly
n
and
in
the
counterterrorism
realm
avoiding
the
impulse
to
authorize
the
use
of
harsh
tactics
such
as
ethno
racial
profiling
and
random
checkpoints
n
schulhofer
tyler
and
huq
s
approach
is
distinctively
what
rachel
harmon
calls
non
law
n
in
the
sense
that
it
explicitly
rejects
legal
intervention
into
policing
their
core
suggestions
are
training
the
substance
of
which
is
highly
discretionary
and
rarely
encoded
directly
into
law
and
avoiding
litigation
based
pathways
toward
systemic
reform
such
as
the
department
of
justice
consent
decree
process
the
solutions
do
not
involve
creating
changing
or
enforcing
the
law
this
means
that
even
if
these
approaches
are
effective
they
largely
leave
intact
the
legal
structure
that
has
given
birth
to
distrust
and
illegitimacy
meares
has
made
several
proposals
to
encourage
departments
to
adopt
principles
of
procedural
justice
conceptually
she
has
advanced
the
notion
of
rightful
policing
the
idea
that
policing
should
be
designed
to
maximize
both
lawful
conduct
and
community
perceptions
of
police
legitimacy
n
building
in
part
from
schulhofer
tyler
and
huq
s
idea
that
persuading
and
incentivizing
police
to
treat
people
fairly
will
be
more
effective
than
forcing
them
to
do
so
meares
s
scholarship
has
embraced
community
policing
efforts
such
as
project
safe
neighborhoods
in
chicago
illinois
project
exile
in
richmond
virginia
and
operation
ceasefire
in
boston
massachusetts
these
programs
methods
include
organizing
meetings
with
ex
offenders
to
build
relationships
and
inform
them
of
alternative
opportunities
to
crime
as
well
as
holistic
problem
solving
approaches
such
as
legitimacy
based
hot
spots
policing
also
known
as
focused
deterrence
n
these
approaches
are
a
sort
of
proactive
policing
that
should
according
to
their
proponents
avoid
the
pitfalls
of
earlier
forms
of
broken
windows
policing
because
they
now
emphasize
procedural
justice
in
the
micro
level
interactions
of
police
contact
n
scholars
have
proposed
a
variety
of
other
interventions
to
build
legitimacy
as
well
for
example
some
have
proposed
that
law
enforcement
randomize
police
stops
and
searches
in
theory
randomization
should
allow
police
to
engage
in
hands
on
crime
prevention
without
negatively
impacting
the
legitimacy
of
the
system
by
making
specific
people
particularly
young
african
american
and
latino
men
feel
targeted
n
other
scholars
have
incorporated
these
concerns
about
spatial
and
racial
distribution
of
procedurally
unjust
policing
into
fourth
amendment
arguments
they
propose
that
courts
should
consider
whether
officers
were
making

individualized
determination
of
suspicion
as

required
n
or
rather
engaging
in
a
collective
determination
of
suspicion
based

n
the
greatest
strength
of
the
police
legitimacy
approach
is
its
deceptive
simplicity
its
two
core
ideas
that
people
will
accept
unfavorable
police
decisions
so
long
as
the
preceding
processes
are
perceived
to
be
fair
and
that
the
police
should
treat
all
people
including
african
americans
and
the
poor
with
dignity
and
respect
in
order
to
be
more
effective
at
the
work
of
crime
deterrence
are
marked
deviations
from
the
prevailing
wisdom
about
policing
that
preceded
legitimacy
theory
for
example
as
noted
above
the
kerner
commission
report
partly
blamed
african
americans
cynicism
about
the
police
on
the
harsh
tactics
that
police
deemed
necessary
to
control
crime
in
predominantly
black
inner
city
neighborhoods
n
in
one
of
the
earliest
in
depth
studies
of
urban
police
william
l
a
westley
found
that
the
police
officers
he
studied
tended
to
view
both
african
americans
and
residents
of
poor
neighborhoods
as
requiring
a
fundamentall
different
type
of
policing
than
other
groups
because
those
two
groups
would
respond
only
to
fear
and
rough
treatment
n
officers
today
are
not
as
likely
to
overtly
express
racial
animus
but
they
might
use
different
language
focused
on
class
and
culture
to
make
a
similar
point
n
justifications
for
race
and
class
differentiated
policing
partly
derive
from
a
view
that
police
tactics
must
vary
by
the
type
of
community
in
order
to
be
effective
the
procedural
justice
approach
is
a
partial
corrective
to
that
common
wisdom
however
police
legitimacy
is
not
all
encompassing
and
it
is
often
disturbingly
oversimplified
in
practice
policymakers
and
police
department
leaders
attempting
to
apply
the
theory
often
condense
it
to
empirically
informed
officer
politeness
n
most
legitimacy
scholars
would
not
claim
that
the
lack
of
legitimacy
is
the
sole
problem
in
the
relationship
between
law
enforcement
and
african
american
and
poor
communities
or
that
procedural
justice
is
the
only
solution
needed
n
yet
much
of
the
current
reform
conversation
has
drawn
heavily
on
legitimacy
theory
and
the
procedural
justice
approach
as
if
they
are
silver
bullet
solutions
to
today
s
policing
crisis
reformers
have
done
so
in
part
because
the
proposals
that
emanate
from
the
procedural
justice
perspective
such
as
improved
officer
training
n
are
relatively
easy
for
police
agencies
to
implement
relatively
inexpensive
and
relatively
noncontroversial
while
offering
some
real
on
the
ground
benefits
to
civilians
who
encounter
the
police
n
if
the
solution
to
today
s
social
and
legal
policing
problems
is
training
the
path
forward
is
clear
yet
some
scholars
have
worried
that
without
an
emphasis
on
the
problem
of
collective
estrangement
through
social
and
racial
control
the
procedural
justice
solution
could
paradoxically
teach
officers
more
effective
ways
to
discriminate
and
violate
privacy
n
indeed
fourth
amendment
jurisprudence
on
the
voluntariness
of
searches
foregrounds
this
danger
courts
often
mention
the
politeness
or
courtesy
of
officers
when
using
a
totality
of
the
circumstances
analysis
to
decide
whether
a
warrantless
search
was
voluntary
at
times
debating
the
relative
importance
of
politeness
in
the
voluntariness
analysis
n
thin
conceptions
of
procedural
justice
could
produce
what
jeremy
bentham
called
sham
security
n
leaving
some
individuals
with
a
vague
sense
that
they
have
been
treated
justly
while
neglecting
more
fundamental
questions
of
justice
an
expanded
theoretical
approach
understands
distrust
as
a
problem
of
legal
estrangement
a
marginal
and
ambivalent
relationship
with
society
the
law
and
predominant
social
norms
that
emanates
from
institutional
and
legal
failure
in
the
following
part
i
discuss
estrangement
theory
and
its
distinctions
from
police
legitimacy
theory
in
greater
detail
the
legal
estrangement
perspective
can
provide
a
fresh
perspective
in
research
and
policy
on
the
extent
to
which
african
americans
and
people
who
live
in
high
poverty
communities
feel
a
sense
of
solidarity
with
law
enforcement
and
other
legal
institutions
moreover
this
approach
could
help
scholars
and
policymakers
imagine
new
ways
to
promote
solidarity
and
social
inclusion
through
law
and
policy
b
a
crisis
of
estrangement
while
legitimacy
theory
has
its
roots
in
weber
n
the
distinctive
elements
of
legal
estrangement
theory
are
rooted
in
mile
durkheim
for
durkheim
the
central
project
of
modern
society
is
to
maintain
organic
solidarity
defined
as
social
cohesion
based
on
fulfillment
of
the
different
functions
each
person
serves
within
society
n
ideally
law
s
function
is
to
create
and
maintain
social
cohesion
law
is
not
understood
as
an
end
in
itself
nor
solely
a
means
of
bodily
control
n
in
the
durkheimian
view
the
purpose
of
criminal
justice
is
to
restore
those
who
break
the
law
with
the
ultimate
goal
of
increasing
social
cohesion
by
reinforcing
moral
and
legal
norms
n
a
society
that
does
not
reinforce
moral
norms
and
does
not
promote
social
trust
leaves
its
inhabitants
in
a
state
of
anomie
with
broken
social
bonds
although
durkheim
originated
the
concept
of
anomie
the
idea
gained
greater
precision
and
liberation
from
its
purely
pro
state
perspective
in
the
work
of
robert
merton
for
merton
anomie
is
a
breakdown
in
the
cultural
structure
of
society
n
these
breakdowns
are
particularly
likely
to
occur
when
there
is
an
acute
disjunction
between
the
cultural
norms
and
goals
and
the
socially
structured
capacities
of
members
of
the
group
to
act
in
accord
with
them
n
in
other
words
cultural
structures
break
down
when
despite
a
group
s
adoption
of
mainstream
cultural
norms
and
goals
certain
aspects
of
the
social
structure
prevent
them
from
being
able
to
act
in
ways
that
support
those
norms
and
goals
although
the
suitability
of
durkheim
s
comprehensive
view
of
law
and
punishment
for
modern
contexts
is
questionable
n
the
broadest
reading
of
anomie
theory
that
the
purpose
of
the
legal
system
is
to
create
a
cohesive
and
inclusive
society
and
that
a
broken
social
order
leaves
some
people
without
the
resources
for
full
social
membership
is
at
the
root
of
legal
estrangement
theory
a
century
after
durkheim
originated
the
anomie
concept
and
decades
after
merton
refined
it
sociologists
robert
sampson
and
dawn
jeglum
bartusch
offered
legal
cynicism
as
a
framework
for
understanding
how
residents
of
predominantly
african
american
neighborhoods
in
chicago
thought
about
the
law
and
its
enforcers
n
sampson
and
bartusch
defined
legal
cynicism
as
anomie
about
law
n
anomie
is
more
than
distrust
instead
it
is
a
sense
that
the
very
fabric
of
the
social
world
is
in
chaos
a
sense
of
social
estrangement
meaninglessness
and
powerlessness
often
a
result
of
structural
instability
and
social
change
n
it
is
a
sense
founded
on
legal
and
institutional
exclusion
and
liminality
n
perhaps
the
strongest
articulation
of
legal
anomie
comes
from
eminent
ethnographer
elijah
anderson
who
credited
the
tendency
to
use
extra
legal
forms
of
violence
among
some
of
his
research
subjects
in
inner
city
philadelphia
to
the
profound
sense
of
alienation
from
mainstream
society
and
its
institutions
felt
by
many
poor
inner
city
black
people
n
in
contrast
law
that
is
well
designed
and
properly
enforced
should
reassure
community
members
that
society
has
not
abandoned
them
that
they
are
engaged
in
a
collective
project
of
making
the
social
world
one
concern
with
labeling
anomie
about
law
as
legal
cynicism
is
that
the
word
cynicism
suggests
that
the
attitudinal
perspective
of
communities
is
the
issue
of
interest
rather
than
the
process
that
led
to
a
cultural
orientation
toward
distrusting
the
police
the
legal
cynicism
term
works
for
the
approach
taken
by
sampson
and
bartusch
as
well
as
that
of
kirk
and
papachristos
as
both
seek
to
link
legal
cynicism
as
measured
in
a
survey
with
a
number
of
outcomes
however
anomie
refers
not
only
to
the
subjective
feeling
of
concern
it
is
also
meant
to
implicate
a
particular
set
of
structural
conditions
that
produced
that
subjective
feeling

i
use
legal
estrangement
in
this
essay
to
better
capture
the
fullness
of
the
idea
of
anomie
about
law
legal
estrangement
can
help
scholars
understand
situations
where
even
despite
the
embrace
of
legality
by
african
americans
and
residents
of
high
poverty
neighborhoods
and
regardless
of
the
degree
to
which
they
embrace
law
enforcement
officials
as
legitimate
authorities
they
are
nonetheless
structurally
ostracized
through
law
s
ideals
and
priorities
the
theoretical
and
empirical
genealogies
of
legitimacy
and
legal
cynicism
reveal
important
distinctions
first
the
overwhelming
majority
of
the
legitimacy
research
has
sought
to
describe
a
general
perception
of
law
enforcement
and
legal
authority
based
on
a
representative
sample
of
the
public
n
in
contrast
scholarship
on
legal
cynicism
the
attitudinal
portion
of
legal
estrangement
theory
has
generally
sought
to
describe
a
contextualized
ecological
view
of
law
enforcement
this
scholarship
has
particularly
focused
its
efforts
on
understanding
the
nature
of
the
fraught
relationship
between
african
americans
and
high
poverty
communities
on
the
one
hand
and
the
police
on
the
other
n
legal
estrangement
is
a
cultural
and
systemic
mechanism
that
exists
both
within
and
beyond
individual
perceptions
it
is
partly
representative
of
a
state
of
anomie
related
to
the
law
and
legal
authorities
and
it
interacts
with
legal
and
other
structural
conditions
for
example
poverty
racism
and
gender
hierarchy
to
maintain
segregation
and
dispossession
the
salience
of
a
targeted
collective
community
oriented
analysis
is
even
greater
when
seeking
to
understand
the
realities
that
gave
birth
to
black
lives
matter
many
scholars
and
advocates
have
argued
that
african
americans
are
particularly
likely
to
assess
the
legitimacy
effectiveness
and
justness
of
institutions
based
on
their
beliefs
about
how
these
institutions
treat
african
americans
as
a
group
and
not
just
their
individual
experiences
n
a
person
could
simultaneously
see
the
police
as
a
legitimate
authority
believing
that
individuals
should
obey
officer
commands
in
the
abstract
and
feel
estranged
from
the
police
believing
that
the
legal
system
and
law
enforcement
as
the
individual
s
group
experiences
these
institutions
are
fundamentally
flawed
and
chaotic
and
therefore
send
negative
messages
about
the
group
s
societal
belonging
n
some
scholarship
on
the
legal
mistrust
of
poor
african
americans
could
be
misread
to
suggest
that
a
large
subset
of
this
group
possesses
values
that
are
antithetical
to
law
abiding
behavior
almost
as
if
these
individuals
do
not
care
what
the
law
is
and
do
not
believe
they
should
be
bound
by
it
a
better
supported
interpretation
is
that
many
poor
african
americans
might
see
police
as
a
legitimate
authority
in
the
ideal
and
might
even
empathize
with
some
police
officers
plight
but
they
find
the
police
as
a
whole
too
corrupt
unpredictable
or
biased
to
deem
them
trustworthy
n
even
as
they
accept
the
ideal
vision
of
the
police
as
the
state
authorized
securers
of
public
safety
their
nonideal
working
theory
might
be
as
earlier
research
suggests
that
the
police
are
just
another
gang
n
estrangement
theory
can
improve
legitimacy
theory
in
three
main
ways
first
certainly
in
its
initial
stages
legitimacy
theory
has
emphasized
whether
people
feel
voluntarily
obligated
to
obey
or
cooperate
with
law
enforcement
the
theoretical
starting
point
of
legitimacy
analysis
is
whether
and
how
the
state
maintains
and
exercises
its
power
in
an
analysis
based
on
legal
estrangement
theory
increasing
the
power
of
the
state
bears
at
most
a
spurious
relationship
to
the
outcome
of
concern
which
is
social
inclusion
across
groups
from
a
robust
legal
estrangement
perspective
the
law
s
purpose
is
the
creation
and
maintenance
of
social
bonds
an
emphasis
on
inclusion
implies
concerns
not
only
about
how
individuals
perceive
the
police
and
the
law
and
thus
whether
those
individuals
cooperate
with
the
state
s
demands
but
about
the
signaling
function
of
the
police
and
the
law
to
groups
about
their
place
in
society
while
legitimacy
theorists
might
acknowledge
the
value
of
these
sorts
of
community
feelings
they
are
not
those
theorists
key
variables
of
interest
n
shifting
the
orientation
of
legitimacy
theory
from
governmental
power
to
social
inclusion
is
one
way
that
theory
can
better
capture
the
concerns
of
activists
in
the
era
of
black
lives
matter
second
given
its
origins
in
legal
cynicism
theory
a
legal
estrangement
perspective
emphasizes
cultural
orientation
toward
the
police
rather
than
individual
attitudes
about
the
police
a
cultural
inquiry
is
concerned
with
the
symbolic
and
structural
meaning
of
the
police
to
particular
groups
of
people
as
opposed
to
those
individuals
opinions
about
police

people
s
opinions
about
their

their
beliefs
about
whether
the
police
in
general
tend
to
be
helpful
and
the
symbolic
meanings
they
attach
to
the
police
can
be
sharply
divergent
from
each
other
n
third
while
most
legitimacy
theorists
treat
individuals
as
their
unit
of
analysis
and
theorization
the
legal
estrangement
framework
is
ultimately
focused
on
groups
and
communities
even
as
studies
are
unavoidably
conducted
by
looking
at
individual
experiences
the
broader
concern
of
legal
estrangement
is
with
understanding
people
in

viewing
distrust
of
the
law
as
a
problem

despite
the
pestilence
of
untimely
death
that
then
and
now
marks
her
neighborhood
n
shawna
has
thus
far
been
spared
the
memory
of
seeing
a
human
being
die
but
she
is
familiar
with
the
pop
pop
pop
of
gunshots
interrupting
a
basketball
game
she
can
still
hear
the
hum
of
an
open
windowed
truck
rolling
closer
while
prowling
for
targets
the
screams
of
neighbors
recognizing
a
familiar
horror
the
thumps
of
her
playmates
chests
hitting
the
ground
seeking
safety
and
the
thuds
of
their
shoes
rapidly
beating
the
hot
asphalt
where
they
had
been
dribbling
a
ball
moments
earlier
she
remembers
that
a
sudden
paralysis
afflicted
her
limbs
on
those
occasions
she
remembers
that
her
mother
would
run
to
her
corral
her
somebody
would
get
shot
somebody
would
get
killed
somebody
would
get
stabbed
outside
my
house
in
front
of
my
house
on
the
basketball
court
where
i
spent
most
of
my
time
there
for
real
shawna
s
mother
denise
was
in
shawna
s
estimation
paranoid
every
now
and
then
denise
got
fed
up
and
called
the
police
about
various
neighborhood
disturbances
she
s
a
good
person
shawna
explained
but
denise
avoided
calling
the
police
from
her
own
phone
and
instead
went
to
a
neighbor
s
home
to
call
to
be
sure
denise
sometimes
called
police
from
a
neighbor
s
phone
because
her
own
phone
was
disconnected
but
shawna
suspects
that
the
more
usual
reason
denise
called
from
her
neighbor
s
phone
was
so
the
call
would
come
from
a
number
other
than
hers
making
it
more
difficult
for
police
and
potential
retaliators
to
learn
that
she
was
the
snitch
she
had
to
call
from
some
other
number
because
she
just
it
was
unsafe
for
her
people
can
call
the
police
anonymously
n
but
denise
suspected
the
police
would
find
out
who
she
was
anyway
and
that
they
would
be
too
careless
to
protect
her
identity
denise
warned
shawna
about
crime
in
the
neighborhood
and
kept
shawna
indoors
as
much
as
the
active
extroverted
girl
could
tolerate
denise
also
warned
shawna
about
the
neighborhood
s
police
petrified
by
her
daughter
s
awe
of
them
w
hen
i
was
little
shawna
recalled
i
used
to
idolize
the
police
and
i
used
to
be
like
oh
can
i
be
like
you
when
i
grow
up
what
is
it
that
you
do
asking
them
a
whole
bunch
of
questions
her
mother
urged
her
to
stay
away
from
police
officers
once
when
shawna
was
about
eight
years
old
she
was
chatting
with
two
white
police
officers
who
she
thinks
were
in
the
neighborhood
to
investigate
drug
activity
as
shawna
remembers
it
she
asked
the
officers
what
they
do
how
she
could
become
a
police
officer
and
so
on
i
was
a
serious
young
lady
shawna
joked
denise
saw
shawna
with
the
officers
and
panicked
get
over
here
get
over
here
get
over
here
girl
shawna
asked
w
hat
did
i
do
denise
continued
agitated
who
told
you
to
talk
to
them
they
can
do
anything
to
you
they
can
take
you
and
kill
you
shawna
was
perplexed
they
re
police
why
would
they
just
take
me
and
kill
me
over
the
decade
or
so
since
that
incident
shawna
s
once
pristine
view
of
police
has
grown
ever
more
tainted
this
tarnishing
process
has
been
propelled
not
only
by
her
personal
experiences
but
also
through
witnessing
the
encounters
of
her
friends
and
neighbors
hearing
about
other
incidents
through
television
and
social
media
and
gaining
folk
wisdom
from
family
and
older
community
members
for
example
several
years
before
the
daniel
holtzclaw
case
broke
n
as
a
pubescent
girl
shawna
learned
from
her
grandmother
that
the
police
could
rape
her
i
don
t
know
the
whole
story
but
my
grandma
told
me
how
one
of
the
police
in
my
community
some
man
had
taken
this
little
girl
she
was
about
twelve
i
don
t
know
if
she
was
missing
or
if
he
just
took
her
anyway
he
took
her
and
he
raped
her
in
the
back
of
the
police
station
and
they
caught
it
on
camera
then
my
grandmother
told
me
about
it
i
was
like
twelve
at
the
time
which
was
just
a
couple
of
years
after
the
rape
i
was
like
wow
shawna
s
confusion
grew
the
police
is
supposed
to
have
power
and
supposed
to
be
using
it
for
good
but
the
police
also
did
that
to
that
little
girl
it
s
just
terrible
that
story
funneled
through
her
beloved
grandmother
is
now
embedded
in
her
psyche
and
colors
her
more
recent
experiences
with
and
observations
of
police
officers
that
just
made
me
think
twice
about
the
police
ever
since
then
i
just
don
t
know
the
case
shawna
is
likely
referencing
involved
william
d
welch
a
former
baltimore
police
officer
who
entered
an
alford
plea
n
to
a
charge
of
misconduct
in
office
in
early
when
shawna
was
ten
n
after
another
officer
arrested
a
sixteen
year
old
girl
based
on
an
open
warrant
for
prostitution
welch
allegedly
offered
to
dispose
of
marijuana
that
was
in
her
possession
if
she
sexually
serviced
him
according
to
the
accuser
she
and
welch
flushed
the
marijuana
down
a
police
station
toilet
and
returned
to
the
interview
room
where
she
complied
with
his
conditions
n
prosecutors
originally
charged
welch
with
second
degree
rape
however
after
the
police
department
s
evidence
control
unit
misplaced
much
of
the
physical
evidence
against
welch
prosecutors
offered
and
welch
accepted
a
plea
deal
n
welch
thus
avoided
prison
a
judge
sentenced
welch
to
a
suspended
ten
year
prison
term
after
three
years
of
probation
and
ordered
him
to
resign
from
the
baltimore
police
department
n
but
shawna
might
have
been
talking
about
a
different
case
there
were
other
prominent
rape
cases
against
baltimore
police
officers
in
roughly
the
same
time
period
like
the
welch
case
the
facts
of
those
cases
do
not
perfectly
align
with
the
story
lodged
in
shawna
s
mind
today
n
shawna
s
understanding
of
the
police
grew
darker
still
through
encounters
and
observations
at
the
bus
station
near
the
iconic
mondawmin
mall
arguably
west
baltimore
s
central
hub
mondawmin
one
of
the
city
s
oldest
enclosed
shopping
malls
is
more
than
a
retail
center
it
is
also
the
nerve
center
for
ten
west
baltimore
bus
lines
and
the
location
of
government
social
services
offices
and
various
health
clinics
n
inside
the
mall
uniformed
private
security
guards
are
tasked
with
maintaining
mondawmin
s
security
while
on
the
outside
western
district
police
officers
handle
the
job
shawna
does
not
distinguish
between
the
public
and
private
police
she
just
knows
that
when
she
is
in
or
near
mondawmin
she
encounters
hostile
people
in
uniform
n
shawna
reports
several
negative
encounters
there
but
nothing
that
would
earn
the
attention
of
journalists
researchers
or
most
advocates
she
has
experienced
at
most
possibly
idle
threats
that
the
next
time
a
police
officer
sees
her
he
will
mace
or
even
arrest
her
these
threats
these
forceful
words
would
not
register
as
uses
of
force
in
the
most
sophisticated
studies
of
police
encounters
n
yet
they
have
constrained
her
movement
the
grind
of
injustice
has
led
shawna
to
avoid
mondawmin
as
much
as
possible
though
the
mall
s
ubiquity
makes
it
hard
to
fully
escape
i
stopped
going
to
mondawmin
because
the
police
up
there
are
rude
i
mean
i
know
you
re
trying
to
keep
order
and
peace
but
you
don
t
have
to
disrespect
me
and
threaten
me
every
five
seconds
they
threatened
to
mace
people
if
they
don
t
get
to
their
bus
stop
then
the
man
told
me
he
was
going
to
arrest
me
because
i
was
talking
to
my
home
girl
and
i
wouldn
t
get
on
the
bus
it
wasn
t
my
bus
i
was
at
the
bus
stop
talking
to
her
why
are
you
threatening
to
arrest
me
shawna
claims
that
the
officer
followed
her
and
her
friend
after
they
began
to
walk
away
he
kept
getting
smart
with
his
little
cowboy
boots
i
was
just
like
who
are
these
police
like
where
did
they
come
from
shawna
had
a
few
stories
from
mondawmin
including
watching
a
young
man
get
arrested
who
wasn
t
probably
all
innocent
but
in
her
view
wasn
t
doing
anything
he
wasn
t
supposed
to
be
doing
the
gilmor
homes
where
shawna
spent
the
first
sixteen
of
her
nineteen
years
has
recently
been
in
the
national
media
as
the
home
of
freddie
gray
the
twenty
five
year
old
baltimore
man
who
died
in
police
custody
on
april
n
mondawmin
was
a
starting
site
of
the
ensuing
riots
n
shawna
was
nearby
when
the
riots
broke
out
trying
to
head
to
a
friend
s
house
for
spaghetti
shawna
s
views
on
the
riots
vacillate
from
empathy
for
the
good
police
officers
who
have
been
unfairly
demonized
to
frustration
at
the
destruction
of
already
limited
west
baltimore
institutions
to
condemnation
of
unjust
police
practices
to
pragmatic
belief
in
the
necessity
of
the
police
i
felt
bad
for
the
police
though
when
they
were
rioting
they
were
throwing
bricks
at
the
police
cars
and
all
this
other
stuff
first
of
all
you
re
going
to
need
them
second
of
all
every
police
officer
is
not
bad
belying
usual
portrayals
of
people
like
shawna
in
the
media
and
in
most
research
shawna
readily
acknowledges
the
humanity
of
officers
and
the
heterogeneity
of
police
forces
h
e
s
got
kids
too
he
s
got
to
live
too
he
s
got
to
eat
too
and
if
he
wanted
to
be
a
police
officer
that
doesn
t
mean
every
police
officer
is
bad
still
some
of
them
have
to
go
despite
the
negative
representation
of
baltimore
youth
in
the
national
media
during
the
riots
and
what
she
sees
as
the
inherent
wrong
of
riotous
behavior
shawna
has
ambivalently
started
to
believe
that
the
riots
were
a
necessary
catalyst
for
the
police
officers
to
face
criminal
charges
n
it
might
not
be
right
to
riot
but
if
they
wouldn
t
have
done
that
they
would
never
have
pressed
charges
on
the
police
officers
it
might
have
been
terrible
for
our
community
and
made
us
look
a
mess
especially
to
the
nation
to
everybody
who
saw
it
shawna
is
upset
that
some
leaders
used
the
controversial
term
thugs
when
referring
to
baltimore
rioters
despite
not
participating
in
the
riot
herself
shawna
felt
that
the
label
was
directed
at
young
african
american
west
baltimoreans
in
general
it
really
hurt
my
feelings
that
they
called
us
thugs
i
saw
a
video
on
that
too
they
included
president
obama
who
described
the
rioters
as
criminals
and
thugs
who
tore
up
the
place
n
maryland
governor
larry
hogan
who
depicted
them
as
gangs
of
thugs
whose
only
intent
was
to
bring
violence
and
destruction
to
the
city
n
baltimore
city
council
president
bernard
c
jack
young
who
distinguished
between
legitimate
sandtown
winchester
residents
and
thugs
seizing
upon
an
opportunity
n
and
baltimore
mayor
stephanie
rawlings
blake
who
lamented
that
young
rioters
were
disrespecting
the
legacy
of
people
who
had
fought
for
the
city
in
the
past
too
many
people
have
spent
generations
building
up
this
city
for
it
to
be
destroyed
by
thugs
who
in
a
very
senseless
way
are
trying
to
tear
down
what
so
many
have
fought
for
rawlings
blake
said
n
after
extensive
criticism
rawlings
blake
and
young
backed
away
from
using
the
term
thug
n
the
white
house
stood
behind
the
president
s
choice
of
words
n
talking
with
us
only
a
few
weeks
after
the
murder
of
nine
people
in
charleston
south
carolina
s
emanuel
african
methodist
episcopal
church
n
shawna
compared
charleston
officers
humane
treatment
of
shooter
dylann
roof
with
baltimore
officers
aggression
toward
freddie
gray
she
shook
her
head
with
disgust
they
bought
him
burger
king
they
bought
him
burger
king
but
they
couldn
t
even
get
freddie
gray
to
a
hospital
n
i
asked
shawna
how
she
knew
about
all
of
these
things
the
details
of
freddie
gray
s
arrest
the
series
of
thug
speeches
and
the
burger
king
trip
for
dylann
roof
it
was
on
facebook
a
lot
of
things
are
on
facebook
shawna
pointed
out
later
i
asked
her
do
you
want
to
be
a
police
officer
anymore
whoa
shawna
chuckled
i
gave
that
dream
up
now
entering
her
final
year
of
high
school
shawna
desultorily
explained
that
her
goals
for
the
next
several
years
are
to
just
better
myself
in
the
years
to
come
that
s
what
i
want
to
do
i
just
want
to
be
better
the
legitimacy
perspective
would
offer
an
incomplete
diagnosis
of
the
unsettled
relationship
between
the
police
and
someone
like
shawna
a
thoughtful
young
woman
who
has
never
had
any
serious
police
encounter
who
has
managed
to
avoid
getting
a
criminal
record
and
who
is
a
general
law
abider
wanting
to
trust
the
police
but
convinced
that
the
police
are
not
trustworthy
for
people
like
her
shawna
is
generally
compliant
with
the
law
and
believes
police
officers
should
be
respected
she
thinks
that
it
is
good
to
help
police
officers
and
she
appreciates
that
her
mother
would
stealthily
report
crime
from
a
law
enforcement
perspective
people
like
shawna
are
allies
and
assets
to
the
community
shawna
behaves
like
someone
who
views
the
police
as
a
legitimate
legal
authority
yet
shawna
s
views
also
reflect
a
deep
sense
of
alienation
about
police
she
stopped
going
to
the
mall
to
avoid
interacting
with
the
officers
there
she
abandoned
her
childhood
dream
of
becoming
a
police
officer
even
though
she
possesses
the
presence
personality
and
background
to
be
an
excellent
law
enforcement
official
she
fears
that
police
might
kill
or
sexually
assault
someone
like
her
a
young
low
income
black
woman
who
lives
in
west
baltimore
although
shawna
sees
the
law
and
its
enforcers
as
worthy
of
obedience
as
a
theoretical
matter
she
does
not
believe
that
law
enforcement
officials
see
her
and
people
like
her
as
a
true
part
of
the
polity
she
is
nothing
more
than
a
thug
this
understanding
of
her
group
s
place
in
the
world
does
not
lead
to
lawbreaking
or
noncooperation
as
a
legitimacy
perspective
might
predict
n
yet
her
words
nonetheless
reveal
a
cleavage
or
estrangement
from
the
enforcers
of
the
law
her
story
reveals
that
the
empirical
outcome
that
legitimacy
theory
is
best
used
to
explain
is
the
wrong
outcome
shawna
s
problem
is
not
noncompliance
but
symbolic
community
exclusion
iv
a
tripartite
theory
of
legal
estrangement
to
this
point
this
essay
has
argued
that
scholars
and
policymakers
should
understand
persistent
police
distrust
among
african
americans
and
residents
of
high
poverty
communities
as
a
problem
of
legal
estrangement
a
cultural
orientation
about
the
law
that
emanates
from
collective
symbolic
and
structural
exclusion
that
is
both
subjective
and
objective
factors
in
this
part
i
further
define
legal
estrangement
theory
i
argue
that
legal
estrangement
is
a
product
of
three
socio
legal
processes
procedural
injustice
vicarious
marginalization
and
structural
exclusion
all
of
these
processes
are
supported
in
the
empirical
literature
although
their
primary
justifications
emerge
from
theory
below
i
explain
each
process
in
greater
detail
drawing
upon
the
literature
and
offering
real
world
illustrations
from
qualitative
data
a
procedural
injustice
building
from
the
legitimacy
and
procedural
justice
scholarship
described
in
part
ii
i
argue
that
experiences
in
which
individuals
feel
treated
unfairly
by
the
police
are
one
key
provocateur
of
legal
estrangement
the
procedural
injustice
component
operates
at
the
individual
and
attitudinal
level
but
writ
large
expands
to
the
cultural
level
n
survey
research
indicates
that
a
feeling
that
the
police
have
behaved
disrespectfully
feeds
into
an
overall
disbelief
in
the
legitimacy
of
the
law
and
law
enforcement
n
the
path
to
legitimacy
from
a
procedural
justice
perspective
requires
treatment
with
dignity
and
respect
acknowledgment
of
one
s
rights
and
concerns
and
a
general
awareness
of
the
importance
of
recognizing
people
s
personal
status
and
identity
and
treating
those
with
respect
even
while
raising
questions
about
particular
conduct
n
consider
the
example
of
justin
n
an
eighteen
year
old
african
american
man
living
in
northeast
baltimore
who
is
heading
to
a
small
religious
college
out
of
state
on
an
athletic
scholarship
he
had
wanted
to
aim
for
an
ivy
league
school
because
his
high
school
grades
were
strong
but
according
to
him
his
sat
score
was
nearly
points
shy
of
the
baseline
justin
s
police
encounters
typify
and
bleed
into
a
general
feeling
that
he
is
socially
and
politically
powerless
the
criminal
justice
system
just
get
s
so
irritating
just
to
know
you
can
t
do
nothing
about
it
he
groused
you
have
a
voice
but
then
it
s
your
voice
and
billions
of
other
voices
if
everybody
s
not
together
and
its
one
side
against
the
other
your
voice
basically
doesn
t
matter
it
just
gets
so
frustrating
how
disrespectful
somebody
with
high
power
can
be
it
just
gets
annoying
to
illustrate
his
point
about
disrespect
from
people
in
power
justin
told
us
about
his
most
recent
police
encounter
n
he
and
his
friends
were
in
hunt
valley
a
small
suburb
just
north
of
baltimore
city
limits
known
for
its
expansive
recently
reinvigorated
outdoor
shopping
mall
at
around
pm
as
they
walked
toward
the
light
rail
station
that
would
carry
them
home
to
west
baltimore
they
were
stopped
by
a
police
officer
they
were
walking
in
the
street
along
one
side
they
felt
more
comfortable
walking
in
the
road
than
on
the
sidewalk
because
there
were
woods
on
either
side
of
the
street
it
s
night
time
i
don
t
want
to
be
over
there
for
one
you
got
to
think
there
s
mosquitoes
ticks
and
stuff
like
that
people
could
be
hiding
over
there
n
according
to
justin
the
officer
pulled
them
over
questioned
them
about
what
they
were
doing
and
ran
all
of
their
information
the
officer
ultimately
only
gave
them
warnings
for
walking
in
the
street
justin
repeated
the
charge
still
with
a
hint
of
disbelief
for
walking
in
the
street
for
walking
in
the
street
n
what
irked
justin
more
than
the
warning
though
was
the
police
officer
s
apparent
disregard
for
their
travel
timetable
while
they
were
stopped
justin
and
his
friends
told
the
officer
that
they
were
on
their
way
to
the
light
rail
station
and
that
they
needed
to
get
there
quickly
because
the
rail
stops
running
at
midnight
they
were
not
sure
when
the
last
train
to
baltimore
would
depart
so
they
were
trying
to
get
there
as
soon
as
possible
the
officer
assured
them
that
they
would
make
their
train
yet
by
the
time
he
checked
their
information
and
issued
their
warning
tickets
it
was
approximately
am
justin
s
bitterness
about
missing
the
train
had
not
yet
faded
when
i
say
they
didn
t
let
us
go
until
about
they
didn
t
let
us
go
until
and
only
gave
us
warnings
for
walking
in
the
street
justin
now
expects
that
the
police
will
not
value
his
time
he
has
resigned
himself
to
this
signal
of
his
own
inconsequentiality
whatever
it
is
whatever
you
need
go
ahead
because
now
i
know
we
on
your
time
now
once
you
stop
me
even
if
i
did
nothing
wrong
we
on
your
time
so
i
might
as
well
just
get
it
over
with
let
you
do
what
you
re
going
to
do
i
know
you
re
going
to
be
disrespectful
i
m
prepared
for
that
i
know
you
re
going
to
be
disrespectful
it
s
up
to
me
how
i
m
going
to
react
to
that
when
asked
if
he
had
other
experiences
like
that
one
justin
could
not
answer
precisely
he
knows
that
he
has
been
stopped
many
times
but
he
tries
not
to
dwell
on
those
encounters
preferring
to
focus
on
school
work
sports
and
females
he
also
tries
to
minimize
the
importance
of
race
in
this
unnamed
number
of
police
encounters
i
just
hate
the
way
how
they
can
be
so
disrespectful
to
us
like
we
re
not
human
or
nothing
it
s
like
this
stereotype
where
you
think
a
young
african
american
or
not
even
a
young
african
american
just
a
young
individual
period
just
walking
you
think
they
re
up
to
something
he
tries
instead
to
look
at
his
police
encounters
from
a
power
and
authority
perspective
in
part
just
to
avoid
the
stress
of
seeing
the
world
as
racist
n
people
who
have
never
had
power
before
they
finally
get
power
and
they
want
to
abuse
it
i
try
my
best
not
to
look
at
it
as
a
racial
thing
because
i
know
that
s
only
going
to
make
me
mad
and
stress
me
out
so
i
try
to
look
at
it
from
all
angles
justin
is
an
ambitious
young
man
one
of
the
few
in
the
sample
who
had
the
good
fortune
of
having
solid
college
plans
he
has
carefully
curated
his
group
of
friends
to
include
only
those
who
keep
each
other
focused
mostly
fellow
college
bound
athletes
if
justin
had
been
answering
a
survey
about
legal
compliance
there
is
a
reasonable
chance
that
he
would
have
marked
that
he
adheres
to
most
laws
and
believes
that
it
is
important
to
do
so
yet
he
deeply
distrusts
the
police
partly
because
he
believes
that
they
treat
him
and
other
young
baltimoreans
with
disrespect
in
order
to
assert
their
authority
n
in
addition
he
has
serious
doubts
about
whether
the
police
would
be
helpful
if
he
needed
them
saying
that
no
matter
what
the
issue
was
he
would
not
call
the
police
i
call
the
police
i
m
not
doing
nothing
for
nobody
if
i
call
the
police
there
s
a
possibility
they
might
turn
on
me
those
feelings
of
being
both
under
surveillance
and
unprotected
have
created
a
devil
s
brew
of
legal
estrangement
such
that
even
a
youth
like
justin
who
has
thus
far
been
able
to
avoid
the
criminalization
process
common
for
young
men
of
color
n
would
rather
pursue
extralegal
help
with
neighborhood
concerns
than
trust
in
the
police
as
for
the
midnight
police
encounter
on
the
facts
as
justin
presented
them
there
is
little
doubt
that
the
stop
was
lawful
the
officer
saw
justin
and
his
friends
walking
in
the
middle
of
the
street
in
violation
of
maryland
state
law
n
he
stopped
them
asked
them
what
they
were
doing
ran
their
identification
apparently
finding
no
open
warrants
and
sent
them
on
their
way
with
only
a
warning
justin
had
two
problems
with
the
stop
he
feels
that
the
very
reason
they
were
stopped
was
generalized
suspicion
of
young
people
and
possibly
young
black
people
and
that
the
officer
did
not
care
that
this
stop
caused
them
to
miss
their
ride
home
this
stop
was
less
awful
than
it
could
have
been
but
it
factors
heavily
into
justin
s
concerns
about
the
police
and
the
larger
social
structure
justin
s
story
illustrates
how
procedural
injustice
even
at
a
relatively
minor
level
creates
and
reinforces
legal
estrangement
the
legitimacy
literature
though
concerned
with
procedural
injustice
does
not
offer
an
account
that
illuminates
justin
s
concerns
about
the
police
he
willingly
complied
with
the
officer
s
commands
not
out
of
fear
but
from
a
sense
that
generally
speaking
he
ought
to
obey
the
instructions
of
law
enforcement
officers
however
the
experience
nonetheless
contributed
to
his
sense
that
there
is
a
schism
between
young
baltimoreans
and
the
police
yet
procedural
injustice
is
only
one
leg
of
legal
estrangement
s
three
legged
stool
the
benefits
of
a
legal
estrangement
perspective
emerge
more
clearly
when
considering
the
additional
processes
of
vicarious
marginalization
and
structural
exclusion
b
vicarious
marginalization
the
second
contributor
to
legal
estrangement
discussed
here
is
vicarious
marginalization
the
marginalizing
effect
of
police
maltreatment
that
is
targeted
toward
others
although
the
literature
on
legal
socialization
legitimacy
and
legal
cynicism
vaguely
acknowledges
the
influence
of
police
experiences
within
people
s
social
networks
and
the
impact
of
highly
publicized
misconduct
on
cultural
orientations
about
the
law
the
scholarly
treatment
of
vicarious
experience
is
thin
relative
to
the
treatment
of
personal
experience
n
this
deficit
is
in
part
a
disciplinary
artifact
most
legal
socialization
and
legal
legitimacy
research
draws
from
social
psychology
which
by
definition
focuses
primarily
on
understanding
individuals
internal
lives
and
how
they
relate
to
their
personal
interactions
and
behaviors
n
the
legitimacy
literature
has
been
interested
in
generalized
views
and
societal
orientations
but
it
focuses
mostly
on
whether
one
can
generalize
from
personal
experiences
instead
of
whether
and
how
impersonal
vicarious
experiences
also
contribute
to
social
orientations
n
sociological
and
socio
legal
theory
in
contrast
provides
a
theoretical
grounding
for
the
idea
that
other
people
s
negative
experiences
with
the
police
whether
those
people
are
part
of
one
s
personal
network
or
not
feed
into
a
more
general
cultural
sense
of
alienation
from
the
police
n
legal
estrangement
is
born
of
the
cumulative
collective
experience
of
procedural
and
substantive
injustice
in
the
study
of
incarceration
scholars
have
developed
a
clearer
view
of
the
cultural
contagiousness
of
criminal
justice
contact
for
example
naomi
sugie
finds
that
the
female
romantic
partners
of
formerly
incarcerated
men
are
less
likely
to
vote
to
register
to
vote
and
to
believe
that
voting
is
important
than
similarly
situated
women
who
are
not
partnered
with
a
formerly
incarcerated
man
n
while
voting
and
registering
are
behaviors
the
belief
that
voting
is
important
is
an
attitude
that
might
in
the
aggregate
reach
the
level
of
a
cultural
orientation
along
similar
lines
megan
comfort
argues
that
the
romantic
partners
of
men
serving
time
in
prison
undergo
a
process
of
secondary
prisonization
adopting
routinized
behaviors
styles
of
self
presentation
ways
of
speaking
and
even
sexual
desires
that
are
shaped
by
their
vicarious
incarceration
n
researchers
are
exploring
the
effects
of
incarceration
on
the
worldviews
of
the
children
of
incarcerated
parents
n
moreover
the
vicarious
effects
of
incarceration
are
not
limited
to
the
intimate
partners
and
children
of
the
incarcerated
for
example
in
their
study
of
the
relationship
between
race
mass
incarceration
and
distrust
in
the
law
christopher
muller
and
daniel
schrage
find
that
african
americans
who
had
a
formerly
incarcerated
close
friend
or
family
member
were
more
likely
than
other
african
americans
to
blame
bias
among
the
police
and
courts
for
the
criminal
justice
system
s
racial
disparities
n
yet
at
the
front
end
of
the
criminal
justice
continuum
scholars
rarely
probe
these
cultural
emergences
n
more
work
needs
to
be
done
to
examine
the
collective
memory
of
police
interaction
defined
as
the
cultural
conception
of
what
it
is
like
to
interact
with
the
police
that
emanates
in
part
from
membership
in
a
group
or
identity
category
here
in
various
degrees
being
african
american
or
residing
in
a
racially
and
socioeconomically
isolated
neighborhood
collective
memories
are
based
on
some
combination
of
personal
experience
observing
and
hearing
about
the
experiences
of
others
passing
accumulated
wisdom
from
parent
to
child
observing
interactions
in
public
space
seeing
or
not
seeing
murals
and
other
forms
of
public
commemoration
watching
television
scrolling
through
social
media
and
sharing
all
of
these
personal
and
vicarious
experiences
in
the
community
n
in
other
areas
of
legal
inquiry
such
as
constitutional
interpretation
state
sponsored
mass
violence
interracial
marriage
and
general
racial
inequality
scholars
have
probed
the
role
that
collective
memory
plays
in
the
law
and
legal
institutions
n
through
a
combination
of
major
social
upheavals
and
everyday
forms
of
information
gathering
people
come
to
understand
themselves
and
gain
perspective
on
what
it
means
to
be
a
part
of
a
group
be
it
a
religion
a
race
or
even
a
business
n
most
studies
of
collective
memory
focus
on
clear
often
tragic
historical
events
that
had
a
cognizable
beginning
and
end
such
as
american
slavery
or
the
holocaust
n
however
some
research
and
theory
argue
that
there
can
be
broader
sorts
of
collective
memory
such
as
a
collective
memory
of
racism
and
discrimination
that
ground
people
s
interpretations
of
day
to
day
interracial
experiences
n
in
this
sense
police
maltreatment
and
discrimination
can
also
become
sites
for
collective
memory
and
collective
identity
construction
vicarious
marginalization
in
the
context
of
policing
then
is
ultimately
about
how
people
draw
upon
information
other
than
their
own
experiences
as
police
targets
or
suspects
to
understand
their
group
s
common
experience
with
law
enforcement
there
is
no
better
illustration
of
how
vicarious
marginalization
might
operate
and
what
its
repercussions
might
be
than
current
events
involving
police
officer
maltreatment
of
african
americans
as
explained
above
distrustful
relationships
between
police
officers
and
african
american
communities
are
longstanding
and
deep
seated
however
the
recent
stream
of
videos
of
violent
police
interactions
has
along
with
organizing
techniques
given
birth
to
the
black
lives
matter
movement
this
movement
has
elevated
police
violence
to
the
national
collective
consciousness
sparking
community
organizing
and
policy
advocacy
n
some
have
claimed
that
the
seemingly
ceaseless
stream
of
grisly
scenes
on
television
and
social
media
are
giving
birth
to
a
new
form
of
race
based
posttraumatic
stress
n
but
short
of
or
in
addition
to
race
based
trauma
the
ritualistic
observation
of
black
men
and
women
having
unjust
and
often
deadly
interactions
with
law
enforcement
conveys
a
message
to
their
coethnics
and
other
similarly
situated
observers
n
that
message
might
be
that
the
police
as
a
whole
are
dangerous
untrustworthy
and
opposed
to
the
idea
that
african
americans
and
the
poor
are
truly
members
of
the
polity
group
conversations
both
in
person
and
through
social
media
can
crystallize
that
message
n
legal
estrangement
emerging
out
of
personal
and
vicarious
experiences
serves
as
a
lens
through
which
many
african
americans
interpret
past
and
future
engagements
with
law
enforcement
officials
videos
of
negative
police
interactions
may
elevate
personal
experiences
to
a
cultural
level
by
demonstrating
to
people
who
have
had
negative
police
interactions
that
their
experiences
are
not
unique
media
coverage
that
emphasizes
particular
aspects
of
police
interactions
such
as
race
gender
or
perceived
criminality
provide
a
schema
for
interpreting
one
s
own
experiences
in
ways
that
positive
experiences
may
not
fully
overcome
by
contributing
to
conceptions
of
how
police
treat
particular
groups
n
media
coverage
may
heighten
legal
estrangement
by
providing
evidence
that
we
are
living
in
a
moment
of
cultural
and
legal
instability
regarding
race
and
the
police
and
it
may
increase
culture
s
power
to
drive
perhaps
undesirable
behavior
such
as
avoiding
the
police
refusing
to
call
on
them
for
help
or
engaging
in
law
breaking
activity
n
yet
the
mechanisms
that
give
birth
to
vicarious
marginalization
are
not
limited
to
television
and
social
media
some
youth
in
the
baltimore
sample
reported
observing
the
police
mistreating
others
whether
strangers
parents
and
friends
and
they
factored
those
observations
into
their
assessments
of
police
untrustworthiness
others
talked
about
the
experiences
of
parents
siblings
and
friends
that
they
did
not
personally
witness
but
that
were
nonetheless
salient
in
developing
their
orientations

then
people
really
cared
about
their
job
then
now
people
just
look
at
it
for
the
money
that
they
are
going
to
make
n
when
jamila
graduated
from
high
school
in
she
became
the
first
person
in
generations
of
her
family
to
do
so
this
triumph
has
inspired
her
younger
brothers
that
s
very
big
for
them
very
very
big
and
they
look
up
to
me
now
jamila
explained
to
us
one
of
them
like
a
younger
shawna
aspires
to
enroll
in
the
police
academy
and
join
the
ranks
of
police
officers
jamila
appreciates
this
goal
as
she
thinks
police
have
an
important
social
role
to
play
police
men
and
women
at
the
end
of
the
day
we
kind
of
need
them
to
keep
the
city
safe
but
it
s
how
you
do
it
is
what
really
matters
because
you
can
t
just
walk
into
a
neighborhood
and
get
scared
jamila
herself
has
recently
completed
the
first
stage
of
an
intensive
and
competitive
college
readiness
program
and
is
preparing
to
start
community
college
intending
to
transfer
into
a
local
bachelor
s
degree
granting
college
in
two
years
her
long
term
goals
include
studying
philosophy
and
becoming
a
lawyer
she
believes
that
practicing
law
would
be
the
best
way
to
help
people
i
love
law
too
because
i
like
giving
people
second
chances
everyone
s
not
a
bad
person
despite
her
positive
early
experience
with
police
her
model
citizenship
her
brother
s
goal
of
becoming
a
police
officer
her
own
goal
of
joining
the
bar
and
her
embrace
of
the
broad
role
that
police
can
serve
jamila
is
profoundly
skeptical
that
the
police
and
government
officials
more
generally
value
people
from
her
community
we
need
real
real
people
that
care
about
people
any
kind
of
state
official
anything
that
has
to
do
with
dealing
with
people
we
need
better
people
jamila
s
assessment
of
police
seems
to
stem
from
a
mixture
of
community
wisdom
and
the
experiences
of
her
friends
and
neighbors
a
few
months
ago
jamila
and
her
friend
rock
were
waiting
outside
of
a
middle
school
to
walk
rock
s
brother
a
student
at
the
school
home
jamila
and
rock
were
about
fifteen
minutes
early
they
were
hanging
out
outside
to
pass
the
time
and
a
police
officer
came
by
and
asked
them
to
leave
jamila
immediately
started
to
walk
away
as
she
did
not
have
any
reason
to
be
there
rock
however
started
running
away
according
to
jamila
running
away
from
police
is
a
standard
practice
for
young
men
even
when
they
are
clean
i
e
not
carrying
anything
illegal
n
when
the
officer
caught
up
with
rock
he
pushed
rock
to
the
ground
pulled
out
his
baton
and
started
beating
him
with
it
the
officer
may
have
searched
rock
but
if
so
jamila
did
not
mention
it
the
officer
did
not
lock
rock
up
then
but
he
seems
to
have
cited
him
for
loitering
or
some
other
minor
offense
as
rock
lay
on
the
ground
jamila
called
his
mother
the
officer
just
beat
him
walked
off
and
left
him
there
in
the
parking
lot
jamila
bitterly
recounted
jamila
fears
that
if
she
had
not
been
there
rock
might
have
died
then
what
would
it
still
have
mattered
then
or
does
it
not
matter
at
all
and
i
feel
like
they
re
given
too
much
power
because
they
feel
like
okay
they
re
officers
i
have
a
gun
i
have
a
badge
you
have
to
listen
to
me
you
have
to
do
this
you
have
to
do
that
when
really
you
re
the
same
as
you
re
the
same
person
as
me
whether
you
know
right
away
you
re
the
same
person
we
breathe
just
like
i
breathe
you
breathe
you
bleed
just
like
i
bleed
we
re
the
same
people
jamila
s
anger
is
not
born
primarily
of
her
own
experiences
most
of
her
personal
experiences
have
been
positive
or
neutral
instead
she
tells
stories
of
the
mistreatment
of
her
friends
and
of
african
americans
more
generally
n
we
don
t
have
a
good
relationship
black
people
with
police
because
of
what
they
re
known
to
be
doing
she
does
not
specify
who
knows
what
police
are
doing
there
is
no
active
person
or
group
passing
these
stories
along
they
are
just
known
jamila
also
distrusts
the
media
including
both
network
news
and
social
media
she
believes
that
both
of
these
sources
are
advancing
a
destructive
racial
trope
about
the
nature
of
police
community
relations
in
baltimore
m
edia
is
the
cause
of
all
of
this
jamila
pontificated
at
rapid
speed
t
hey
kept
putting
emphasis
on
white
white
white
white
cop
white
guy
white
cop
white
cop
white
guy
they
were
putting
emphasis
on
it
jamila
thinks
that
the
narrative
about
freddie
gray
promoted
through
broadcast
and
social
media
is
responsible
for
the
april
unrest
if
the
media
didn
t
broadcast
it
as
big
as
they
did
she
argued
it
wouldn
t
have
happened
like
this
because
people
started
reacting
when
they
came
on
to
the
news
and
it
came
across
on
that
social
media
on
that
timeline
of
facebook
and
stuff
like
that
sticking
to
her
preference
for
class
based
rather
than
race
based
arguments
jamila
contends
that
the
broadcast
media
promotes
a
racial
narrative
to
make
money
i
used
to
think
that
they
just
want
people
to
be
aware
of
what
was
going
on
but
then
how
they
started
wording
things
another
white
cop
kills
blacks
another
unarmed
black
teen
i
feel
they
got
the
outcome
they
wanted
i
feel
like
they
wanted
people
to
react
and
get
mad
because
as
views
go
up
they
get
paid
more
money
jamila
rejects
this
narrative
arguing
that
instead
of
race
it
s
bigger
than
that
this
is
a
nation
al
problem
it
s
worldwide
although
jamila
s
specific
critique
of
the
media
s
racial
analysis
was
at
times
hard
to
follow
her
general
argument
was
that
the
government
is
interested
in
maintaining
brute
authority
in
any
way
that
it
can
thus
the
media
narrative
surrounding
baltimore
s
policing
troubles
distracts
people
with
a
partial
explanation
race
instead
of
forcing
them
to
confront
the
fuller
explanation
maintenance
of
social
and
economic
hegemony
at
all
levels
of
course
not
all
baltimore
youth
shared
jamila
s
particular
take
on
the
role
of
race
or
her
skepticism
of
all
media
myron
n
for
example
was
thrilled
at
the
broadcast
media
s
coverage
of
the
freddie
gray
incident
using
news
like
a
verb
he
related
i
m
glad
they
finally
newsed
our
shit
myron
is
pleased
that
these
incidents
which
have
been
going
on
for
years
in
his
estimation
were
deemed
newsworthy
the
broadcast
media
attention
spurred
a
shift
in
the
social
media
experience
as
well
finally
facebook
and
instagram
went
to
something
other
than
us
killing
each
other
or
fighting
each
other
they
finally
went
to
something
like
helping
us
broadcasting
what
they
re
doing
to
us
johnson
n
had
yet
another
take
disparaging
broadcast
media
coverage
in
similar
tones
to
jamila
but
viewing
the
use
of
video
and
social
media
as
a
way
to
offer
an
alternative
narrative
i
f
the
media
was
here
now
they
would
be
saying
some
crazy
things
about
a
situation
instead
of
the
truth
about
it
he
contended
that
s
another
reason
why
people
need
to
actually
be
active
into
social
media
a
little
bit
more
i
n
order
to
find
the
truth
you
need
to
have
your
phone
out
tweet
things
take
videos
about
things
while
opinions
of
these
media
sources
vary
young
people
commonly
consume
them
and
deploy
them
as
filters
to
understand
the
experience
of
being
policed
in
baltimore
a
few
days
before
our
interview
jamila
saw
an
officer
in
her
courtyard
surrounded
by
a
crowd
of
children
blasting
the
popular
song
watch
me
whip
nae
nae
n
and
dancing
some
of
the
children
took
out
their
phones
to
record
indeed
there
have
been
several
similar
officer
dance
videos
from
jurisdictions
across
the
country
over
the
past
two
years
often
using
the
whip
nae
nae
song
n
when
the
officer
left
the
children
told
him
goodbye
a
nicety
between
community
kids
and
the
police
that
jamila
had
never
seen
before
jamila
appreciated
the
gesture
when
i
seen
that
i
was
like
yeah
i
kind
of
like
gave
the
officer
a
nod
because
that
s
a
good
thing
you
usually
don
t
see
that
at
the
same
time
she
does
not
expect
the
encounter
to
make
much
of
a
change
in
the
way
she
sees
police
or
in
the
way
other
adults
from
her
community
perceive
police
once
a
man
s
mind
s
already
made
up
there
s
no
telling
him
different
pathways
of
vicarious
marginalization
such
as
stories
from
family
members
witnessing
friends
interactions
and
watching
videos
and
media
coverage
of
strangers
experiences
of
police
related
violence
and
injustice
are
poorly
considered
in
current
theory
and
policy
the
legitimacy
approach
tends
to
deemphasize
the
importance
of
interlocking
social
contexts
including
peer
influences
n
the
existence
of
these
pathways
is
not
surprising
though
when
one
considers
what
social
scientists
have
long
understood
about
the
stickiness
of
negative
events
in
the
human
memory
n
the
socialization
function
of
family
and
friend
networks
n
the
ways
culture
is
created
and
transmitted
n
and
the
social
construction
of
knowledge
n
personal
experience
with
the
police
is
only
one
stick
in
the
bundle
of
information
that
people
use
to
form
their
perspectives
on
law
enforcement
how
they
understand
the
policing
experiences
of
others
varies
based
in
part
on
their
relationship
with
the
person
who
had
the
interaction
and
especially
when
the
vicarious
experience
comes
through
a
viral
police
video
varies
based
on
how
well
the
experience
at
issue
matches
up
with
metanarratives
about
the
police
shared
narratives
about
how
the
police
treat
african
americans
and
people
who
live
in
poor
communities
propel
legal
estrangement
to
reduce
legal
estrangement
counternarratives
that
focus
on
respect
and
value
for
black
and
poor
lives
must
emerge
and
take
root
c
structural
exclusion
the
third
part
of
the
theory
of
legal
estrangement
is
structural
exclusion
this
component
describes
the
ways
in
which
policies
that
may
appear
facially
race
and
class
neutral
distribute
policing
resources
so
that
african
americans
and
residents
of
disadvantaged
neighborhoods
tend
to
receive
lower
quality
policing
than
whites
and
residents
of
other
neighborhoods
n
laws
and
policies
produce
and
normalize
vastly
different
experiences
by
race
and
class
n
the
apparent
neutrality
of
most
modern
laws
and
policies
means
that
even
those
who
are
disadvantaged
under
them
might
not
fully
perceive
them
as
discriminatory
n
these
policies
serve
as
a
form
of
legal
closure
a
means
of
hoarding
legal
resources
for
the
socially
and
socioeconomically
advantaged
while
locking
marginalized
groups
out
of
the
benefits
of
law
enforcement
this
idea
draws
from
the
theory
of
social
closure
n
the
process
of
legal
closure
leaves
some
areas
essentially
lawless
harshly
policed
yet
underprotected
n
while
others
may
be
rigorously
defended
over
and
above
the
degree
to
which
they
are
at
risk
the
concept
of
legal
closure
acknowledges
that
there
are
both
losers
and
winners
in
the
current
policing
regime
current
scholarship
and
policymaking
focuses
on
how
to
address
problems
with
the
losers
without
examining
the
current
system
s
beneficiaries
part
of
the
reason
that
the
harshest
and
least
effective
police
officers
can
be
found
in
high
poverty
communities
is
because
department
policies
on
pay
and
seniority
as
well
as
state
laws
on
officer
wages
and
additional
employment
send
the
most
experienced
and
highest
paid
police
officers
to
the
wealthiest
areas
residents
of
wealthier
urban
and
suburban
neighborhoods
benefit
from
the
current
policing
regime
this
insight
reframes
the
problem
that
police
reform
attempts
to
address
as
not
only
a
problem
of
racism
or
poverty
but
a
problem
of
inequality
in
access
to
the
machinery
of
the
law
n
the
structural
exclusion
prong
of
legal
estrangement
theory
also
emphasizes
that
police
violence
is
not
primarily
a
problem
of
wayward
officers
or
misunderstood
suspects
but
instead
a
problem
embedded
in
the
legal
system
itself
one
indicator
that
poor
african
americans
in
particular
have
been
excluded
from
police
resources
is
that
police
repeatedly
fail
to
respond
or
to
respond
in
a
timely
fashion
when
they
are
called
n
structural
exclusion
often
occurs
in
ways
that
community
members
do
not
recognize
but
police
nonresponse
is
an
inequality
that
community
members
often
notice
and
it
is
usually
evidence
of
local
state
and
federal
policy
decisions
in
response
to
police
abandonment
marginalized
people
seeking
protection
or
redress
of
grievances
have
generally
turned
to
self
help
either
by
calling
upon
family
members
or
friends
and
thus
increasing
violence
in
the
aggregate
n
or
by
creating
or
enlisting
the
help
of
informal
institutions
for
example
sudhir
alladi
venkatesh
s
historical
and
ethnographic
account
of
life
in
chicago
s
now
defunct
robert
taylor
homes
describes
a
series
of
alternative
community
law
enforcement
groups
indigenous
law
enforcement
that
residents
used
to
police
themselves
after
the
police
abandoned
the
development
as
early
as
the
s
n
in
the
early
s
however
as
the
drug
trade
grew
and
gangs
evolved
from
largely
familial
enterprises
to
more
impersonal
almost
corporate
entities
n
those
gangs
ultimately
took
over
the
pseudo
law
enforcement
role
from
the
community
law
enforcement
groups
n
at
no
point
did
police
step
in
to
reclaim
meaningful
authority
within
the
neighborhood
n
the
incentive
structure
for
police
officers
was
to
avoid
neighborhoods
like
the
robert
taylor
homes
particularly
in
the
era
before
federal
policy
incentivized
police
departments
to
prevent
crime
in
high
crime
neighborhoods
n
of
course
policing
has
changed
since
the
early
days
of
the
robert
taylor
homes
much
of
the
early
critique
of
police
officers
treatment
of
racially
and
socioeconomically
marginalized
neighborhoods
or
what
many
scholars
call
the
ghetto
stemmed
from
law
enforcement
s
neglect
of
those
communities
n
leading
to
some
mid
twentieth
century
racial
justice
advocates
to
urge
police
to
become
more
active
in
poor
urban
neighborhoods
n
yet
several
forces
converged
in
the
s
s
and
s
that
shifted
the
problem
from
one
of
utter
neglect
to
the
current
problem
of
overpolicing
and
underprotection
first
policing
underwent
a
move
toward
professionalization
which
brought
about
improvements
such
as
the
use
of
technology
reliance
on
evidence
rather
than
confessions
given
during
investigations
and
requirements
that
police
undergo
more
extensive
education
and
standardized
training
n
however
as
part
of
the
professionalization
package
and
because
of
shifts
in
technology
and
the
sprawl
of
cities
departments
shifted
their
tactics
from
having
officers
walk
a
beat
an
area
that
they
specifically
focused
on
to
using
cars
and
technology
to
respond
to
calls
for
service
n
second
partly
in
reaction
to
the
massive
increase
in
urban
crime
during
the
s
broken
windows
policing
also
known
as
order
maintenance
or
quality
of
life
policing
took
root
in
the
s
and
s
this
type
of
policing
moved
in
the
opposite
direction
of
the
call
for
service
model
by
urging
officers
to
heavily
and
proactively
enforce
laws
against
minor
criminal
activity
particularly
in
distressed
communities
the
shift
meant
that
people
in
racially
and
socioeconomically
isolated
communities
first
felt
abandoned
then
felt
heavily
monitored
but
primarily
monitored
only
for
minor
crimes
that
were
not
at
the
heart
of
their
public
safety
and
security
concerns
the
war
on
drugs
altered
policing
as
well
although
much
of
the
critique
of
the
war
on
drugs
has
focused
on
its
hotly
debated
role
in
the
rise
of
mass
incarceration
n
the
war
on
drugs
altered
the
front
end
of
the
criminal
justice
system
policing
just
as
significantly
beginning
in
the
s
and
increasingly
throughout
the
s
and
s
the
war
on
drugs
funded
special
narcotics
enforcement
police
units
and
gang
units
across
the
country
arming
regular
police
departments
with
military
grade
armor
and
weaponry
and
authorizing
virtually
free
reign
over
marginalized
neighborhoods
n
because
police
often
relied
on
bad
information
when
making
busts
and
conducting
raids
whole
communities
felt
under
police
suspicion
regardless
of
whether
particular
individuals
had
done
anything
to
earn
that
suspicion
n
the
twin
perils
of
harsh
policing
and
neglectful
policing
indicate
structural
exclusion
from
public
safety
an
exclusion
that
corresponds
with
intersecting
race
class
and
geographic
marginalization
some
scholarship
on
overpolicing
and
underprotection
portrays
the
phenomenon
as
a
gendered
and
generational
issue
meaning
that
young
people
especially
young
men
feel
overpoliced
while
older
decent
people
in
poor
african
american
communities
feel
underprotected
n
the
reality
is
far
more
complex
many
young
men
too
would
ideally
want
the
police
to
protect
them
and
their
communities
patrick
carr
laura
napolitano
and
jessica
keating
reached
this
finding
in
their
qualitative
criminology
study
of
an
ethnically
diverse
latinx
white
and
african
american
sample
of
young
men
and
women
ages
twelve
to
twenty
three
in
three
highcrime
socioeconomically
challenged
philadelphia
neighborhoods
although
most
of
the
youths
regardless
of
race
or
gender
had
a
negative
disposition
toward
the
police
most
of
them
including
young
african
american
men
also
suggested
greater
presence
of
police
and
harsher
enforcement
of
the
law
as
ways
to
address
crime
in
their
communities
n
one
way
to
understand
this
result
is
as
a
kind
of
bounded
creativity
because
these
youths
were
growing
up
in
high
crime
urban
neighborhoods
in
the
s
and
s
a
time
and
place
where
the
police
were
highly
visible
and
when
alternative
community
social
control
resources
were
relatively
limited
perhaps
they
could
not
imagine
a
world
where
the
government
could
use
noncriminal
justice
means
to
deter
crime
this
view
would
counsel
hesitancy
before
relying
on
youths
words
as
true
statements
of
their
ideals
n
yet
the
authors
settle
on
the
explanation
that
despite
the
youths
negative
experiences
with
the
police
they
cling
to
the
mainstream
cultural
ideal
that
police
should
protect
them
and
their
communities
along
with
protection
the
youths
desire
procedurally
just
policing
n
the
critical
point
about
structural
exclusion
is
that
despite
the
youths
cynicism
about
the
police
they
nonetheless
believe
that
the
police
are
failing
to
provide
protective
services
to
their
communities
this
conflicted
desire
for
police
protection
is
observable
in
lemuel
s
story
lemuel
is
a
twenty
four
year
old
african
american
young
man
who
grew
up
in
the
lexington
terrace
housing
project
in
west
baltimore
n
lemuel
unlike
shawna
justin
and
jamila
has
spent
a
large
portion
of
his
youth
engaged
in
criminal
activity
n
unlike
his
brothers
one
of
whom
is
incarcerated
and
one
of
whom
was
murdered
seven
years
ago
lemuel
managed
to
avoid
becoming
an
official
member
of
any
street
gang
or
clique
in
his
terms
he
was
a
thug
not
a
gangster
mostly
he
stole
food
sports
jerseys
cars
and
other
property
with
his
brother
and
dealt
small
amounts
of
marijuana
to
earn
a
baseline
income
when
i
was
robbing
people
there
was
a
reason
why
i
was
doing
it
my
stomach
was
literally
growling
nothing
to
do
either
i
die
starve
or
i
do
something
i
was
too
young
for
a
job
i
mean
i
cut
grass
during
the
summer
i
shoveled
snow
through
the
winter
but
what
do
you
do
in
between
lemuel
s
family
was
so
poor
that
his
parents
made
deliberate
choices
to
forego
necessities
for
their
male
children
lemuel
mimicked
his
stepfather
with
an
acerbic
chuckle
my
father
he
always
said
they
boys
they
don
t
need
no
shoes
they
don
t
need
no
underwear
they
don
t
need
socks
the
first
time
he
remembers
feeling
scared
and
realizing
that
his
family
was
very
poor
was
when
the
eviction
people
came
and
we
re
holding
the
door
so
they
won
t
come
in
petty
theft
was
lemuel
s
family
s
livelihood
what
we
going
to
do
whatever
you
can
do
so
we
made
sure
we
ate
not
surprisingly
lemuel
had
numerous
run
ins
with
the
police
in
his
younger
delinquent
years
he
likened
the
police
he
encountered
the
knockers
plainclothes
officers
assigned
to
flex
squads
focused
on
drugs
and
violent
crime
n
to
denzel
washington
s
character
in
the
movie
training
day
n
according
to
lemuel
these
officers
all
african
american
n
often
wore
ski
masks
he
don
t
want
you
to
know
who
he
is
because
he
s
about
to
do
something
that
he
ain
t
supposed
to
do
lemuel
says
that
the
knockers
would
give
him
an
ultimatum
during
every
run
in
they
could
either
take
him
to
jail
or
they
could
allow
him
to
go
home
when
a
boy
took
the
go
home
option
they
sit
you
in
the
back
seat
with
a
knocker
back
there
and
they
ll
beat
your
ribs
take
all
your
money
out
your
pocket
leave
you
in
the
hood
that
you
ain
t
supposed
to
be
in
one
of
lemuel
s
most
formative
experiences
with
a
police
officer
took
place
at
a
high
school
located
in
the
heart
of
gang
territory
one
day
when
he
was
about
fifteen
years
old
lemuel
showed
up
to
school
drunk
on
bacardi
gold
rum
at
the
time
i
was
doing
a
lot
of
drinking
i
was
going
through
stuff
he
explained
he
was
also
carrying
drugs
for
his
personal
use
and
a
knuckle
knife
a
set
of
brass
knuckles
with
a
knife
attached
for
protection
as
is
common
at
baltimore
s
public
high
schools
security
was
on
high
alert
n
in
addition
to
the
usual
metal
detectors
officers
were
on
hand
to
frisk
the
students
a
female
officer
patted
lemuel
down
and
found
the
drugs
in
his
pocket
according
to
lemuel
the
officer
grabbed
his
scrotum
and
squeezed
she
allegedly
told
him
you
better
not
say
nothing
as
he
remembers
it
she
told
him
that
if
he
screamed
she
would
remove
the
drugs
from
his
pocket
perhaps
simply
taking
them
or
turning
them
in
so
that
he
would
get
into
legal
trouble
though
tears
welled
in
lemuel
s
eyes
he
stayed
silent
and
the
officer
let
him
go
but
he
returned
home
swollen
and
in
pain
n
despite
those
horrific
recollections
procedural
injustice
seems
too
clinical
a
word
for
bodily
assault
there
have
been
times
when
lemuel
has
wanted
to
call
the
police
for
help
when
lemuel
was
younger
someone
from
his
neighborhood
robbed
him
and
took
his
sports
jersey
an
item
that
was
relatively
expensive
given
his
financial
background
and
thus
had
great
significance
to
him
he
wished
that
he
could
call
the
police
to
report
the
crime
and
get
the
jersey
back
but
instead
he
reluctantly
fought
the
older
boy
who
took
it
got
my
ass
whipped
got
my
jersey
back
though
there
have
been
other
times
when
he
has
wanted
to
call
the
police
as
well
times
when
an
old
fashioned
schoolyard
brawl
would
not
be
of
much
help
people
have
shot
near
him
and
things
was
a
little
bit
out
of
my
control
yet
he
still
did
not
call
the
police
because
it
s
never
good
lemuel
s
uncle
is
a
police
officer
but
instead
of
making
him
feel
closer
to
the
police
he
thinks
the
job
reflects
poorly
on
his
uncle
s
character
lemuel
told
us
chuckling
even
my
uncle
my
uncle
s
an
asshole
he
don
t
come
to
no
family
reunions
or
nothing
lemuel
does
not
think
the
problems
of
policing
that
he
has
experienced
and
that
gave
rise
to
the
freddie
gray
unrest
are
attributable
to
race
in
his
view
the
problems
of
police
community
relations
are
problems
of
neighborhood
income
inequality
black
white
hispanic
it
doesn
t
matter
your
race
it
matters
where
you
live
it
s
almost
your
income
because
lemuel
has
committed
crimes
in
higher
income
neighborhoods
he
has
seen
firsthand
that
police
respond
quickly
in
those
areas
he
and
a
friend
attempted
to
burglarize
a
home
in
a
wealthier
part
of
baltimore
county
and
they
assumed
that
because
the
house
was
in
a
semirural
area
it
would
take
the
police
a
long
time
to
arrive
they
were
wrong
someone
called
the
police
and
officers
arrived
very
quickly
when
you
re
in
another
neighborhood
you
get
treated
with
more
respect
i
realized
that
when
i
went
to
try
to
do
my
first
home
invasion
the
cop
response
was
so
quick
it
was
so
quick
i
never
seen
the
cops
respond
to
this
neighborhood
so
quickly
lemuel
believes
that
slow
police
response
is
inevitably
part
of
the
experience
of
living
in
the
projects
including
trailer
parks
one
distinction
between
the
police
in
west
baltimore
and
the
police
where
lemuel
attempted
the
burglary
is
jurisdictional
west
baltimore
located
within
baltimore
s
city
limits
is
under
the
jurisdiction
of
the
baltimore
city
police
department
by
contrast
outside
the
city
limits
in
baltimore
county
the
baltimore
county
police
department
handles
policing
assuming
lemuel
s
experience
is
representative
the
alleged
discrepancy
in
response
times
could
come
from
the
differences
in
policies
and
workloads
between
the
city
and
the
county
police
departments
the
differences
between
these
jurisdictions
might
relate
to
their
relative
emphases
on
responding
to
crime
reactively
versus
implementing
preventive
or
proactive
approaches
it
might
be
the
case
that
in
the
county
the
police
department
still
places
heavy
emphasis
on
responding
to
calls
for
service
while
in
the
city
particularly
in
high
crime
areas
there
is
greater
emphasis
on
patrolling
these
different
approaches
could
explain
city
residents
simultaneous
sense
that
there
is
a
heavy
presence
of
police
cars
n
and
delayed
response
to
calls
for
service
n
more
research
is
needed
to
compare
police
response
times
across
and
between
jurisdictions
and
to
locate
the
department
level
policies
and
practices
that
might
explain
any
undue
delay
lemuel
s
earlier
experiences
of
procedural
injustice
could
also
be
attributable
not
only
to
individual
bad
officers
but
to
policies
and
department
cultures
that
incentivize
bad
behavior
as
noted
above
lemuel
s
most
vivid
negative
experiences
were
with
the
knockers
the
plainclothes
police
officers
who
work
in
units
that
focus
solely
on
violent
crime
and
drug
crime
in
distressed
baltimore
neighborhoods
these
units
which
have
been
called
flex
squads
in
the
past
but
are
often
renamed
are
allowed
broad
discretion
including
whether
they
wear
uniforms
whether
they
drive
marked
cars
where
they
police
they
are
not
limited
to
a
post
and
the
hours
they
work
n
they
usually
carry
out
drug
raids
as
well
although
baltimore
s
flex
squads
came
under
fire
in
the
mid
s
due
to
deep
corruption
in
the
southwest
police
district
s
squad
including
the
rapes
that
shawna
fears
n
the
squads
now
exist
with
somewhat
greater
oversight
yet
some
people
including
former
police
officers
claim
that
street
enforcement
units
are
still
given
wide
discretion
that
they
often
grievously
misuse
n
arrest
incentives
and
the
more
general
culture
of
arrest
n
might
also
have
contributed
to
experiences
like
lemuel
s
although
he
reports
being
arrested
only
once
and
not
through
an
encounter
with
a
knocker
it
is
possible
that
police
were
more
present
in
his
neighborhood
because
they
were
looking
for
people
to
arrest
perhaps
because
lemuel
was
so
young
police
were
slower
to
arrest
him
while
we
do
not
have
evidence
of
what
those
specific
officers
believed
insider
accounts
suggest
that
department
policy
encouraged
greater
police
presence
in
predominantly
poor
and
african
american
neighborhoods
even
for
officers
who
were
not
assigned
to
those
areas
former
baltimore
police
officer
michael
wood
told
reporters
that
after
getting
a
plum
assignment
to
an
upper
middle
class
predominantly
white
neighborhood
he
would
sometimes
leave
his
post
to
go
to
a
poor
predominantly
black
neighborhood
to
make
arrests
he
needed
to
meet
his
expected
number
of
arrests
but
even
though
there
were
people
using
drugs
and
committing
other
crimes
in
the
neighborhood
where
he
was
assigned
he
knew
there
would
be
trouble
if
he
arrested
the
wrong
person
so
even
though
it
technically
violated
policy
for
wood
to
patrol
for
arrests
outside
of
his
post
his
supervisors
signed
of
on
his
work
they
knew
that
judges
and
court
officials
lived
in
that
neighborhood
if
i
locked
up
the
judge
s
year
old
son
for
drugs
or
whatever
things
could
get
really
bad
for
me
wood
told
reporters
n
several
scholars
have
described
the
perils
of
arrest
incentives
arguing
that
such
policies
have
contributed
to
mass
penal
control
through
misdemeanor
arrests
and
noncarceral
forms
of
state
supervision
n
lemuel
s
story
and
the
baltimore
context
suggest
that
incentives
to
arrest
might
also
simply
bring
more
people
into
contact
with
aggressive
policing
even
if
those
people
are
never
arrested
and
even
if
they
do
not
become
suspects
of
any
particular
crime
this
contact
might
have
negative
effects
on
their
perceptions
of
police
reminding
them
of
their
relative
worthlessness
in
the
eyes
of
the
state
consequently
arrest
incentivizing
policies
may
serve
to
deepen
legal
estrangement
on
a
broader
scale
of
course
structural
exclusion
through
policing
is
layered
atop
deeper
structural
disadvantages
that
arise
in
the
contexts
of
growing
up
poor
and
african
american
and
living
in
the
city
of
baltimore
good
policing
is
just
one
additional
resource
or
another
form
of
capital
n
from
which
the
law
writ
large
may
exclude
people
like
shawna
justin
jamila
and
lemuel
v
dismantling
estrangement
how
can
police
reform
dismantle
legal
estrangement
there
is
little
scholarship
that
tackles
this
question
in
even
a
cursory
way
research
suggests
that
procedural
justice
can
unsettle
the
psychological
process
that
leads
people
to
perceive
the
police
as
illegitimate
evidence
also
indicates
that
the
procedural
justice
solution
can
effectively
increase
perceptions
of
legitimacy
across
race
and
to
some
extent
class
n
yet
other
than
the
well
trodden
but
hazy
path
of
community
policing
n
there
has
been
little
discussion
of
reforms
that
can
disrupt
the
sociological
process
leading
whole
communities
to
see
the
police
as
a
symbol
of
their
status
on
the
social
periphery
measures
that
emanate
from
legitimacy
theory
and
the
procedural
justice
approach
such
as
police
training
are
ultimately
an
impoverished
response
to
estrangement
n
one
might
reasonably
view
legal
estrangement
not
as
a
problem
of
policing
but
as
a
problem
of
concentrated
poverty
and
racial
inequality
certainly
as
is
apparent
in
the
vignettes
offered
in
this
essay
concentrated
poverty
and
systemic
racial
injustice
are
major
structural
problems
that
produce
legal
estrangement
fully
dismantling
legal
estrangement
will
be
impossible
without
more
fundamental
shifts
in
economic
distribution
and
eradication
of
racial
discrimination
the
problems
of
policing
that
have
motivated
black
lives
matter
are
problems
of
america
s
broken
opportunity
structure
n
the
root
causes
of
estrangement
similar
to
the
root
causes
of
crime
and
mass
incarceration
may
seem
inappropriate
to
address
through
the
criminal
justice
system
n
admittedly
the
structural
factors
believed
to
contribute
most
fundamentally
to
cynicism
such
as
concentrated
poverty
segregation
and
residential
instability
n
are
not
generally
seen
as
the
province
of
police
practice
and
policy
yet
to
demand
that
curing
poverty
and
eliminating
race
discrimination
are
the
only
ways
to
meaningfully
effect
change
in
policing
is
to
accept
paralysis
the
root
causes
mentality
encourages
scholars
and
policymakers
to
ignore
ways
that
police
practices
and
policy
directly
and
actively
contribute
to
legal
estrangement
and
its
concomitant
racial
and
socioeconomic
conditions
for
instance
some
scholars
have
argued
that
police
practices
directly
contribute
to
persistent
residential
segregation
n
police
contact
can
negatively
influence
the
prison
reentry
process
making
it
difficult
for
returning
citizens
to
maintain
employment
and
familial
relationships
n
multiple
experiences
with
arrest
of
a
parent
can
result
in
court
dates
for
children
that
keep
them
out
of
school
and
siphon
them
into
the
criminal
justice
apparatus
this
process
interrupts
their
education
and
ultimately
places
them
at
risk
for
incarceration
and
its
related
perils
n
because
there
has
been
insufficient
attention
to
legal
estrangement
in
the
regulation
of
policing
opportunities
to
link
the
structural
factors
in
estrangement
with
concrete
reforms
to
policing
have
been
underexplored
the
proposals
here
are
not
offered
as
a
cure
all
to
legal
estrangement
but
are
instead
an
opening
salvo
to
encourage
police
reformers
to
dedicate
energy
toward
new
strategies
and
structures
of
police
governance
a
using
federal
tools
to
change
local
practices
scholars
often
overlook
many
of
the
structural
issues
that
confront
policing
outside
the
purview
of
federal
law
because
the
policing
crisis
is
embedded
in
state
and
local
laws
and
policies
even
though
federal
law
and
policy
has
brought
some
uniformity
to
local
policing
through
spending
initiatives
since
the
s
police
administrative
rules
and
practices
still
vary
intensely
among

in
addition
there
is
rich
debate
over
the
appropriate
institutional
actors
that
should
regulate
local
police
behavior
n
faced
with
disagreement
over
the
depth
of
the
solutions
needed
issues
of
federalism
and
potentially
limited
institutional
capacities
one
would
be
hard
pressed
to
find
a
legal
silver
bullet
capable
of
resolving
the
legal
and
social
problems
of
policing
one
tool
that
provides
the
federal
government
with
leverage
to
force
local
departments
to
change
or
eliminate
structurally
exclusive
policies
is
section
of
the
violent
crime
control
and
law
enforcement
act
of
also
known
as
the
clinton
crime
bill
n
section
authorizes
the
u
s
attorney
general
to
sue
a
local
police
department
for
engaging
in
a
pattern
or
practice
of
violating
constitutional
and
legal
rights
the
department
of
justice
doj
may
use
the
threat
of
litigation
to
reach
an
agreement
with
the
agency
to
pursue
specific
reforms
or
take
the
agency
to
court
and
mandate
actions
through
a
consent
decree
although
section
has
many
merits
for
example
the
law
is
credited
with
providing
a
path
to
successful
long
term
reform
for
police
departments
in
cincinnati
los
angeles
and
pittsburgh
n
many
scholars
have
offered
an
array
of
potential
improvements
to
the
law
n
one
of
the
biggest
shortcomings
of
section
is
that
its
use
is
politically
cyclical
n
during
the
second
term
of
president
george
w
bush
the
doj
did
not
enter
into
a
single
consent
decree
with
a
police
agency
opting
instead
to
enter
into
nonbinding
agreements
with
wayward
departments
n
in
contrast
the
obama
administration
has
investigated
dozens
of
departments
n
even
this
figure
is
relatively
small
considering
that
there
are
more
than
police
departments
across
the
united
states
many
scholars
believe
that
the
costly
and
invasive
nature
of
the
process
limits
its
capacity
to
reach
the
full
set
of
departments
that
may
require
oversight
n
one
suspects
that
a
trump
doj
will
investigate
very
few
if
any
police
departments
indeed
perhaps
the
major
drawback
of
relying
on
is
that
it
likely
allows
so
much
unlawful
and
procedurally
unjust
policing
to
go
undetected
baltimore
provides
an
excellent
example
of
this
issue
on
august
the
doj
released
a
page
report
lambasting
the
baltimore
police
department
for
its
persistent
violations
of
the
rights
of
baltimore
s
african
american
population

in
particular
the

s
mistreatment
of

just
sixteen
months
earlier
in

the
final
report
of
the

first
century

described
baltimore
s
efforts
to
build
community
legitimacy

testimony
from

police
commissioner
anthony
batts
touting
the

establishment
of
a
new
professional
standards

accountability
bureau
tasked
with
rooting
out
corruption
holding

i
es
and

n
the
doj
report
which
denounces
the
department
for
its
failure
to
properly
train
officers
does
not
even
mention
this
bureau
in
fact
the
report
only
briefly
mentions
the
baltimore
police
department
s
other
efforts
to
address
its
legacy
of
bias
n
it
took
the
death
of
freddie
gray
and
the
corresponding
public
uproar
to
push
the
doj
to
commence
this
investigation
and
issue
the
report
while
section
provides
a
helpful
backstop
it
allows
departments
to
maintain
a
veneer
of
community
orientation
until
a
crisis
strikes
major
pushes
for
structural
reform
should
not
rely
on
litigation
that
is
rarely
initiated
before
tragedy
occurs
while
recognizing
the
inherent
insufficiency
of
incremental
interventions
as
a
full
remedy
for
legal
estrangement
in
this
part
i
provisionally
discuss
fourth
amendment
jurisprudence
and
four
areas
of
police
governance
reform
that
could
contribute
to
dismantling
estrangement
these
reforms
have
garnered
much
less
attention
in
the
most
recent
police
reform
debates
than
police
training
community
policing
initiatives
or
even
structural
reform
litigation
whereas
most
scholarship
on
police
regulation
tends
to
focus
on
constitutional
criminal
procedure
n
these
reforms
are
aimed
at
statutory
and
municipal
law
at
the
federal
state
and
local
levels
unlike
the
legitimacy
approach
legal
estrangement
theory
directly
suggests
structural
reform
the
theory
demands
attention
to
group
societal
membership
and
the
deep
seated
laws
policies
and
structures
that
have
produced
the
policing
crisis
microlevel
procedural
justice
reforms
aimed
at
producing
individual
level
feelings
of
legitimacy
are
anemic
responses
to
legal
estrangement
b
paying
the
police
the
police
wage
system
is
a
structural
factor
that
functionally
excludes
many
poor
people
and
african
americans
from
policing
resources
thereby
contributing
to
legal
estrangement
the
wage
structure
under
which
police
officers
generally
operate
works
inversely
to
the
way
it
should
some
of
the
busiest
and
most
dangerous
jobs
in
law
enforcement
often
pay
the
least
particularly
in
cities
towns
and
counties
that
are
financially
strapped
finding
the
means
to
retain
police
officer
talent
is
a
serious
challenge
moreover
officers
are
frequently
aware
of
localized
pay
disparities
for
example
a
journalistic
report
on
st
louis
county
claimed
that
officers
in
some
parts
of
the
county
were
making
poverty
wages
as
low
as
per
hour
n
the
doj
ferguson
consent
decree
required
that
the
city
increase
officer
salaries
as
part
of
its
recruitment
plan
n
low
officer
wages
introduce
two
major
perversions
to
the
system
first
when
salaries
are
too
low
the
most
skilled
and
experienced
officers
will
rationally
leave
higher
crime
areas
to
work
in
easier
areas
where
they
are
paid
more
second
low
wages
mean
that
many
officers
feel
pressure
to
pursue
large
amounts
of
overtime
hours
and
off
duty
work
also
known
as
secondary
employment
or
moonlighting
n
police
officers
typically
receive
a
base
hourly
wage
but
many
earn
a
significant
amount
of
their
take
home
pay
through
overtime
in
baltimore
for
example
over
one
hundred
officers
in
fiscal
year
earned
more
than
in
overtime
pay
in
that
year
the
highest
paid
employee
of
the
baltimore
city
police
department
earned
in
overtime
pay
and
in
base
pay
for
a
total
of
more
than
the
city
s
mayor
and
more
than
the
police
commissioner
n
in
six
of
the
ten
highest
paid
people
in
baltimore
city
government
were
employees
of
the
police
department
n
only
one
of
those
employees
the
police
commissioner
had
a
top
ten
base
salary
the
others
received
substantial
amounts
of
money
in
what
appears
to
be
overtime
pay
n
the
stress
and
burden
of
extended
work
hours
can
make
even
the
most
promising
officers
terrible
at
their
job
n
the
president
s
task
force
report
devotes
one
of
its
six
pillars
to
officer
wellness
and
safety
with
emphasis
on
mental
health
n
it
stresses
the
riskiness
and
trauma
of
the
job
and
blames
officer
judgment
errors
on
fatigue
it
even
discusses
shift
length
as
a
potential
contributor
to
officer
fatigue
n
but
the
report
does
not
directly
draw
a
link
between
fatigue
exposure
to
risk
and
trauma
long
shifts
and
wage
related
pressures
and
overwork
all
factors
that
may
affect
economically
depressed
jurisdictions
more
than
other
jurisdictions
wage
disparity
is
a
structural
issue
that
occurs
far
upstream
from
the
events
that
have
catalyzed
the
police
reform
movement
bringing
greater
transparency
and
equity
to
officer
salaries
will
likely
decrease
procedural
injustice
and
vicarious
marginalization
on
the
ground
which
could
over
time
reduce
legal
estrangement
even
where
officers
are
paid
on
the
same
scale
within
the
same
departments
they
still
may
be
earning
less
to
police
tougher
neighborhoods
collective
bargaining
means
that
departments
are
often
bound
to
pay
salary
assign
shifts
assign
beats
and
give
promotions
or
transfers
on
the
basis
of
seniority
n
and
even
where
collective
bargaining
is
not
in
place
decision
making
based
on
seniority
is
often
embedded
into
police
culture
seniority
rules
mean
that
new
patrol
officers
tend
to
get
the
least
desired
assignments
graveyard
shifts
and
tough
neighborhoods
while
receiving
the
lowest
compensation
n
although
problems
of
police
wage
inequality
and
job
insecurity
are
tied
partly
to
local
governments
financial
insolvency
n
federal
intervention
could
help
bring
balance
between
urban
and
suburban
wages
since
the
establishment
of
the
federal
office
of
community
oriented
policing
services
in
federal
funding
has
flowed
to
local
departments
to
incentivize
various
reforms
n
federal
funding
then
could
partially
close
the
gap
between
the
wages
that
local
taxes
can
fund
and
the
wages
needed
to
attract
the
most
skilled
officers
to
the
highest
need
areas
state
legislation
could
help
as
well
in
indiana
for
example
legislators
have
proposed
requiring
the
state
s
office
of
management
and
budget
to
prepare
an
annual
report
comparing
the
salaries
of
state
police
with
salaries
in
the
three
largest
local
police
departments
and
to
make
recommendations
about
wage
parity
n
it
is
difficult
to
tell
whether
such
legislation
will
be
effective
but
this
bill
represents
one
way
that
states
could
help
reduce
local
wage
disparity
between
officers
another
practice
that
allocates
policing
resources
to
wealthier
neighborhoods
to
the
detriment
of
poorer
neighborhoods
is
police
departments
practice
of
taking
on
secondary
employment
n
under
secondary
employment
arrangements
private
entities
such
as
sports
teams
or
neighborhood
associations
can
pay
the
police
department
extra
money
to
provide
additional
police
services
the
doj
has
criticized
such
local
government
arrangements
for
contribut
ing
to
inequitable
policing
n
for
example
when
the
doj
first
investigated
the
new
orleans
police
department
in
some
of
its
most
significant
criticism
fell
upon
the
department
s
paid
detail
program
n
paid
detail
gave
officers
the
opportunity
to
earn
extra
money
by
working
overtime
for
private
pay
and
most
of
the
places
they
worked
were
the
areas
lowest
in
crime
the
breadth
and
prevalence
of
the
detail
system
has
essentially
privatized
officer
overtime
at
nopd
resulting
in
officers
working
details
in
the
areas
of
town
with
the
least
crime
while
an
insufficient
number
of
officers
are
working
in
the
areas
of
new
orleans
with
the
greatest
crime
prevention
needs
those
with
means
in
new
orleans
are
essentially
able
to
buy
additional
protection
while
those
without
such
means
are
unable
to
pay
for
the
services
and
extra
protection
needed
to
make
up
for
insufficient
or
ineffective
policing
while
any
community
that
wants
extra
security
certainly
has
a
right
to
pay
for
it
it
raises
troubling
legal
and
ethical
questions
when
that
extra
security
might
otherwise
have
been
focused
on
parts
of
the
city
most
in
need
of
police
assistance
n
this
language
might
have
been
a
clarion
call
to
municipal
governments
to
prohibit
or
at
least
to
regulate
more
effectively
the
use
of
sworn
police
officers
as
private
security
for
overtime
pay
however
perhaps
because
the
investigation
revealed
such
a
massive
number
of
issues
the
report
s
critique
of
paid
detail
did
not
gain
national
traction
n
in
addition
the
doj
did
not
mention
paid
detail
in
its
ultimate
consent
decree
with
the
new
orleans
police
department
n
importantly
the
report
s
critique
of
paid
detail
is
not
general
it
does
not
state
that
officer
moonlighting
is
per
se
corrupt
it
limits
its
analysis
to
the
particularities
of
new
orleans
and
even
suggests
an
acceptable
alternative
paid
detail
governance
structure
based
on
that
suggestion
local
governments
might
do
well
to
heed
doj
s
call
and
centralize
requests
for
private
employment
of
off
duty
officers
so
that
they
can
better
monitor
the
practice
and
use
it
to
bring
additional
funds
into
their
police
departments
n
another
option
would
be
to
bar
sworn
police
officers
from
taking
on
this
type
of
secondary
employment
altogether
instead
local
governments
could
expect
private
entities
who
want
extra
security
to
hire
staff
through
private
firms
some
seattle
neighborhoods
have
instituted
this
approach
n
yet
there
are
reasons
to
hesitate
to
take
this
path
private
police
do
not
have
the
same
powers
nor
operate
under
the
same
constitutional
constraints
that
apply
to
sworn
police
officers
n
private
security
officers
might
be
used
only
for
neighborhood
observation
and
suspect
tracking
but
they
need
to
contact
public
police
to
conduct
searches
and
arrests
in
any
event
finding
a
way
to
maintain
a
public
private
distinction
in
policing
would
solve
the
ethical
problem
of
allowing
the
training
equipment
and
culture
that
the
public
provides
to
sworn
police
officers
to
directly
reproduce
neighborhood
inequality
secondary
employment
is
thus
a
mechanism
through
which
poorer
communities
are
structurally
excluded
from
good
policing
officers
may
receive
overtime
pay
for
working
as
officers
in
wealthier
areas
while
they
only
earn
paltry
wages
to
keep
distressed
neighborhoods
safe
this
dynamic
sends
a
stark
message
that
protecting
wealthier
areas
is
more
lucrative
than
protecting
higher
poverty
areas
secondary
employment
policies
like
these
might
even
suggest
at
least
symbolically
that
african
american
and
poor
lives
truly
lack
value
c
reorganizing
the
police
there
are
more
than
twelve
thousand
police
departments
in
the
united
states
nearly
half
of
which
employ
fewer
than
ten
police
officers
n
even
as
philosophies
of
policing
have
shifted
dramatically
over
the
past
century
governance
structures
of
policing
have
largely
remained
intact
n
consolidation
of
very
small
police
districts
might
be
another
way
to
ameliorate
the
structural
exclusion
from
police
resources
that
contributes
to
legal
estrangement
although
consolidating
districts
would
not
constitute
a
total
reorganization
of
departments
it
might
be
a
strong
first
step
toward
creating
a
structure
more
amenable
to
meaningful
community
engagement
and
checks
on
police
power
the
proliferation
of
many
small
police
departments
means
that
some
neighborhoods
can
essentially
become
individual
fiefdoms
for
certain
officers
the
issue
of
unchecked
power
in
extremely
small
rural
or
suburban
police
departments
came
to
national
attention
for
a
very
short
time
in
late
when
a
south
carolina
prosecutor
attempted
twice
to
win
the
conviction
of
richard
combs
the
police
chief
and
sole
police
officer
in
eutawville
south
carolina
a
town
with
a
population
of
combs
was
charged
with
murder
for
shooting
bernard
bailey
a
fifty
four
year
old
unarmed
african
american
man
in
the
parking
lot
of
eutawville
s
town
hall
in
may
bailey
had
intervened
when
combs
issued
a
traffic
ticket
to
bailey
s
daughter
and
the
shooting
allegedly
occurred
a
few
days
later
when
combs
attempted
to
serve
bailey
with
a
warrant
for
obstruction
of
justice
some
onlookers
saw
combs
as
an
example
of
an
officer
who
because
he
functioned
as
the
sole
traffic
officer
regular
patrol
officer
and
police
chief
had
unfettered
power
to
use
the
machinery
of
criminal
justice
for
vindictive
purposes
a
structure
that
seems
almost
destined
to
produce
corrupt
police
action
n
yet
after
the
briefest
of
moments
as
combs
ultimately
took
a
guilty
plea
for
misconduct
in
office
and
as
bigger
city
shootings
took
over
news
cycles
again
the
issue
of
small
police
department
governance
returned
to
obscurity
n
small
departments
can
also
create
various
interjurisdictional
inconsistencies
ranging
from
the
amount
of
training
officers
receive
to
the
equipment
available
to
keep
themselves
and
civilians
safe
for
example
one
of
the
arguments
that
combs
s
attorney
made
to
explain
his
decision
to
shoot
bailey
was
that
because
the
town
he
policed
is
very
small
they
did
not
have
less
lethal
equipment
such
as
a
stun
gun
taser
or
pepper
spray
this
meant
that
the
only
means
of
force
he
had
available
was
his
gun
n
whether
giving
combs
a
taser
or
pepper
spray
would
have
saved
bailey
s
life
is
a
difficult
question
however
it
does
seem
likely
that
in
part
because
of
the
governance
structure
of
his
department
combs
did
not
have
access
to
expensive
taser
technology
moreover
the
prevalence
of
very
small
departments
in
close
proximity
to
each
other
increases
the
likelihood
that
an
officer
fired
from
one
jurisdiction
for
serious
reasons
could
find
work
as
an
officer
in
another
poor
communities
are
more
likely
to
hire
gypsy
cops
officers
with
spotty
work
histories
who
have
been
fired
elsewhere
because
their
resource
constraints
make
it
more
difficult
for
them
to
discriminate
between
good
and
bad
officers
n
again
the
officers
least
likely
to
conduct
their
work
in
a
procedurally
just
manner
are
siphoned
toward
poor
communities
some
have
claimed
in
line
with
strong
federalism
advocates
and
some
basic
tenets
of
public
choice
theory
that
having
more
police
agencies
within
close
proximity
increases
competition
which
in
turn
could
improve
their
responsiveness
to
community
needs
and
allow
dissatisfied
people
to
vote
with
their
feet
by
relocating
elsewhere
n
yet
there
is
little
evidence
that
these
benefits
emerge
from
the
existence
of
very
small
police
departments
that
lack
meaningful
external
oversight
while
there
is
some
evidence
that
the
current
extreme
fragmentation
is
detrimental
to
the
overall
quality
of
policing
n
historically
one
argument
against
department
consolidation
was
that
administrative
centralization
could
threaten
officers
ability
to
engage
in
community
policing
n
however
it
may
not
be
empirically
true
that
fragmentation
of
police
administration
is
correlated
with
let
alone
a
catalyst
of
effective
community
oriented
policing
indeed
some
of
the
most
celebrated
efforts
to
link
police
and
community
have
taken
place
in
larger
departments
n
by
contrast
the
sheer
volume
of
locally
controlled
police
departments
all
of
which
have
slightly
different
policies
and
issues
creates
a
major
barrier
to
systemic
reform
the
seemingly
infinite
variations
on
police
policy
means
that
scholars
and
policymakers
may
observe
common
problems
across
local
contexts
but
find
it
difficult
to
sufficiently
address
those
problems
on
a
larger
scale
consolidation
would
help
if
only
because
it
would
decrease
the
number
of
departments
and
make
it
easier
to
gain
a
picture
of
their
policies
and
practices
unlike
many
of
the
structural
reforms
proposed
in
this
part
department
consolidation
has
gained
some
support
from
advocates
for
money
saving
in
criminal
justice
after
the
recession
municipal
budgets
shrank
and
many
officers
were
furloughed
or
laid
off
n
local
executives
are
increasingly
considering
police
consolidation
as
a
potential
cost
effective
structural
reform
and
some
departments
have
already
consolidated
as
a
way
to
cut
redundancies
n
thus
consolidation
could
win
the
mutual
support
of
fiscal
conservatives
and
liberals
building
a
coalition
reminiscent
of
the
left
right
nexus
on
cutting
mass
incarceration
n
however
significant
hurdles
could
impede
such
a
reform
for
one
members
of
the
public
who
live
in
very
small
towns
may
interpret
consolidation
of
small
departments
as
a
cut
to
their
public
safety
and
to
local
control
of
their
police
force
in
addition
consolidation
would
mean
that
some
people
who
have
immense
power
would
be
required
to
yield
it
these
fundamental
issues
mean
that
securing
support
for
department
consolidation
in
local
areas
will
pose
a
significant
challenge
d
raising
the
stakes
of
fourth
amendment
jurisprudence
understanding
today
s
policing
crisis
as
a
problem
of
legal
estrangement
clarifies
and
raises
the
stakes
of
our
fourth
amendment
jurisprudence
when
judges
rule
on
the
lawfulness
of
police
conduct
in
a
single
case
they
are
ruling
on
a
program
n
that
program
is
bigger
than
systematic
terry
stops
and
frisks
of
young
african
american
and
latino
men
n
the
program
is
endemic
to
policing
itself
including
serving
warrants
n
and
responding
or
not
responding
to
calls
for
assistance
because
of
the
longstanding
social
cultural
and
symbolic
meaning
of
the
police
among
african
americans
and
in
racially
and
socioeconomically
marginalized
communities
policing
cases
more
than
others
send
messages
to
groups
about
social
inclusion
and
indeed
social
citizenship
legitimacy
theory
does
not
offer
a
consistent
mode
of
response
to
this
problem
n
what
messages
are
conveyed
in
fourth
amendment
jurisprudence
justice
sotomayor
s
impassioned
dissent
in
strieff
showed
her
understanding
that
this
case
even
though
it
involved
a
white
defendant
blessed
police
discretion
to
behave
in
ways
that
denigrate
and
alienate
minority
populations
to
illustrate
we
can
return
to
the
facts
of
strieff
n
in
strieff
a
narcotics
detective
douglas
fackrell
conducted
surveillance
outside
a
home
in
southern
salt
lake
city
utah
for
about
a
week
fackrell
had
received
an
anonymous
tip
that
people
were
selling
and
purchasing
methamphetamine
there
fackrell
saw
several
people
enter
and
leave
the
home
after
short
periods
of
time
behavior
that
in
his
view
was
consistent
with
drug
dealing
and
purchasing
edward
strieff
was
one
of
the
people
who
visited
the
home
on
one
of
these
surveillance
days
strieff
left
the
home
in
question
and
went
to
a
nearby
convenience
store
even
though
fackrell
only
knew
that
strieff
had
visited
the
home
information
that
did
not
amount
to
reasonable
suspicion
to
justify
a
search
fackrell
followed
strieff
to
the
convenience
store
stopped
him
and
questioned
him
about
what
he
was
doing
at
the
home
in
question
fackrell
also
took
strieff
s
identification
card
and
shared
his
information
with
a
police
dispatcher
the
dispatcher
told
fackrell
that
strieff
had
an
open
warrant
for
his
arrest
on
a
minor
traffic
violation
fackrell
then
arrested
strieff
and
in
a
search
incident
to
arrest
found
the
evidence
he
was
looking
for
strieff
was
holding
a
small
baggie
of
meth
and
other
drug
paraphernalia
n
why
is
this
case
troubling
fackrell
violated
the
fourth
amendment
by
stopping
strieff
in
the
first
place
even
the
prosecutor
conceded
that
point
n
yet
the
court
ruled
that
because
fackrell
learned
that
strieff
had
an
open
warrant
for
arrest
even
if
just
for
a
minor
traffic
violation
the
search
he
conducted
was
sufficiently
attenuated
from
the
unconstitutional
stop
that
the
evidence
fackrell
discovered
was
admissible
in
a
world
where
few
people
had
open
warrants
this
decision
might
seem
somewhat
troubling
but
not
catastrophic
yet
in
a
scenario
where
a
substantial
number
of
people
have
open
warrants
often
for
the
most
minor
of
infractions
often
for
noncriminal
violations
of
probation
and
parole
conditions
and
often
because
of
their
poverty
n
the
strieff
decision
authorizes
tremendous
power
police
officers
are
now
free
to
arbitrarily
and
even
unconstitutionally
stop
people
ask
them
for
their
identification
have
a
dispatcher
search
their
record
find
an
arrest
warrant
for
a
long
unpaid
parking
ticket
or
a
missed
appointment
with
a
probation
officer
and
use
that
ticket
as
a
reason
to
conduct
any
physical
search
that
they
would
like
to
conduct
if
they
find
any
contraband
that
contraband
could
be
used
as
evidence
in
court
while
police
officers
need
discretion
in
order
to
locate
and
deter
crime
this
ruling
gives
them
a
worrisome
amount
of
license
when
one
views
this
ruling
in
context
and
imagines
strategies
like
fackrell
s
playing
out
in
racially
and
socioeconomically
marginalized
places
like
west
baltimore
one
understands
more
clearly
that
the
court
has
endorsed
the
wholesale
exclusion
of
poor
african
americans
and
often
latinx
communities
from
the
protection
of
the
law
and
from
their
rightful
place
in
society
in
whren
v
united
states
the
court
ruled
inter
alia
that
challenges
to
police
investigations
based
on
race
based
selective
enforcement
must
proceed
through
fourteenth
amendment
equal
protection
analysis
rather
than
fourth
amendment
analysis
n
given
the
very
high
bar
for
proving
racial
discrimination
under
the
equal
protection
clause
post
washington
v
davis
n
whren
significantly
curtails
the
degree
to
which
fourth
amendment
jurisprudence
on
police
investigation
could
be
used
to
correct
racial
discrimination
in
the
conduct
of
police
investigations
thus
state
courts
might
under
some
circumstances
be
better
suited
than
federal
courts
to
factor
in
the
local
context
of
racial
discrimination
and
disparity
reflective
of
legal
estrangement
for
example
in
late
the
massachusetts
supreme
judicial
court
ruled
in
commonwealth
v
warren
that
an
african
american
man
s
decision
to
flee
from
the
police
is
not
on
its
own
sufficiently
probative
of
reasonable
suspicion
n
the
court
partly
based
its
reasoning
on
statistical
evidence
that
african
american
men
in
boston
disproportionately
experience
stops
based
on
racial
profiling
n
black
male
bostonians
the
court
cautioned
might
just
as
easily
be
motivated
by
the
desire
to
avoid
the
recurring
indignity
of
being
racially
profiled
as
by
the
desire
to
hide
criminal
activity
n
in
other
words
in
an
environment
where
the
police
have
signaled
strongly
to
african
american
men
that
their
group
is
not
a
full
part
of
society
entitled
to
the
presumption
of
innocence
the
natural
response
to
that
communication
is
to
avoid
the
police
regardless
of
any
involvement
in
crime
this
was
a
judicial
acknowledgement
of
the
potential
effects
of
legal
estrangement
judges
who
rule
on
the
constitutionality
of
searches
should
keep
in
mind
the
stakes
of
giving
too
much
leeway
to
the
police
stakes
that
legal
estrangement
theory
illuminates
traditionally
we
think
of
the
potential
harms
of
policing
gone
awry
as
violations
of
privacy
and
individual
dignity
and
on
the
opposite
side
we
weigh
the
police
s
ability
to
respond
to
and
reduce
crime
n
yet
as
important
as
individual
privacy
is
the
collective
stakes
are
even
higher
moreover
some
have
argued
that
the
text
of
the
fourth
amendment
emphasizing
reasonableness
demands
that
courts
consider
distributional
outcomes
of
searches
and
seizures
by
race
gender
and
other
group
categories
n
the
question
of
reasonableness
has
grown
obscure
as
fourth
amendment
jurisprudence
has
come
to
focus
so
heavily
on
warrants
consent
probable
cause
and
so
forth
perhaps
distracting
courts
from
the
fundamental
reasonableness
inquiry
that
should
take
into
account
distributional
concerns
between
groups
n
getting
fourth
amendment
rulings
wrong
by
giving
the
police
too
much
power
risks
both
individual
and
collective
membership
in
the
american
social
order
e
democratizing
the
police
legal
estrangement
demands
a
deep
meaningful
approach
to
democratizing
police
governance
bringing
about
cohesion
and
solidarity
between
police
and
african
american
and
poor
communities
will
require
a
more
aggressive
infusion
of
deliberative
participation
in
policing
than
most
proposals
demand
a
legitimacy
approach
might
not
object
to
deep
democratization
these
processes
would
arguably
make
the
police
more
effective
in
securing
voluntary
compliance
and
would
arguably
encourage
the
police
to
use
procedurally
just
methods
but
legitimacy
would
not
require
it
barry
friedman
and
maria
ponomarenko
have
recently
argued
against
police
exceptionalism
in
policymaking
they
propose
that
police
policies
such
as
the
use
of
swat
teams
and
warrantless
searches
require
legislative
authorization
administrative
rulemaking
with
notice
and
comment
or
some
other
democratic
process
similar
to
other
areas
of
regulation
n
while
their
argument
is
persuasive
the
communities
most
affected
by
legal
estrangement
are
often
locked
out
of
the
democratic
process
more
generally
for
a
panoply
of
reasons
ranging
from
the
education
gap
to
felony
disenfranchisement
and
its
chilling
effects
on
turnout
in
high
incarceration
communities
to
active
efforts
at
voter
suppression
to
gerrymandering
to
the
capture
of
policymaking
through
high
stakes
lobbying
african
americans
particularly
if
they
live
in
high
poverty
communities
have
relatively
little
say
in
who
their
representatives
are
or
in
the
legislation
that
their
representatives
ultimately
pass
n
the
public
in
general
participates
sparingly
in
administrative
rulemaking
and
race
and
class
distributed
access
gaps
have
long
been
seen
in
that
area
of
lawmaking
as
well
n
shifting
toward
more
democratic
processes
is
important
on
the
grounds
of
democracy
and
the
rule
of
law
and
it
does
provide
an
opening
for
meaningful
change
however
it
is
unlikely
on
its
own
to
unsettle
legal
estrangement
in
the
communities
that
are
most
affected
by
it
n
combining
these
processes
with
other
democracy
enhancing
reforms
might
be
necessary
transparency
measures
including
data
collection
and
hot
ticket
reforms
such
as
police
officer
body
cameras
can
also
contribute
to
the
overall
democratization
of
policing
in
a
way
that
could
begin
to
root
out
legal
estrangement
n
currently
the
most
widely
distributed
videos
that
focus
on
police
generally
show
officers
either
engaging
in
forceful
or
other
distasteful
behavior
or
performing
acts
such
as
dancing
playing
basketball
or
distributing
ice
cream
the
former
are
unsettling
because
they
emphasize
police
wrongdoing
rather
than
police
officers
effective
interactions
with
the
public
which
are
likely
more
common
the
latter
are
unsettling
because
they
suggest
such
acts
are
core
to
today
s
iteration
of
community
policing
data
might
alert
scholars
and
activists
to
overlooked
systemic
problems
but
they
could
also
illuminate
police
agencies
and
officers
that
are
doing
their
work
properly
if
one
suspects
that
most
police
interactions
go
the
way
that
they
should
data
and
transparency
can
potentially
be
a
boon
to
solidarity
between
officers
and
communities
data
can
perhaps
put
what
police
actually
do
most
of
the
time
in
clearer
perspective
when
then
state
senator
obama
led
the
illinois
legislature
in
passing
antiracial
profiling
legislation
in
n
he
emphasized
that
the
purpose
of
the
bill
was
to
collect
data
on
police
activity
he
convinced
the
fraternal
order
of
police
that
the
data
would
give
them
an
opportunity
to
show
that
they
were
doing
valid
police
work
not
engaging
in
racial
discrimination
n
this
initiative
represents
only
one
example
of
a
transparency
measure
that
could
serve
both
to
root
out
estrangement
and
to
provide
a
more
informed
understanding
of
police
yet
perhaps
an
even
more
effective
approach
would
include
ways
to
make
policing
more
qualitatively
transparent
for
instance
making
videos
of
regular
police
work
more
publicly
available
opening
access
to
police
departments
and
perhaps
even
finding
ways
to
support
more
adversarial
forms
of
transparency
and
accountability
such
as
organized
cop
watching
n
reconciliation
is
a
third
type
of
democratic
reform
that
the
legal
estrangement
perspective
might
suggest
criminologist
and
activist
david
kennedy
along
with
leaders
of
the
doj
funded
national
initiative
for
building
community
trust
and
justice
have
proposed
that
police
departments
undertake
a
reconciliation
process
between
officers
and
historically
distressed
communities
n
although
the
specific
mechanisms
that
would
be
officially
instituted
are
unclear
the
proposed
process
would
involve
a
method
of
facilitating
frank
engagements
between
minority
communities
police
and
other
authorities
that
allow
them
to
address
historical
tensions
grievances
and
misconceptions
and
reset
relationships
n
the
idea
of
reconciliation
builds
on
kennedy
s
groundbreaking
work
as
founder
of
operation
ceasefire
and
the
national
network
for
safe
communities
nnsc
through
these
two
organizations
kennedy
and
others
engaged
in
a
deep
strategy
of
violence
prevention
by
working
with
local
gangs
and
bringing
those
offenders
together
with
key
stakeholders
including
the
police
n
the
newly
proposed
reconciliation
efforts
represent
an
effort
to
scale
up
some
of
the
insights
gained
from
these
local
violence
reduction
interventions
the
mechanics
of
this
reconciliation
proposal
remain
unclear
the
proposal
is
distinct
from
prevailing
democratic
reform
recommendations
because
it
takes
very
seriously
the
historical
roots
of
legal
estrangement
accommodates
the
complexity
of
the
dynamics
between
officers
and
communities
and
in
some
ways
meets
the
habermasian
ideal
of
a
truly
deliberative
consent
based
approach
to
policing
taking
full
account
of
historical
distrust
is
essential
to
the
success
of
cultural
change
to
avoid
merely
replacing
one
modality
of
domination
with
another
n
however
governments
usually
use
truth
and
reconciliation
processes
to
address
injustices
that
occurred
over
a
cognizable
bounded
time
period
and
involved
a
fairly
identifiable
set
of
wrongdoers
n
to
deal
with
the
problem
of
legal
estrangement
a
restorative
reconciliation
model
would
have
to
recognize
the
deeply
systemic
nature
of
the
problem
moreover
nnsc
s
goal
of
reducing
violence
is
not
the
same
as
rooting
out
legal
estrangement
a
key
insight
that
drives
the
innovation
in
operation
ceasefire
and
other
programs
is
that
most
of
the
violence
in
a
community
is
concentrated
within
relatively
confined
networks
n
thus
deeply
targeting
those
networks
in
a
deliberative
legitimacy
building
way
is
a
successful
approach
legal
estrangement
in
contrast
is
more
dispersed
and
broadly
influential
however
the
basic
intuitions
of
reconciliation
intentionally
bringing
police
and
communities
together
to
build
trust
on
a
group
level
and
actively
reckoning
with
the
collective
memories
of
harsh
policing
reflect
the
type
of
intensive
deeply
democratic
process
that
might
produce
long
lasting
cultural
change
f
shrinking
refining
the
footprint
of
the
police
finally
the
legal
estrangement
perspective
raises
fundamental
questions
about
the
role
of
police
in
society
police
and
more
broadly
the
criminal
justice
system
have
become
the
primary
vehicle
through
which
the
state
responds
to
social
deprivation
n
at
times
police
can
play
a
positive
role
in
channeling
resources
to
people
who
need
them
particularly
as
a
conduit
into
diversion
and
decarceration
programs
that
may
for
example
help
people
get
into
counseling
and
narcotics
rehabilitation
programs
n
yet
as
a
matter
of
principle
routing
rehabilitation
and
social
services
through
the
police
could
perversely
widen
the
carceral
net
and
reify
the
culture
of
control
n
the
expansion
of
policing
control
has
added
to
police
departments
coffers
over
the
past
three
decades
leading
to
the
growth
of
many
forces
n
yet
even
police
officers
complain
that
the
system
expects
them
to
play
an
outsized
role
in
poor
people
s
daily

than

n
the
legal
estrangement
perspective
should
encourage
serious
reflection
on
whether
and
how
much
armed
officials
should
inhabit
the
role
of
social
caretaker
recently
scholars
and
policymakers
have
pushed
for
a
cultural
shift
in
policing
proposing
that
officers
see
themselves
as
guardians
rather
than
warriors
n
while
this
work
is
commendable
it
demands
greater
discussion
of
the
nature
and
scope
of
the
guardianship
that
we
should
expect
the
police
to
provide
it
might
be
that
reforms
that
enable
greater
collaboration
between
police
and
social
services
could
make
the
police
more
legitimate
at
an
individual
level
but
it
might
also
in
the
aggregate
worsen
disparities
in
criminal
justice
treatment
by
race
and
class
this
aggregate
effect
would
increase
legal
estrangement
ultimately
the
legal
estrangement
perspective
demands
a
more
holistic
discussion
of
institutional
competence
a
legitimacy
analysis
often
examines
institutions
in
a
decontextualized
way
assessing
whether
a
particular
institution
here
the
police
has
legitimacy
or
not
legal
estrangement
encourages
a
more
relational
examination
of
institutions
the
frailty
of
one
bundle
of
institutions
here
the
welfare
state
might
chip
away
at
the
legitimacy
of
the
police
of
other
institutions
and
perhaps
the
state
itself
shrinking
the
footprint
of
armed
bureaucrats
and
creating
a
more
robust
system
of
civil
supports
might
bring
more
legitimacy
to
these
institutions
and
increase
their
capacity
to
produce
social
inclusion
conclusion
this
essay
argues
that
legal
estrangement
a
theory
that
focuses
on
the
symbolic
and
structural
marginalization
of
african
americans
and
the
poor
from
society
provides
richer
theoretical
grounding
for
police
reform
legal
estrangement
theory
incorporates
procedural
justice
a
solution
derived
from
legitimacy
theory
as
a
first
step
toward
understanding
police
distrust
among
african
american
and
poor
communities
yet
legal
estrangement
surpasses
legitimacy
theory
by
fully
considering
two
larger
levels
at
which
distrust
operates
vicarious
marginalization
and
structural
exclusion
vicarious
experiences
range
from
the
mistreatment
of
a
friend
as
jamila
experienced
or
through
learning
about
more
distant
negative
treatment
as
shawna
experienced
when
she
learned
about
the
officer
rapes
structural
aspects
of
policing
the
drug
searches
that
happened
at
lemuel
s
school
the
knockers
that
he
encountered
in
his
neighborhood
and
the
discretion
to
enforce
questionable
walking
ordinances
against
kids
like
justin
exclude
whole
groups
of
people
from
experiencing
policing
as
a
protective
benefit
and
create
a
dividing
line
between
the
valued
and
the
valueless
drawing
on
these
theoretical
insights
i
have
proposed
a
number
of
areas
for
reform
that
taken
together
should
help
create
the
deep
and
lasting
cultural
change
that
will
be
required
to
truly
overcome
legal
estrangement
these
reforms
range
widely
including
more
technocratic
reforms
restructuring
police
wages
and
consolidating
districts
judicial
measures
rethinking
fourth
amendment
levels
of
interpretation
community
centered
measures
democratization
reconciliation
and
transparency
and
a
fundamental
revisitation
of
institutional
roles
shrinking
and
refining
the
police
footprint
while
linking
it
to
a
shoring
up
of
critical
social
welfare
institutions
these
solutions
offer
a
deeper
path
forward
than
the
legitimacy
perspective
does
pushing
beyond
procedural
justice
they
do
of
course
remain
incomplete
the
legal
estrangement
perspective
demands
taking
account
of
historically
rooted
group
marginalization
and
the
collective
consciousness
of
discrimination
and
mistreatment
this
historical
and
collective
perspective
is
central
to
the
project
of
police
reform
accordingly
the
perspective
sensitizes
police
reformers
to
the
idea
that
while
modifications
within
the
institution
of
policing
are
critical
and
should
move
beyond
individual
line
officers
their
work
will
not
be
finished
until
it
spurs
change
in
the
full
array
of
institutions
that
perpetuate
poverty

in
general
it
is
important
to
note
that

uses
of

can
be
unreasonable
and
thus
punishable
even

the
law
or
failing
to

the
test

s
alleged
assault
occurred
years
before
videotaping
emerged
as
a
response
to
harsh
police
tactics
n
for
example
one
young
man
who
resides
primarily
in
northwest
baltimore
s
park
heights
neighborhood
said
that
there
are
so
many
cars
on
every
corner
in
that
neighborhood
that
he
constantly
feels
that
he
is
being
watched
i
ll
go
up
to
park
heights
and
every
corner
i
go
to
i
m
going
to
see
a
police
car
i
m
not
trying
to
say
that
s
a
bad
thing
i
m
not
even
saying
a
cop
is
watching
but
when
you
see
a
police
car
eventually
that
s
somebody
saying
you
re
being
watched
for
real
that
s
how
i
feel
and
i
guess
that
s
how
people
see
it
when
they
see
a
cop
car
it
s
like
they
re
being
watched
this
quote
was
recorded
during
an
interview
conducted
by
kaitlin
edin
nelson
and
janice
bonsu
on
june
n
one
young
woman
discussing
the
same
neighborhood
said
that
it
takes
the
police
about
twenty
five
minutes
to
arrive
when
someone
calls
about
a
murder
accident
or
other
major
event
despite
their
common
presence
geena
i
heard
you
say
earlier
that
a
situation
has
to
be
serious
before
you
call
the
police
what
kind
of
situation
would
that
be
respondent
like
murder
or
a
robbery
accident
somebody
being
injured
not
just
a
little
dispute
or
fuss
somebody
that
has
an
injury
or
someone
in
trouble
geena
how
long
would
the
police
take
to
respond
and
get
there
respondent
i
don
t
know
i
think
like
twenty
five
minutes
unless
they
re
in
the
area
and
they
just
got
called
over
monica
do
you
see
the
police
around
a
lot
like
you
said
unless
they
re
in
the
area
are
they
in
the
areas
where
you
are
that
much
respondent
ye
ah
they
do
because
i
live
right
up
the

from
the

so
they

as

explains
most

racism
as

view
thus
the
cure
is
educating
them
to

offered
here
implies
that
because
the
phenomenon

is
by

while
some

focused
on

s

as
a
catalyst
for
the

response
and
her
death
activists
have
claimed
more
in
line
with
a
legal
estrangement
perspective
that
the
officers
decision
to
fire
on
gaines
when
she
was
holding
her
five
year
old
son
was
symbolic
of
their
devaluation
of
african
american
lives
from
a
legitimacy
perspective
the
fact
that
gaines
was
carrying
a
shotgun
which
she
allegedly
fired
could
be
relevant
officers
can
explain
in
a
seemingly
neutral
way
why
they
made
the
decision
to
fire
from
an
estrangement
perspective
regardless
of
whether
the
officers
decision
was
objectively
reasonable
it
was
subjectively
unreasonable
and
reproductive
of
the
social
exclusion
of
african
americans
n
one
exception
to
this
characterization
is
some
of
tracey
meares
s
scholarship
in
particular
in
a
lecture
on
the
legitimacy
of
police
among

men

policing
can
build

meares
notes
that
a
core
assumption

that

is

introduction
the
potential
benefits
of
smart
city
technologies
are
numerous
by
becoming
smart
a
city
can
not
only
deliver
more
and
better
services
with
greater
efficiency
it
can
capture
the
cultural
cach
of
the
tech
savvy
label
what
city
leader
would
not
want
the
economic
growth
that
comes
with
a
thriving
startup
community
everyone
wants
to
be
the
next
silicon
valley
or
seattle
and
these
regions
want
to
maintain
their
status
as
hot
tech
hubs
so
smart
city
initiatives
race
ahead
in
pittsburgh
new
york
los
angeles
kansas
city
atlanta
and
elsewhere
driving
innovation
to
bring
the
american
city
into
the
st
century
n
however
privacy
advocates
are
voicing
concerns
over
some
of
the
privacy
risks
and
other
unintended
consequences
that
can
crop
up
with
smart
city
programs
the
purpose
of
this
essay
is
not
to
deny
the
benefits
of
smart
city
initiatives
or
argue
against
their
implementation
rather
it
seeks
to
help
policy
makers
avoid
problems
by
identifying
them
early
on
before
they
become
baked
into

hypothetical
headlines
that
distill
the
way
privacy
risks
from
smart

can
capture
the

imagination
it
also
highlights
common

and
urges
policy
makers
to
reframe
the
way
they
think
about

and
smart

the
beauty
of
the
smart

movement
is
the
diversity
of
ideas
enabled
by
the
focus
on
locality
cities
all
over
the
world
are
experimenting
with
novel
projects
all
the
time
and
no
one
person
could
chronicle
all
the
potential
privacy
risks
rather
than
attempt
the
impossible
this
essay
hopes
to
impact
policy
by
identifying
motivating
examples
and
advocating
a
measured
approach
where
policy
makers
question
the
assumptions
that
lead
to

risks
and
enact
strong

what
is
a

city
a
smart
city
is
one
that
integrates
information
and
communication
technologies
icts
and
the
internet
of
things
iot
to
manage
the
city
s
assets
and
delivery
of
services
city
assets
and
services
may
include
local
departments
information
systems
schools
libraries
transportation
systems
hospitals
power
plants
law
enforcement
and
other
community
services
n
essentially
smart
cities
seek
to
improve
city
life
by
gathering
more
data
analyzing
and
processing
that
data
sharing
it
and
using
it
to
deliver
services
a
typical
smart
city
initiative
might
include
installation
of
internet
connected
sensors
in
public
places
value
added
services
like
free
wi
fi
or
public
information
kiosks
big
data
analytics
of
publicly
held
data
an
online
portal
through
which
to
share
municipal
data
or
some
combination
of
the
above
and
more
these
sorts
of
projects
offer
substantial
benefits
to
cities
and
their
residents
a
central
plank
of
most
smart
city
projects
is
the
deployment
of
internet
connected
sensors
to
provide
the
city
with
the
data
it
needs
to
be
smart
for
example
in
kansas
city
sensity
s
led
streetlights
not
only
consume
much
less
electricity
than
a
traditional
bulb
but
have
visual
sensors
that
can
track
when
a
vehicle
is
blocking
the
path
of
the
new
streetcar
and
alert
authorities
to
have
it
ticketed
and
removed
this
system
allows
the
city
s
public
transit
to
operate
unimpeded
other
cities
have
systems
to
monitor
traffic
flow
or
listen
for
gunshots
and
dispatch
police
sensors
are
not
the
only
smart
city
tool
however
many
cities
wish
to
use
technology
to
improve
governance
and
streamline
service
delivery
police
departments
have
tools
that
analyze
crime
patterns
and
can
inform
them
where
crimes
are
likely
to
occur
in
the
future
allowing
for
more
efficient
resource
allocation
a
city
might
employ
an
app
that
lets
citizens
report
potholes
or
other
road
hazards
for
expedited
repair
some
cities
have
gone
even
further
by
experimenting
with
algorithmic
decision
making
in
city
services
and
programs
municipal
open
data
initiatives
seek
to
share
the
data
held
by
the
city
with
the
public
generally
through
an
online
portal
the
hope
is
that
such
data
will
empower
citizens
to
accomplish
civic
projects
or
allow
business
to
better
inform
their
work
for
example
advocacy
groups
might
be
able
to
track
patterns
of
discriminatory
housing
practices
or
local
entrepreneurs
may
build
an
app
for
better
real
time
traffic
updates
value
added
services
are
another
publicly
recognizable
smart
city
benefit
the
most
common
of
these
services
is
free
public
wi
fi
but
could
also
include
public
kiosks
that
provide
real
time
information
on
events
restaurants
or
public
transit
new
york
and
kansas
city
are
leading
the
way
with
such
kiosks
clearly
the
rewards
of
a
smart
city
are
great
but
such
rewards
also
come
with
risks
this
essay
s
chief
concerns
are
the
risks
posed
to
privacy
and
civil
liberties
iii
the
problem
with
smart
cities
just
as
the
nature
of
smart
city
projects
and
their
intended
benefits
are
diverse
so
are
the
potential
problems
they
encompass
multiple
forms
of
privacy
and
security
risks
as
well
as
threats
to
civil
liberties
a
common
concern
is
the
increase
in
data
collection
that
smart
cities
naturally
entail
if
smart
city
sensors
are
deployed
in
public
areas
which
is
kind
of
the
point
they
potentially
introduce
government
surveillance
technology
into
the
public
square
at
an
unprecedented
level
as
the
reaction
to
the
snowden
revelations
demonstrates
the
public
can
react
quite
strongly
to
programs
they
interpret
as
unbridled
government
surveillance
the
proliferation
of
sensors
is
not
the
only
smart
city
problem
however
the
prospect
of
free
public
wi
fi
is
appealing
to
many
but
sometimes
the
label
free
doesn
t
fully
account
for
the
cost
of
the
service
when
it
entails
turning
users
into
data
subjects
and
then
monetizing
them
n
further
cities
run
the
risk
of
discrimination
and
disparate
impact
that
can
be
entirely
unintentional
for
example
transportation
schemes
that
rely
solely
on
smartphone
hailed
ride
sharing
services
could
exclude
elderly
or
homeless
populations
without
access
to
that
technology
in
many
cases
the
unforeseen
consequences
and
burdens
of
a
smart
city
initiative
will
fall
most
heavily
on
the
disadvantaged
poor
ubiquitous
surveillance
may
combat
crime
but
it
will
also
cast
its
eye
most
heavily
upon
people
who
use
public
services
and
spaces
most
frequently
and
may
exacerbate
the
criminalization
of
homelessness
n
those
with
means
can
purchase
wi
fi
in
the
home
while
those
without
may
be
relegated
to
free
public
networks
where
they
exchange
personal
information
for
services
even
worse
the
poor
often
have
the
least
voice
in
public
debates
and
decision
making
who
will
speak
for
them
when
the
city
s
big
data
analytics
route
services
away
from
the
urban
core
to
avoid
safety
issues
or
systemically
recommend
against
granting
bail
based
on
race
n
other
problems
of
inequity
may
emerge
along
the
rural
urban
digital
divide
n
well
funded
and
technically
savvy
city
governments
can
afford
dedicated
privacy
officers
but
smaller
cities
may
rush
to
implement
smart
city
technologies
while
lacking
the
capacity
or
expertise
to
address
privacy
these
issues
need
serious
consideration
now
not
after
smart
city
programs
are
already
in
place
and
the
damage
has
been
done
it
is
likely
that
most
policy
makers
care
about
privacy
at
least
in
the
abstract
nevertheless
the
rush
to
capture
the
benefits
of
smart
cities
can
blind
policy
makers
to
important
privacy
considerations
this
blindness
is
often
the
result
of
some
faulty
assumptions
or
a
mistaken
framing
of
the
privacy
issue
whatever
the
reason
cities
can
pay
the
price
for
ignoring
privacy
in
the
form
of
bad
publicity
in
the
worst
cases
the
stories
about
smart
city
privacy
issues
can
morph
out
of
control
based
on
misinformation
and
scuttle
entire
projects
n
at
a
minimum
policy
makers
should
apply
the
front
page
test
when
planning
and
implementing
their
smart
city
programs
asking
themselves
how
the
public
might
react
if
their
decision
were
splashed
on
tomorrow
morning
s
front
page
city
policy
makers
should
recognize
as
a
baseline
that
privacy
is
important
for
utilitarian
if
not
outright
ethical
reasons
and
seek
to
mitigate
privacy
problems
wherever
they
can
the
efforts
of
smart
city
leaders
like
seattle
and
kansas

demonstrate
that
privacy
can
be
a
smart

its

nature
tends
to
create

from
a

and
utility
standpoint
a

an
ideal
smart

tool
not
so
much
from

the

of
such

can
be
thought

as

risks
could
materialize

in
the
case
of

through
anonymization
in
the
case

noisetube
says
nothing
about
what
happens
once
the

decides
to

smartbay
does
not
describe
its
anonymization
methods

as
i

discuss
it
is
quite
difficult

before

much
of
it

obscure
as

n
first
is
the
potential

open

second
are
the
twin
issues
of
re
identification
and
mosaic
effects
true
de
identification
is
quite
difficult
to
accomplish
because
the
prevalence
of
big
data
often
allows
determined
actors
to
reverse
the
de
identification
process
and
compromise
a
data
subject
s
privacy

classic
example

to
re
identify
medical
records
from
knowing
only
the
sex
date
of
birth
and
zip

of

the
mosaic
effect
becomes
a
concern
when
multiple
data
sets
are
available
for
combination
the
very
core
of
big
data
n
the
combination
of
data
sets
can
reveal
information
that
was
thought
to
be
anonymous
for
instance
linking
various
records
through
a
common
zip
code
n
and
in
some
cases
can
lead
to
complete
re
identification

parties

city
prefers
manipulation
over
legislation
to
control
citizen
behavior
city
policy
makers
have
numerous
tools
at
their
disposal
to
influence
citizen
behavior
cities
routinely
legislate
through
city
codes
and
ordinances
scholars
have
also
been
exploring
alternative
means
of
regulation
such
as
nudging
designing
around
cognitive
biases
to
push
people
toward
salutary
behavior
n
this
regulatory
approach
grew
in
standing
when
cass
sunstein
ascended
to
the
head
of
the
office
of
information
and
regulatory
affairs
under
obama
other
works
show
that
digitizing
platforms
can
lead
to
problematic
asymmetries
of
information
and
power
leaving
consumers
subject
to
unprecedented
manipulation
n
taken
together
these
two
bodies
of
literature
suggest
that
digital
i
e
smart
cities
will
present
numerous
and
novel
opportunities
for
policy
makers
to
influence
citizens
as
smart
cities
move
to
digitize
their
interactions
with
citizens
the
interface
between
city
and
citizen
will
be
increasingly
subject
to
the
design
caprice
of
policy
makers
but
cities
should
be
wary
of
abusing
these
techniques
even
the
originators
of
nudging
warn
that
such
techniques
should
be
constrained
by
the

if
warnings
to
heed
the

test
are
not

judicial
concerns
over
separation

haunt

even
end
well

for
example
in
a
decidedly
analogue
case
the
new
york
city
department
of
health
recently
attempted
to
nudge
people
toward
drinking
smaller
portions
of
sugary
drinks
by
capping
soda
serving
sizes
one
of
the
reasons
the
new
york
appellate
division
struck
down
the
regulation
because
it
violated
separation
of
powers
n
they
reasoned
that
the
board
usurped
legislative
role
of
identifying
new
health
hazards
n
by
relying
on
digital
design
and
architecture
policy
makers
will
have
even
greater
opportunities
to
circumvent
democratic
processes
they
may
also
inadvertently
violate
other
legal
constraints
like
due
process
or
equal
protection
the
digitization
of
cities
no
less
than
market
places
or

platforms
will
bring
disruptive

smart
city

have
the
potential
to
ease

and
deliver
better

for
all
city
residents
but
as
with

unthinking
or

can
threaten
civil

and
increase

headline
city

against
the

and

for
example
many
smart
city
initiatives
rely
on
smartphones
as
a
predeployed
network
of
sensors
and
trackers
however
it
is
easy
to
forget
that
not
everyone
has
ready
access
to
this
technology
while
smartphone
penetration
in
the
u
s
has
reached
an
impressive
of
the
mobile
phone
market
n
that
still
leaves
of
the
population
without
this
so
called
ubiquitous

and
that
is
not
even
counting
people
without

people
will
be
left

simply
fail
to
deliver
the
intended
benefits
to
certain
communities
because
of
a
lack
of
understanding
of
those
community
s
needs
n
or
as
mentioned
earlier
the
design
of
some
projects
might
create
disparate
impacts
between
communities
such
as
ad
supported
projects
catering
more
to
rich
users
with
more
valuable
eyeballs
n
much
of
the
foregoing
discussion
has
focused
on
the
ways
in
which
a
lack
of
privacy
can
have
a
disparate
impact
on
the
poor
large
databases
can
discriminate
in
prosaic
and
unintended
ways
for
instance
through
simple
data
entry
errors
people
who
change
their
names
often
women
and
those
with
multiple
surnames
often
people
of
color
like
hispanics
are
more
likely
to
have
errors
in
identity
databases
n
however
big
data
also
poses
risks
of
more
pernicious
forms
of
discrimination
there
are
significant
worries
this
technology
could
be
used
to
digitally
redline
certain
ethnic
or
otherwise
unwanted
groups
from
retail
commerce
employment
tenancy
or
credit
n
much
of
the
data
collected
and
process
by
a
smart
city
program
is
not
subject
to
the
protections
of
the
fair
credit
reporting
act
yet
some
companies
have
found
a
way
to
use
it
as
a
proxy
for
credit
risk
all
the
same
n
recall
that
mosaic
effects
allow
multiple
data
points
in
city
open

initiatives
to
link

to

this
fact
could
revive
the
specter
of
good
old
fashion
redlining
where

through
city

inadvertently
links
people
to

increased

algorithmic
decision
making
is
a
more
cutting
edge
application
early
adopters
hope
it
can
improve
municipal
governance
and
efficiency
for
example
washington
d
c
has
begun
basing
bail
decisions
for
city
jails
based
not
on
ability
to
pay
but
on
a
computer
algorithm
s
assessment
of
the
accused
s
flight
and
recidivism
risk
n
at
first
blush
removing
ability
to
pay
as
a
factor
seems
a
more
equitable
solution
however
civil
rights
activists
have
expressed
concerns
that
the
data
feeding
these
algorithms
may
reflect
and
perpetuate
system
bias
already
prominent
in
the
criminal
justice
system
n
if
such
systems
are
built
without
giving
thought
to
the
potential
for
discrimination
they
will
preserve
it
under
the
guise
of
scientific
fairness
algorithms
like
all
technologies
are
designed
by
people
and
design
choices
will
always
reflect
the
biases
or
lack
of
knowledge
of
the
designer
n
iv
common
assumptions
and
mistakes
what
are
the
assumptions
and
mistakes
that
underpin
these
smart
city
risks
part
iv
will
identify
a
few
of
the
most
pernicious
ones
and
recommend
simple
reframes
to
mitigate
them
sometimes
the
remedy
is
merely
to
recognize
the
potential
risks
in
other
cases
it
will
question
longstanding
practices
in
the
commercial
internet
a
assumption
google
does
it
so
we
can
too
in
the
prevailing
price
model
for
services
in
the
information
economy
users
divulge
some
private
information
and
or
assent
to
tracking
in
exchange
for
free
services
but
in
that
model
when
the
service
is
free
the
user
is
the
product
as
people
become
more
accustomed
to
giving
up
privacy
for
free
services
the
temptation
to
borrow
the
private
sector
model
only
grows
after
all
governments
always
need
more
money
and
the
monetary
value
of
incoming
data
from
smart
cities
is
hard
to
ignore
why
shouldn
t
cities
sell
this
data
to
raise
revenue
or
at
least
offset
the
cost
of
delivering
smart
city
services
the
answer
lies
in
the
different
responsibilities
of
private
and
public
sector
actors
private
companies
have
a
responsibility
to
deliver
value
to
their
shareholders
they
care
about
privacy
only
insofar
as
it
is
good
for
the
bottom
line
what
s
more
every
individual
customer
strikes
their
own
bargain
with
a
company
when
they
use
the
company
s
services
they
may
not
negotiate
the
individual
terms
of
the
contract
but
they
can
at
least
choose
whether
to
transact
the
social
contract
is
different
from
a
commercial
contract
governments
have
an
inherent
responsibility
to
safeguard
the
interest
of
their
citizens
and
among
those
interests
is
privacy
most
individuals
cannot
feasibly
opt
out
of
public
life
nor
should
they
be
forced
to
in
order
to
protect
their
privacy
further
every
citizen
already
pays
for
services
in
the
form
of
taxes
there
are
already
defined
pathways
through
which
governments
raise
money
to
step
outside
those
pathways
can
violate
the
implicit
bargain
between
people
and
their
governments
b
assumption
notice
and
consent
is
always
enough
to
protect
privacy
notice
and
consent
the
idea
that
institutions
must
properly
notify
users
and
obtain
their
consent
before
collecting
and
using
their
data
has
been
the
cornerstone
of
privacy
regulation
in
the
us
for
years
though
many
privacy
scholars
have
looked
at
this
regime
and
found
it
lacking
n
such
notices
may
be
incomprehensible
to
the
average
user
n
or
simply
too
numerous
to
deal
with
as
a
practical
matter
n
notice
and
consent
faces
further
difficulty
in
iot
applications
such
as
public
cameras
or
light
poles
because
meaningful
opportunities
to
provide
notice
and
consent
are
few
or
non
existent
and
citizens
do
not
have
a
meaningful
choice
to
avoid
city
streets
there
are
other
more
privacy
protecting
regimes
that
cities
can
and
should
employ
n
c
assumption
this
will
be
better
because
it
involves
technology
some
policy
makers
may
pursue
technological
solutions
uncritically
out
of
blind
faith
that
because
they
involve
technology
they
must
be
better
smart
cities
do
after
all
have
the
word
smart
in
their
name
but
policy
makers
would
do
well
to
remember
that
new
technological
breakthroughs
often
come
with
new
risks
or
present
risks
in
new
ways
cathy
o
neil
author
of
the
book
weapons
of
math
destruction
has
documented
the
myriad
ways
in
which
the
unthinking
application
of
algorithms
and
big
data
analytics
can
have
negative
consequences
n
technology
is
still
built
by
human
beings
and
will
often
reflect
the
human
goals
ideologies
and
biases
n
d
assumption
free
services
have
zero
cost
the
information
economy
offers
an
ever
expanding
number
of
services
without
asking
for
a
penny
in
exchange
instead
users
give
their
consent
sometimes
explicit
though
often
tacit
to
divulge
personal
information
up
front
and
have
their
online
activities
tracked
this
arrangement
has
created
tremendous
value
for
both
users
and
service
providers
but
is
it
truly
without
cost
chris
hoofnagle
and
jan
whittington
have
documented
how
the
free
label
allows
companies
to
generate
contractual
hazards
for
consumers
ignore
consumer
preferences
for
privacy
and
mislead
consumers
by
creating
the
impression
that
a
given
transaction
will
be
free
n
policy
makers
should
not
be
similarly
misled
privacy
is
not
free
and
if
smart
cities
are
to
protect
it
they
will
likely
need
to
bear
those
costs
for
example
in
the
san
francisco
mayor
s
office
greenlit
a
municipal
wi
fi
project
in
partnership
with
earthlink
and
google
n
the
deal
would
have
subjected
users
particularly
free
users
to
invasive
tracking
n
however
a
study
by
the
city
budget
analyst
showed
that
although
a
municipally
owned
service
posed
some
risks
it
was
fiscally
feasible
and
more
privacy
protective
n
cities
should
consider
the
true
costs
of
free
services
and
consider
whether
other
models
can
suit
their
purposes
while
protecting
privacy
e
assumption
de
identification
aggregation
eliminates
privacy
risks
i
have
already
covered
the
difficulties
of
creating
truly
de
identified
and
anonymous
data
sets
above
and
others
have
done
the
same
task
much
more
skillfully
than
i
ever
could
n
in
privacy
as
in
life
there
are
no
silver
bullets
or
one
size
fits
all
solutions
de
identification
has
a
role
to
play
but
it
cannot
be
the
only
privacy
protection
in
place
f
assumption
more
data
is
always
better
the
benefits
of
big
data
are
so
tempting
that
it
can
be
easy
to
fall
into
this
trap
however
increasing
the
amount
of
data
held
also
increases
the
risks
discussed
above
recall
that
state
open
records
acts
may
require
disclosure
of
vast
swathes
of
city
held
records
which
will
only
grow
in
volume
as
smart
cities
hold
on
to
more
data
for
example
washington
state
s
law
requires
disclosure
of
all
records
except
for
six
specifically
enumerated
categories
greatly
increasing
the
risk
of
unintended
information
spillage
as
cities
like
seattle
collect
more
data
n
data
minimization
is
a
powerful
tool
to
avoid
these
risks
in
another
example
kansas
city
s
sensity
light
posts
process
all
of
their
visual
data
locally
in
the
lighting
unit
via
machine
learning
algorithm
that
can
determine
whether
to
take
action
without
a
human
ever
laying
eyes
on
the
video
feed
therefore
this
data
does
not
need
to
be
transmitted
or
stored
at
a
central
location
nor
does
it
even
need
to
be
recorded
g
mistake
forgetting
about
security
hopefully
with
the
rise
in
high
profile
attacks
and
data
breaches
this
mistake
is
becoming
less
common
but
even
when
organizations
attempt
to
address
security
it
is
notoriously
difficult
to
do
well
cities
also
need
to
ensure
that
their
vendors
and
other
third
parties
treat
their
data
with
an
appropriate
level
of
care
h
mistake
proceeding
without
transparency
or
public
engagement
as
this
essay
s
headlines
illustrate
privacy
or
lack
thereof
can
make
the
public
nervous
and
stories
about
privacy
abuses
can
go
viral
quickly
this
seems
to
be
a
lesson
that
governments
will
be
learning
for
as
long
as
governments
exist
but
transparency
and
public
engagement
are
the
best
way
to
avoid
a
bad
headline
they
also
make
for
better
governance
and
hopefully
better
privacy
protections
kansas
city
s
smart
city
advisory
board
is
a
model
of
transparency
in
this
respect
and
may
be
credited
with
the
quiet
and
quiescent
implementation
of
their
smart
city
plan
v
models
the
potential
benefits
of
smart
cities
are
too
great
to
let
a
privacy
fundamentalist
approach
prevent
their
implementation
instead
policy
makers
should
be
pragmatic
and
clear
eyed
about
the
privacy
and
discrimination
risks
many
policy
makers
are
already
thinking
about
these
risks
n
fortunately
there
is
a
great
deal
of
precedent
for
protecting
the
privacy
of
institutionally
and
government
held
data
while
delivering
benefits
to
consumers
and
citizens
a
seattle
s
privacy
vetting
process
while
seattle
has
had
its
share
of
run
ins
with
privacy
advocates
in
the
past
n
recent
efforts
demonstrate
a
strong
commitment
both
to
transparency
open
data
and
privacy
while
the
city
has
made
commitments
to
open
up
its
data
across
all
departments
n
it
has
also
implemented
an
extensive
privacy
intake
and
review
process
to
handle
this
data
n
the
program
is
pragmatic
it
recognizes
that
different
departments
have
varying
levels
of
sophistication
when
it
comes
to
privacy
and
therefore
utilizes
an
easily
understood
privacy
review
process
n
the
program
consists
of
a
series
of
straightforward
questions
many
of
them
yes
no
and
all
of
them
in
plain
english
to
walk
civil
servants
through
the
process
of
deciding
how
to
handle
city
data
n
the
city
created
a
chief
privacy
officer
that
can
work
across
departments
to
ensure
citywide
compliance
with
the
privacy
program
rather
than
being
confined
to
the
department
of
information
technology
n
it
also
designates
privacy
champions
within
individual
departments
to
help
inculcate
a
culture
of
privacy
within
the
bureaucracy
and
implement
programs
n
finally
the
city
conducted
an
extensive
privacy
impact
assessment
with
local
partners
at
the
university
of
washington
to
identify
weaknesses
in
its
programs
one
finding
of
the
assessment
was
that
vendor
contracts
were
often
weak
or
agnostic
on
privacy
protection
n
after
the
assessment
the
city
found
that
one
of
its
vendor
contracts
enabled
a
vendor
to
sell
the
traffic
location
data
from
bluetooth
and
wi
fi
sensors
on
secondary
markets
with
this
realization
the
city
was
able
to
successfully
renegotiate
its
contract
and
is
working
on
standard
terms
that
will
protect
privacy
cities
should
remember
that
have
tremendous
market
power
in
negotiating
contracts

employs
a
comprehensive
step
by
step
model
to
balance
privacy
risks
vs

utility
when
deciding
whether
to
disclose
city
data
while
perhaps
overly
complex
for
city
employees
unfamiliar
with
the
nuances
of

the

is
keenly
aware
of
the
privacy

discussed
in

the
health
insurance
portability
and
accountability
act
starts
with
the
assumption
of
confidentiality
and
privacy
and
only
deviates
from
that
norm
under
specific
enumerated
circumstances
n
in
addition
to

though
imperfect
n
requirements
for
de
identification
n
hipaa
s
privacy
rules
have
strong
proscriptions
against
using
patient
data
for
marketing
n
the
law
is
not
without
its
faults
of
course
but
emphasizes
patient
control
of
data
and
has
become
synonymous
with
strong
privacy
protection
while
allowing
for
salutary
uses
of
data
for
things
like
research
n
d
the
u
s
census
what
does
a
year
old
accounting
of
american
households
run
by
a
federal
bureaucracy
have
to
do
with
privacy
it
turns
out
quite
a
lot
when
it
involves
collecting
personal
information
on
every
single
american
or
at
least
trying
to
the
census
bureau
collects
vast
amounts
of
personal
information
on
americans
while
maintaining
strong
privacy
protections
related
to
disclosure
n
misuse
n
and
access
for
research
n
at
the
same
time
the
bureau
allows
the
data
subject
access
to
and
use
of
their
own
data

e
the
privacy
act
the
privacy
act
of
was
one
of
the
earliest
codifications
of
the
fair
information
practices
fips
it
protects
personal
information
held
by
the
federal
government
from
disclosure
n
the
interplay
between
the
privacy
act
and
the
freedom
of
information
act
foia
n
can
be
a
model
for
cities
struggling
to
balance
privacy
and
transparency
f
state
privacy
acts
state
privacy
acts
are
too
numerous
to
detail
here
but
the
laboratory
of
democracy
offers
a
myriad
of
ways
to
protect
citizen
privacy
in
publicly
held
data
conclusion
nothing
in
this
essay
should
be
taken
as
a
comprehensive
list
of
the
privacy
problems
and
solutions
facing
smart
cities
for
instance
the
fair
information
practices
or
fips
have
been
a
leading
example
of
strong
privacy
protections
when
organizations
actually
follow
them
and
the
federal
trade
commission
has
been
regulating
privacy
for
decades
the
us
has
other
well
developed
sector
specific
privacy
regimes
such
as
the
fair
credit
reporting
act
and
the
graham
leach
bliley
act
there
are
also
many
examples
to
draw
from
internationally
lest
we
assume
the
smart
cities
movement
is
confined
to
the
us
indeed
these
issues
are
too
vast
to
resolve
with
a
single
effort
they
will
require
collaboration
and
conversation
from
numerous
stakeholders
but
the
work
begins
by
acknowledging
the
problems
and
committing
to
address
them
early
on
protecting
privacy
is
well
within
the
power
of
policy
makers
who
are
aware
of
the
problems
and
committed
to
fixing
them
in
doing
so
they
have
an
opportunity
to
challenge
some
of
the
underlying
assumptions
and
longstanding
practices
that
pose
risks
in
the
first
place
hopefully
improving
privacy
as
a
whole
at
the
very
least
they
may
prevent
valuable
innovative
smart
city
projects
from
falling
victim
to
public
ire

nasty

analytics
as
a
business
discipline
has
existed
for
decades
its
application
and
acceptance
have
increased
recently
because
of
the
pace
and
scale
of
data
generation
the
increase
in
processing
speeds
rapidly
reducing
storage
costs
and
the
sophistication
of
enabling
tools
and
technology
these
advances
have
led
to
the
promise
of
better
business
decisions
informed
by
the
science
of
analytics
analytics
now
sits
at
the
top
of
the
business
agenda
for
many
leading
organizations
looking
for
new
ways
to
create
competitive
advantage
government
agencies
have
significant
volumes
of
data
and
more
often
than
not
there
is
little
no
dialogue
between
departments
the
insights
that
can
be
derived
out
of
tapping
into
the
collective
knowledge
of
various
departments
is
left
to
one
s
imagination
it
would
generate
outcomes
more
than
sum
of
its
parts
governments
can
harness
the
power
of
analytics
in
a
way
that
very
few
organizations
can
for
example
to
reduce
eliminate
financial
leakages
from
social
welfare
schemes
to
detect
the
most
crime
prone
areas
in
a
city
to
plug
revenue
leakage

fraudulent

and
expenditure

introduction
beginning

the
s
police
departments
in
major
american
cities
started
aggressively
deploying
pedestrian
stops
and
body
searches
in
response
to
escalating
violent
crime
rates

the
programmatic
deployment
of
stop
and
frisk
or

question
and

sqf
in
new

n
chicago
n
philadelphia
n
and
other
major
cities
n
involved
large
numbers
of
street
stops
and
frisks
often
concentrated
in
a
handful
of
minority
neighborhoods
given
the
volume
of
individuals
stopped
sqf
likely
became
the
modal
form
of
police
citizen
contact
for
many
urban
residents
n
between
may
and
august
for
example
police
in
chicago
stopped
more
than
people
which
translates
into
stops
per
inhabitants
n
in
philadelphia
police
have
stopped
between
and
people
per
year
since
n
in
baltimore
the
department
of
justice
estimates
roughly
people
were
stopped
in
n
at
its
peak
in
new
york
s
sqf
policy
generated
more
than
stops
per
year
n
between
and
that
city
s
inhabitants
experienced
roughly
five
million
street
stops
n
given
the
sheer
scale
of
these
intrusions
into
citizens
daily
lives
it
is
hardly
surprising
that
sqf
would
provoke
some
public
controversy
sharp
elbowed
debate
has
ensued
as
to
whether
african
americans
and
hispanics
are
being
inappropriately
stopped
and
searched
n
in
addition
to
catalyzing
a
wider
national
argument
about
race
and
policing
n
sqf
has
sparked
large
scale
public
protests
n
mayoral
campaigns
n
threats
to
sue
n
and
litigation
itself
in
the
wake
of
legal
challenges
settlements
or
consent
decrees
regulating
the
use
of
street
stops
have
been
reached
in
the
past
few
years
in
several
cities
in
the
last
year
or
so
new
york
n
chicago
n
philadelphia
n
cincinnati
n
new
orleans
n
seattle
n
baltimore
n
cleveland
n
and
newark
n
have
all
entered
into
either
a
judicial
decree
or
a
similar
form
of
settlement
process
two
cities
boston
and
oakland
did
not
wait
for
litigation
but
engaged
expert
consultants
in
both
cases
the
consultant
isolated
evidence
of
racial
discrimination
in
street
policing
n
the
debate
over
sqf
is
heated
in
part
because
of
disagreement
about
how
the
core
moral
wrong
of
intensive
street
policing
if
one
exists
should
be
conceived
the
law
provides
a
starting
point
for
this
inquiry
but
ultimately
not
a
satisfying
answer
the
legal
framework
employed
by
many
of
the
aforementioned
settlements
and
consent
decrees
is
modeled
on
a
body
of
black
letter
constitutional
doctrine
that
is
focused
centrally
on
the
motivations
and
beliefs
of
specific
individual
officers
for
example
in
new
york
the
case
of
floyd
v
city
of
new
york
which
has
yielded
the
only
extensive
judicial
decision
on
sqf
focused
first
on
the
supreme
court
s
decision
terry
v
ohio
n
which
held
that
officers
need
reasonable
articulable
suspicion
of
criminality
to
make
a
nonconsensual
street
stop
consistent
with
the
fourth
amendment
n
then
citing
the
supreme
court
s
decision
in
personnel
administrator
v
feeney
n
the
floyd
court
held
that
plaintiffs
had
to
show
that
sqf
not
only
had
a
racially
disparate
effect
but
had
been
adopted
at
least
in
part
because
of
not
merely
in
spite
of
its
adverse
effects
upon
certain
racial
groups
n
other
consent
decrees
and
settlements
are
also
crafted
in
the
shadow
of
terry
and
feeney
the
seattle
settlement
is
typical
in
commanding
that
the
police
department
adopt
a
street
stop
policy
that
explicitly
conforms
to
constitutional
requirements
that
officers
be
annually
trained
on
fourth
amendment
and
related
law
and
that
patrolling
police
act
free
of
unlawful
bias
n
similarly
the
philadelphia
settlement
condemns
stops
frisks
or
searches
made
without
the
requisite
reasonable
suspicion
and
envisages
policies
and
practices
to
ensure
that
stops
and
frisks
are
not
conducted
on
the
basis
of
the
race
or
ethnic
origin
of
the
suspect
except
where
the
law
permits
race
or
ethnic
origin
to
be
considered
n
this
individualist
black
letter
doctrine
means
that
even
absent
litigation
to
a
final
judgment
courts
and
legal
reform
efforts
have
to
use
a
relatively
narrow
lens
trained
solely
upon
discrete
interpersonal
transactions
similarly
the
dominant
economic
model
of
racial
bias
in
policing
focuses
on
the
identification
of
individual
officers
taste
based
discrimination
over
and
above
statistical
discrimination
n
this
article
argues
that
sqf
presents
a
normative
challenge
that
is
not
well
captured
by
the
individualistic
lens
of
terry
and
feeney
or
by
a
focus
on
taste
based
discrimination
as
a
more
general
matter
the
distinctive
moral
harm
of
sqf
does
not
turn
on
racial
animus
per
feeney
or
weak
evidentiary
predicates
per
terry
although
both
might
well
exist
and
even
be
pervasive
on
the
ground
this
harm
indeed
does
not
arise
within
the
narrow
individualist
transactional
frame
that
currently
dominates
both
law
and
economics
n
sqf
today
is
defined
by
its
large
scale
and
group
based
application
n
its
distinctive
moral
wrong
is
inextricably
related
to
this
programmatic
quality
not
the
happenstance
of
individual
officers
motives
n
the
core
of
this
wrong
is
structural
accordingly
the
welfarist
analysis
i
propose
in
part
i
is
focused
on
the
large
scale
programmatic
use
of
sqf
as
observed
in
new
york
chicago
and
philadelphia
in
contrast
i
have
no
cavil
with
the
retail
use
of
terry
stops
as
an
element
of
nonprogrammatic
street
policing
when
operationalized
at
a
large
scale
however
sqf
is
an
important
link
in
the
reproduction
of
social
and
racial
stratification
in
this
regard
it
typically
has
large
regressive
distributional
effects
and
surprisingly
little
value
added
as
a
crime
control
measure
more
specifically
sqf
should
be
understood
as
a
historically
situated
innovation
that
responds
to
late
twentieth
century
urban
pathologies
in
a
manner
that
predictably
perpetuates
those
criminogenic
pathologies
the
call
for
sqf
arose
in
important
measure
because
local
and
state
governments
had
engaged
in
policies
that
over
time
fostered
minority
neighborhoods
that
remain
entrenched
in
concentrated
poverty
and
suffer
from
high
violent
crime
rates
rather
than
addressing
those
underlying
conditions
local
and
state
policy
makers
have
chosen
to
respond
with
a
policy
that
has
stigmatizes
minority
residents
that
has
limited
crime
control
benefits
and
that
imposes
large
negative
spillovers
on
disadvantaged
neighborhoods
viewed
in
this
dynamic
perspective
sqf
catalyzes
an
entangled
set
of
individual
and
neighborhood
level
harms
through
mutually
reinforcing
interactions
these
various
harms
reinforce
the
social
and
racial
stratification
that
initially
set
the
stage
for
massive
street
policing
expenditures
without
a
clear
grasp
of
this
ecological
and
dynamic
context
current
remedial
interventions
are
likely
to
fall
short
or
to
go
astray
in
response
to
such
ecological
and
dynamic
dimensions
constitutional
law
is
now
disarmed
some
other
tool
is
needed
consistent
with
a
growing
body
of
scholarship
that
resists
the
narrow
transactional
frame
of
current
constitutional
doctrine
n
and
the
dominant
doctrinal
focus
on
individual
officials
fault
n
i
argue
that
our
current
doctrinal
models
for
capturing
the
harms
of
aggressive
policing
fall
woefully
short
instead
a
more
structural
and
capacious
legal
framework
is
needed
to
encapsulate
the
core
moral
objections
to
sqf
an
alternative
more
promising
legal
framework
is
a
version
of
the
disparate
impact
standard
familiar
from
the
employment
discrimination
n
and
fair
housing
contexts
n
a
disparate
impact
framework
is
better
able
to
account
for
the
evidentiary
problems
involved
in
accounting
for
the
diverse
forms
of
discrimination
manifested
in
a
complex
system
characterized
by
a
high
degree
of
diffused
discretion
n
to
be
clear
this
alternative
approach
is
by
no
means
perfect
it
does
not
provide
a
proxy
for
the
thorough
evaluation
of
both
costs
and
benefits
presented
in
this
article
rather
disparate
impact
isolates
a
subset
of
problematic
cases
in
which
sqf
s
heavy
burden
is
asymmetrically
assigned
to
minority
communities
it
demands
a
robust
justification
from
the
state
for
that
potentially
regressive
subordinating
and
demoralizing
situation
in
this
regard
it
is
better
placed
than
either
fourth
amendment
or
equal
protection
doctrine
to
resist
the
exacerbation
of
racial
hierarchies
n
no
theory
of
liability
however
will
be
a
comprehensive
panacea
to
a
complex
and
entrenched
social
phenomenon
like
concentrated
racialized
poverty
disparate
impact
liability
for
sqf
captures
the
instances
in
which
the
moral
wrong
of
sqf
is
at
its
acme
even
if
it
does
not
capture
all
instances
in
which
that
wrong
arises
it
helps
ensure
that
policing
responses
make
matters
no
worse
it
is
emphatically
only
a
piece
of
the
larger
mosaic
of
needful
policing
reform
that
ought
to
be
pursued
through
both
judicial
and
political
avenues
disparate
impact
liability
is
often
overlooked
because
it
has
not
been
part
of
equal
protection
doctrine
since
the
early
s
n
because
of
the
constitution
centered
focus
of
much
scholarship
it
is
easy
to
forget
it
is
available
but
a
disparate
impact
standard
is
available
under
both
federal
statutes
that
regulate
local
police
departments
n
and
also
in
california
n
and
illinois
n
state
law
n
the
chicago
settlement
and
the
new
orleans
settlement
invoke
some
of
these
disparate
impact
rules
as
guiding
authorizations
n
nevertheless
neither
elaborates
upon
their
bare
bone
textual
references
as
a
result
the
analytic
and
practical
advantages
of
a
disparate
impact
lens
for
police
remain
underappreciated
the
theoretical
questions
raised
by
its
translation
to
the
policing
context
also
remain
poorly
understood
my
final
aim
is
to
show
how
disparate
impact
can
serve
as
a
lens
for
analyzing
street
policing
in
practice
to
that
end
i
consider
how
disparate
racial
impacts
might
be
sifted
from
the
granular
policing
data
increasingly
being
collected
by
large
police
departments
as
a
result
of
settlements
and
consent
decrees
n
specifically
i
sketch
three
tractable
empirical
strategies
for
identifying
disparate
impact
in
street
stop
related
policies
first
deployment
related
disparities
between
beats
or
districts
within
a
jurisdiction
can
be
measured
to
ascertain
whether
a
municipality
s
overall
distribution
of
policing
resources
can
be
justified
on
race
neutral
grounds
n
second
within
a
given
beat
or
district
disparities
in
how
stops
are
allocated
among
different
ethnic
and
racial
groups
can
be
evaluated
n
finally
at
the
level
of
given
officers
disparities
in
the
quantum
of
suspicion
deployed
for
whites
and
nonwhites
can
be
assessed
by
using
a
range
of
empirical
tools
n
by
aggregating
and
contrasting
disparities
at
these
different
levels
the
empirical
approach
that
i
sketch
roughly
enables
a
better
understanding
of
the
causes
and
extent
of
sqf
s
disparate
impact
that
understanding
in
turn
can
serve
as
a
foundation
for
more
targeted
less
disruptive
and
more
effective
remedial
interventions
these
empirical
approaches
moreover
enable
disparate
impact
s
translation
to
the
policing
context
while
avoiding
the
constitutional
and
practical
problems
encountered
in
the
employment
discrimination
context
for
each
empirical
approach
posited
i
consider
the
range
of
legitimate
exculpatory
justifications
that
might
be
offered
to
diffuse
a
prima
facie
finding
of
racial
disparity
n
i
further
respond
to
weaknesses
made
apparent
by
disparate
impact
s
extant
operation
in
other
contexts
in
the
employment
discrimination
context
for
example
there
has
been
disagreement
about
how
to
identify
business
justifications
that
can
justify
racial
disparities
n
and
the
magnitude
of
ultimate
disparities
required
for
liability
n
the
use
of
disparate
impact
in
the
employment
context
has
also
generated
worries
about
the
doctrine
s
constitutionality
n
and
its
efficacy
in
promoting
structural
policy
change
n
in
translating
disparate
impact
to
the
policing
context
i
consider
and
reject
each
of
these
reasons
as
a
reason
for
abandoning
the
translation
the
possibility
of
disparate
impact
as
a
template
for
rethinking
urban
policing
has
yet
to
be
explored
in
any
detail
although
an
earlier
article
by
david
sklansky
and
colleagues
touches
on
the
question
n
but
my
analysis
aligns
with
penetrating
work
by
tracey
meares
jeffrey
fagan
and
amanda
geller
all
of
whom
correctly
emphasize
that
sqf
is
a
distinctive
mode
of
urban
policing
that
cannot
be
analyzed
in
terms
of
discrete
interactions
because
programmatic
stops
are
imposed
from
the
top
down
at
a
massive
scale
n
furthermore
i
echo
richard
banks
worry
about
the
potential
inadequacy
as
a
policy
framework
of
much
constitutional
doctrine
although
my
diagnosis
and
response
to
the
problem
of
race
in
policing
differ
from
his
approach
n
in
addition
my
analysis
diverges
sharply
from
the
large
literature
on
racial
profiling
n
which
more
narrowly
focuses
on
intentional
animus
or
the
purposive
use
of
race
as
a
criterion
in
enforcement
decisions
n
unlike
these
analyses
my
approach
does
not
focus
on
individual
fault
or
bad
intent
instead
i
argue
that
legal
intervention
should
be
organized
around
the
interaction
between
a
specific
kind
of
common
policing
strategy
and
larger
social
dynamics
of
racial
segmentation
and
stratification
n
the
argument
proceeds
in
three
steps
in
part
i
i
provide
a
comprehensive
empirically
robust
account
of
sqf
as
a
distinctive
modality
of
urban
policing
highlighting
the
dynamic
negative
effects
of
sqf
upon
minority
communities
in
concentrated
urban
poverty
part
ii
turns
to
the
constitutional
doctrine
developed
pursuant
to
the
fourth
amendment
and
the
equal
protection
clause
to
regulate
such
policing
using
terry
and
feeney
as
focal
points
i
demonstrate
that
constitutional
doctrine
systematically
fails
to
account
for
the
harms
that
flow
from
sqf
the
gap
reveals
inconsistencies
and
internal
contradictions
within
the
doctrine
having
rejected
the
default
framework
for
legal
analysis
of
sqf
i
sketch
in
part
iii
an
alternative
lens
of
disparate
impact
concluding
i
illustrate
three
empirical
strategies
that
might
be
used
to
determine
whether
remedial
intervention
is
warranted
in
so
doing
i
hope
to
show
that
disparate
impact
is
a
practicable
and
plausible
approach
for
use
by
courts
and
other
supervisory
and
regulatory
bodies
i
the
costs
and
benefits
of
stop
and
frisk
policing
to
evaluate
stop
and
frisk
as
a
way
of
eliciting
public
order
requires
an
understanding
of
its
costs
and
benefits
in
historical
and
social
context
this
part
therefore
begins
by
offering
a
definition
of
sqf
as
a
historically
situated
strategy
employed
by
urban
police
forces
it
then
develops
a
careful
tally
of
its
pros
and
cons
some
courts
have
analyzed
sqf
in
terms
of
costs
while
bracketing
its
benefits
n
i
disagree
with
this
approach
appreciation
of
the
distinctive
wrong
of
sqf
demands
a
comprehensive
understanding
of
related
justifications
criticisms
and
benefits
all
nested
in
an
ecological
and
dynamic
context
a
defining
stop
and
frisk
sqf
stop
question
and
frisk
or
sqf
is
an
urban
policing
measure
that
involves
the
large
scale
deployment
of
officers
in
public
spaces
e
g
sidewalks
alleys
the
communal
outdoor
spaces
of
public
housing
tasked
with
conducting
frequent
investigative
stops
under
a
line
of
cases
beginning
with
terry
v
ohio
n
an
officer
is
entitled
to
make
a
brief
nonconsensual
investigatory
stop
if
she
has
a
reasonable
articulable
suspicion
that
a
crime
either
has
occurred
or
is
about
to
occur
n
separately
if
the
officer
has
a
further
reasonable
articulable
suspicion
that
the
person
stopped
is
armed
and
presently
dangerous
to
the
officer
or
to
others
he
may
conduct
a
limited
protective
search
for
concealed
weapons
n
in
either
the
stop
or
the
frisk
context
reasonable
articulable
suspicion
is
a
less
demanding
standard
than
probable
cause
but
it
still
requires
a
minimal
level
of
objective
justification
n
in
addition
to
a
stop
and
a
frisk
officers
may
take
further
actions
ranging
from
a
verbal
caution
or
a
citation
to
an
arrest
arrests
vary
widely
in
character
they
can
be
discretionary
or
mandatory
n
they
may
be
based
on
conduct
or
evidence
discovered
by
the
officer
during
the
stop
or
they
might
be
predicated
on
an
outstanding
warrant
revealed
when
a
person
s
name
is
cross
referenced
with
state
local
or
federal
databases
the
jurisprudence
of
terry
stops
and
frisks
focuses
on
discrete
transactions
between
specific
officers
and
specific
defendants
but
this
is
misleading
n
sqf
as
i
have
defined
it
is
a
policy
that
operates
today
at
scale
not
tens
or
hundreds
of
individuals
but
tens
or
hundreds
of
thousands
are
arrested
over
the
course
of
months
in
new
york
for
example
there
were
documented
stops
in
and
stops
in
n
in
philadelphia
a
city
with
one
fifth
new
york
s
population
there
were
more
than
stops
each
of
the
last
three
years
despite
the
existence
of
a
court
supervised
consent
decree
n
the
analysis
in
this
section
is
focused
on
sqf
as
deployed
en
masse
sqf
has
similarities
to
and
can
overlap
somewhat
with
the
strategy
of
broken
windows
or
quality
of
life
policing
n
but
the
tactics
are
distinct
whereas
broken
windows
policing
relies
on
arrests
to
remove
undesirable
persons
from
a
neighborhood
n
sqf
can
involve
a
relatively
low
rate
of
arrests
n
sqf
tends
to
be
a
direct
response
to
violent
crime
it
is
not
a
prophylactic
response
to
the
possibility
that
the
sight
of
broken
windows
will
induce
escalating
forms
of
disorder
n
hence
criticisms
of
broken
windows
policing
cannot
be
translated
to
sqf
in
any
mechanical
fashion
one
more
detail
is
essential
to
my
functional
definition
of
sqf
within
a
city
sqf
is
typically
employed
with
greatest
intensity
on
a
small
subset
of
neighborhoods
n
typically
its
deployment
is
highest
in
neighborhoods
characterized
by
concentrated
poverty
where
crime
rates
tend
to
be
higher
than
in
other
parts
of
the
city
n
in
chicago
for
example
one
study
of
stops
in
found
stops
per
residents
in
the
african
american
neighborhood
of
englewood
but
stops
per
residents
in
the
white
neighborhood
of
lincoln
foster
n
in
particular
sqf
tends
to
be
concentrated
upon
minority
i
e
african
american
and
hispanic
neighborhoods
in
new
york
the
district
court
in
floyd
found
that
the
racial
composition
of
a
neighborhood
was
a
better
predictor
of
the
density
of
stops
than
its
lagged
crime
rate
n
and
at
the
height
of
new
york
s
sqf
an
african
american
resident
of
new
york
city
had
a
ninety
two
percent
chance
of
being
stopped
in
a
single
year
period
n
sqf
in
short
is
not
just
a
high
frequency
policing
strategy
it
is
also
a
highly
geographically
concentrated
one
in
minority
african
american
and
hispanic
neighborhoods
so
even
if
it
entails
a
low
rate
of
arrest
therefore
it
is
likely
that
sqf
at
least
contributes
to
the
exceedingly
high
rates
of
minority
arrests
in
the
jurisdictions
in
which
it
is
deployed
n
in
summary
sqf
is
best
understood
as
the
large
scale
use
of
terry
stops
in
predominantly
black
and
hispanic
urban
neighborhoods
in
response
to
violent
crime
its
architects
are
cognizant
of
and
indeed
embrace
this
racial
asymmetry
n
but
rather
than
dwelling
on
whether
their
views
should
be
ranked
as
invidious
discrimination
i
engage
in
a
more
consequentialist
inquiry
i
consider
the
gains
and
the
harms
from
sqf
these
i
contend
must
be
understood
in
light
of
geographic
and
historical
context
to
be
appreciated
properly
it
is
the
benefits
of
sqf
that
i
focus
upon
first
before
considering
costs
b
the
crime
control
benefits
of
sqf
in
context
the
case
for
sqf
aggressive
use
of
street
stops
at
a
high
volume
has
a
long
historical
pedigree
n
by
they
had
become
so
endemic
that
the
kerner
commission
established
by
president
johnson
to
investigate
the
urban
riots
singled
out
the
police
s
excessive
use
of
investigative
stops
n
and
the
wholesale
harassment
by
certain
elements
of
the
police
community
of
which
minority
groups
particularly
negros
frequently
complain
n
today
s
fires
are
residues
of
yesterday
s
conflagrations
sqf
in
its
modern
form
is
a
direct
response
to
an
uptick
of
violent
crime
in
the
s
collocated
with
what
william
julius
wilson
called
the
persistence
of
ghetto
poverty
n
the
political
sponsors
of
the
policy
consistently
identified
violent
crime
control
as
its
core
aim
n
because
violent
crime
is
disproportionately
committed
by
african
americans
and
concentrated
in
black
neighborhoods
they
argued
it
is
no
surprise
that
sqf
focuses
on
those
predominantly
minority
neighborhoods
n
rather
than
proof
of
anti
minority
animus
the
use
of
sqf
is
evidence
for
this
view
that
police
are
exerting
special
efforts
to
protect
minorities
from
crime
the
persuasive
force
of
this
argument
from
crime
control
is
the
subject
of
this
subpart
while
the
tally
of
sqf
s
costs
is
addressed
in
the
following
subpart
the
genesis
of
an
argument
for
sqf
s
crime
control
benefits
is
found
in
the
early
s
in
the
sociologist
james
q
wilson
published
an
influential
opinion
piece
in
the
new
york
times
entitled
just
take
away
their
guns
a
phrase
that
succinctly
encapsulated
the
distinctive
appeal
of
sqf
n
wilson
argued
for
the
aggressive
use
of
terry
stops
as
a
means
to
reduce
the
number
of
people
who
carry
guns
unlawfully
especially
in
places
on
streets
in
taverns
where
the
mere
presence
of
a
gun
can
increase
the
hazards
we
all
face
n
his
call
responded
directly
to
what
by
any
measure
was
a
grave
crisis
of
law
and
order
at
the
time
new
york
city
was
suffering
from
a
high
homicide
rate
n
of
the
murders
that
occurred
in
new
york
in
the
year
ending
as
wilson
wrote
more
than
were
committed
by
firearm
n
wilson
s
call
for
aggressive
street
policing
as
a
prophylaxis
for
gun
violence
found
a
measure
of
empirical
support
the
following
year
in
the
criminologist
lawrence
sherman
and
colleagues
published
the
results
of
a
quasi
experiment
conducted
for
twenty
nine
weeks
in
kansas
city
of
gun
based
intensive
street
policing
and
found
a
forty
nine
percent
decline
in
gun
crimes
without
any
spillover
to
neighboring
areas
n
results
of
this
kind
prompted
scores
of
cities
to
rush
to
follow
the
kansas
city
model
n
by
seizing
upon
sqf
as
a
tool
for
lowering
violent
crime
rates
the
earliest
adopter
of
sqf
new
york
city
seems
to
have
begun
aggressive
use
of
terry
stops
as
distinct
from
broken
windows
policing
around
a
parallel
aggressive
use
of
stops
in
philadelphia
came
to
public
attention
in
after
a
scandal
involving
hundreds
of
unlawful
arrests
searches
and
prosecutions
in
the
th
police
district
led
to
the
disclosure
of
incident
reports
showing
a
high
rate
of
illegal
stops
n
in
the
early
s
constitutional
litigation
over
chicago
s
gang
loitering
ordinance
in
part
hinged
on
the
stops
executed
under
that
measure
over
three
years
n
the
chicago
police
department
s
limited
collection
of
information
about
its
stops
and
frisks
meant
that
it
was
not
until
that
data
emerged
showing
that
the
city
s
sqf
intensity
had
exceeded
its
usage
patterns
of
the
s
and
incidentally
also
overshot
new
york
city
s
per
capita
stop
rates
n
crucially
the
policing
strategy
endorsed
by
wilson
and
implicitly
supported
by
the
kansas
city
evidence
does
not
lend
itself
to
uniform
application
across
entire
cities
violent
crime
in
urban
contexts
has
long
been
closely
correlated
with
a
subset
of
geographic
areas
typically
characterized
by
concentrated
poverty
n
in
turn
concentrated
urban
poverty
both
in
the
s
and
today
is
not
evenly
spread
across
racial
ethnic
groups
rather
it
is
a
disproportionately
minority
phenomenon
n
not
only
impoverished
african
americans
but
also
black
middle
class
cohorts
are
disproportionately
represented
in
extremely
poor
urban
neighborhoods
n
one
side
effect
of
this
is
that
urban
violent
crime
impacts
minority
groups
more
grievously
than
non
minority
groups
n
in
the
year
before
james
wilson
wrote
his
times
op
ed
the
african
american
homicide
victimization
rate
per
population
was
the
white
rate
was
n
from
the
perspective
of
its
political
sponsors
sqf
has
to
train
upon
african
american
and
hispanic
neighborhoods
not
because
of
some
theory
of
race
and
crime
but
because
that
is
where
the
murders
the
murders
of
minority
citizens
are
happening
n
if
american
cities
were
making
progress
toward
meaningful
racial
integration
this
nexus
between
policing
and
race
might
be
expected
to
have
waned
by
today
but
despite
increasing
ethnic
and
racial
diversity
within
cities
racial
segregation
endures
in
many
cities
n
indeed
as
many
american
cities
are
as
hypersegregated
today
as
they
were
in
n
the
experience
of
residential
segregation
moreover
has
remained
especially
stable
for
african
americans
regardless
of
class
nationally
the
proportion
of
african
american
areas
lacking
racial
diversity
has
remained
stubbornly
set
at
around
percent
throughout
the
s
n
even
relatively
advantaged
black
neighborhoods
continue
to
be
unique
in
the
degree
to
which
they
are
spatially
linked
with
communities
of
severe
concentrated
disadvantage
n
the
argument
in
favor
of
sqf
in
short
rests
on
its
ability
to
mitigate
the
costs
of
violent
crime
particularly
associated
with
urban
minority
dominated
neighborhoods
to
the
extent
that
areas
of
concentrated
poverty
persist
in
cities
and
to
the
extent
they
are
predominantly
black
or
hispanic
sqf
might
even
be
viewed
as
a
form
of
affirmative
action
it
is
a
positive
subsidy
to
impoverished
minority
communities
a
surplus
provision
of
the
public
good
of
policing
in
former
new
york
police
commissioner
ray
kelly
s
words
the
real
problem
with
urban
policing
is
then
that
african
americans
are
being
understopped
in
light
of
the
violent
crime
experienced
by
black
communities
n
the
difficulties
of
sqf
as
violent
crime
control
the
benefits
of
sqf
however
are
more
qualified
than
its
advocates
suggest
i
analyze
here
how
those
benefits
are
properly
characterized
before
turning
to
the
policy
s
costs
focusing
solely
upon
sqf
s
suppression
of
violent
crime
there
are
both
reasons
for
skepticism
of
the
magnitude
of
the
ensuing
welfare
gain
and
grounds
for
treating
such
benefits
as
morally
problematic
these
concerns
i
stress
bear
on
sqf
s
efficacy
not
the
moral
urgency
of
addressing
the
hecatomb
of
contemporary
urban
homicide
in
cities
such
as
chicago
today
if
there
is
no
convincing
evidence
that
sqf
in
fact
meaningfully
improves
policing
outcome
and
if
there
is
also
evidence
that
it
has
substantial
deleterious
effects
then
it
should
be
considered
a
moral
wrong
in
the
same
class
as
employment
discrimination
or
housing
segregation
moreover
evidence
that
sqf
imposes
concentrated
costs
on
minority
populations
without
remotely
commensurate
benefits
points
toward
the
need
for
a
distinct
programmatic
remedy
such
as
disparate
impact
liability
i
highlight
four
interrelated
grounds
for
concern
first
the
evidence
for
an
absolute
crime
control
effect
from
sqf
is
surprisingly
fragile
second
the
evidence
of
a
marginal
effect
from
sqf
in
comparison
to
other
methods
is
nonexistent
what
evidence
exists
suggests
many
of
the
crime
control
benefits
of
sqf
might
be
obtained
without
its
aggregate
racially
disparate
aspect
third
and
relatedly
the
claim
that
sqf
disproportionately
benefits
african
americans
rests
on
complex
and
controversial
assumptions
finally
even
assuming
firm
evidence
of
large
crime
control
gains
from
sqf
there
is
a
normative
objection
to
the
state
taking
credit
for
those
benefits
when
the
governmental
entities
responsible
for
sqf
also
contributed
to
minority
segregation
into
neighborhoods
of
concentrated
poverty
first
notwithstanding
sherman
s
kansas
city
study
it
is
very
difficult
to
connect
sqf
to
any
crime
reduction
n
two
subsequent
efforts
at
replicating
the
former
study
in
indianapolis
and
pittsburgh
have
produced
ambivalent
results
n
the
indianapolis
study
for
example
found
that
homicide
rates
decreased
in
one
of
two
treatment
areas
but
remained
unchanged
in
the
other
n
its
authors
concluded
that
the
present
state
of
knowledge
does
not
allow
us
to
answer
the
theoretical
questions
of
what
produced
the
effects
observed
in
kansas
city
n
a
meta
analysis
of
six
policing
experiments
involving
increased
police
patrols
in
north
and
south
america
reexamined
the
pittsburgh
data
this
data
found
that
while
the
earlier
studies
had
found
a
statistically
significant
reduction
in
gun
violence
alternative
specifications
strongly
suggest
the
estimated
drop
in
shots
fired
incidents
was
due
at
least
in
part
to
a
preintervention
trend
a
seasonal
pattern
or
chance
n
nevertheless
the
authors
of
the
meta
study
found
themselves
ultimately
generally
favorable
to
the
method
pioneered
in
kansas
city
even
as
they
raised
substantial
concern
as
to
whether
sherman
s
experiment
could
be
scaled
up
beyond
the
level
of
small
neighborhoods
n
in
an
operational
context
sqf
fares
less
well
rigorous
empirical
studies
of
sqf
s
post
deployment
are
rare
existing
results
though
provide
sparse
support
for
its
crime
control
effects

study
of
the
effects
of
sqf
on
burglary
and
robbery
rates
in
new
york
between
and
found
few
significant
effects
n
another
quantitative
study
of
new
york
found
that
the
number
of
shooting
incidents
was
virtually
unchanged
during
the
years
in
which
stops
and
frisks
grew
at
an
extraordinary
rate
suggesting
that
it
was
extremely
unlikely
that
these
stops
could
have
reduced
the
homicide
rate

reducing
gun
ownership
or

the
most
detailed
and
comprehensive
study
of
overall
trends
in
recent
crime
rates
in
new
york
by
franklin
zimring
also
concluded
that
in
the
new
york
city
context
there
is
no
way
to
separately
measure
the
value
added
by
aggressive
intervention
in
new
york
city
n
a
leading
criminologist
and
the
paramount
expect
on
new
york
policing
zimring
has
seemed
of
two
minds
about
street
policing
in
general
on
the
one
hand
he
has
identified
aggressive
measures
such
as
hot
spot
policing
the
elimination
of
open
air
drug
markets
and
firearm
reduction
as
probably
successful
n
on
the
other
hand
he
has
been
much
more
confident
that
data
driven
crime
mapping
and
patrol
strategy
management
and
the
hiring
of
police
officers
did
likely
have
large
and
negative
effects
on
crime
rates
n
at
the
very
best
zimring
s
evidence
leaves
open
the
possibility
that
sqf
had
some
role
to
play
in
crime
reduction
it
casts
little
light
on
the
magnitude
of
that
role
and
it
has
little
to
say
about
whether
the
same
gains
in
public
order
might
have
been
achieved
through
alternate
means
another
potential
means
of
examining
sqf
s
impact
is
to
examine
the
aftermath
of
the
policy
s
unexpected
discontinuance
but
there
has
also
been
no
detailed
study
of
what
happened
after
the
new
york
city
police
department
reduced
the
number
of
stops
dramatically
in
in
the
three
years
after
that
decline
began
however
murder
rates
have
remained
essentially
flat
n
in
chicago
a
different
and
more
complicated
story
prevails
a
sharp
rise
in
murder
and
decline
in
arrests
followed
the
november
release
of
long
suppressed
video
footage
of
a
fatal
police
shooting
that
provoked
sharp
public
outcry
against
the
chicago
police
department
n
immediately
thereafter
in
january
changes
to
how
stops
and
frisks
are
recorded
but
no
change
to
operational
policy
went
into
effect
n
given
that
the
highly
critical
public
reaction
to
the
video
likely
had
a
significant
effect
on
multiple
aspects
of
police
morale
and
hence
police
behavior
it
is
hard
to
disentangle
any
discrete
effect
from
changes
in
sqf
policy
from
changes
due
to
the
critical
public
reaction
to
the
demoralizing
release
of
evidence
of
unlawful
police
violence
those
who
rush
to
judgment
or
seek
to
cast
blame
based
on
the
chicago
or
new
york
data
trends
may
well
be
ensnared
unwittingly
in
a
species
of
motivated
reasoning
the
empirical
case
for
a
crime
control
benefit
from
sqf
in
short
does
not
stand
on
strong
foundations
n
while
there
is
some
empirical
support
for
an
effect
from
sqf
in
small
scale
experiments
there
is
no
existing
evidence
that
this
effect
can
be
replicated
at
a
citywide
level
n
the
weakness
of
its
evidentiary
predicate
contrasts
with
firmer
evidentiary
basis
for
other
kinds
of
reform
including
the
deployment
of
more
officers
and
the
use
of
more
data
driven
approaches
more
than
forty
years
after
wilson
s
initial
intervention
therefore
sqf
remains
largely
predicated
on
a
mere
prediction
about
the
effect
of
intensive
street
stops
on
violent
crime
levels
second
econometric
studies
of
sqf
s
effect
on
crime
of
the
kind
discussed
above
aim
to
isolate
the
marginal
effect
of
the
policy
after
controlling
for
all
other
relevant
variables
in
effect
they
strive
to
hold
all
else
constant
and
then
search
for
an
effect
of
sqf
on
crime
rates
but
the
assumption
that
all
else
remains
constant
is
an
obvious
artifice
a
police
force
that
foregoes
sqf
is
likely
to
employ
an
alternative
policing
strategy
that
does
not
involve
nonconsensual
interventions
or
facially
racial
disparities
in
treatment
the
marginal
negative
effect
on
crime
control
of
shifting
from
sqf
to
an
alternative
modality
of
policing
is
likely
to
be
smaller
than
the
absolute
effect
of
simply
foregoing
sqf
entirely
a
police
force
that
chooses
to
forego
sqf
can
redeploy
the
substantial
personnel
resources
that
it
occupies
for
other
tactical
uses
there
are
moreover
other
modalities
of
policing
that
are
positively
associated
with
crime
control
in
rigorous
empirical
studies
consider
for
example
the
empirical
literature
on
hot
spot
policing
a
technique
that
has
some
parallels
with
sqf
but
that
can
also
be
distinguished
from
it
hot
spot
policing
involves
the
application
of
police
interventions
at
very
small
geographic
units
of
analysis
n
a
range
of
studies
and
meta
studies
suggests
that
the
highly
localized
deployment
of
officers
has
a
meaningful
and
statistically
significant
effect
on
crime
rates
n
hot
spot
policing
and
sqf
have
some
similarities
but
their
differences
are
critical
to
begin
there
is
a
question
of
scale
i
have
already
stressed
more
than
once
that
sqf
as
i
use
the
term
involves
tens
or
hundreds
of
thousands
of
arrests
hot
spot
policing
does
not
require
similarly
massive
deployments
the
one
study
of
an
existing
sqf
policy
to
consider
the
question
concluded
that
deployments
tended
to
occur
across
areas
that
were
too
large
to
be
characterized
as
hot
spots
as
that
term
is
technically
used
n
even
if
the
distinction
in
scale
between
sqf
and
hot
spot
policing
is
hard
to
quantify
in
practice
it
seems
easy
enough
to
draw
n
moreover
hot
spot
policing
does
not
require
stops
let
alone
frisks
or
arrests
to
be
effective
there
is
instead
evidence
that
increased
police
presence
alone
dampens
crime
rates
and
the
strongest
impact
is
associated
with
situational
prevention
strategies
that
disrupt
situational
dynamics
that
allow
crime
to
occur
for
example
by
razing
abandoned
buildings
n
one
study
of
street
stops
at
microgeographic
hot
spots
examined
in
one
week
increments
in
new
york
generated
reductions
in
crime
but
cautioned
that
evidence
suggests
that
crime
prevention
can
be
achieved
without
resorting
to
an
unrestricted
sqf
policy
n
in
this
new
york
data
moreover
sqf
was
pursued
at
the
expense
of
other
strategies
leaving
open
questions
about
the
potential
of
other
policing
strategies
n
hot
spot
policing
plainly
requires
a
nontrivial
number
of
officers
so
it
is
important
to
emphasize
that
my
argument
here
solely
concerns
the
style
of
policing
not
the
sheer
volume
of
officers
deployed
n
and
increasing
stops
or
arrests
do
not
appear
to
be
a
necessary
component
of
hot
spot
policing
to
the
contrary
in
one
leading
study
the
authors
noted
approvingly
that
officers
in
the
treatment
condition
i
e
engaged
in
hot
spot
policing
were
not
evaluated
on
their
stop
count
but
rather
were
held
accountable
for
reducing
citizen
calls
for
service
and
for
ameliorating
social
and
physical
incivilities
in
targeted
hot
spot
areas
n
a
recent
meta
analysis
of
nineteen
studies
of
hot
spot
policing
separately
examined
the
effects
of
two
distinct
versions
of
that
policy
that
involved
either
increasing
the
volume
of
traditional
policing
or
using
a
problem
solving
approach
n
three
of
the
ten
existing
studies
of
the
traditional
policing
model
found
small
positive
effects
on
crime
reduction
n
but
the
overall
mean
effect
size
of
problem
oriented
hot
spot
policing
was
twice
the
effect
size
of
the
traditional
policing
model
n
it
would
seem
that
the
decision
to
simply
increase
traditional
policing
activities
at
hot
spots
is
dominated
in
practice
by
problem
solving
measures
the
contrast
between
sqf
and
hot
spot
policing
usefully
underscores
a
more
general
point
policing
is
not
a
single
undifferentiated
public
good
rather
policing
is
mutative
and
takes
several
forms
it
can
entail
the
pursuit
of
diverse
ends
of
crime
control
order
maintenance
and
social
provision
with
divergent
tools
n
police
forces
now
engaged
in
sqf
have
at
other
times
employed
other
quite
different
approaches
which
focus
instead
on
service
provision
n
community
relations
n
or
prophylactic
street
policing
some
of
these
policies
aim
to
reduce
crime
others
such
as
community
policing
seek
to
build
a
reservoir
of
public
support
to
tap
in
moments
of
strain
n
these
different
services
can
be
bundled
in
different
ways
in
at
least
some
of
the
jurisdictions
in
which
sqf
is
employed
neighborhoods
subject
to
aggressive
street
policing
do
not
necessarily
receive
high
levels
of
other
policing
services
n
indeed
racial
segregation
at
the
municipal
level
is
systematically
correlated
to
depressed
levels
of
public
service
provision
n
in
chicago
for
example
african
american
and
hispanic
neighborhoods
are
subject
to
sqf
on
the
one
hand
but
on
the
other
hand
experience
substantially
longer
delays
than
non
minority
neighborhoods
when
seeking
police
aid
via
calls
n
policing
is
thus
both
under
supplied
and
over
provided
simultaneously
defenders
of
sqf
therefore
mislead
when
they
equate
sqf
with
a
police
force
focusing
its
resources
where
people
most
need
protection
n
rather
it
is
both
possible
and
in
fact
often
seems
to
be
the
case
that
sqf
is
accompanied
by
serious
deficiencies
in
respect
to
other
elements
of
the
bundle
of
police
services
estimation
of
the
margin
costs
of
ending
sqf
must
as
a
result
account
for
the
possibility
of
variance
across
these
other
elements
of
the
police
function
third
the
assumption
of
sqf
s
advocates
particularly
in
new
york
has
been
that
its
benefits
accrue
to
the
minority
residents
of
high
crime
neighborhoods
more
than
they
accrue
to
residents
of
low
crime
neighborhoods
n
implicitly
these
advocates
are
drawing
a
comparison
between
sqf
and
affirmative
action
both
they
suggest
are
policies
that
disproportionately
benefit
african
american
and
hispanic
minorities
but
consider
another
possibility
since
the
s
the
fear
of
crime
has
been
a
concern
that
has
powerfully
mobilized
white
electorates
n
it
may
be
that
among
the
gains
of
sqf
is
a
reduction
in
the
fear
of
crime
n
and
that
this
gain
is
diffused
among
the
wider
urban
population
the
latter
of
course
is
typically
much
larger
than
the
urban
subpopulation
subject
to
sqf
even
assuming
there
is
a
substantial
marginal
crime
control
gain
in
substituting
sqf
for
the
next
best
policy
n
it
is
necessarily
the
case
that
whereas
the
predominantly
minority
residents
of
impoverished
neighborhoods
experience
both
costs
and
benefits
the
predominantly
white
non
residents
of
other
neighborhoods
experience
only
benefits
albeit
in
expectation
at
a
much
lower
rate
there
are
also
likely
to
be
many
more
white
non
residents
of
targeted
areas
than
minority
non
residents
the
former
group
benefits
from
being
able
to
access
more
of
the
city
as
well
as
from
a
more
general
reduction
in
their
fear
of
crime
n
depending
on
the
magnitude
of
these
various
costs
and
benefits
for
different
racial
groups
it
is
at
least
possible
that
the
adoption
of
sqf
might
create
larger
net
benefits
for
the
class
of
white
nonresidents
as
a
whole
than
for
the
class
of
minority
residents
of
highly
policed
neighborhoods
in
a
manner
that
is
racially
regressive
even
without
accounting
for
the
potential
costs
of
sqf
n
the
claim
that
sqf
disproportionately
benefits
minorities
is
an
important
part
of
the
moral
case
in
favor
of
the
policy
closer
examination
of
the
assumptions
underlying
the
claim
however
uncovers
its
contingency
it
is
hardly
clear
that
again
even
bracketing
the
costs
of
sqf
it
is
true
that
a
disproportionate
share
of
the
social
benefits
of
sqf
run
to
minority
communities
much
depends
on
the
welfare
effects
from
crime
reductions
and
from
mitigation
of
crime
related
fears
fourth
the
final
reason
for
skepticism
of
the
positive
case
for
sqf
based
on
its
crime
control
effects
is
not
based
on
empirical
data
or
calculations
of
its
welfare
related
consequences
rather
it
is
moral
in
nature
and
depends
on
a
distinctive
and
controversial
moral
logic
the
idea
that
no
one
shall
be
permitted
to
profit
by
his
own
fraud
or
to
take
advantage
of
his
own
wrong
or
to
found
any
claim
upon
his
own
iniquity
or
to
acquire
property
by
his
own
crime
n
applying
that
concededly
raw
intuition
to
the
case
of
sqf
reveals
the
following
line
of
argument
the
problem
of
violent
crime
to
which
sqf
responds
flows
from
the
existence
of
neighborhoods
of
concentrated
and
racialized
poverty
although
there
are
many
forces
molding
the
latter
governmental
actors
at
the
state
and
local
level
have
a
large
share
of
responsibility
those
same
governmental
bodies
if
not
the
exact
same
individual
politicians
also
resorted
to
sqf
n
but
having
exposed
minority
communities
to
the
harm
of
high
violent
crime
rates
governmental
bodies
cannot
then
take
advantage
of
this
wrong
to
seek
a
measure
of
legal
and
policy
leeway
that
they
otherwise
would
not
have
at
a
minimum
they
should
elect
the
policing
strategy
that
imposes
the
minimum
burden
on
minority
communities
that
as
a
result
of
persisting
state
policy
have
been
subjected
to
concentrated
poverty
and
high
crime
rates
policing
that
is
should
be
subject
to
a
hippocratic
constraint
the
threshold
premise
of
this
argument
that
states
and
localities
bear
a
measure
of
responsibility
for
concentrated
minority
poverty
has
substantial
support
in
the
historical
and
empirical
literature
to
be
sure
macrostructural
forces
such
as
the
deindustrialization
of
central
cities
and
the
exit
of
some
middle
class
and
wealthy
african
americans
have
driven
the
growth
of
concentrated
racialized
poverty
n
but
these
forces
have
been
magnified
by
deliberate
policy
decisions
to
concentrate
minorities
and
the
poor
in
public
housing
n
in
chicago
for
example
alderman
and
the
mayor
thwarted
efforts
from
the
s
onward
to
disperse
african
americans
outside
traditionally
black
neighborhoods
n
across
the
country
zoning
restrictions
and
permitting
requirements
have
been
extensively
deployed
to
perpetuate
racially
exclusionary
residential
patterns
n
the
implications
of
state
involvement
in
the
creation
of
concentrated
racialized
poverty
turn
on
the
sort
of
moral
fault
one
attributes
to
a
collective
entity
such
as
a
municipality
the
precise
mix
of
state
action
and
private
actions
responsible
for
residential
segregation
and
the
extent
to
which
any
historical
responsibility
is
mitigated
by
the
passage
of
time
and
the
burdens
that
remediation
would
impose
on
innocent
third
parties
n
i
do
not
aim
to
resolve
that
complex
suite
of
questions
here
rather
my
more
limited
claim
is
that
a
city
s
claims
on
behalf
of
sqf
must
at
a
minimum
be
contextualized
by
its
general
historical
responsibility
for
the
burdens
imposed
by
concentrated
poverty
particularly
on
the
racial
minorities
whose
efforts
to
move
beyond
that
condition
in
search
of
employment
and
educational
opportunities
have
so
often
been
thwarted
n
at
an
absolute
minimum
it
would
seem
appropriate
to
demand
a
heightened
burden
of
proof
for
claims
about
the
benefits
of
disparate
crime
control
measures
tendered
by
the
very
entity
responsible
for
racial
segregation
stated
in
brief
then
my
fourth
point
is
that
the
institutional
author
of
racial
segregation
should
do
no
further
harm
to
minorities
when
it
addresses
the
costs
of
such
segregation
having
created
the
problem
that
sqf
is
intended
to
address
municipalities
have
no
entitlement
to
a
benefit
of
empirical
doubt
more
ambitiously
cities
partial
culpability
for
the
underlying
condition
of
concentrated
poverty
might
justify
a
demand
for
special
efforts
to
ensure
that
no
policy
response
to
crime
imposes
a
disproportionate
share
of
costs
on
the
legatees
of
historical
discrimination
or
that
denies
them
a
disproportionate
share
of
its
benefits
to
summarize
then
this
section
has
examined
the
crime
control
benefits
of
sqf
the
evidence
for
those
is
surprisingly
fragile
the
case
for
thinking
sqf
has
marginal
benefits
in
comparison
to
a
next
best
policy
option
such
as
hot
spot
policing
is
even
shakier
accounting
for
sqf
s
more
diffuse
effect
on
the
fear
of
crime
moreover
suggests
that
defenses
of
sqf
as
a
form
of
affirmative
action
may
well
fail
finally
an
analysis
based
on
the
state
s
historical
responsibilities
for
the
underlying
conditions
that
motivate
sqf
suggests
a
need
to
view
the
state
s
celebration
of
the
policy
s
benefits
with
a
measure
of
skepticism
c
the
ecological
and
dynamic
costs
of
sqf
this
section
turns
from
sqf
s
putative
benefits
to
its
costs
in
my
view
sqf
has
an
intertwined
set
of
individual
and
collective
costs
that
largely
but
not
exclusively
sound
in
an
equality
related
rather
than
a
fourth
amendment
register
my
starting
assumption
is
that
sqf
s
costs
no
less
than
its
benefits
cannot
be
properly
understood
or
evaluated
once
they
are
detached
from
the
historical
origins
of
concentrated
poverty
nor
can
they
be
evaluated
without
thinking
carefully
about
the
ways
in
which
sqf
might
perpetuate
the
underlying
conditions
of
social
and
racial
stratification
into
concentrated
poverty
in
short
rather
than
analyzing
racial
discrimination
as
a
single
point
outcome
i
embrace
here
the
dominant
emphasis
in
recent
sociological
scholarship
on
modeling
discrimination
as
a
process
n
i
identify
eight
pathways
by
which
sqf
can
impose
harms
on
individuals
and
communities
defined
by
race
i
began
the
analysis
of
costs
by
focusing
on
the
immediate
encounter
between
police
and
an
individual
having
documented
costs
in
that
proximate
context
i
then
widen
my
lens
to
capture
a
diverse
array
of
adverse
spillovers
from
that
immediate
encounter
not
only
to
the
individual
but
also
for
his
or
her
social
network
and
for
racial
minorities
his
or
her
larger
racial
cohort
the
latter
effects
of
sqf
it
should
be
noted
diffuse
through
social
networks
and
families
n
several
critically
depend
upon
vicious
cycles
or
positive
feedback
mechanisms
that
entangle
individual
and
neighborhood
level
effects
n
often
with
regressive
distributive
consequences
more
generally
it
is
plausible
to
view
all
eight
causal
pathways
as
intertwined
and
to
an
extent
mutually
reinforcing
first
the
supreme
court
in
terry
recognized
that
even
brief
stops
and
frisks
have
immediate
and
substantial
costs
chief
justice
warren
described
even
a
temporary
police
stop
as
a
serious
intrusion
upon
the
sanctity
of
the
person
which
may
inflict
great
indignity
and
arouse
strong
resentment
and
it
is
not
to
be
undertaken
lightly
n
in
subsequent
cases
however
the
court
has
tended
to
downplay
the
immediate
psychological
and
dignitary
costs
of
being
stopped
n
but
ethnographic
data
and
qualitative
studies
demonstrate
that
chief
justice
warren
s
initial
intuition
was
correct
the
immediate
toll
of
a
nonconsensual
police
intrusion
even
absent
physical
content
or
formal
consequence
is
substantial
perhaps
the
best
evidence
derives
from
a
recent
survey
of
young
men
in
new
york
conducted
by
amanda
geller
and
colleagues
the
latter
found
that
contact
with
the
police
primarily
in
the
form
of
terry
stops
was
consistently
associated
with
persisting
stigma
trauma
anxiety
and
depressive
symptoms
n
on
reflection
it
should
be
no
surprise
that
these
effects
flow
from
a
terry
stop
the
latter
is
an
unexpected
encounter
with
heavily
armed
police
typically
characterized
by
a
sense
of
utter
helplessness
and
a
sharp
fear
of
violence
and
deadly
force
n
this
fear
may
be
amplified
by
a
worry
of
more
prolonged
detention
a
real
concern
in
a
jurisdiction
where
police
have
arrest
quotas
to
fill
n
this
psychological
toll
is
not
immediately
visible
it
may
be
shameful
even
to
confess
these
are
perhaps
the
least
troubling
explanations
for
why
such
costs
have
largely
fallen
out
of
judicial
accounts
of
sqf
second
a
different
racial
asymmetry
afflicts
judicial
consideration
of
the
risks
of
bodily
harm
attendant
on
a
terry
stop
on
the
one
hand
the
court
has
punctiliously
attended
to
the
risk
of
bodily
harm
to
officers
during
a
stop
n
on
the
other
hand
the
court
has
been
largely
silent
about
the
possibility
that
terry
stops
expose
the
individual
subject
to
police
attention
to
a
substantial
risk
of
physical
violence
n
nor
has
it
accounted
for
the
possibility
that
these
risks
will
be
positively
correlated
with
minority
status
recent
empirical
work
by
roland
fryer
using
the
terry
stop
related
records
of
new
york
s
police
found
large
racial
differences
in
police
use
of
non
lethal
force
including
slapping
grabbing
and
pushing
individuals
into
a
wall
or
onto
the
ground
n
even
assuming
perfectly
compliant
behavior
african
americans
were
twenty
one
percent
more
likely
to
experience
force
than
whites
n
in
chicago
wesley
skogan
has
found
higher
rates
of
nonlethal
force
in
the
context
of
stops
of
blacks
than
in
white
citizen
stops
n
given
such
large
racial
differentials
in
the
use
of
force
it
would
hardly
be
surprising
if
a
large
proportion
of
the
innocent
minority
residents
of
high
crime
neighborhood
who
are
stopped
and
frisked
objected
to
aggressive
sqf
even
if
it
had
public
safety
benefits
that
diffused
to
their
benefit
n
third
the
effects
of
terry
stops
on
the
individuals
subjected
to
police
attention
do
not
expire
when
their
participants
are
released
from
police
control
rather
negative
experiences
with
the
police
breed
cynicism
about
the
law
n
an
unwillingness
to
invoke
the
police
s
aid
and
a
diminished
proclivity
to
comply
with
the
law
or
cooperate
with
legal
authorities
the
connections
between
negative
police
treatment
and
strongly
aversive
views
of
the
police
are
empirically
well
grounded
albeit
not
in
contexts
where
sqf
has
been
implemented
n
but
studies
from
the
specific
cities
where
sfq
is
employed
demonstrate
vividly
that
intensive
street
policing
has
lingering
effects
on
the
dispositions
and
upon
the
beliefs
of
any
population
routinely
subject
to
its
rigors
for
instance
a
recent
qualitative
study
of
young
men
living
in
three
high
crime
neighborhoods
in
philadelphia
found
that
less
than
ten
percent
were
willing
to
call
the
police
in
any
circumstance
in
part
because
many
had
themselves
had
negative
experiences
with
the
police
in
the
past
n
tellingly
the
same
study
also
found
resentment
directed
at
police
because
of
their
failure
to
respond
to
calls
in
a
timely
fashion
n
police
that
is
are
not
seen
reflexively
in
a
negative
light
it
is
their
intrusive
and
disrespectful
behavior
toward
minority
citizens
in
particular
coupled
with
their
failure
to
provide
non
coercive
public
safety
that
elicits
negative
perceptions
of
the
badge
this
study
however
focused
on
negative
experiences
of
police
rather
than
the
mere
fact
of
being
stopped
although
the
philadelphia
study
suggests
that
young
men
in
particular
perceive
police
contact
generally
as
negative
it
does
not
test
for
different
effects
of
any
police
contact
n
in
contrast
a
recent
study
in
new
york
examining
young
subjects
specifically
in
areas
affected
by
sqf
found
that
increasing
experience
of
stops
whether
negative
or
positive
experiences
diminished
perceptions
of
police
legitimacy
n
another
study
in
chicago
has
found
not
only
that
african
americans
have
strikingly
lower
levels
of
trust
in
police
but
those
caught
up
in
enforcement
and
investigative
stops
were
less
trusting
of
police
by
almost
forty
five
percent
n
a
larger
body
of
empirical
findings
from
the
united
states
and
beyond
demonstrates
that
diminished
police
legitimacy
is
associated
with
a
diminished
disposition
to
follow
the
law
and
a
lesser
willingness
to
cooperate
with
police
n
relatedly
a
high
volume
of
stops
concentrated
in
a
specific
geographically
locale
can
create
a
vicious
circle
feedback
loop
that
flows
from
individual
legal
cynicism
to
increased
collective
victimization
and
then
back
again
when
police
are
perceived
as
endorsing
excessive
force
against
racial
minorities
members
of
that
minority
population
tend
to
become
more
reluctant
to
seek
police
aid
in
a
time
series
study
of
how
highly
publicized
incidents
of
police
violence
in
milwaukee
influenced
the
use
of
matthew
desmond
andrew
papachristos
and
david
kirk
found
that
such
incidents
have
a
clear
and
significant
negative
impact
on
citizen
crime
reporting
n
other
studies
have
found
that
when
sqf
is
perceived
as
being
distributed
on
racial
grounds
perhaps
because
african
americans
and
hispanics
are
in
fact
at
a
much
greater
per
capita
risk
of
being
stopped
than
whites
n
cynicism
about
the
law
and
police
is
likely
to
be
sharpened
within
minority
communities
at
the
margin
violations
of
the
law
become
more
frequent
n
as
the
expected
risk
of
being
victimized
rises
therefore
residents
of
heavily
policed
areas
become
less
willing
to
proactively
reach
out
to
police
this
further
lowers
the
expected
cost
of
criminality
rather
than
alleviating
it
as
sqf
s
advocates
hoped
n
more
crime
in
turn
leads
to
more
aggressive
sqf
which
starts
the
cycle
anew
a
version
of
one
element
of
this
dynamic
has
been
termed
the
ferguson
effect
this
rather
loaded
term
captures
the
possibility
that
high
visibility
instances
of
police
misconduct
lead
to
increases
in
crime
because
of
reduced
confidence
in
police
or
because
of
increased
risk
averseness
on
police
s
part
evidence
for
a
broad
ferguson
effect
however
is
weak
and
is
confined
to
certain
crimes
in
certain
cities
n
if
further
evidence
were
to
emerge
of
such
an
effect
it
would
nevertheless
strengthen
the
vicious
circle
argument
developed
in
the
previous
paragraphs
fourth
is
yet
another
vicious
circle
related
to
legal
cynicism
if
minorities
have
consistently
negative
views
of
the
police
and
respond
to
stops
accordingly
police
may
come
to
anticipate
more
resistance
from
those
minorities
shared
police
expectations
of
a
greater
risk
of
african
american
violence
in
response
to
a
police
stop
is
one
potential
explanation
for
the
higher
rates
of
force
for
black
suspects
that
fryer
finds
in
the
new
york
sqf
data
n
consistent
with
this
possibility
greater
perceived
minority
threat
appears
to
predict
higher
levels
of
police
use
of
force
controlling
for
other
relevant
predictors
n
appearances
in
this
way
influence
realities
n
the
perception
of
racial
disproportionality
in
stops
on
this
theory
influences
individual
residents
behavior
which
in
the
aggregate
creates
racial
differences
in
violence
by
police
this
of
course
merely
strengthens
minorities
negative
expectations
of
police
n
in
this
way
large
racial
disparities
in
the
physical
harms
associated
with
sqf
can
be
reconciled
with
the
nearly
uniform
support
for
the
principle
of
equal
treatment
found
in
polling
data
n
fifth
just
as
legal
cynicism
leads
to
higher
victimization
rates
so
too
can
the
carceral
consequences
of
sqf
have
negative
effects
more
punitive
police
enforcement
and
parole
surveillance
leads
to
a
higher
frequency
of
repeat
admissions
from
a
given
neighborhood
which
begets
more
incarceration
which
in
turn
begets
more
crime
n
to
the
extent
sqf
does
not
result
in
arrests
or
incarceration
of
course
this
dynamic
is
forestalled
sixth
sqf
might
solidify
stereotypical
assumptions
about
the
correlation
of
race
and
criminality
when
neighborhoods
targeted
for
sqf
are
predominantly
african
american
and
hispanic
sqf
is
likely
to
strengthen
the
widely
shared
perception
of
a
connection
between
race
and
crime
n
careful
empirical
studies
have
demonstrated
that
the
racial
composition
of
a
neighborhood
already
provides
a
cue
for
people
s
estimates
of
its
disorderly
character
n
and
its
crime
rate
n
sqf
especially
when
explicitly
justified
on
the
basis
of
black
criminality
works
as
an
official
imprimatur
upon
this
popular
stereotype
and
by
instantiating
state
policy
on
the
basis
of
that
spurious
correlation
it
deepens
and
ratifies
racial
stereotypes
that
predate
any
known
disparity
in
crime
rates
and
invidious
generalizations
that
depend
not
on
empirics
but
rather
on
profound
and
harmful
assumptions
about
racial
differences
n
consistent
with
this
dynamic
empirical
evidence
already
suggests
that
suspects
with
darker
skin
pigmentation
are
more
likely
to
identified
as
criminal
n
and
punished
more
severely
n
than
similarly
situated
lighter
toned
suspects
it
may
also
be
that
the
tighter
perceived
correlation
between
race
and
criminality
reinforces
residential
segregation
by
marking
off
black
from
white
neighborhoods
n
seventh
another
probable
effect
of
sqf
is
a
dampening
of
civil
participation
by
residents
of
affected
neighborhoods
in
ways
that
over
time
conduce
to
diminished
collective
political
power
important
recent
work
by
amy
lerman
and
vesla
weaver
has
demonstrated
empirically
that
contact
with
the
criminal
justice
system
including
nonconsensual
stops
has
a
substantial
and
statistically
significant
effect
on
trust
in
government
n
in
one
national
sample
the
probability
of
voting
declined
by
percent
for
those
who
have
been
stopped
n
once
again
there
is
a
potent
vicious
circle
in
operation
here
sqf
is
a
form
of
policing
that
allocates
most
of
its
costs
to
minorities
living
in
concentrated
poverty
but
the
downstream
effect
of
a
high
stop
rate
is
that
roughly
one
in
ten
of
those
subjected
to
sqf
become
less
likely
to
vote
like
felon
disenfranchisement
laws
sqf
thus
has
the
effect
of
sapping
low
income
minority
communities
influence
on
public
policy
and
on
the
political
distribution
of
valued
public
goods
n
even
as
it
purports
to
empower
those
communities
eighth
and
finally
is
yet
another
potential
aggregate
level
effect
this
time
upon
the
level
of
collective
efficacy
within
a
neighborhood
developed
by
the
harvard
sociologist
robert
sampson
the
concept
of
collective
efficacy
involves
the
linkage
of
mutual
trust
and
the
shared
willingness
to
intervene
n
in
repeated
studies
high
levels
of
collective
efficacy
have
been
found
to
boost
neighborhoods
ability
to
realize
the
common
values
of
residents
and
maintain
effective
social
controls
is
a
major
source
of
neighborhood
variation
in
violence
and
in
particular
homicide
n
although
there
is
no
study
of
the
effect
of
sqf
on
levels
of
collective
efficacy
there
is
little
reason
to
think
it
will
be
positive
if
contact
with
the
police
breeds
legal
cynicism
intracommunal
violence
anxiety
and
an
unwillingness
to
engage
politically
it
is
hard
to
see
how
it
could
foster
collective
efficacy
if
that
is
so
sqf
suppresses
a
key
determinant
of
public
safety
within
neighborhoods
in
considering
these
eight
pathways
it
is
important
to
note
that
in
many
respects
their
effects
are
likely
endure
across
generations
most
impoverished
african
american
youth
as
well
as
a
significant
proportion
of
middle
income
ones
live
in
urban
neighborhoods
of
concentrated
poverty
of
the
kind
subject
to
sqf
n
sqf
is
likely
pivotal
in
the
formation
of
many
minority
children
s
understandings
of
their
status
and
possibilities
in
america
an
effect
compounded
by
the
further
fact
that
one
in
four
black
children
already
experiences
parental
incarceration
n
to
think
that
sqf
s
structural
harms
will
be
transient
therefore
is
to
be
far
too
optimistic
this
is
a
long
list
its
items
though
should
not
be
viewed
in
isolation
rather
these
mechanisms
operate
in
simultaneous
and
overlapping
ways
all
of
these
pathways
generate
costs
concentrated
on
the
minority
individuals
and
communities
in
which
sqf
is
imposed
in
this
their
effects
are
intersecting
and
cumulative
impoverished
minority
individuals
and
through
them
their
communities
become
more
demoralized
alienated
anxious
crime
ridden
and
politically
powerless
the
net
effect
of
sqf
s
eight
costs
therefore
is
singular
it
is
to
maintain
and
even
deepen
social
and
geographic
schisms
that
separate
neighborhoods
and
racial
groups
it
is
for
this
reason
that
sqf
cannot
be
understood
as
merely
an
individual
level
intervention
it
sets
in
motion
a
range
of
important
social
processes
largely
detrimental
to
the
shared
interests
of
a
neighborhood
and
a
racial
group
in
ways
that
reiterate
and
recapitulate
extant
racial
and
social
hierarchies
these
dynamics
finally
may
help
explain
the
surprising
lack
of
empirical
evidence
of
crime
reduction
from
sqf
n
at
an
aggregate
level
communities
subject
to
sqf
are
likely
to
see
their
political
efficacy
their
collective
efficacy
and
their
shared
commitment
to
the
law
wither
one
effect
of
these
changes
is
an
expected
increase
in
levels
of
crime
this
may
offset
whatever
gains
the
direct
application
of
sqf
achieves
partially
or
in
full
sqf
in
short
is
a
short
term
panacea
that
in
the
medium
term
may
well
prove
self
defeating
d
the
distinctive
moral
wrong
of
sqf
this
part
has
so
far
provided
a
definition
and
analysis
of
the
positives
and
negatives
of
sqf
with
the
aim
of
refashioning
the
case
against
sqf
rather
than
cabining
the
inquiry
by
imposing
artificial
constitutional
categories
at
the
threshold
i
have
identified
both
individual
and
neighborhood
level
costs
and
benefits
with
a
clear
picture
of
both
positives
and
negatives
in
hand
it
is
possible
to
recapitulate
the
argument
against
sqf
in
a
more
nuanced
form
to
be
sure
absent
precise
quantification
of
both
costs
and
benefits
that
argument
necessarily
has
a
provisional
aspect
i
have
no
proof
that
the
policy
s
costs
exceed
its
benefits
nevertheless
i
view
the
weakness
of
benefit
related
evidence
and
the
accumulation
of
cost
related
evidence
as
sufficiently
clear
to
suggest
that
a
working
account
of
the
distinctive
moral
wrong
of
sqf
is
feasible
the
core
of
the
case
against
sqf
is
dynamic
and
ecological
in
character
it
rests
on
the
policy
s
effect
not
just
on
the
specific
persons
stopped
by
police
on
the
street
but
on
the
dynamic
role
that
sqf
plays
in
the
social
and
racial
stratifications
that
concatenate
with
each
other
to
create
urban
residential
segregation
it
is
an
analysis
moreover
that
proceeds
without
making
any
assumption
of
racial
animus
or
individual
officer
fault
in
the
early
s
sqf
was
adopted
as
a
response
to
rising
violent
crime
associated
with
minority
dominated
neighborhoods
characterized
by
concentrated
poverty
in
that
respect
it
was
at
its
origin
a
response
to
an
unexpected
externality
from
the
urban
residential
segregation
that
had
been
promoted
by
state
actors
from
world
war
ii
onward
local
and
state
officials
might
have
taken
another
path
n
from
the
s
onwards
historian
elizabeth
hinton
has
demonstrated
national
and
local
politics
gradually
blended
opportunity
development
and
training
programs
of
the
war
on
poverty
with
the
surveillance
patrol
and
detention
programs
of
the
war
on
crime
n
by
the
s
however
the
war
on
crime
would
eventually
completely
supplant
great
society
antipoverty
programs
as
a
solution
to
urban
discontent
n
non
coercive
solutions
in
short
had
already
been
tabled
by
the
time
the
crime
wave
of
the
late
s
and
early
s
was
in
full
flush
n
nevertheless
the
policy
response
to
that
crime
wave
has
had
ironically
limited
crime
control
related
payoff
while
at
the
same
time
ratifying
racial
stereotypes
emasculating
minority
communities
politically
and
exacerbating
their
social
and
political
weaknesses
especially
given
the
backdrop
of
municipal
policies
that
consciously
enabled
and
entrenched
the
urban
ghetto
this
policy
choice
was
a
morally
problematic
one
it
was
in
effect
a
choice
by
the
state
to
exacerbate
a
form
of
racial
stratification
for
which
the
state
itself
bears
large
moral
if
not
constitutional
responsibility
sqf
is
thus
but
one
link
in
a
larger
process
n
of
social
and
racial
stratification
in
ways
that
extend
well
beyond
the
discrete
effects
of
an
isolated
encounter
between
one
officer
and
one
resident
n
given
its
exiguous
benefits
shared
across
the
whole
of
society
and
its
multifarious
costs
largely
concentrated
within
already
impoverished
minority
communities
it
is
hard
to
imagine
that
sqf
would
have
anything
but
regressive
distributive
effects
as
between
racial
groups
n
on
the
assumption
that
my
judgments
about
the
relative
magnitude
of
costs
and
benefits
are
sustained
therefore
i
believe
that
sqf
can
fairly
be
characterized
as
a
systemic
and
institutional
phenomenon
that
reproduces
racial
inequality
and
the
presumption
of
black
and
brown
criminality
n
it
is
one
of
the
mechanisms
by
which
racial
division
in
american
society
is
produced
and
reproduced
given
this
characterization
i
resist
claims
that
the
problem
of
race
in
policing
is
a
distraction
and
that
it
would
be
better
to
focus
reforming
energies
on
say
the
problem
of
mass
incarceration
n
or
structural
inequality
n
sqf
even
absent
any
racial
animus
cannot
be
separated
from
larger
processes
of
subordination
along
social
and
racial
lines
and
efforts
to
distinguish
the
two
phenomena
are
deeply
misguided
equally
beside
the
point
are
claims
that
sqf
is
based
on
an
accurate
generalization
about
racial
minorities
criminality
n
such
background
regularities
are
themselves
functions
of
state
action
given
the
state
s
role
in
perpetuating
racialized
concentrated
poverty
which
is
in
turn
correlated
with
crime
a
policy
choice
that
reinforces
rather
than
dissipates
the
force
of
that
pernicious
generalization
is
hardly
entitled
to
deference
based
on
its
putative
accuracy
n
a
legal
remedy
might
not
be
able
to
capture
all
of
the
diverse
causal
pathways
i
have
identified
here
but
a
legal
remedy
should
nonetheless
respond
in
part
to
sqf
s
distinctive
moral
wrong
by
identifying
those
instances
of
policing
choice
that
have
the
least
positive
effect
on
security
with
the
largest
stratification
related
spillovers
it
is
this
question
of
the
aptitude
of
constitutional
doctrine
and
its
subconstitutional
counterpart
in
disparate
impact
law
to
which
i
now
turn
ii
street
policing
and
the
limits
of
constitutional
doctrine
this
part
turns
to
the
core
doctrines
of
constitutional
law
invoked
and
applied
in
challenges
to
sqf
the
fourth
amendment
doctrine
associated
with
terry
and
the
equal
protection
clause
rules
that
have
coalesced
around
feeney
i
argue
that
there
is
a
mismatch
between
these
doctrinal
vehicles
and
the
core
normative
challenge
posed
by
sqf
as
i
have
articulated
it
in
part
i
this
mismatch
renders
current
constitutional
law
ill
suited
to
accounting
for
the
normative
challenges
of
sqf
thinking
about
the
costs
and
benefits
of
sqf
in
terms
of
fourth
amendment
and
equal
protection
law
instead
reveals
a
troublingly
asymmetrical
gap
cutting
across
both
doctrinal
structures
to
wit
fourth
amendment
law
and
equal
protection
law
alike
employ
narrow
transactional
frames
to
tally
the
costs
imposed
by
state
action
to
traditionally
subordinate
minorities
but
are
periodically
open
to
dynamic
and
ecological
effects
in
ways
that
serve
to
obscure
or
exculpate
harms
to
racial
minorities
to
see
the
mismatch
between
current
constitutional
doctrine
and
sqf
programs
in
a
nutshell
consider
a
simple
hypothetical
imagine
a
police
force
in
which
every
officer
had
internalized
both
terry
and
feeney
each
officer
in
consequence
understood
that
she
could
not
make
a
nonconsensual
street
stop
without
the
relevant
reasonable
articulable
suspicion
of
criminality
and
that
she
could
not
make
that
stop
because
of
not
merely
in
spite
of
n
the
perceived
racial
identity
of
the
individual
to
be
stopped
what
would
change
in
the
actual
practice
of
sqf
would
the
concerns
about
the
volume
and
racial
disparities
in
stops
be
assuaged
the
short
answer
is
probably
not
consistent
with
the
weak
terry
rule
it
may
well
be
possible
for
a
police
force
to
conduct
a
very
large
volume
of
stops
consistent
with
feeney
those
stops
might
be
constitutionally
valid
even
if
they
were
distributed
in
a
way
that
deepens
racial
stratification
indeed
racial
disparities
are
particularly
likely
to
persist
if
police
sincerely
believe
that
african
americans
commit
a
disproportionate
share
of
offenses
and
thus
ought
to
comprise
a
higher
per
capita
rate
of
street
stops
the
application
of
conventional
constitutional
doctrine
under
the
fourth
amendment
and
the
equal
protection
clause
therefore
is
consistent
with
preservation
of
sqf
at
its
present
volume
and
as
characterized
by
current
racial
disparities
this
part
first
considers
the
fourth
amendment
law
and
shows
its
inadequacies
it
then
analyzes
equal
protection
doctrine
to
reveal
why
it
has
utterly
failed
to
address
the
problem
of
street
policing
a
the
limits
of
fourth
amendment
doctrine
the
fourth
amendment
law
of
street
stops
cannot
impose
a
meaningful
constraint
upon
sqf
in
minority
neighborhoods
characterized
by
concentrated
poverty
to
the
contrary
fourth
amendment
doctrine
systematically
lowers
the
cost
of
such
stops
in
comparison
to
others
conducted
outside
the
distinctive
urban
ecologies
of
sqf
to
the
extent
that
the
fourth
amendment
law
of
street
policing
takes
account
of
changing
social
and
institutional
contexts
though
it
is
thoroughly
asymmetrically
it
accounts
for
such
contexts
only
when
doing
so
expands
state
authority
the
reasonable
articulable
suspicion
predicates
for
a
terry
stop
and
a
related
frisk
are
not
demanding
hurdles
they
focus
solely
on
the
ex
ante
evidentiary
basis
for
a
stop
and
wholly
ignore
the
manner
in
which
a
stop
is
conducted
terry
that
is
takes
no
account
of
variance
in
the
potential
dignitary
and
demoralization
externalities
imposed
by
aggressive
or
demeaning
police
behavior
moreover
the
court
has
not
defined
reasonable
articulable
suspicion
beyond
warning
that
an
officer
must
be
able
to
articulate
something
more
than
a
hunch
n
the
court
has
instead
underscored
that
this
evaluation
be
made
under
the
totality
of
the
circumstances
n
this
gives
officers
a
wide
array
of
predicate
facts
to
choose
from
when
making
their
case
with
one
exception
officers
subjective
beliefs
and
knowledge
are
as
a
result
available
as
bases
for
a
terry
stop
n
even
though
such
subjective
factors
are
not
relevant
to
the
fourth
amendment
analysis
in
other
contexts
n
the
exception
is
also
telling
even
where
race
is
the
real
i
e
subjective
basis
of
the
stop
the
fourth
amendment
provides
no
remedy
where
alternative
factual
grounds
for
reasonable
articulable
suspicion
can
be
conjured
n
quite
apart
from
this
peculiar
gerrymandering
of
the
legally
relevant
grounds
for
evaluating
the
quality
of
a
stop
officers
discretion
is
rarely
in
practice
subject
to
rigorous
adversarial
testing
in
a
subsequent
criminal
adjudication
where
the
sole
witnesses
to
a
stop
are
the
suspect
and
arresting
officers
there
is
little
reason
to
think
the
resulting
testimonial
contest
will
result
in
accurate
outcomes
police
have
a
strong
incentive
to
color
the
facts
in
their
favor
or
even
outright
lie
n
a
recent
ethnographic
account
of
the
chicago
criminal
courts
for
example
paints
a
bleak
picture
of
judges
who
routinely
laughed
at
the
fabrication
of
police
reports
as
if
it
were
a
novelty
rather
than
an
abuse
of
power
n
chicago
s
pathologies
might
be
extreme
but
it
is
hard
to
imagine
such
practices
are
wholly
absent
from
other
large
metropolitan
court
systems
n
in
many
urban
jurisdictions
therefore
there
will
be
little
effectual
incentive
for
officers
to
comply
with
terry
s
meager
epistemic
exhortation
nevertheless
the
general
trend
in
judicial
reworkings
of
terry
has
been
deflationary
i
will
just
give
one
example
as
it
happens
one
that
is
particularly
relevant
to
sqf
whereas
the
terry
court
allowed
the
stop
and
frisk
only
when
an
officer
suspected
crime
was
afoot
n
subsequent
cases
extended
that
power
to
instances
in
which
a
crime
has
been
completed
n
while
at
first
blush
it
might
seem
innocuous
and
sensible
this
subtle
shift
in
practice
dramatically
expands
police
discretion
under
terry
the
constellation
of
facts
that
might
be
invoked
to
justify
a
stop
was
bounded
by
what
an
officer
could
observe
at
a
specific
moment
in
time
n
now
an
officer
can
rely
on
a
far
greater
universe
of
historical
facts
available
through
a
police
forces
index
of
suspect
descriptions
to
support
reasonable
articulable
suspicion
in
a
handful
of
controversial
cases
descriptions
identifying
african
american
suspects
have
been
employed
to
conduct
blanket
searches
n
in
the
controversial
case
of
brown
v
city
of
oneonta
for
example
a
description
of
a
black
male
suspect
provoked
oneonta
police
to
stop
more
than
two
hundred
non
white
persons
including
women
encountered
on
the
streets
n
even
absent
the
broad
search
at
issue
in
brown
a
large
enough
pool
of
suspect
descriptions
as
is
likely
to
be
the
case
in
large
cities
means
that
police
discretion
to
stop
becomes
orders
of
magnitude
larger
than
the
authority
defined
in
terry
n
subsequent
refinements
to
the
terry
regime
have
rendered
sqf
more
attractive
relative
to
other
ways
of
deploying
policing
resources
as
the
late
william
stuntz
noted
criminal
procedure
rules
can
act
as
subsidies
making
some
kinds
of
law
enforcement
cheaper
than
others
n
stuntz
applied
this
logic
to
make
a
comparison
between
policing
street
markets
which
is
cheap
for
the
police
and
the
more
expensive
regulation
of
indoor
upscale
drug
markets
n
his
point
though
can
be
extended
to
the
neighborhood
level
for
a
parallel
differential
arises
between
neighborhoods
of
concentrated
poverty
and
areas
of
comparative
wealth
because
of
two
fourth
amendment
precedents
first
the
court
in
illinois
v
wardlow
held
that
a
suspect
s
mere
presence
in
a
high
crime
area
and
more
particularly
an
area
of
heavy
narcotics
trafficking
was
relevant
to
the
legality
of
a
terry
stop
n
evidence
from
new
york
s
sqf
practice
also
demonstrates
that
this
term
is
vulnerable
to
subjective
and
highly
contextualized
interpretation
n
this
may
be
of
particular
concern
to
the
extent
that
an
increasing
proportion
of
minorities
tends
to
create
a
belief
of
disorderliness
and
criminality
as
multiple
studies
show
n
wardlow
creates
an
incentive
to
target
minority
neighborhoods
indeed
even
setting
aside
the
question
of
how
a
high
crime
area
is
to
be
identified
or
bounded
wardlow
explicitly
subsidizes
police
activity
in
neighborhoods
of
concentrated
poverty
in
comparison
to
wealthy
neighborhoods
n
second
the
supreme
court
s
recent
decision
in
utah
v
streiff
n
creates
an
incentive
for
officers
to
target
for
stops
populations
that
are
likely
to
have
a
higher
per
capita
rate
of
bench
warrants
in
streiff
the
arresting
officer
was
conducting
a
stakeout
of
a
house
where
drug
sales
were
suspected
to
happen
n
he
saw
strieff
leave
the
house
and
stopped
him
despite
lacking
the
terry
predicate
of
reasonable
articulable
suspicion
n
as
a
result
of
what
the
state
conceded
to
be
an
illegal
stop
the
officer
asked
streiff
for
identification
n
upon
checking
the
produced
documentation
with
his
dispatcher
the
officer
learned
of
an
outstanding
warrant
for
streiff
and
arrested
him
n
a
search
incident
to
arrest
found
methamphetamine
and
drug
paraphernalia
n
the
issue
before
the
court
was
whether
this
evidence
should
be
excluded
as
fruit
of
the
initial
illegal
stop
n
writing
for
five
justices
justice
thomas
said
no
n
characterizing
the
initial
unlawful
stop
as
negligent
and
a
good
faith
mistake
n
the
court
found
the
search
incident
to
arrest
that
had
produced
the
narcotics
to
be
sufficiently
attenuated
by
the
pre
existing
arrest
warrant
n
hence
the
evidence
found
during
the
search
incident
to
arrest
was
not
subject
to
exclusion
in
streiff
s
criminal
adjudication
n
as
justice
sotomayor
s
dissent
pointed
out
outstanding
warrants
are
surprisingly
common
n
a
recent
ethnography
of
misdemeanor
courts
in
new
york
illustrates
how
courts
and
prosecutors
generate
a
large
volume
of
outstanding
warrants
for
failures
to
appear
at
repeatedly
rescheduled
hearings
and
then
seek
dispositions
with
little
effect
other
than
to
facilitate
later
arrests
n
in
streiff
justice
sotomayor
did
not
contextualize
the
use
of
outstanding
warrants
in
the
sqf
context
but
she
cited
evidence
gathered
by
the
justice
department
in
ferguson
missouri
and
explained
that
the
astounding
numbers
of
warrants
can
be
used
by
police
to
stop
people
without
cause
and
flagged
that
it
is
no
secret
that
people
of
color
are
disproportionate
victims
of
this
type
of
scrutiny
n
justice
sotomayor
s
analysis
is
hard
to
dispute
police
indeed
have
long
been
cognizant
of
the
strategic
potential
for
outstanding
warrant
checks
during
street
stops
and
have
strategically
exploited
it
n
the
decision
in
streiff
creates
a
new
incentive
for
police
to
engage
in
negligent
stops
n
lacking
even
with
the
minimal
accouterments
of
reasonable
articulable
suspicion
in
order
to
check
for
warrants
this
incentive
becomes
more
powerful
as
the
expected
number
of
such
outstanding
warrants
in
a
neighborhood
increases
n
here
then
is
yet
another
incentive
pressing
police
to
focus
street
patrols
on
neighborhoods
of
concentrated
poverty
even
if
they
cannot
muster
the
minimal
evidentiary
predicate
of
terry
officers
have
a
sure
fire
way
of
showing
progress
simply
by
making
illegal
stops
and
arresting
based
on
either
outstanding
warrants
or
contraband
found
during
a
search
incident
to
arrest
streiff
allows
officers
to
employ
stops
even
absent
terry
suspicion
and
demonstrate
success
decisions
such
as
wardlow
and
streiff
mean
that
current
fourth
amendment
jurisprudence
systematically
tilts
in
favor
of
sqf
the
doctrinal
framework
at
work
in
these
cases
minimizes
both
proximate
and
distant
harms
to
individuals
stopped
it
also
ignores
the
ecological
harms
and
dynamic
stratification
effects
associated
with
sqf
n
indeed
it
seems
fair
to
say
that
the
vocabulary
of
the
fourth
amendment
does
not
at
present
contain
the
resources
even
to
account
for
those
harms
let
alone
hold
them
in
the
balance
with
terry
stops
positive
crime
control
effects
one
indication
of
this
is
that
justice
sotomayor
s
comments
about
the
ecological
context
of
street
policing
were
so
strikingly
at
odds
with
the
normative
verbiage
of
the
court
s
fourth
amendment
cases
that
they
generated
national
media
attention
n
if
the
mere
fact
a
justice
is
cognizant
of
the
larger
policy
context
in
which
a
legal
question
arises
stimulates
the
press
into
action
it
is
because
the
modal
fourth
amendment
decision
is
hermetically
detached
from
the
distinctive
ecological
and
dynamic
costs
flowing
from
urban
policing
nevertheless
that
jurisprudence
is
not
wholly
bounded
by
a
narrow
transactional
focus
rather
the
court
selectively
and
asymmetrically
accounts
for
dynamic
effects
consider
the
streiff
court
s
treatment
of
the
exclusionary
remedy
n
the
court
s
foundational
decisions
about
the
scope
of
that
remedy
focus

allow

costly
exclusionary
remedy
only
when
its

in

compliance
with

acknowledging
this

the
streiff

stated

why
this
would
be
so
is
not
clear
tort
liability

about

account

judicial

will
provide

than

it
seems

to
also
analyze

racial
impact
a
topic

the
limits
of

the

traction
on
the
distinctive
wrong
of
sqf

the
contrary
thinking
about
racial
equality
doctrine

the
lens
of
sqf

a
gap
between
the
court
s
articulated
justifications
and
its
current
doctrinal
specifications
to
take
seriously
the
normative
concerns
i
have
flagged
would
mean
treating
sqf
as
a
paradigmatic
equal
protection
violation
today
however
the
doctrine
relegates
policing
disparities
to
the
margin
two
core
prohibitions
are
embodied
in
current
equal
protection
clause
jurisprudence
first
explicit
racial
classifications
trigger
strict
scrutiny
and
require
government
to
demonstrate
with
clarity
that
its
purpose
or
interest
is
both
constitutionally
permissible
and
substantial
and
that
its
use
of
the
classification
is
necessary
to
the
accomplishment
of
its
purpose
n
in
the
absence
of
an
explicit
racial
classification
n
a
government
action
motivated
by
a
discriminatory
purpose
with
an
adverse
effect
on
a
discrete
protected
class
establishes
an
equal
protection
clause
violation
but
the
court
s
gloss
on
discriminatory
purpose
promulgated
in
personnel
administrator
of
massachusetts
v
feeney
is
cast
in
exacting
terms
n
it
compels
litigants
to
show
that
a
state
actor
selected
or
reaffirmed
a
particular
course
of
action
at
least
in
part
because
of
not
merely
in

of
its
adverse
effects
upon
an
identifiable
group

in
contrast
a
disparate
impact
on
a
racial
group
alone
does
nothing
to
impugn
the
constitutionality
of
a
state
action
n
in
the
criminal
justice
context
this
doctrinal
framework
leaves
the
state
with
a
largely
free
hand
at
the
supreme
court
few
equal
protection
cases
have
arisen
in
the
criminal
justice
context
concerning
systemic
or
structural
inequalities
as
opposed
to
discrete
instances
of
bias
on
the
part
of
individual
actors
such
as
jurors
or
more
rarely
prosecutors
only
one
recent
case
has
grappled
with
an
explicit
racial
classification
in
johnson

california
a
state
prison
used
a
racial
classification
to
sort

temporarily

could
be
determined
n
the
court
rejected
the
state
s
call
to
derogate
from
strict
scrutiny
n
in
contrast
the
court
declined
to
grant
certiorari
in
brown
v
city
of
oneonta
a
case
that
would
have
required
it
to
consider
whether
the
second
circuit
had
correctly
held
that
a
race
based
suspect
description
was
not
a
racial
classification
subject
to
strict
scrutiny
n
under
feeney
there
are
a
handful
of
cases
in
which
prosecutorial
use
of
preemptory
challenges
is
held
to
be
racially
motivated
and
thus
to
violate
the
equal
protection
clause
n
but
more
systemic
challenges
to
the
operation
of
the
criminal
justice
institutions
have
been
wholly
absent
from
the
court
s
docket
since
the
case
of
mcclesky
v
kemp
n
in
large
measure
this
is
because
mccleskey
established
a
near
insurmountable
barrier
to
such
challenges
n
in
that
capital
case
the
court
declined
to
infer
discriminatory
purpose
from
unrebutted
statistical
evidence
that
georgia
s
capital
punishment
treated
defendants
differently
based
on
their
race
and
the
race
of
their
victim
n
among
the
reasons
the
court
offered
for
declining
to
entertain
even
powerful
statistical
evidence
n
it
worried
that
if
we
accepted
mccleskey
s
claim
that
racial
bias
has
impermissibly
tainted
the
capital
sentencing
decision
we
could
soon
be
faced
with
similar
claims
as
to
other
types
of
penalty
including
noncapital
sentencing
n
this
concern
about
what
justice
brennan
acerbically
characterized
as
a
fear
of
too
much
justice
n
reoccurs
in
other
instances
in
which
criminal
justice
disparities
have
been
challenged

absent
the
miraculous
happenstance
of
testimonial
or
documentary
evidence
of
bias
a
stroke
of
luck
that
befell
plaintiffs
in
the
challenge
to
new

policy
n
mccleskey
means
that
the
courthouse
door
is
effectively
shut
to
discriminatory
purpose
challenges
in
the
criminal
justice
context
n
mccleskey
in
tandem
with
the
narrow
definition
of
racial
classifications
evinced
by
the
court
s
treatment
of
johnson
and
brown
drastically
narrows
litigants
opportunities
to
challenge
the
role
of
race
in
criminal
justice
institutions
the
substance
of
current
equal
protection
doctrine
in
short
evinces
no
concern
for
either
the
ecological
spillovers
of
enforcement
actions
onto
larger
racial
cohorts
and
much
like
the
fourth
amendment
cases
canvassed
above
it
is
heedless
of
dynamic
effects
except
perhaps
for
its
evident
concern
with
maintaining
the
criminal
justice
status
quo
finally
neither
the
rule
against
racial
classification
nor
the
bar
to
discriminatory
motivations
takes
into
account
the
possibility
that
officials
are
aware
that
a
policy
pursued
for
nonracial
ends
has
a
wholly
foreseeable
negative
effects
on
other
members
of
a
racial
or
ethnic
cohort
n
or
the
possibility
that
race
is
so
pervasively
correlated
with
nonracial
traits
such
as
residence
socioeconomic
status
and
the
like
that
official
decision
makers
simply
cannot
disentangle
racial
from
nonracial
criteria
n
there
is
something
of
a
puzzle
here
in
glossing
the
equal
protection
clause
the
court
has
invoked
ideas
of
racial
stigma
n
racial
balkanization
n
and
the
dignitary
interest
in
being
judged
on
one
s
own
merits
n
and
then
it
has
been
largely
silent
about
policing
but
it
is
not
hard
to
see
that
sqf
as
described
in
part
i
implicates
each
of
these
concerns
it
is
most
importantly
often
expressly
predicated
on
a
putative
relationship
between
race
to
criminality
n
it
is
indeed
explicitly
defended
on
the
basis
of
a
generalization
a
stereotype
about
racial
minorities
that
is
not
merely
derogatory
but
that
has
historically
been
a
keystone
of
discriminatory
legal
architectures
and
its
advocates
make
no
bones
that
the
price
of
public
safety
will
be
borne
disproportionately
by
only
some
and
only
because
of
the
color
of
their
skin
further
it
not
only
thrives
upon
the
festering
racial
segregation
that
scars
our
cities
but
it
reinforces
segregation
to
the
extent
that
minorities
are
subject
to
increased
stops
when
they
leave
their
neighborhoods
quite
literally
it
echoes
and
embeds
the
balkanization
of
our
cities
into
black
and
white
quarters
in
addition
thanks
to
the
weak
evidentiary
threshold
of
terry
it
enables
police
to
engage
in
aggregate
deprivations
of
individual
liberty
that
are
predicated
only
fractionally
on
individual
behavior
and
largely
on
race
and
place
if
one
takes
the
court
s
justifications
on
face
value
policing
tactics
such
as
sqf
in
short
ought
to
be
the
sine
qua
non
of
what
the
equal
protection
clause
prevents
the
equal
protection
doctrine
in
conclusion
provides
the
moral
justifications
but
not
the
doctrinal
tools
for
dealing
with
sqf
it
is
beholden
to
the
default
narrow
and
atomistic
transactional
frame
of
constitutional
doctrine
which
shears
away
both
ecological
and
dynamic
contexts
and
ultimately
it
lacks
the
courage
of
its
notional
convictions
for
these
reasons
it
is
not
well
adapted
to
the
task
of
fixing
sqf
iii
the
disparate
impact
lens
on
sqf
this
part
turns
from
critique
to
a
more
constructive
proposal
not
all
instruments
to
mitigate
moral
wrongs
have
to
reside
in
the
constitution
so
i
look
elsewhere
i
argue
that
a
disparate
impact
framework
of
liability
now
found
in
both
federal
statutes
and
state
law
provides
a
better
but
not
a
perfect
framework
for
analyzing
urban
street
policing
policy
the
purpose
of
the
disparate
impact
lens
advanced
here
is
diagnostic
it
is
also
second
best
in
the
sense
that
it
does
not
track
the
loose
cost
benefit
analysis
that
is
fleshed
out
in
part
i
that
cost
benefit
analysis
in
my
view
impugns
all
programmatic
use
of
sqf
in
racially
diverse
cities
at
present
more
modestly
a
disparate
impact
lens
provides
a
way
to
identify
when
a
police
department
s
programmatic
use
of
terry
stops
is
especially
likely
to
be
unjustified
because
it
is
characterized
by
distinctive
ecological
and
dynamic
harms
a
disparate
impact
lens
in
other
words
flushes
out
the
subset
of
municipal
policing
practices
from
which
the
harms
identified
in
part
i
are
most
likely
to
flow
it
does
not
flag
every
instance
in
which
sqf
is
unjustified
on
welfarist
terms
formally
a
disparate
impact
framework
identifies
a
set
of
policing
practices
in
which
the
likely
proximate
costs
of
sqf
are
concentrated
on
minority
communities
without
an
adequately
supported
justification
the
analysis
developed
in
part
ii
suggested
that
the
proximate
costs
of
sqf
which
include
the
hassle
and
humiliation
of
stops
are
only
a
fraction
of
the
total
costs
of
sqf
the
latter
comprise
the
larger
set
of
dynamic
costs
to
individuals
families
and
communities
but
if
even
the
proximate
costs
of
sqf
are
highly
concentrated
it
is
likely
that
aggregate
costs
are
also
extremely
concentrated
where
the
state
cannot
identify
a
strong
public
policy
justification
for
that
concentration
sqf
should
be
ranked
as
legally
problematic
more
specifically
where
the
state
cannot
adequately
make
the
case
that
the
concentration
of
sqf
responds
to
a
real
crime
problem
and
in
fact
mitigates
that
problem
it
should
be
required
to
reconsider
its
policing
strategy
in
this
sense
the
avoidance
of
disparate
impact
is
a
modest
second
best
demand
which
nudges
the
state
s
attention
toward
the
right
elements
of
policing
strategy
n
it
invites
that
is
remedial
attention
to
systemic
rather
than
individualistic
pathologies
and
it
avoids
the
moralizing
and
potentially
polarizing
language
of
individual
blame
and
liability
to
flesh
out
this
alternative
lens
onto
sqf
this
part
defines
and
defends
disparate
impact
liability
as
a
legally
available
approach
for
analyzing
policing
decisions
in
particular
i
develop
the
reasons
for
which
disparate
impact
is
superior
to
the
currently
dominant
constitutional
approaches
described
in
part
ii
having
dealt
with
potential
objections
to
its
translation
to
the
policing
context
i
conclude
by
sketching
how
in
practice
disparate
impact
liability
can
be
applied
to
sqf
in
practice
a
disparate
impact
analysis
requires
econometric
studies
of
the
aggregate
data
about
stops
frisks
and
other
outcomes
as
well
as
fine
grained
judgments
about
how
to
specify
and
interpret
such
studies
i
set
forth
three
general
lines
of
inquiry
that
might
profitably
be
applied
to
such
aggregate
data
to
determine
whether
a
disparate
impact
exists
i
largely
bracket
however
more
technical
questions
of
econometric
specification
together
these
empirical
strategies
nevertheless
provide
a
rough
template
for
making
disparate
impact
an
effective
and
practicable
instrument
of
legal
reform
a
the
availability
of
disparate
impact
the
theory
of
disparate
impact
liability
in
race
discrimination
cases
is
associated
with
the
supreme
court
s
construction
of
title
vii
of
the
civil
rights
act
of
in
griggs
v
duke
power
co
n
in
a
somewhat
chastened
form
it
remains
available
to
plaintiffs
in
employment
discrimination
cases

impact
is
also
a
cognizable
theory
of
liability
under
the
age
discrimination
in

act
adea
n
and
the
fair
housing
act
fha
n
it
can
be
understood
as
either
an
instrument
for
rooting
out
bad
intent
or
as
a
freestanding
ground
of
liability
n
disparate
impact
is
in
contrast
a
road
not
taken
in
equal
protection
law
n
disparate
impact
liability
in
the
policing
context
is
available
under
two
sets
of
laws
first
title
vi
of
the
civil
rights
act
of
prohibits
discrimination
under
any
program
or
activety
receiving
federal
funds
n
pursuant
to
an
explicit
grant
of
rule
making
authority
under
the
statute
federal
agencies
including
the
department
of
justice
have
promulgated
regulations
prohibiting
disparate
racial
impacts
as
well
as
disparate
racial
treatment
n
the
justice
department
s
disparate
impact
regulation
applies
to
any
program
for
which
federal
financial
assistance
is
authorized
under
a
law
administered
by
the
department
n
because
local
police
departments
receive
federal
funding
from
dozens
of
separate
programs
many
administered
by
the
department
of
justice
n
the
title
vi
bar
on
disparate
impact
applies
to
most
state
and
local
police
forces
that
prohibition
however
may
be
enforced
by
public
suits
but
not
via
individuals
invoking
a
private
right
of
action
n
the
new
orleans
consent
decree
and
the
baltimore
settlement
obtained
by
the
justice
department
for
example
both
invoke
title
vi
authority
albeit
in
nebulous
terms
n
second
at
least
two
states
prohibit
policing
measures
with
disparate
racial
impacts
the
illinois
civil
rights
act
tracking
title
vi
s
language
and
effect
prohibits
discrimination
under
any
program
or
activity
on
the
grounds
of
that
person
s
race
color
national
origin
or
gender
n
in
at
least
one
case
it
has
been
applied
to
policing
decisions
n
california
s
law
which
applies
to
all
state
programs
prohibits
criteria
or
methods
of
administration
that
have
the
purpose
or
effect
of
subjecting
a
person
to
discrimination
on
the
basis
of
ethnic
group
identification
religion
age
sex
color
or
a
physical
or
mental
disability
n
disparate
impact
is
commonly
framed
as
a
three
step
analysis
in
the
employment
discrimination
context
a
prima
facie
case
is
established
by
showing
that
a
specific
employment
practice
caused
racial
disparities
in
a
salient
outcome
measure
n
a
racial
disparity
is
gauged
by
comparing
employment
rates
in
an
employer
s
workforce
with
the
qualified
labor
pool
n
or
the
applicant
pool
n
rather
than
to
the
general
population
agencies
interpreting
title
vii
have
long
used
a
four
fifth
rule
to
single
out
cognizable
disparities
n
the
supreme
court
has
approvingly
cited
this
interpretation
adding
that
a
simple
significant
statistical
disparity
and
nothing
more
is
needed
at
the
threshold
n
this
prima
facie
case
however
may
be
rebutted
by
evidence
that
the
challenged
practice
is
job
related
for
the
position
in
question
and
consistent
with
business
necessity
n
this
defense
however
is
overcome
if
there
is
a
legitimate
alternative
employment
practice
that
will
result
in
less
discrimination
n
b
the
comparative
advantage
of
disparate
impact
black
letter
constitutional
law
largely
ignores
the
ecological
and
dynamic
aspects
of
sqf
it
therefore
fails
to
provide
a
useful
analytic
lens
for
determining
when
and
how
urban
street
policing
is
a
moral
wrong
why
would
a
disparate
impact
lens
do
any
better
it
is
not
a
form
of
cost
benefit
analysis
of
the
kind
developed
above
after
all
rather
a
disparate
impact
analysis
is
appropriate
here
because
it
is
a
way
to
isolate
the
proximate
costs
of
a
policy
excluding
that
is
its
social
familial
and
intergenerational
effects
and
to
compare
those
to
its
affirmative
policy
justifications
in
the
policing
context
disparate
impact
thus
weighs
a
subcategory
of
the
costs
imposed
on
minority
populations
against
almost
all
the
crime
control
related
benefits
of
the
policy
given
its
failure
to
capture
the
full
range
of
costs
adumbrated
in
part
ii
and
given
that
it
will
likely
account
for
most
of
the
benefits
of
sqf
a
disparate
impact
lens
is
likely
to
be
radically
under
inclusive
it
will
only
capture
a
subset
of
cases
in
which
sqf
imposes
a
moral
wrong
nevertheless
there
are
three
reasons
for
thinking
that
disparate
impact
is
a
better
fit
for
identifying
the
distinctive
moral
wrong
of
sqf
identified
in
part
i
even
if
it
does
not
track
precisely
a
cost
benefit
analysis
first
disparate
impact
liability
is
at
least
focused
on
aggregate
rather
than
individual
outcomes
it
is
panoramic
rather
than
microscopic
the
institutional
focus
of
disparate
impact
widens
the
array
of
relevant
institutional
decisions
that
can
be
considered
as
causes
of
harm
policing
is
not
simply
a
matter
of
officers
on
the
street
making
ad
hoc
decisions
like
any
other
complex
organizations
a
police
force
is
channeled
through
policies
practices
and
bureaucratic
norms
developed
at
competing
institutional
nodes
from
city
hall
to
chief
of
police
s
office
to
the
precinct
house
the
capacious
lens
used
by
disparate
impact
captures
more
relevant
state
actions
than
an
approach
focused
on
bad
motives
analysis
under
a
wide
angle
disparate
impact
rubric
is
also
not
limited
to
the
consequences
of
a
discrete
individual
s
action
it
focuses
more
capaciously
on
all
the
effects
of
a
practice
n
sqf
as
i
have
described
it
in
part
i
need
not
rest
on
pernicious
individual
motivations
to
generate
a
distinctive
moral
wrong
rather
that
wrong
can
flow
from
the
effects
of
institutional
policies
and
practices
disparate
impact
is
sensitive
to
a
wide
range
of
effects
and
is
in
particular
able
to
capture
the
interaction
between
past
distributions
and
present
policing
practice
an
institutional
practice
such
as
sqf
will
produce
different
effects
depending
on
the
context
to
which
is
applied
when
employed
in
a
fashion
that
tracks
patterns
of
existing
racial
segregation
its
race
related
patterns
will
be
different
from
an
application
that
cuts
across
extant
forms
of
racial
stratification
this
difference
is
captured
in
the
broad
scope
of
disparate
impact
analysis
which
accounts
for
history
as
well
as
institutional
context
in
a
way
that
discriminatory
treatment
analysis
cannot
second
disparate
impact
analysis
focuses
attention
on
the
morally
relevant
question
of
whether
the
crime
control
benefits
of
the
policy
as
a
whole
justify
its
costs
once
a
racial
effect
is
identified
at
the
threshold
the
second
step
of
the
disparate
impact
analysis
involves
careful
consideration
of
the
affirmative
justifications
for
the
disparity
in
effect
the
analysis
roughly
weighs
positives
against
negatives
in
the
discriminatory
treatment
context
by
contrast
there
is
no
opportunity
to
identify
or
weigh
all
relevant
costs
as
a
result
when
a
race
based
criteria
is
used
as
in
brown
v
city
of
oneonta
n
a
court
inclined
to
permit
race
based
suspect
descriptions
as
cost
justified
will
find
it
easier
to
avoid
strict
scrutiny
by
declining
to
perceive
a
racial
classification
at
work
in
the
first
instance
n
on
the
other
side
of
the
ledger
disparate
impact
analysis
also
considers
the
aggregate
outcomes
of
a
policy
in
the
sqf
context
for
example
this
would
mean
counts
of
the
numbers
of
different
racial
groups
who
are
stopped
again
it
is
important
to
emphasize
that
this
is
not
a
full
tally
of
the
ecological
and
dynamic
spillovers
from
aggressive
sqf
policing
but
it
accounts
for
the
policy
s
sheer
size
and
hence
reflects
at
least
approximately
the
effect
of
a
large
number
of
minority
stops
on
self
worth
residential
patterns
and
the
diffusion
of
stereotypical
beliefs
about
the
links
between
race
and
crime
far
better
than
a
legal
framework
pinched
to
fit
cleanly
around
individual
motives
finally
disparate
impact
liability
obviates
the
need
to
make
controversial
judgments
about
individuals
intentions
beliefs
and
attitudes
by
focusing
attention
on
these
elusive
psychological
facts
both
terry
and
feeney
invite
self
deception
and
perjury
on
the
part
of
police
and
municipal
policymakers
the
feeney
framework
in
particular
also
ratchets
up
emotional
stakes
by
predicating
a
remedy
on
the
finding
that
a
specific
person
is
motivated
by
discriminatory
intent
a
standard
that
has
the
potential
to
induce
backlash
within
regulated
entities
such
as
police
forces
n
by
honing
in
upon
consequentialist
criteria
instead
the
disparate
impact
standard
obviates
loaded
and
easily
deflected
allegations
of
bad
intent
even
as
it
draws
salutary
attention
to
the
deeper
and
more
enduring
costs
of
sqf
to
be
clear
no
judicially
enforceable
theory
of
liability
will
provide
a
panacea
to
the
problem
of
concentrated
racialized
poverty
or
the
complex
network
of
state
action
and
inaction
that
created
and
perpetuated
it
the
case
for
disparate
impact
liability
in
the
policing
context
rests
on
the
more
modest
claim
that
it
captures
a
wider
array
of
morally
relevant
costs
and
benefits
than
the
available
alternatives
it
does
not
imply
perfection
c
the
objections
to
disparate
impact
in
the
policing
context
three
objections
to
the
application
of
disparate
impact
liability
to
the
policing
context
are
worth
resolving
before
turning
to
the
nitty
gritty
of
application
they
concern
its
constitutionality
its
efficacy
and
the
availability
of
popular
support
to
begin
with
there
has
recently
been
a
question
about
the
constitutionality
of
disparate
impact
liability
even
though
in
its
infancy
in
the
s
it
was
understood
as
an
important
strand
of
equal
protection
law
n
paradoxically
at
least
one
member
of
the
court
has
intimated
that
disparate
impact
might
itself
violate
the
equal
protection
clause
because
it
forces
race
consciousness
n
nevertheless
more
recent
precedent
suggests
that
there
is
no
constitutional
problem
in
the
existence
of
disparate
impact
prohibitions
but
that
those
prohibitions
might
raise
such
problems
in
their
application
n
in
particular
the
court
has
suggested
that
the
second
step
of
the
analysis
the
proffer
of
legitimate
justifications
for
a
disparity
is
key
in
glossing
the
fha
s
disparate
impact
prong
the
court
in
its
texas
department
of
housing
and
community
affairs
v
inclusive
communities
project
opinion
cautioned
that
constitutional
problems
would
arise
if
liability
were
imposed
based
solely
on
a
showing
of
a
statistical
disparity
n
rather
it
is
only
artificial
arbitrary
and
unnecessary
barriers
that
legitimately
and
constitutionally
trigger
such
liability
n
this
places
great
stress
on
the
opportunity
a
defendant
must
have
in
a
disparate
impact
proceeding
to
point
to
non
arbitrary
and
necessary
grounds
for
a
justification
n
more
specifically
a
regression
analysis
used
to
identify
a
race
effect
must
include
controls
for
legitimate
justifications
for
a
disparity
n
a
second
concern
raised
by
a
number
of
recent
commentators
is
that
the
disparate
impact
theory
has
produced
no
substantial
social
change
and
there
is
no
reason
to
think
that
extending
the
theory
to
other
contexts
would
have
produced
meaningful
reform
n
a
common
thread
uniting
these
concerns
is
the
premise
that
courts
are
unwilling
to
broadly
restructure
social
institutions
n
or
interfere
with
the
private
intra
firm
ordering
n
to
be
sure
the
frailty
of
the
judicial
will
to
enforce
constitutional
norms
on
behalf
of
disfavored
groups
cannot
be
overstated
nevertheless
blanket
pessimism
is
unwarranted
for
two
reasons
to
begin
with
several
cities
are
already
operating
under
consent
decrees
or
settlements
that
either
include
an
independent
monitor
or
envisage
much
judicially
supervised
reorganization
of
street
policing
n
further
there
is
no
reason
to
think
that
municipal
officials
involved
in
the
negotiation
and
operationalizing
of
these
deals
lack
any
interest
at
all
in
mitigating
the
fierce
public
pressure
to
diminish
the
racial
tensions
of
urban
policing
the
application
of
disparate
impact
liability
provides
a
more
cogent
way
for
them
to
understand
how
to
do
so
than
available
alternatives
in
addition
precise
agency
regulations
such
as
those
issued
in
under
the
fha
have
the
potential
to
stabilize
disparate
impact
law
and
to
provide
clarity
to
regulated
entities
subject
to
different
judicial
standards
n
there
is
no
reason
such
stabilization
cannot
be
achieved
in
the
policing
context
through
more
specific
justice
department
regulations
however
unlikely
these
might
be
in
the
near
term
indeed
the
more
granular
account
of
how
to
think
about
disparate
impact
in
the
context
of
policing
data
that
follows
in
part
iii
c
itself
can
do
double
duty
by
providing
a
framework
for
such
regulations
finally
it
might
be
argued
that
broad
support
for
aggressive
street
policing
within
minority
communities
provides
a
sufficient
justification
for
racially
disparate
allocation
of
terry
stops
n
if
the
very
communities
that
suffer
the
costs
of
intensive
policing
also
clamor
for
such
policing
the
moral
case
for
disparate
impact
liability
seems
thin
indeed
yet
evidence
for
community
demand
in
the
context
of
sqf
is
thin
on
the
ground
protests
in
chicago
new
york
and
philadelphia
about
stop
and
frisk
have
been
led
by
organizations
from
minority
communities
n
more
generally
to
the
extent
that
african
american
political
leaders
have
sought
increased
policing
there
have
been
accompanying
demands
to
redirect
power
and
economic
resources
to
low
income
minority
communities
n
but
when
blacks
ask
for
better
policing
legislators
tend
to
hear
more
instead
n
disparate
impact
liability
is
more
sensitive
to
the
marginal
crime
control
benefits
attached
to
sqf
as
well
as
its
costs
it
is
therefore
a
sensible
way
to
reconcile
minority
communities
demands
for
both
better
public
security
and
also
freedom
for
excessive
street
policing
cannot
d
disparate
impact
in
action
this
final
section
sketches
how
a
disparate
impact
analysis
of
sqf
data
might
be
put
into
action
its
twofold
aim
is
to
show
that
such
inquiries
are
feasible
and
to
start
to
make
progress
on
some
of
the
knotty
theoretical
puzzles
raised
by
disparate
impact
s
implementation
to
set
the
stage
for
this
inquiry
it
is
useful
to
consider
its
practical
context
the
settlements
in
philadelphia
and
chicago
which
were
both
reached
without
information
generating
litigation
require
ongoing
collection
of
extensive
data
concerning
the
timing
justifications
suspect
demographics
and
consequences
of
stops
n
how
might
this
data
be
interrogated
for
evidence
of
disparate
impact
how
concretely
can
one
inquiry
into
whether
a
discrete
practice
or
policy
causes
a
racially
disparate
impact
that
is
not
justified
on
legitimate
and
necessary
grounds
be
executed
in
answering
these
questions
i
focus
on
the
theoretical
questions
of
what
kinds
of
disparities
should
count
not
more
technical
questions
of
econometric
identification
strategy
a
disparate
racial
impact
can
result
from
one
of
three
elements
of
policing
strategy
each
of
the
latter
warrants
separate
and
distinct
analysis
at
each
level
racial
disparities
salient
to
the
distinctive
moral
wrong
of
sqf
can
emerge
and
at
each
level
the
state
can
also
avail
itself
of
different
legitimate
justifications
for
the
disparity
if
anything
the
feasible
analytic
tools
favor
the
state
as
a
result
disparate
impact
analysis
in
the
fashion
developed
here
is
decisively
under
inclusive
insofar
as
it
does
not
capture
all
the
ecological
and
dynamic
externalities
from
sqf
the
availability
of
plural
tests
to
capture
a
racially
disparate
effect
only
partially
compensate
for
this
lacuna
nevertheless
it
is
the
best
extant
doctrinal
framework
for
the
problem
and
also
likely
superior
to
anything
that
can
be
created
from
scratch
in
current
political
conditions
for
the
purpose
of
illustration
here
i
hypothesize
a
municipal
jurisdiction
that
has
just
entered
a
consent
decree
we
can
assume
that
like
new
york
philadelphia
and
chicago
this
municipality
is
racially
and
economically
segregated
with
race
and
socioeconomic
status
closely
covarying
we
can
also
assume
that
the
city
is
divided
into
precincts
which
are
the
foundational
elements
of
the
geographic
allocation
of
police
the
municipality
s
sqf
as
in
real
life
cases
is
directed
at
neighborhoods
of
concentrated
poverty
and
high
crime
which
are
also
predominantly
minority
the
municipality
is
required
to
gather
data
about
stops
of
the
kind
elicited
by
the
chicago
and
philadelphia
settlements
i
will
assume
police
collect
that
data
faithfully
n
i
focus
here
on
the
legal
question
of
what
questions
can
be
asked
of
the
resulting
data
i
discuss
each
three
levels
of
analysis
in
turn
for
each
level
i
identify
the
relevant
element
of
state
policy
or
practice
the
outcome
across
which
racial
disparities
may
be
observed
and
the
range
of
feasible
justifications
a
municipality
might
offer
where
possible
i
also
note
if
the
question
has
been
examined
in
an
existing
study
or
litigation
between
precinct
disparities
the
first
level
of
analysis
that
should
be
tested
is
the
rate
of
sqf
deployment
by
precinct
recall
that
the
core
justification
for
sqf
tendered
by
its
defenders
is
that
street
police
are
deployed
where
crime
occurs
racial
disparities
arise
only
because
crime
is
concentrated
in
minority
neighborhoods
n
but
this
may
not
be
the
case
perceptions
of
crime
can
also
be
a
function
of
the
racial
composition
of
a
neighborhood
n
a
threshold
policy
decision
to
be
tested
is
the
volume
of
terry
stop
per
precinct
with
a
lagged
measure
of
crime
as
a
control
this
is
a
way
of
determining
whether
the
geographical
distribution
of
policing
resources
turns
on
racial
demographics
or
crime
rates
n
for
example
jeffrey
fagan
tested
whether
the
number
of
stops
per
precinct
in
new
york
city
was
disproportionate
to
the
racial
composition
of
the
precinct
after
controlling
for
several
different
types
of
historical
crime
rate
n
his
analysis
suggested
that
crime
based
justification
for
sqf
s
allocation
was
unfounded
n
using
an
ordinary
least
squares
regression
he
found
that
the
percentage
of
african
american
residents
was
a
stronger
predictor
of
terry
stop
volume
than
lagged
rates
of
violent
crime
narcotics
offices
weapons
offenses
and
trespass
n
only
property
and
quality
of
life
rates
outperformed
race
as
predictors
of
stop
volume
n
this
is
an
especially
striking
result
given
sqf
s
justification
in
the
wake
of
the
kansas
city
experiment
as
a
means
of
reducing
violent
crime
and
as
an
alternative
to
broken
windows
policing
n
it
is
also
striking
because
the
assumption
that
an
increase
in
crime
rates
should
predict
a
subsequent
increase
in
street
stops
is
dubious
insofar
as
it
stacks
the
deck
in
the
state
s
favor
in
a
normative
troubling
way
the
use
of
lagged
crime
rates
as
a
control
assumes
that
the
only
available
or
perhaps
the
best
available
policing
response
to
upticks
in
crime
concern
is
more
intensive
street
policing
but
this
is
false
n
as
i
have
argued
the
evidence
that
sqf
has
a
large
crime
control
effect
is
weak
especially
in
comparison
to
alternative
policing
instruments
n
the
use
of
crime
rates
as
a
baseline
further
assumes
that
terry
stops
are
responsive
to
all
species
of
violent
crime
but
at
least
for
the
proportion
of
violent
crimes
that
occur
within
the
home
against
partners
or
other
intimates
it
is
hard
to
see
how
terry
stops
are
responsive
n
in
short
there
is
no
good
reason
to
assume
the
best
only
or
most
effective
response
to
rising
crime
rates
in
a
specific
neighborhood
is
to
increase
the
number
of
people
being
stopped
n
a
between
precinct
measure
of
racial
disparities
can
be
combined
with
a
range
of
other
measures
to
develop
a
more
nuanced
rendering
of
how
policing
resources
are
allocated
across
geographic
areas
hence
simple
descriptive
statistics
can
provide
useful
confirmatory
evidence
even
if
they
cannot
on
their
own
prove
disparate
impact
liability
consistent
with
inclusive
communities
n
the
data
might
be
further
interrogated
by
comparing
the
determinants
of
precinct
level
deployments
with
the
rate
of
stops
per
resident
conditional
on
racial
identity
n
where
such
citywide
tests
find
that
not
only
do
minority
neighborhoods
bear
a
disproportionate
toll
of
stops
but
minority
individuals
also
bear
a
larger
share
of
those
stops
there
is
reason
for
concern
that
sqf
is
not
only
regressive
in
effect
but
also
triggers
the
dynamic
vicious
circle
processes
described
in
part
i
c
in
addition
the
between
precinct
distribution
of
street
policing
is
usefully
contrasted
with
the
distribution
of
other
policing
resources
if
precincts
that
receive
intensive
terry
treatments
for
example
are
associated
with
lower
rates
of
other
policing
measures
e
g
they
have
fewer
officers
deployed
across
both
reactive
and
proactive
policing
or
they
have
persistently
longer
wait
times
for
calls
then
there
is
further
reason
for
skepticism
that
crime
control
simpliciter
in
fact
explains
or
justifies
racial
disparities
in
stops
across
geographic
subunits
within
the
municipality
within
precinct
disparities
the
next
level
of
analysis
focuses
on
the
distribution
of
terry
stops
by
racial
or
ethnic
group
within
a
precinct
between
precinct
tests
are
incomplete
because
even
if
there
are
no
between
precinct
disparities
a
disparate
racial
impact
might
emerge
within
a
given
precinct
if
racial
minorities
engaged
in
the
same
potentially
criminal
conduct
as
non
minorities
are
more
likely
holding
all
else
constant
to
be
stopped
or
otherwise
policed
than
non
minorities
in
the
same
position
the
intuition
that
racial
minorities
may
be
overpoliced
in
comparison
to
similar
non
minority
citizens
is
easy
to
see
in
the
context
of
racially
heterogeneous
central
business
districts
where
minority
citizens
may
be
perceived
as
categorically
out
of
place
and
hence
suspicious
but
the
same
disparity
can
arise
even
in
poorer
majority
minority
neighborhoods
a
pair
of
studies
of
narcotics
policing
in
seattle
by
katherine
beckett
and
her
colleagues
nicely
illustrate
how
race
might
figure
in
within
precinct
dynamics
in
this
way
their
first
study
demonstrated
among
other
things
that
in
the
capitol
hill
neighborhood
of
seattle
three
percent
of
those
purchasing
narcotics
were
african
american
while
of
those
arrested
were
african
american
n
their
second
study
found
that
predominantly
white
outdoor
drug
markets
received
far
less
attention
from
police
than
racially
diverse
ones
such
that
the
geographic
concentration
of
law
enforcement
resources
was
a
significant
cause
of
racial
disparity
n
indeed
a
qualitative
component
of
the
study
found
that
police
officers
flagged
one
racially
diverse
crack
market
while
failing
to
mention
a
similar
but
overwhelmingly
white
market
for
prescription
drugs
operating
alongside
it
n
of
special
note
here
beckett
and
her
collaborators
explicitly
consider
the
possibility
that
differences
in
the
policing
of
crack
cocaine
and
prescription
drug
markets
may
have
been
due
to
different
levels
of
associated
violence
n
they
find
however
that
the
association
between
crack
and
violence
does
not
appear
to
have
existed
in
seattle
during
the
period
under
investigation
n
these
studies
findings
echo
sociological
findings
of
how
racial
composition
often
predicts
perceptions
of
crime
and
historical
findings
about
the
deep
roots
of
stereotypes
of
black
criminality
they
demonstrate
the
importance
of
a
nuanced
and
contextualized
analysis
of
what
is
happening
within
heavily
policed
neighborhoods
rather
than
a
blase
assumption
that
heavy
policing
in
high
crime
neighborhoods
is
necessarily
even
handed
or
efficacious
a
within
precinct
analysis
usefully
considers
whether
the
rate
of
minority
stops
is
better
predicted
by
legitimate
policing
grounds
or
suspects
race
conditional
on
certain
precinct
level
characteristics
within
a
pool
of
stop
related
data
the
number
of
stops
per
ethnic
group
within
a
given
time
period
would
be
the
outcome
i
e
dependent
variable
to
be
explained
n
for
a
given
precinct
one
could
ask
whether
there
is
a
statistically
significant
correlation
between
the
rate
of
stops
and
the
fact
individual
suspects
are
african
american
or
hispanic
rather
than
white
after
controlling
for
relevant
precinct
level
characteristics
some
existing
studies
deploy
a
method
called
multilevel
modeling
to
control
simultaneously
for
individual
and
precinct
level
factors
n
i
will
assume
that
approach
is
valid
although
nothing
rests
on
that
assumption
so
long
as
some
parallel
econometric
technique
is
available
the
pivotal
question
for
such
multilevel
models
is
the
choice
of
control
variables
to
capture
non
arbitrary
and
necessary
justifications
n
a
disparate
impact
model
should
include
only
control
variables
that
provide
normatively
valid
justifications
for
a
within
precinct
racial
disparity
in
this
regard
it
is
fundamentally
dissimilar
from
tests
for
discriminatory
motives
a
regression
based
test
for
the
latter
operates
by
excluding
all
possible
explanations
for
a
stop
except
for
the
race
of
a
suspect
the
study
employed
in
the
new
york
litigation
for
example
controls
for
the
foreign
born
proportion
of
a
precinct
socioeconomic
status
and
the
presence
of
a
business
district
n
but
a
racial
disparate
impact
as
a
matter
of
law
arises
not
only
when
there
is
no
other
possible
explanation
for
a
racial
gap
in
stop
rates
it
additionally
arises
when
there
is
no
legitimate
explanation
related
to
policing
goals
for
that
gap
in
this
regard
the
economic
analysis
of
disparate
impacts
is
unlike
the
large
array
of
econometric
studies
that
focus
on
a
causal
if
then
question
and
treat
randomized
trials
as
an
ideal
n
variables
such
as
the
socioeconomic
character
of
a
precinct
its
foreign
born
populace
and
officer
race
have
no
place
in
disparate
impact
analysis
n
their
inclusion
leads
to
included
variable
bias
insofar
as
they
would
not
plausibly
justify
a
racial
disparity
in
outcomes
n
even
when
included
in
disparate
treatment
analyses
they
result
in
bloated
statistical
models
so
chock
full
of
covariates
i
e
control
variables
that
any
evidence
of
disparate
treatment
disappears
n
in
several
existing
studies
lagged
crime
or
violent
crime
rates
are
used
as
the
baseline
control
in
this
sort
of
multilevel
model
n
this
parameter
at
least
relates
directly
to
the
notional
justification
that
a
municipality
has
for
increased
street
stops
i
e
crime
related
patterns
subject
to
the
concerns
raised
above
n
it
captures
the
ways
in
which
deployment
levels
might
fluctuate
in
response
to
shifts
in
the
geographic
distribution
of
crime
it
is
also
likely
to
be
superior
to
a
benchmark
of
lagged
arrest
rates
which
is
employed
in
some
models
n
the
latter
are
potentially
influenced
by
officers
racial
beliefs
to
this
end
a
recent
metastudy
of
the
effect
of
suspect
race
on
arrest
decisions
found
that
minorities
are
at
least
thirty
percent
more
likely
to
be
arrested
as
similar
non
minority
suspects
n
historical
arrest
rates
thus
provide
a
distorted
baseline
which
obscures
potential
racial
disparities
in
stops
by
implicitly
controlling
for
officer
bias
it
is
worth
underscoring
once
more
that
the
racial
composition
of
the
pool
of
those
suspected
of
a
crime
or
arrested
for
a
crime
is
by
no
means
an
unproblematic
benchmark
for
the
racial
composition
of
those
subject
to
a
terry
stop
even
within
a
particular
neighborhood
the
best
argument
from
using
such
data
as
a
benchmark
in
my
view
focuses
solely
on
racial
composition
of
the
local
violent
offender
population
it
hypothesizes
that
police
focus
either
on
people
or
places
associated
with
higher
violent
crime
risk
given
racial
segregation
and
racial
divides
between
social
groups
it
is
then
predicted
that
the
racial
composition
of
the
stopped
population
will
track
that
of
the
at
risk
population
setting
aside
questions
about
the
efficacy
of
sqf
generally
as
a
crime
control
measure
there
are
nonetheless
three
reasons
for
skepticism
of
even
this
benchmark
first
this
logic
assumes
that
municipalities
can
accurately
zero
in
on
not
just
places
but
persons
who
present
a
risk
of
violence
it
is
not
clear
that
this
is
so
for
example
a
recent
study
of
chicago
s
strategic
subjects
list
which
was
used
in
this
fashion
found
that
individuals
on
the
city
s
list
were
no
more
or
less
likely
to
be
victimized
by
violence
than
a
control
group
n
second
if
sqf
focuses
on
places
rather
than
persons
the
number
of
individuals
involved
in
violent
crime
is
still
a
small
fraction
of
the
volume
of
people
stopped
n
in
the
exceptionally
bloody
month
of
august
in
chicago
for
example
ninety
people
were
killed
by
gunfire
n
the
number
of
stops
that
month
was
likely
at
least
two
orders
of
magnitude
greater
even
assuming
that
the
chicago
police
in
that
month
were
focused
accurately
on
corners
where
violence
was
likely
to
occur
more
than
one
hundred
instances
of
reasonable
articulable
suspicion
were
being
targeted
for
every
one
act
of
violence
and
even
if
police
then
have
reason
to
anticipate
a
particular
corner
or
street
will
witness
violence
at
a
minimum
some
ninety
nine
out
of
every
one
hundred
stops
will
have
no
relation
to
that
violence
historical
patterns
of
violence
cannot
explain
why
reasonable
articulable
suspicion
existed
for
those
individuals
the
racial
demographics
of
violent
crimes
or
violent
crime
related
arrests
on
a
given
street
or
corner
do
not
necessarily
predict
the
racial
distribution
of
reasonable
articulable
suspicion
that
police
can
witness
at
any
given
moment
in
time
for
most
stops
most
of
the
time
therefore
it
seems
likely
that
historical
crime
rates
will
be
orthogonal
to
the
incidence
of
a
terry
stop
finally
imagine
a
municipality
that
affirmatively
directs
its
police
to
engage
in
a
pattern
of
stops
that
mimics
the
racial
distribution
of
violent
crime
offenders
in
many
contexts
that
distribution
will
skew
heavily
towards
african
americans
and
to
a
lesser
extent
hispanics
this
is
in
effect
a
system
of
racial
quotas
where
some
large
fraction
of
those
subject
to
state
coercion
suffer
that
fate
based
solely
on
their
race
rather
than
their
own
past
conduct
especially
given
the
weak
empirical
support
for
sqf
s
efficacy
such
a
policy
raises
stark
equal
protection
concerns
even
under
the
supreme
court
s
current
highly
restrictive
view
of
the
doctrine
n
instead
of
using
crime
rates
violent
crime
rates
or
analogous
arrest
rates
as
a
benchmark
of
just
policing
therefore
a
study
of
disparate
impact
would
ideally
track
beckett
and
colleagues
seattle
study
in
estimating
the
racial
composition
of
the
baseline
population
subject
to
police
action
through
ethnographic
observation
of
open
air
drug
markets
and
other
means
n
ideally
that
is
data
would
be
sampled
perhaps
from
police
body
cameras
to
estimate
the
racial
composition
of
the
population
observed
on
patrol
for
whom
reasonable
articulable
suspicion
obtained
if
like
police
in
beckett
s
studies
officers
tended
to
ignore
non
minority
offenders
while
stopping
minority
offenders
a
within
precinct
disparity
would
be
established
with
certainty
such
an
approach
is
hardly
impossible
indeed
a
recent
study
of
oakland
policing
used
text
analysis
of
sound
recordings
from
officers
body
cameras
to
identify
differential
racial
treatment
of
citizens
during
street
encounters
n
within
and
between
officer
disparities
finally
racial
disparities
can
emerge
not
only
at
the
aggregate
levels
of
between
and
within
precincts
n
they
can
also
arise
either
because
some
or
all
officers
within
a
precinct
differentiate
between
minority
and
non
minority
suspects
without
a
legitimate
justification
this
level
of
police
action
which
comprises
the
dispersed
exercise
of
individual
officers
discretion
demands
attention
to
the
specific
sequence
of
distinct
police
actions
embedded
within
a
particular
interaction
ranging
from
the
decision
to
stop
the
decision
to
frisk
the
use
of
force
and
the
imposition
of
subsequent
consequences
such
as
citations
or
arrests
given
the
existence
of
outstanding
warrants
as
a
reason
for
arrests
however
the
latter
are
a
particularly
tricky
variable
to
analyze
because
they
may
be
unrelated
to
the
initial
stop
i
sketch
here
the
most
promising
approaches
for
identifying
racial
disparities
at
the
individual
officer
level
i
then
caution
against
the
use
of
the
most
popular
economic
model
of
police
stops
commonly
known
as
the
kpt
model
as
neither
apposite
nor
realistic
as
a
framework
for
analyzing
sqf
individual
officers
might
create
racially
disparate
effects
in
two
distinct
ways
first
the
terry
standard
of
reasonable
articulable
suspicion
is
a
vague
term
with
a
range
of
possible
calibrations
n
some
or
all
officers
might
apply
stronger
or
weaker
evidentiary
predicates
for
stops
of
different
racial
groups
second
as
fryer
s
powerful
analysis
of
new
york
policing
demonstrates
officers
might
differentially
treat
minorities
who
have
been
stopped
by
employing
a
greater
quantum
of
violence
other
outcomes
such
as
citations
and
arrests
might
also
be
disparately
allocated
disparities
in
both
stop
rates
and
post
stop
outcomes
should
be
analyzed
in
a
disparate
impact
analysis
on
the
stop
rate
question
a
simple
measure
is
to
rerun
the
multilevel
models
used
for
within
precinct
disparities
using
officers
rather
than
precincts
as
the
relevant
unit
of
analysis
and
lagged
crime
rates
measured
at
the
smallest
available
geographic
unit
as
a
control
n
a
parallel
analysis
can
be
run
for
outcomes
such
as
the
seizure
of
contraband
or
firearms
n
again
included
variable
bias
would
result
if
controls
other
than
legitimate
policing
justification
such
as
the
lagged
crime
rate
measure
were
included
alternatively
a
more
promising
approach
involves
the
use
of
the
stop
level
hit
rate
shr
or
the
ex
ante
probability
of
discovering
contraband
or
a
weapon
based
on
what
an
officer
knows
before
a
stop
n
focusing
on
weapons
related
stops
sharad
goel
and
his
colleagues
first
use
two
years
worth
of
historical
stop
forms
to
calculate
the
actual
probability
of
finding
a
weapon
for
various
combinations
of
factors
listed
on
stop
forms
as
the
basis
of
reasonable
articulable
suspicion
along
with
location
timing
and
local
hit
rate
data
n
this
enables
them
to
calculate
the
distribution
of
ex
ante
probabilities
of
finding
weapons
for
minorities
and
non
minorities
both
in
general
and
holding
location
constant
n
in
effect
by
comparing
the
distribution
of
shrs
for
blacks
and
whites
they
show
that
the
effective
quantum
of
reasonable
articulable
suspicion
for
minorities
is
lower
than
that
for
non
minorities
n
the
same
analysis
might
be
executed
by
precinct
or
by
officer
to
determine
if
racial
disparities
are
either
geographically
concentrated
or
the
work
of
a
small
fraction
of
officers
rather
than
following
goel
s
lead
the
economics
literature
is
dominated
by
a
model
by
john
knowles
nicola
persico
and
petra
todd
known
as
the
kpt
model
n
in
capsule
form
kpt
is
a
game
theoretical
model
of
traffic
stops
in
which
police
seek
to
maximize
arrests
and
both
black
and
white
motorists
maximize
contraband
police
observe
race
both
they
and
motorists
strategically
anticipate
the
other
s
actions
kpt
predicts
a
nash
equilibrium
in
which
blacks
and
whites
are
stopped
at
different
rates
while
the
probability
of
finding
contraband
i
e
the
hit
rate
across
groups
is
equal
n
the
force
of
the
kpt
model
is
to
show
how
what
at
first
seems
a
racial
disparity
unequal
stop
rates
is
in
fact
explained
by
dynamic
strategic
action
by
both
police
and
motorists
n
as
a
correlative
differences
in
hit
rates
provide
evidence
of
taste
based
discrimination
for
a
number
of
reasons
though
the
kpt
model
is
not
well
suited
to
identify
the
core
wrong
of
racially
disparate
policing
to
begin
with
kpt
is
informative
only
about
bias
in
searches
not
in
stops
n
it
is
also
a
model
for
detecting
taste
based
discrimination
or
animus
rather
than
the
use
of
race
as
an
accurate
generalization
or
the
disparate
racial
impact
of
another
factor
e
g
socioeconomic
status
n
stated
otherwise
it
ignores
all
negative
externalities
from
race
based
policing
n
even
in
this
more
limited
compass
its
core
equilibrium
concept
rests
on
the
questionable
assumption
that
police
and
motorists
know
of
and
dynamically
adapt
to
each
other
s
behavior
n
extensions
of
their
work
that
vary
the
models
show
that
equal
hit
rates
might
also
be
consistent
with
racial
animus
n
because
the
modeling
assumptions
of
kpt
are
so
controversial
and
its
implications
so
fragile
in
the
face
of
subtle
changes
in
relevant
actors
information
and
motivation
in
my
view
it
does
not
provide
a
useful
lens
even
for
the
limited
question
of
whether
there
is
animus
based
searches
in
the
first
instance
conclusion
aggressive
deployment
of
terry
stops
has
been
a
point
of
friction
between
urban
police
and
impoverished
minority
communities
for
more
than
fifty
years
there
has
been
a
moment
of
late
in
which
a
measure
of
reform
appeared
politically
feasible
or
so
the
recent
spate
of
settlements
and
consent
decrees
might
suggest
n
it
may
well
be
that
this
window
is
closing
due
to
national
level
political
changes
but
the
underlying
problems
of
discriminatory
policing
popular
dissatisfaction
with
excessive
and
onerous
street
hassle
and
the
frequency
of
police
violence
will
not
go
away
even
if
the
federal
government
fails
to
act
there
are
local
state
and
private
actors
with
strong
incentives
to
press
for
reform
nevertheless
without
a
clear
account
of
why
and
when
aggressive
deployment
of
terry
stops
can
be
a
moral
wrong
we
will
not
have
a
clear
sense
of
when
or
how
we
might
deploy
law
to
remedy
it
to
this
end
this
article
has
aimed
to
specify
the
distinctive
moral
wrong
of
sqf
and
to
demonstrate
that
the
law
does
have
resources
to
identify
it
my
central
claim
has
been
that
a
disparate
impact
lens
applicable
to
police
pursuant
to
title
vi
and
state
law
provides
a
better
vantage
point
than
black

constitutional
law
by
demonstrating
that
a
disparate
impact
lens
is
constitutional
potent
and
practicable
in
terms
of
its
implementation
i
hope
to
prompt
a
deeper
conversation
about
the
positive
role
that
law

the

sore
that

minority
police

in

today
what
i
have
offered
here
though
is
emphatically
only
the
beginning
of
that
story
the
law
i
have
shown
can
be
used
to
identify
instances
in
which
street
policing
plays
a
role
in
perpetuating
and
deepening
racial
and
social
stratification
once
identified
dysfunctional
policing
must
be
remedied
through
political
pressure
and
legal
injunctions
that
will
vary
from
jurisdiction
to
jurisdiction
n
there
is
no
universal
panacea
police
reform
moreover
is
only
one
element
of
a
larger
necessary
program
of
social
reform
necessary
to
dislodge
the
persistence
of
racialized
concentrated
poverty
police
do
not
create
ghettos
nor
will
getting
policing
right
dissolve
ghettos
overnight
nevertheless
doing
the
hard
work
of
police
reform
is
a
necessary
step
in
rectifying
the
historical
blight
of
entrenched
racial
stratification

many
of
its
reasons

statistical

are
plainly
spurious

example

asserted
that

might
more

be

if
there
were
fewer
entities

fewer

id
at
this

understand
in
the
absence
of
discretion
there
would
be
no
opportunity
for
a
state
actor
to
take
a
decision
motivated
by
a
discriminatory
purpose
to
insulate
discretionary
decisions
from

that
artificial

will
eventually
displace
many
jobs
martin
ford
author
of
rise
of
the
robots
technology
and
the
threat
of
a
jobless
future
opined
that
jobs
that
entail
computer
manipulation
of
data
in
routine
and
predictable
ways
are
vulnerable
to
automation
for
example
the
predictive
policing
system
predpol
deployed
by
the
los
angeles
police
department
lapd
reportedly
outperformed
experienced
lapd
analysts
in
forecasting
crime
such
zero
sum
fears
are
not
entirely
unfounded
as
advances
in
machine
learning
suggest
that
ai
can
emulate
and
might
even
surpass
human
abilities
to
manage
the
expected
loss
of
jobs
a
guiding
framework
for
ai
adoption
was
proposed
at
the
world
economic
forum
annual
meeting
in
january
recommending
approaches
to
ensure
that
ai
augments
rather
than
replace
human
workers
in
the
same
vein
the
plausible
impact
of
ai
on
law
enforcement
jobs
should
be
anticipated
the
mission
of
law
enforcement
is
set
to
be
more
challenging
given
the
confluence
of
burgeoning
centrality
of
cities
evolving
transnational
crime
and
security
threats
with
the
use
of
ubiquitous
police
closed
circuit
television
camera
surveillance
to
counter
urban
terrorism
for
example
police
and
homeland
security
functions
are
increasingly
interwoven
and
data
driven
hence
law
enforcement
intelligence
analysts
would
certainly
benefit
from
employing
both
human
and
ai
insights
in
the
analyses
of
a
multitude
of
strategic
and
tactical
threats
ai
technologies
have
been
trailed
in
predictive
policing
and
video
surveillance
and
have
shown
promise
their
strength
is
the
ability
to
expeditiously
process
massive
volumes
of
data
detect
patterns
even
if
complex
and
obscure
and
emulate
the
human
brain
in
learning
from
human
inputs
and
from
trial
and
error
however
ai
s
ability
to
self
learn
raises
the
concern
that
human
analysts
would
eventually
become
obsolete
predpol
for
example
tried
to
assuage
this
concern
by
emphasising
that
its
algorithms
do
not
replace
but
require
analysts
inputs
to
perform
effectively
and
adapt
to
changing
needs
the
current
state
of
ai
is
that
its
learning
capacity
still
needs
to
be
honed
hence
its
reliability
may
not
be
unlimited
it
can
for
example
decipher
many
but
not
all
aspects
of
criminal
human
behaviour
the
misbehaving
chat
bot
tay
that
learned
to
spew
racist
rants
demonstrated
the
potential
risks
of
ai
s
limitations
in
terms
of
possible
unintended
consequences
similarly
an
underperforming
ai
could
potentially
impair
intelligence
analysis
and
drive
miscalculations
in
operational
strategy
and
deployment
with
grave
implications
on
public
security
given
the
fallibility
of
ai
and
that
intelligence
analysis
is
too
critical
a
security
function
to
be
entrusted
totally
to
it
there
should
be
calculated
human
oversight
of
its
use
this
requires
law
enforcement
agencies
to
retain
the
tacit
knowledge
and
experience
of
analysts
according
to
research
cited
in
the
book
critical
knowledge
transfer
by
harvard
business
school
high
level
corporate
executives
remain
doubtful
that
the
deep
knowledge
and
experience
of
human
experts
could
ever
be
fully
codified
into
algorithms
furthermore
society
may
be
ambivalent
about
delegating
machines
with
the
responsibility
to
solve
human
crime
and
security
issues
as
exemplified
by
concerns
over
racial
discrimination
and
false
positives
arising
from
the
reported
use
of
an
ai
technology
beware
by
chicago
police
to
generate
a
hit
list
of
suspects
subject
to
the
nature
of
threat
ai
s
assessments
might
not
be
comprehensive
if
consumed
in
isolation
ai
might
not
provide
all
the
answers
and
analysts
would
find
it
necessary
to
question
its
assessments
in
certain
situations
for
the
purposes
of
corroboration
and
plugging
of
information
gaps
analysts
would
have
to
fuse
ai
s
assessments
with
information
collected
from
other
sources
such
as
human
intelligence
such
information
might
reside
outside
databases
yet
appreciable
as
it
could
relate
to
criminal
motivation
unreported
incidents
and
first
time
offenders
clean
skins
therefore
could
shape
operational
strategies
adversaries
may
seek
to
outsmart
law
enforcement
ai
technologies
to
evade
detection
and
arrest
by
manipulating
the
data
inputs
of
big
data
and
open
source
information
hence
the
analysts
judgement
and
intuition
could
complement
ai
as
bulwarks
against
intelligent
adversaries
analysts
could
be
drivers
rather
than
passengers
of
change
by
being
co
developers
of
ai
technologies
a
study
on
exploring
the
potential
for
using
ai
techniques
in
police
report
analysis
by
the
university
of
gothenburg
sweden
highlighted
the
importance
of
incorporating
analysts
insights
into
the
iterative
process
of
machine
learning
to
improve
ai
s
ability
to
discern
complex
patterns
the
prospects
of
ai
learning
everything
and
replacing
analysts
could
be
managed
with
a
framework
to
redesign
analysts
business
processes
to
focus
on
two
higher
value
work
streams
first
given
the
need
for
human
oversight
analysts
could
double
hat
as
algorithmists
who
are
internal
auditors
tasked
with
promoting
best
practices
in
the
application
of
ai
and
review
its
assessments
to
ensure
standards
and
accuracy
and
second
analysts
could
support
strategy
formulation
through
qualitative
research
into
the
underlying
and
interrelated
factors
of
threats
such
as
cross
border
demographic
economic
and
terrain
issues
which
may
influence
criminal
human
behaviour
the
insights
could
enrich
ai
s
data
driven
assessment
or
develop
directions
for
further
analyses
by
ai
given
finite
resources
analysts
could
support
frontline
policing
by
helping
to
prioritise
threats
flagged
by
ai
these
tasks
would
require
analysts
to
foster
deeper
collaboration
with
field
officers
and
various
stakeholders
within
security
and
non
security
agencies
ultimately
ai
would
inevitably
transform
the
intelligence
analyst
s
profession
in
law
enforcement
just
as
how
the
patrol
car
and
two

radio
revolutionised
policing
in

remove

making

even

few
of
the

producing
them
have

they

we
need
to
know
more
because
it
s
clear
that
such
systems
face
a
fundamental
problem
the
data
they
rely
on
are
collected
by
a
criminal

system
in
which
race
makes
a
big
difference
in
the
probability
of

even
for
people
who
behave
identically
inputs
derived
from
biased
policing
will
inevitably
make
black
and
latino
defendants
look
riskier
than
white
defendants
to
a
computer
as
a
result
data
driven
decision
making
risks
exacerbating
rather
than
eliminating
racial
bias
in
criminal
justice
consider
a
judge
tasked
with
making
a
decision
about
bail
for
two
defendants
one
black
and
one
white
our
two
defendants
have
behaved
in
exactly
the
same
way
prior
to
their
arrest
they
used
drugs
in
the
same
amount
have
committed
the
same
traffic
offenses
owned
similar
homes
and
took
their
two
children
to
the
same
school
every
morning
but
the
criminal
justice
algorithms
do
not
rely
on
all
of
a
defendant
s
prior
actions
to
reach
a
bail
assessment
just
those
actions
for
which
he
or
she
has
been
previously
arrested
and
convicted
because
of
racial
biases
in
arrest
and
conviction
rates
the
black
defendant
is
more
likely
to
have
a
prior
conviction
than
the
white
one
despite
identical
conduct
a
risk
assessment
relying
on
racially
compromised
criminal
history
data
will
unfairly
rate
the
black
defendant
as
riskier
than
the
white
defendant
to
make
matters
worse
risk
assessment
tools
typically
evaluate
their
success
in
predicting
a
defendant
s
dangerousness
on
rearrests
not
on
defendants
overall
behavior
after
release
if
our
two
defendants
return
to
the
same
neighborhood
and
continue
their
identical
lives
the
black
defendant
is
more
likely
to
be
arrested
thus
the
tool
will
falsely
appear
to
predict
dangerousness
effectively
because
the
entire
process
is
circular
racial
disparities
in
arrests
bias
both
the
predictions
and
the
justification
for
those
predictions
we
know
that
a
black
person
and
a
white
person
are
not
equally
likely
to
be
stopped
by
police
evidence
on
new
york
s
stop

frisk
policy
investigatory
stops
vehicle
searches
and
drug
arrests
show
that
black
and
latino
civilians
are
more
likely
to
be
stopped
searched
and
arrested
than
whites

the
following

before
adopting

the
judicial
decision
making
process
jurisdictions
should
demand
that
any
tool
being
implemented
undergo
a
thorough
and
independent
peer
review
process
we
need
more
transparency
and
better
data
to
learn
whether
these
risk
assessments
have
disparate
impacts
on
defendants
of
different
races
foundations
and
organizations
developing
risk
assessment
tools
should
be
willing
to
release
the
data
used
to
build
these
tools
to
researchers
to
evaluate
their
techniques
for
internal
racial
bias
and
problems
of
statistical
interpretation
even
better
with
multiple
sources
of

researchers
could
identify
biases
in
data
generated
by
the
criminal
justice
system
before
the
data
is
used
to
make
decisions
about
liberty
unfortunately
producers
of
risk
assessment
tools
even
nonprofit
organizations
have
not
voluntarily
released
anonymized
data
and
computational
details
to
other
researchers
as
is
now
standard
in
quantitative
social
science
research
for
these
tools
to
make
racially
unbiased
predictions
they
must
use
racially
unbiased
data
we
cannot
trust
the
current
risk
assessment
tools
to
make
important
decisions
about
our
neighbors
liberty
unless
we
believe
contrary
to
social
science
research
that
data
on
arrests
offer
an
accurate
and
unbiased
representation
of
behavior
rather
than
telling
us

according

mta
chief

the

introduction
during
the
presidential
campaign
then
candidate
donald
j
trump
announced
his
intention
to
impose
a
muslim
ban
which
would
prohibit
muslim
entry
into
the
united
states
n
as
part
of
his
counterterrorism
strategy
shortly
before
his
election
trump
also
announced
a
proposal
for
the
extreme
vetting
of
immigrants
and
refugees
n
trump
clarified
that
the
muslim
ban
is
something
that
in
some
form
has
morphed
into
an
extreme
vetting
protocol
from
certain
areas
of
the
world
n
on
january
during
his
first
week
as
president
trump
signed
executive
order
titled
protecting
the
nation
from
foreign
terrorist
entry
into
the
united
states
the
january
order
n
litigation
concerning
the
constitutionality
of
this
executive
order
n
focused
on
sections
and
c
provisions
that
relate
to
barring
the
entry
of
travelers
and
refugees
from
specific
muslim
majority
countries
into
the
united
states
n
these
controversial
provisions
were
challenged
as
violating
equal
protection
due
process
and
the
establishment
clause
of
the
first
amendment
among
other
constitutional
and
statutory
claims
n
on
march
president
trump
issued
a
revised
executive
order
the
march
order
executive
order
issued
under
the
same
title
as
the
january
order
protecting
the
nation
from
foreign
terrorist
entry
into
the
united
states
the
march
order
superseded
the
january
order
n
however
it
left
the
extreme
vetting
provisions
of
the
january
order
in
place
n
and
in
fact
expanded
the
vetting
requirements
in
several
respects
n
the
extreme
vetting
requirements
of
the
march
order
are
now
most
fully
articulated
in
section
titled
implementing
uniform
screening
and
vetting
standards
for
all
immigration
programs
n
the
travel
restrictions
and
the
vetting
requirements
were
expanded
yet
again
in
a
third
iteration
of
the
muslim
ban
also
referred
to
as
the
travel
ban
or
the
entry
ban
on
september
shortly
before
oral
argument
was
scheduled
for
the
u
s
supreme
court
on
october
in
the
consolidated
travel
ban
cases
of
trump
v
hawaii
and
trump
v
international
refugee
assistance
project
n
president
trump
signed
a
new
proclamation
the
september
order
n
the
september
order
is
titled
enhancing
vetting
capabilities
and
processes
for
detecting
attempted
entry
into
the
united
states
by
terrorists
or
other
public
safety
threats
n
thus
the
most
recent
order
as
implied
by
the
title
focuses
more
squarely
on
the
extreme
vetting
provisions
set
forth
by
the
prior
orders
more
specifically
sections
a
through
h
of
the
september
order
focus
on
identity
management
and
information
sharing
capabilities
protocols
and
practices
related
to
immigration
screening
and
vetting
n
the
next
day
the
court
ordered
briefing
as
to
whether
the
travel
ban
cases
that
had
been
scheduled
for
oral
argument
on
october
were
moot
n
at
the
time
of
publication
the
litigation
remains
ongoing
including
challenges
to
the
september
order
n
regardless
of
the
final
disposition
of
these
litigation
matters
it
is
significant
to
note
that
the
extreme
vetting
provisions
of
the
original
and
revised
executive
orders
have
received
less
judicial
attention
than
the
travel
restrictions
n
the
extreme
vetting
provisions
do
not
appear
to
be
dependent
upon
the
authority
of
the
orders
and
are
presented
in
the
orders
as
an
evolving
and
prospective
administrative
matter
n
thus
the
vetting
provisions
of
the
march
order
and
the
september
order
may
not
be
fully
challenged
n
this
article
focuses
on
the
long
term
impact
of
modern
vetting
requirements
such
as
those
prescribed
in
the
executive
orders
referenced
above
n
and
other
immigration
related
screening
protocols
that
are
increasingly
algorithmically
anchored
it
contends
that
the
implementation
of
expanded
vetting
protocols
n
risks
implications
that
may
be
undertheorized
due
to
an
underappreciation
of
the
mass
cybersurveillance
and
disparate
impact
consequences
that
surround
current
screening
measures
broadly
promulgated
by
the
u
s
department
of
homeland
security
dhs
specifically
this
article
advances
the
claim
that
dhs
vetting
and
screening
protocols
risk
introducing
an
algorithmically
driven
and
technologically
enhanced
form
of
jim
crow
n
unlike
the
separate
but
equal
n
de
jure
discrimination
n
of
a
historic
jim
crow
regime
algorithmic
jim
crow
risks
imposing
both
de
jure
and
de
facto
discrimination
n
through
an
equal
but
separate
n
regime
this
article
explains
how
algorithmic
jim
crow
is
an
outgrowth
of
a
digital
era
that
exploits
cybersurveillance
n
and
dataveillance
n
systems
that
are
rapidly
proliferating
in
both
the
public
n
and
private
sectors
n
this
article
demonstrates
how
immigration
related
vetting
and
database
screening
protocols
utilize
newly
developed
big
data
n
screening
tracking
and
profiling
tools
that
attempt
to
verify
identity
and
assess
future
risk
n
these
tools
are
now
actively
deployed
by
dhs
n
and
utilize
databases
operated
by
the
military
n
and
intelligence
communities
n
currently
vetting
and
screening
protocols
often
begin
with
biometric
identification
n
for
example
the
digital
collection
and
screening
of
scanned
fingerprints
through
federal
and
state
biometric
databases
in
the
united
states
and
international
biometric
databases
such
as
those
operated
by
icpo
interpol
interpol
n
biometric
data
currently
collected
by
dhs
include
scanned
fingerprints
n
and
irises
n
digital
photos
for
facial
recognition
technology
n
and
dna
n
consequently
implementation
of
extreme
vetting
protocols
will
likely
include
proposals
for
a
tamper
resistant
and
fraud
proof
biometric
electronic
identity
card
n
such
as
a
biometric
epassport
n
the
trump
administration
s
executive
orders
for
example
specifically
mandate
expedited
completion
of
the
biometric
entry
exit
tracking
system
by
dhs
n
as
part
of
new
vetting
protocols
dhs
also
seeks
social

identification
data
n
and
plans
to
seek
social
media
user
credentials
n
such
as
passwords
to
facebook
accounts
of

and

applicants
n
newly
developed
big
data
cybersurveillance
tools
fuse
biometric
data
with
biographic
data
and
internet
and
social
media
profiling
to
assess
risk
n
this
article
aims
to
explain
how
big
data
vetting
is
mistakenly
presented
as
a
procedure
that
is
restricted
to
noncitizens
immigrants
refugee
and
asylum
applicants
and
visitors
seeking
a
travel
visa
to
the
united
states
instead
such
vetting
is
part
of
a
web
of
technologies
that
dhs
has
termed
identity
management
n
the
application
of
these
technologies
may
eventually
extend
to
the
entire
citizenry
through
a
variety
of
policy
proposals
including
a
biometric
national
identification
system
and
various
mandatory
vetting
and
database
screening
programs
identity
management
programs
attempt
to
authenticate
identity
and
assess
the
risk
factors
across
entire
populations
including
the
u
s
citizenry
big
data
vetting
thus
is
misunderstood
as
a
protocol
that
is
likely
to
be
limited
to
immigration
related
screening
more
accurately
such
vetting
includes
an
evolving
form
of
big
data
surveillance
that
attempts
to
assess
criminal
and
terroristic
risk
across
entire
populations
and
subpopulations
through
mass
data
collection
database
screening
and
data
fusion
artificial
intelligence
and
algorithm
driven
predictive
analytics
n
the
long
term
consequences
of
modern
big
data
surveillance
can
be
better
envisioned
by
anticipating
how
and
why
big
data
vetting
protocols
may
be
extended
to
the
entire
population
eventually
all
residents
of
the
united
states
both
citizens
and
noncitizens
may
face
various
stages
of
technological
vetting
and
algorithmic
screening
as
a
part
of
a
post
september
national
security
policy
trajectory
that
embraces
big
data
surveillance
for
its
presumed
efficacy
importantly
in
parallel
with
the
extreme
vetting
protocols
mandated
by
the
executive
orders
almost
every
immigration
reform
effort
since
has
called
for
biometric
data
collection
from
the
entire
citizenry
in
the
united
states
to
enhance
border
security
efforts
n
at
the
same
time
increasing
concern
regarding
homegrown
terrorism
has
resulted
in
a
call
to
extend
domestic
surveillance
and
counterterrorism
efforts
to
both
citizens
and
noncitizens
n
the
snowden
disclosures
for
example
have
further
revealed
how
foreign
intelligence
gathering
tools
such
as
bulk
metadata
collection
can
be
indiscriminate
in
scope
and
impact
both
citizens
and
noncitizens
n
identifying
the
vetting
procedures
embedded
within
executive
order
and
the
constitutional
challenges
which
followed
its
promulgation
is
particularly
appropriate
as
marks
the
seventy
fifth
anniversary
of
the
signing
of
executive
order
by
president
franklin
delano
roosevelt
n
that
order
issued
on
february
and
titled
authorizing
the
secretary
of
war
to
prescribe
military
areas
allowed
for
japanese
internment
by
delegating
to
the
secretary
of
war
the
authority
to
take
such
other
steps
as
he
may
deem
advisable
to
enforce
compliance
with
the
exclusion
of
japanese
americans
and
those
of
japanese
ancestry
n
the
legal
challenges
mounted
against
executive
order
culminated
in
several
u
s
supreme
court
cases
most
notably
korematsu
v
united
states
n
in
this
case
decided
in
the
court
upheld
the
constitutionality
of
executive
order
reasoning
in
part
we
are
dealing
specifically
with
nothing
but
an
exclusion
order
to
cast
this
case
into
outlines
of
racial
prejudice
without
reference
to
the
real
military
dangers
which
were
presented
merely
confuses
the
issue
n
drawing
comparisons
between
executive
order
and
executive
order
and
reviewing
the
original
justification
for
japanese
internment
is
critical
here
as
president
trump
and
others
have
cited
both
fdr
s
actions
n
and
korematsu
as
precedent
for
the
muslim
ban
and
the
development
of
a
muslim
registry
database
n
this
article
proceeds
in
four
parts
part
i
describes
how
modern
vetting
procedures
are
intertwined
with
burgeoning
identity
management
systems
based
on
a
review
of
publicly
available
information
these
vetting
protocols
are
increasingly
dependent
upon
the
following
mass
biometric
data
collection
automated
or
semiautomated
biometric
identification
and
algorithm
dependent
database
screening
programs
in
a
big
data
world
threat
risk
assessments
and
data
profiling
tools
do
not
necessarily
begin
with
the
identification
of
individuals
on
the
basis
of
traditionally
protected
classifications
such
as
race
ethnicity
or
national
origin
instead
because
contemporary
big
data
systems
are
data
classification
oriented
vetting
and
screening
protocols
begin
with
the
identification
of
individuals
on
the
basis
of
numerical
identification
such
as
passport
numbers
and
on
the
basis
of
biometric
identification
such
as
the
cataloguing
of
scanned
fingerprints
and
irises
part
ii
describes
how
national
security
programs
risk
creating
forms
of
discrimination
similar
to
jim
crow
in
that
they
are
also
based
upon
classification
and
screening
protocols
historic
jim
crow
regimes
started
with
a
legal
premise
that
certain
individuals
could
and
should
be
classified
on
the
basis
of
race
next
jim
crow
laws
utilized
screening
systems
to
enforce
segregation
based
upon
designated
racial
classification
this
discussion
explores
why
security
threat
assessments
produced
through
algorithms
and
database
screening
may
similar
to
historic
jim
crow
also
separate
populations
based
upon
particular
classifications
new
algorithmic
jim
crow
systems
like
historic
jim
crow
regimes
systems
may
present
themselves
as
facially
neutral
part
iii
explains
how
identity
management
systems
do
not
necessarily
discriminate
based
on
protected
categories
recognized
under
equal
protection
jurisprudence
n
rather
newly
emerging
vetting
systems
are
often
centered
on
big
data
and
generally
driven
by
mass
data
collection
and
analysis
these
systems
for
instance
purport
to
be
race
neutral
and
not
to
target
individuals
based
on
a
protected
classification
rather
it
is
often
the
case
that
results
of
data
screening
and
vetting
analytics
deemed
suspect
and
anomalous
are
isolated
and
targeted
consequently
the
equal
but
separate
consequences
of
algorithmic
jim
crow
will
allow
for
the
equal
vetting
and
screening
of
all
citizens
and
noncitizens
at
the
same
time
newly
deployed
vetting
systems
will
allow
federal
and
state
governments
to
separate
individuals
based
upon
the
vetting
and
screening
actions
mandated
through
security
policy
developments
part
iv
further
discusses
why
advocates
of
immigration
federalism
n
and
national
security
federalism
n
those
seeking
the
expansion
of
state
participation
in
the
enforcement
of
federal
immigration
and
national
security
law
have
increasingly
enacted
biometric
data
harvesting
and
identity
management
laws
that
mimic
federal
laws
and
programs
these
state
laws
mandate
the
utilization
of
multiple
dataveillance
tools
and
biometric
data
screening
devices
purportedly
to
further
crime
and
immigration
control
and
simultaneously
support
counterterrorism
efforts
yet
just
as
historic
jim
crow
regimes
delegated
segregationist
gatekeeping
duties
to
state
and
private
entities
contemporary
immigration
policy
delegates
restrictive
immigration
gatekeeping
duties
to
state
and
private
entities
under
algorithmic
jim
crow
these
technologically
enabled
gatekeeping
duties
involve
race
neutral
database
screening
of
personally
identifiable
data
and
biometric
data
through
federal
vetting
and
screening
protocols
the
results
however
may
not
be
race
neutral
or
may
in
fact
have
a
disparate
impact
on
traditionally
protected
classes
part
iv
further
explains
how
technological
vetting
protocols
and
algorithm
driven
database
screening
systems
may
be
insulated
from
successful
legal
challenges
as
the
law
has
not
yet
adapted
to
anticipate
new
forms
of
back
end
discrimination
facilitated
by
dhs
s
rapid
deployment
of
identity
management
programs
the
government
as
in
korematsu
will
likely
defend
any
disparate
impact
consequences
as
necessary
and
justified
based
upon
threat
risk
assessments
and
nonracial
classifications
risk
based
classifications
and
data
characteristics
deemed
suspect
fall
outside
of
the
protections
recognized
by
current
equal
protection
jurisprudence
this
type
of
disparate
impact
driven
by
database
screening
and
technologically
enhanced
discrimination
may
face
limited
or
lenient
review
by
a
federal
judiciary
that
generally
grants
broad
deference
to
the
government
in
matters
of
immigration
and
national
security
n
thus
the
advent
of
algorithmic
jim
crow
will
require
an
evolution
of
equality
law
this
article
concludes
that
current
algorithm
driven
vetting
and
biometric
biographic
identification
screening
especially
once
deployed
across
the
entire
citizenry
will
likely
lead
to
discriminatory
profiling
and
surveillance
on
the
basis
of
suspicious
data
as
well
as
classification
based
discrimination
these
vetting
and
screening
systems
are
likely
to
result
in
both
direct
and
disparate
discrimination
particularly
based
on
race
color
ethnicity
national
origin
and
religion
in
addition
recent
immigration
control
policy
and
programs
demonstrate
the
government
s
interest
in
delegating
immigration
vetting
duties
to
private
actors
such
as
employers
and
nonfederal
actors
such
as

i
birth
of
algorithmic
jim
crow
when
president
trump
signed
executive
order
on
january
then
acting
attorney
general
sally
yates
was
taken
by
surprise
n
yates
reviewed
the
order
as
well
as
a
number
of
briefs
by
individuals
who
sought
to
enjoin
the
order
in
federal
court
and
believed
that
it
raised
constitutional
problems
namely
establishment
clause
and
due
process
concerns
n
yates
later
explained
to
the
new
yorker
that
after
reviewing
arguments
for
and
against
the
first
order
she
thought
that
her
two
choices
were
either
to
resign
or
to
refuse
to
defend
the
order
n
after
reviewing
the
evidence
yates
believed
that
the
order
was
ultimately
based
on
religion
and
said
i
thought
back
to
jim
crow
laws
or
literacy
tests
those
didn
t
say
that
the
purpose
was
to
prevent
african
americans
from
voting
but
that
s
what
the
purpose
was
n
yates
drafted
a
letter
to
her
colleagues
at
the
u
s
department
of
justice
in
which
she
stated
at
present
i
am
not
convinced
that
the
defense
of
the
executive
order
is
consistent
with
these
responsibilities
nor
am
i
convinced
that
the
executive
order
is
lawful
n
yates
directed
department
of
justice
attorneys
not
to
defend
the
order
until
she
determined
that
it
was
appropriate
to
act
n
a
few
hours
later
yates
received
a
letter
from
the
white
house
that
informed
her
that
she
had
been
fired
n
yates
s
invocation
of
jim
crow
deserves
notice
the
former
acting
attorney
general
concluded
that
the
executive
order
might
lead
to
a
disparate
impact
on
the
basis
of
protected
classifications
such
as
national
origin
and
religion
at
the
same
time
she
also
recognized
that
the
executive
order
presented
itself
as
facially
neutral
much
like
the
facially
neutral
literacy
tests
promulgated
under
jim
crow
laws
that
disproportionately
burdened
the
voting
rights
of
minority
communities
under
historic
jim
crow
literacy
tests
poll
taxes
and
other
obstacles
to
voting
rights
were
equally
applied
to
all
voters
n
although
these
obstacles
did
not
explicitly
inquire
into
voters
race
they
nonetheless
significantly
disenfranchised
minority
communities
therefore
they
served
discriminatory
ends
even
though
the
race
of
the
voter
was
never
technically
a
basis
for
denying
access
to
the
ballot
n
much
like
literacy
tests
and
poll
taxes
post
security
initiatives
may
disproportionately
impact
minority
communities
even
though
they
do
not
explicitly
effectuate
decisions
based
on
protected
attributes
an
inquiry
into
modern
day
screening
and
vetting
systems
depends
upon
in
an
understanding
of
myriad
post
national
security
programs
and
policy
initiatives
contemporary
screening
and
vetting
systems
utilize
algorithms
to
determine
a
wide
range
of
questions
including
identity
and
associational
assessments
to
gauge
risk
for
example
extreme
vetting
systems
like
the
one
promulgated
by
the
executive
orders
may
bring
about
disproportionate
burdens
on
minority
communities
potential
discrimination
facilitated
or
exacerbated
by
technological
means
appearing
to
be
facially
neutral
may
evade
legal
challenge
requiring
careful
inquiry
because
big
data
screening
and
tracking
systems
unfold
in
ways
that
are
difficult
to
see
for
example
through
algorithm
driven
determinations
internet
based
database
screening
programs
and
social
media
monitoring
it
is
critical
to
explore
how
modern
vetting
protocols
may
be
linked
to
preexisting
post
identity
management
systems
that
are
dependent
upon
cybersurveillance
and
dataveillance
tools
to
grasp
how
extreme
vetting
can
be
extended
to
the
entire
citizenry
it
is
helpful
to
compare
no
fly
database
screening
systems
with
potential
extreme
vetting
database
screening
systems
for
example
based
on
what
is
known
of
both
programs
it
appears
that
many
of
the
database
screening
protocols
overlap
n
part
i
therefore
explains
how
vetting
systems
will
increasingly
rely
upon
database
screening
including
universal
biometric
databases
to
sweep
entire
populations
and
subsets
within
populations
to
assess
terroristic
and
criminal
risk
to
better
understand
the
trump
administration
s
policy
on
extreme
vetting
it
is
important
to
reconstruct
the
justification
for
such
a
policy
based
upon
historical
background
and
prior
policy
developments
implemented
during
the
obama
administration
many
of
the
policies
advanced
by
the
executive
order
are
not
only
an
outgrowth
of
but
they
are
specifically
reactive
to
the
paris
attacks
in
november
and
the
san
bernardino
attack
in

terrorist
events
led

less
than
one
week
later
in

of

then
presidential
candidate

called
for
what
has
been
referred
to
as
a
muslim
ban
or
travel
ban
an
executive
action
that
would
prohibit
entry
of
any
muslim
into

n
trump
did
not
provide
specifics
on
how
he
would
prohibit
muslims
from
entering
the
united
states
however
he
later
clarified
that
the
ban
would
be
temporary
to
allow
the
government
to
assess
its
current
immigration
procedures
and
suspend
immigration
from
regions
linked
with

n
trump
s
call
for
a

was
followed
by
calls
for

six
months
later
on
june
omar
mateen
an
afghani

before
committing
the
worst
mass
shooting
in

history
n
in
the
wake
of
the
orlando
attack
then
candidate
trump
explained
that
the
profiling
of
muslims
in
the
united
states
was
necessary
as
a
preemptive
measure
to
prevent
future
attacks
n
on
august
trump
announced
a
proposal
for
the
extreme
vetting
of
immigrants
and
refugees
in
a
campaign
speech
on
isis
n
he
explained
in
the
cold
war
we
had
an
ideological
screening
test
the
time
is
long
overdue
to
develop

then
on

trump
delivered
an
address
on
his
proposed
immigration
policy

in

to
his
promise
to
build
a
wall
on
the
southern
border

his
reassertion

trump
explained
that

holders
n
these

of
enhanced
national

border
security
systems

as
the

classification

artificial
intelligence

are
not
usually
perceived
as
resulting
in

in
fact
they
may
appear
to
be

compliant

even
equality
enhancing
in
that
algorithmic
screening

can
be
applied
equally
across

screening

classification
systems
however
even
when
facially
neutral
and
algorithmically
based
can
lead
to
profound
constitutional
challenges
the
historical
framing
in
this
section
is
necessary
to
assist
in
the
interrogation
of
new
classification
and
screening
systems
that
are
flourishing
under
security
rationales
and
presented
as
technologically
objective
and
colorblind
therefore
to
better
grasp
why
the
framing
of
algorithmic
jim
crow
is
now
needed
part
ii
lays
a
factual
predicate
to
explain
the
foundational
legal
premises
for
historic
jim
crow
regimes
traditional
jim
crow
laws
first
required
the
government
often
state
and
county
governments
to
engage
in
formal
and
standardized
protocols
to
assign
racial
classification
to
citizens
of
that
state
or
county
once
a
racial
classification
system
was
determined
under
the
law
screening
protocols
also
established
under
jim
crow
laws
enabled
the
separation
of
populations
on
the
basis
of
that
racial
classification
consequently
understanding
the
basic
mechanics
of
how
separation
was
enforced
under
the
law
begins
with
an
understanding
of
historic
jim
crow
classification
and
screening
systems
a
historical
framing
of
jim
crow
this
overview
is
not
intended
to
be
an
exhaustive
history
of
the
legal
issues
and
the
nature
of
jim
crow
other
scholarship
has
addressed
that
subject
in
thoughtful
detail
n
instead
this
background
intends
to
sketch
out
an
understanding
of
the
scope
and
context
of
the
jim
crow
era
and
to
further
clarify
that
its
laws
and
policies
were
not
confined
merely
to
segregating
locational
sites
and
imposing
restrictions
on
movement
rather
jim
crow
was
a
structure
of
exclusion
and
discrimination
devised
by
white
americans
to
be
employed
principally
against
black
americans
its
central
purpose
was
to
maintain
a
second
class
social
and
economic
status
for
blacks
while
upholding
a
first
class
social
and
economic
status
for
whites
in
the
south
jim
crow
discrimination
at
its
height
existed
not
only
by
statute
but
by
custom
and
racial
etiquette
and
it
was
rigidly
enforced
by
both
the
law
enforcement
agencies
and
courts
as
well
as
by
ordinary
white
citizens
who
were
neither
policemen
nor
judges
but
who
often
took
the
law
into
their
own
hands
as
though
they
were
n
one
scholar
explains
that
jim
crow
is
a
term
for
a
series
of
laws
and
ordinances
passed
by
southern
states
and
municipalities
between
and
legalizing
segregation
the
physical
separation
of
individuals
based
on
race
gender
religion
or
class
within
their
boundaries
n
although
racial
discrimination
was
not
a
solely
southern
practice
african
americans
in
northern
states
experienced
discrimination
in
housing
education
employment
and
economic
settings
n
in
the
south
racial
restrictions
were
omnipresent
and
ingrained
in
southern
life
n
one
historian
argues
that
jim
crow
was
a
southern
phenomenon
the
infrastructure
white
southerners
built
to
preserve
insofar
as
humanly
possible
the
old
master
slave
system
n
jim
crow
penetrated
every
facet
of
life
for
southern
african
americans
it
was
an
integral
part
of
the
social
political
and
legal
fabric
of
southern
society
n
jim
crow
established
restrictions
on
marriage
n
voting
n
education
n
employment
n
housing
n
travel
n
and
enforced
segregation
in
public
spaces
n
some
of
these
restrictions
were
codified
in
law
and
others
were
ingrained
as
a
matter
of
social
behavior
and
custom
n
jim
crow
stood
for
an
entire
culture
based
on
violence
racism
and
fear
that
affected
the
life
of
every
african
american
living
in
the
south
n
despite
the
passage
of
the
thirteenth
fourteenth
and
fifteenth
amendments
supreme
court
precedent
in
the
wake
of
those
amendments
upheld
laws
that
enforced
racial
inequality
through
segregation
laws
or
laws
that
created
a
disproportionately
discriminatory
impact
on
african
americans
n
racial
classification
was
an
integral
part
of
jim
crow
n
the
majority
of
the
southern
states
legalized
racial
classification
by
codifying
the
one
drop
rule
or
enshrining
it
as
part
of
their
state
constitutions
any
modicum
of
black
ancestry
meant
that
the
individual
in
question
was
not
white
and
thus
subject
to
jim
crow
laws
n
definitions
of
race
were
also
included
in
antimiscegenation
laws
which
prohibited
interracial
marriage
n
virginia
for
example
adopted
a
law
that
required
racial
descriptions
to
be
recorded
at
a
child
s
birth
to
further
classify
individuals
as
white
or
colored
n
virginia
s
racial
integrity
act
of
n
required
all
citizens
within
the
state
born
after
june
to
register
their
racial
composition
with
the
bureau
of
vital
statistics
n
prohibited
interracial
marriages
and
defined
who
exactly
qualified
as
white
n
a
copy
of
an
old
birth
record
form
provided
by
the
library
of
virginia
describes
the
definition
of
white
under
virginia
law
a
white
person
is
one
with
no
trace
whatever
of
blood
of
another
race
except
that
one
with
one
sixteenth
of
the
blood
of
american
indian
unmixed
with
other
race
may
be
classed
as
white
n
thus
the
jim
crow
system
depended
on
initial
classification
and
markers
of
racial
identity
to
determine
who
would
be
subjected
to
laws
that
designated
individual
treatment
rights
and
privileges
based
on
those
classifications
n
b
classification
and
screening
classification
of
identity
such
as
the
race
based
types
that
occurred
during
the
jim
crow
era
is
an
essential
step
in
establishing
exclusionary
systems
n
exclusion
involves
separating
out
individuals
from
a
group
or
one
group
from
another
category
it
is
not
possible
to
exclude
a
group
from
a
system
of
rights
and
privileges
without
first
determining
criteria
for
exclusion
n
therefore
classification
is
necessary
for
these
systems
operation
n
during
the
jim
crow
era
these
classifications
took
the
form
of
one
drop
laws
or
legal
decisions
that
identified
who
was
colored
and
who
was
not
n
other
exclusionary
systems
have
engaged
in
similar
forms
of
classification
for
example
apartheid
in
south
africa
relied
on
national
identity
cards
that
identified
individuals
by
racial
groups
n
during
the
belgian
colonial
period
in
rwanda
officials
mandated
hutu
and
tutsi
markers
on
identity
cards
in
a
system
that
privileged
tutsi
individuals
and
ultimately
laid
the
groundwork
for
the
genocide
n
in
nazi
germany
the
nuremburg
laws
determined
who
was
jewish
and
thus
subject
to
exclusion
discrimination
and
persecution
n
classification
alone
however
is
not
sufficient
to
operate
an
exclusionary
system
implementing
such
a
system
requires
screening
determining
whether
individuals
who
have
been
classified
are
complying
with
the
rules
that
accompany
such
classification
or
whether
the
individuals
are
somehow
suspect
under
jim
crow
for
example
screening
was
both
official
such
as
official
segregation
policy
enforcement
and
unofficial
as
a
part
of
social
and
behavioral
norms
n
jim
crow
era
screening
was
a
small
data
world
screening
system
relying
first
on
classification
on
paper
documents
such
as
birth
certificates
or
identity
cards
or
an
examination
of
physical
appearance
n
followed
by
screening
to
ensure
that
the
excluded
individuals
complied
with
the
systems
of
classification
n
in
a
big
data
world
systems
of
screening
such
as
the
extreme
vetting
requirements
of
trump
s
executive
orders
are
capable
of
surveilling
vast
numbers
of
individuals
based
on
data
or
other
broad
categories
and
then
subsequently
classifying
them
based
on
status
n
essentially
screening
is
now
theoretically
equal
and
the
classification
system
is
separate
failing
to
examine
the
underlying
bases
of
classification
and
screening
systems
indicates
an
inherent
level
of
trust
in
government
systems
that
ultimately
may
lead
to
harmful
consequences
n
screening
in
a
big
data
world
serves
as
a
form
of
technological
interrogation
and
entrenches
surveillance
as
a
norm
n
mass
screenings
of
citizens
in
collect
it
all
systems
embed
the
structure
of
policing
into
the
state
in
much
the
same
way
that
jim
crow
embedded
racial
classifications
and
screenings
of
individuals
based
on
race
or
perceived
race
n
big
data
systems
seek
suspicious
data
as
a
means
of
identifying
and
classifying
suspicious
persons
n
broad
population
based
screening
and
mass
surveillance
promote
fundamentally
undemocratic
surveillance
norms
n
as
justice
sotomayor
explained
in
her
dissenting
opinion
in
utah
v
strieff
n
random
suspicionless
identity
verifications
by
law
enforcement
on
the
street
are
inherently
undemocratic
this
case
tells
everyone
white
and
black
guilty
and
innocent
that
an
officer
can
verify
your
legal
status
at
any
time
it
says
that
your
body
is
subject
to
invasion
while
courts
excuse
the
violation
of
your
rights
it
implies
that
you
are
not
a
citizen
of
a
democracy
but
the
subject
of
a
carceral
state
just
waiting
to
be
cataloged
n
further
some
screening
protocols
may
rely
on
rationales
that
are
facially
neutral
but
ultimately
based
on
impermissible
classifications
in
his
concurring
opinion
in
international
refugee
assistance
project
v
trump
n
judge
james
wynn
pointed
out
that
discrimination
even
when
shrouded
in
layers
of
legality
is
no
less
an
insult
to
our
constitution
than
naked
invidious
discrimination
n
judge
wynn
cited
dred
scott
v
sandford
n
and
korematsu
v
united
states
n
as
examples
of
judicial
failures
in
response
to
exclusionary
and
discriminatory
systems
cloaked
in
legality
n
in
the
majority
opinion
the
fourth
circuit
concluded
that
the
plaintiffs
had
sufficiently
alleged
that
nationality
served
as
a
proxy
for
religious
discrimination
n
and
was
a
crude
and
ineffective
measure
for
determining
whether
a
threat
existed
n
indeed
in
her
decision
to
refuse
to
defend
the
first
executive
order
then
acting
attorney
general
sally
yates
considered
that
it
bore
a
resemblance
to
jim
crow
laws
n
thus
systems
of
subordination
such
as
jim
crow
and
apartheid
depend
on
classifying
who
is
privileged
and
who
is
not
as
discussed
above
once
a
classification
is
emplaced
laws
can
require
separation
subordination
and
screening
on
the
basis
of
that
classification
jim
crow
regimes
used
race
based
classifications
to
engage
in
a
broad
range
of
economic
social
and
political
exclusions
under
the
law
n
the
act
of
excluding
or
disenfranchising
on
the
basis
of
race
often
required
legally
mandated
screening
processes
n
as
well
as
screening
through
social
norms
and
behavior
control
n
these
screening
processes
would
often
require
governments
or
their
private
delegates
to
screen
individuals
on
the
basis
of
race
and
any
failure
to
do
so
would
often
carry
legal
consequences
as
well
as
social
penalties
such
as
ostracization
n
c
cyberarchitecture
of
algorithmic
jim
crow
perhaps
the
easiest
way
to
understand
how
the
jim
crow
regime
is
being
replicated
in
a
big
data
world
through
algorithmic
jim
crow
is
to
consider
the
following
scenario
imagine
substituting
race
based
classifications
with
classifications
of
digitally
derived
suspiciousness
rather
than
relying
upon
a
targeted
class
such
as
race
national
origin
gender
or
religion
as
a
sole
basis
for
exclusion
big
data
allows
for
exclusion
to
be
based
on
an
abstraction
such
as
digitally
inferred
or
algorithmically
anchored
guilt
or
suspicion
n
in
addition
big
data
can
aggregate
protected
classifications
with
other
collected
data
n
for
example
biometric
screening
that
uses
soft
biometric
indicators
such
as
digital
assessments
of
skin
color
and
estimated
age
extracted
from
a
digital
photo
can
combine
race
data
proxies
with
other
proxy
variables
to
predict
criminal
or
terroristic
behavior
e
g
aggregating
passport
number
and
digital
photo
with
data
analysis
of
web
browsing
activity
and
social
media
presence
n
in
addition
there
are
multiple
components
to
extreme
vetting
including
but
not
limited
to
biometric
identification
n
record
linkage
n
information
extraction
n
and
predictive
analytics
n
in
some
circumstances
these
technologies
allow
for
classification
and
then
screening
in
other
circumstances
these
technologies
allow
for
just
the
opposite
screening
then
classification
what
is
difficult
to
understand
is
how
machine
learning
and
artificial
intelligence
can
replace
human
judgment
in
the
classification
and
screening
processes
of
algorithmic
jim
crow
regimes
in
a
small
data
world
jim
crow
required
a
human
to
physically
inspect
the
skin
color
of
an
individual
to
determine
the
race
of
that
individual
e
g
a
physician
attesting
to
the
race
of
an
individual
on
a
birth
certificate
n
in
the
small
data
world
screening
processes
also
required
human
judgment
e
g
a
county
clerk
inspecting
birth
certificates
before
issuing
marriage
licenses
and
marriage
certificates
to
determine
compliance
with
antimiscegenation
laws
n
in
contrast
human
involvement
is
not
required
to
classify
individuals
in
a
big
data
world
an
individual
can
be
classified
as
a
potential
criminal
terrorist
or
threat
risk
based
on
digital
data
alone
and
digitized
analysis
such
as
algorithmic
screening
algorithmic
tools
can
analyze
data
to
establish
identity
e
g
a
record
locator
matching
algorithm
such
as
database
screening
systems
that
match
names
with
passport
numbers
and
other
databases
of
personally
identifiable
information
and
screen
for
suspicious
digital
profiles
e
g
combine
passport
information
with
stored
data
and
real
time
data
n
stored
data
might
include
bulk
telephony
metadata
n
databases
that
collect
time
duration
and
geolocation
of
calls
and
other
government
records
and
private
data
such
as
consumer
activities
n
real
time
analytics
can
include
situational
awareness
systems
that
attempt
to
analyze
real
time
video
surveillance
feeds
that
connect
the
monitored
individual
through
facial
recognition
technology
to
that
individual
s
social
media
n
hence
the
nature
of
classification
and
screening
capacities
are
radically
different
in
a
big
data
world
classification
therefore
can
be
based
in
part
or
in
whole
on
artificial
intelligence
similarly
screening
in
a
big
data
world
does
not
rely
on
human
processes
the
no
fly
list
for
example
can
be
generated
through
database
screening
and
digital
watchlisting
systems
rather
than
human
nomination
n
thus
in
a
big
data
world
classification
and
screening
protocols
can
be
combined
digitized
and
automated
as
a
result
these
big
data
classification
and
screening
systems
may
be
nearly
impossible
for
a
citizen
to
interrogate
or
challenge
n
what
is
similar
between
big
data
and
small
data
exclusionary
regimes
is
that
separation
and
segregation
is
at
the
heart
of
the
processes
what
appears
to
be
at
the
earliest
stages
of
the
big
data
governance
phenomenon
purely
national
security
motivated
protocols
such
as
the
no
fly
list
might
not
appear
to
be
a
part
of
a
larger
segregationist
regime
at
the
earliest
stages
of
jim
crow
separation
of
the
races
was
deemed
necessary
by
the
court
in
plessy
v

n
under

rationales
to
avoid
race
based
conflict
n
at
the
earliest
stages
of
algorithmic
jim
crow
isolating
individuals
based
on

suspicions
is
also
justified
under
security
rationales
to
prevent
terrorism
unlike
historic
jim
crow
established
to
continue
a
racial
hierarchy
first
instituted
through
slavery
big
data
regimes
do
not
overtly
seek
to
create
subordinate
social
classes
but
that
may
well
be
the
result
like
under
historic
jim
crow
regimes
security
needs
are
professed
as
justification
even
if
we
are
not
yet
faced
with
a
mature
algorithmic
jim
crow
regime
it
is
important
to
recognize
that
jim
crow
laws
took
decades
to
develop
into
a
pervasive
legal
system
n
with
the
benefit
of
hindsight
we
now
examine
the
full
arc
of
jim
crow
including
the
opportunity
to
revisit
the
legal
precedent
that
allowed
for
segregation
to
take
root
and
become
normalized
n
jim
crow
did
not
commence
with
the
segregation
of
every
water
fountain
swimming
pool
bus
train
movie
theater
hotel
or
restaurant
n
jim
crow
did
however
eventually
convert
nearly
every
citizen
into
a
race
classification
expert
and
screening
specialist
to
comply
with
the
laws
n
jim
crow
laws
imposed
a
duty
under
law
or
social
norms
upon
many
entities
public
private
and
individual
citizens
to
classify
and
screen
n
how
will
classification
and
screening
under
algorithmic
jim
crow
like
historic
jim
crow
require
classification
and
screening
requirements
under
the
law
how
will
algorithmic
jim

impose
a
legal
duty
upon

individual
citizens
to
classify
and
screen
jim
crow
laws
mandated
paper
based
classifications
such
as
attestation
to
racial
classifications
on
birth
certificates
n
big
data
technologies
however
do
not
require
discrete
screening
or
classification
procedures
because
of
the
nature
of
modern
data
tools
instead
of
separate
processes
that
treat
screening
and
classification
as
separate
big
data
tools
have
the
capacity
to
execute
both
simultaneously
in
a
small
data
world
linearity
was
more
common
between
classification
and
screening
the
former
had
to
follow
the
latter
as
a
matter
of
logic
without
racial
classification
racial
screening
would
not
have
been
possible
once
an
individual
had
been
classified
as
white
privileges
under
jim
crow
logically
followed
that
racial
status
with
big
data
assessments
can
be
made
concurrently
and
thus
consecutive
processes
are
not
necessary
but
may
occur
under
big
data
theories
of
identity
management
an
aggregation
of
data
can
for
instance
map
identity
such
as
classification
of
potential
terrorist
status
in
addition
the
same
vetting
and
screening
protocols
facilitate
determinations
as
to
access
e
g
whether
an

can
board
a
plane
or
enter
the

it
is
the
accumulation
and
analysis
of
the
ever
growing
aggregation
of

that
makes
possible
the

algorithmic
decision
making

at
the
core
of

enterprise
new
classification
and
screening
technologies
thus
eliminate
or
reduce
the
need
to
conduct
human
based
screening
historic
jim
crow
laws
required
bus
drivers
to
segregate
passengers
on
the
basis
of
race
a
screening
protocol
that
required
human
judgment
and
human
action
n
contemporary
systems
may
use
a
combination
of
automated
screening
and
human
screening
such
as
tsa
screeners
relying
upon
the
predictive

algorithmic
jim

may
also
facilitate
fully
automated

digitized

n
under
contemporary

of

will
likely
comprise
a
combination
of
traditional
characteristics

digital

derived

that
allow
for
inferences
of
guilt
but
instead
of
impermissibly
distributing

withholding
privileges
based
on
protected
classifications
big
data
will
simply
incorporate
them
as
part
of
a
risk
assessment
such
threat
risk
assessments
will
attempt
to
predict
criminal
or
terroristic
predisposition
n
unlike
historic
jim
crow
algorithmic
jim
crow
may
not
require
classification
in
order
to
conduct
screening
because
of
the
vast
amounts
of
digital
data
that
can
be
analyzed
for
both
classification
and
screening
purposes
data
will
at
times
be
collected
and
sorted
for
classification
to
screen
n
at
other
times

will
be
collected
and
screened

determine
a

may
extend
to
the

this

extreme

grasped

that
can
be
applied

in

the
government
allow
for
core
rights
and

to
be
partially
obstructed
in
some
instances
or
altogether
blocked
in

n
moreover
because
of
the
virtual
nature
of
mass

database
screening
and
the
classified
nature
of
certain
programs
the
digital

potential

occur
without

becomes
subject
to
potential
across
the
board
vetting

screening
claims
of
equal

violations
may
collapse
this
likelihood
increases
as
defenders
of
database
screening
argue
such
screening
minimizes
the
role
of
the
human
element
and
thus
minimizes
the
risk
of
racial
profiling
on
a
theoretical
level
because
the
algorithms
of
any
given
big
data
vetting

system
will
not
be
transparent
to
those
subject
to
screening
the
denial
of
a

privilege
or
consequences
such
as
detainment
and
deportation
will
be
without
apparent
cause
beyond
the
fact
that
the

has
determined
that

should
be

artifact
n
redressing
new
forms
of
jim
crow
requires
observing
innovations
in
law
and
policy
that
result
in
the
entrenchment
of
inequities
on
the
basis
of
race
and
other
sites
of
historic
discrimination
n
as
such
alexander
warns
that
vigilance
is
needed
to
bear
witness
to
an
evolutionary
process
of
law
and
policy
that
can
lead
to
new
caste
systems
n
this
is
especially
true
in
a
modern
era
that
may
present
the
mechanism
for
the
caste
as
colorblind
n
and
involve
data
tracking
and
digital
sorting
methods
that
may
present
a
virtual
cage
problem
n
taking
a
cue
from
alexander
to
refuse
to
limit
jim
crow
to
regimes
designed
to
subordinate
a
single
race
or
class
of
individuals
we
may
see
the
newest
emergence
of
jim
crow
in
mass
surveillance
and
algorithm
driven
decision
making
database
screening
and
digital
watchlisting
systems
in
fact
can
serve
as
complementary
and
facially
colorblind
supplements
to
mass
incarceration
systems
n
the
purported
colorblindness
of
mandatory
sentencing
and
mass
incarceration
systems
for
instance
parallels
the
purported
colorblindness
of
mandatory
database
screening
and
vetting
systems
as
reva
siegel
has
theorized
anticlassification
jurisprudence
cannot
achieve
the
same
aims
as
antisubordination
or
antibalkinization
jurisprudence
n
in
contemporary
equality
cases
considered
before
the
supreme
court
siegel
observes
the
justices
who
vote
against
affirmative
action
and
other
race
conscious
civil
rights
policies
are
said
to
reason
from
a
colorblind
anticlassification
principle
premised
on
the
belief
that
the
constitution
protects
individuals
not
groups
and
so
bars
all
racial
classifications
except
as
a
remedy
for
specific
wrongdoing
n
this
judicial
predisposition
to
overturn
programs
that
redress
wrongs
for
suspect
classifications
even
when
the
clear
purpose
of
such
programs
is
to
assist
those
historically
harmed
by
such
classifications
means
that
vetting
and
screening
protocols
that
do
not
overtly
target
such
suspect
classifications
will
not
present
an
equal
protection
problem
in
other
words
if
the
anticlassification
principle
continues
to
dominate
equal
protection
jurisprudence
race
neutral
and
equally
applied
database
screening
and
digital
watchlisting
systems
will
not
appear
to
be
inconsistent
with
the
anticlassification
premise
of
equality
law
therefore
such
programs
may
pass
equal
protection
muster
even
if
they
impose
disparate
consequences
n
similarly
jack
balkin
provocatively
asserts
that
the
law
of
equality
is
often
in
fact
the
law
of
inequality
n
balkin
argues
that
historically
and
paradoxically
the
law
of
equality
has
been
adaptive
to
enforce
inequality
n
balkin
explains
that
the
supreme
court
in
plessy
v
ferguson
acknowledged
that
a
multitude
of
social
and
economic
inequities
arise
on
the
basis
of
race
n
nonetheless
plessy
ratified
racial
segregation
after
finding
no
equal
protection
defect
with
jim
crow
institutions
n
the
court
concluded
that
the
separate
but
equal
principle
upheld
the
equality
guarantees
required
under
the
equal
protection
clause
so
long
as
the
government
provided
a
form
of
theoretical
equality
on
the
back
end
of
segregation
n
according
to
plessy
the
separation
of
the
races
on
the
front
end
of
state
laws
did
not
create
a
violation
of
the
equal
protection
clause
because
the
discrimination
could
be
redressed
on
the
back
end
n
the
plessy
court
further
concluded
that
racial
separation
on
the
front
end
could
serve
important
law
and
order
goals
such
as
increasing
a
state
s
interest
in
ensuring
safety
and
social
order
among
the
different
races
n
this
legal
reasoning
is
now
widely
discredited
and
as
noted
the
court
now
has
an
antidiscrimination
approach
that
strictly
scrutinizes
laws
that
operate
along
such
suspect
classifications
n
nevertheless
that
approach
too
is
viewed
as
inadequate
by
constitutional
law
experts
and
as
hindering
efforts
to
address
unequal
realities
in
contrast
to
the
theoretical
equality
guarantees
assured
on
the
back
end
of
sorting
methods
instituted
under
historic
jim
crow
regimes
at
the
dawn
of
the
big
data
revolution
we
may
be
witnessing
more
and
more
legal
contexts
in
which
all
are
equally
subject
to
digitalized
vetting
and
database
screening
protocols
but
with
results
on
the
back
end
that
raise
equal
protection
concerns
equality
law
that
demands
that
the
government
provide
equal
treatment
under
the
law
on
a
theoretical
level
on
the
front
end
therefore
prohibits
traditional
jim
crow
institutions
but
siegel
balkin
and
others
caution
that
equality
law
cannot
stop
at
a
judicial
inquiry
that
ensures
colorblindness
on
the
front
end
since
that
risks
turning
a
blind
eye
to
the
disparate
impacts
that
can
result
on
the
back
end
n
as
the
government
continues
to
acquire
more
big
data
tools
to
serve
governance
goals
such
as
database
screening
systems
and
predictive
analytics
that
assess
risk
equality
law
may
find
no
constitutional
problem
with
replication
in
reverse
form
of
the
social
inequality
permitted
under
the
separate
but
equal
principle
under
an
emerging
technologically
enhanced
jim
crow
regime
mass
surveillance
and
semiautomated
or
automated
algorithmic
sorting
methods
will
appear
to
be
equally
applied
across
entire
populations
the
colorblind
and
anticlassification
premises
of
vetting
and
screening
systems
will
comport
with
an
equal
but
separate
principle
these
systems
however
will
potentially
offer
only
theoretical
equality
on
the
front
end
of
newly
emerging
data
surveillance
and
data
sorting
methods
meanwhile
any
disparate
impacts
on
the
back
end
will
be
hard
to
challenge
judicially
because
algorithmic
decision
making
can
occur
in
ways
that
are
difficult
to
document
the
evolution
of
constitutional
protections
is
thus
critically
necessary
in
what
balkin
and
sanford
levinson
term
the
national
surveillance
state
n
in
the
national
surveillance
state
the
integration
of
bureaucratized
and
normalized
data
collection
and
information
society
surveillance
technologies
into
day
to
day
governance
should
be
understood
as
a
distinctive
concern
of
american
constitutionalism
one
of
the
most
important
developments
in
american
constitutionalism
is
the
gradual
transformation
of
the
united
states
into
a
national
surveillance
state
n
constitutional
protections
that
once
were
taken
for
granted
in
a
small
data
world
have
proven
robust
in
theory
but
lacking
in
practical
application
n
often
it
is
not
so
much
that
our
physical
personhood
is
threatened
in
the
national
surveillance
state
but
as
daniel
solove
describes
it
it
is
our
digital
person
that
has
been
placed
at
risk
n
the
shift
to
the
national
surveillance
state
and
big
data
governance
should
be
understood
as
paradigmatic
big
data
and
algorithmic
intelligence
technologies
are
disruptive
and
transformative
in
nature
n
defined
by
their
predictive
and
correlative
capacities
big
data
technologies
are
capable
of
facilitating
a
new
type
of
knowledge
that
some
argue
is
akin
to
virtual
reality
e
g
probabilistic
or
algorithmic
holograms
n
thus
big
data
surveillance
that
transforms
into
normalized
day
to
day
governance
practices
often
poses
harms
that
are
more
virtual
than
physical
for
instance
digitally
derived
suspicion
harms
rather
than
detention
harms
n
as
a
result
big
data
driven
predictive
policing
methods
are
void
of
reasonable
suspicion
as
once
defined
in
a
small
data
world
n
for
example
while
in
a
small
data
world
reasonable
suspicion
is
based
on
specific
facts
or
inferences
regarding
a
specific
individual
s
involvement
in
criminal
activity
in
a
big
data
world
on
the
other
hand
targeting
of
suspects
can
proceed
based
on
data
that
is
associated
with
them
as
collected
in
a
database
and
that
fit
particular
profiles
targeted
by
database
searches
small
data
discrimination
consequently
can
evolve
into
a
form
of
big
data
discrimination
in
a
myriad
of
ways
for
example
statistical
guilt
or
correlative
evidence
that
support
inferences
of
suspicion
can
be
assigned
through
race
neutral

how
algorithmic
jim

works
in

in
across
the
board
vetting
this
part
examines
the
no

the
birth
of
a
precrime

screens
citizens
and
noncitizens

a
purportedly
equal
manner

de

has
been
alleged
in
the
disparate
impact
of
the
no
fly
list
a
system
that
has
been
referred
to
as
a
flying
while
muslim
program
n
although
discrimination
may
not
occur
on
the
front
end
of
the
vetting
and
screening
process
of
the
no
fly
list
plaintiffs
challenging
the
no
fly
list
allege
that
the
program
results
in
disparate
consequences
that
disproportionately
impact
those
populations
associated
with
terrorism
such
as
military
age
muslim
males
n
or
muslims
who
may
be
swept
into
the
no
fly

database
screening
systems
by
virtue
of
intensified
surveillance
of
muslim
communities
by
the
intelligence
community
n
examining
the
no
fly
list
litigation
shows
that
in
the
absence
of
discrimination
in
front
end
enforcement
techniques
back
end
discrimination
can
emerge
from
the
supposedly
neutral
analytics
of
the
digital
watchlisting
and
database
screening
system
itself
the
no
fly
list
as
well
as
other
vetting
and
screening
systems
have
already
faced
multiple
legal
challenges
federal
courts
have
been
asked
to
address
the
new
types
of
harms
presented
by
digital
watchlisting
and
database
screening
in
the
national
surveillance
state
n
of
the
challenges
to
multiple
identity
management
technologies
that
have
reached
the
supreme
court
none
have
allowed
for
an
equal
protection
claim
as
cass
sunstein
explains
the
equal
protection
clause
is
directed
at
the
legality
of
classifications
when
a
classification
is
challenged
the
first
question
is
whether
it
is
drawn
on
the
basis
of
race
or
some
other
characteristic
thought
to
call
for
heightened
scrutiny
n
if
there
is
an
impermissible
classification
that
statute
must
survive
the
appropriate
level
of
scrutiny
if
there
is
no
classification
sunstein
explains
the
inquiry
proceeds
to
a
second
question
was
the
classification
motivated
by
an
intention
to
treat
some
class
differently
on
the
basis
of
race
or
again
any
other
characteristic
said
to
call
for
heightened
scrutiny
if
the
answer
is
affirmative
heightened
scrutiny
must
be
applied
if
negative
the
statute
must
be
upheld
unless
it
is
not
rationally
related
to
a
legitimate
state
interest
n
under
the
vetting
and
screening
protocols
of
the
no
fly
list
there
is
no
classification
or
characteristic
that
warrants
heightened
scrutiny
further
thus
far
there
is
no
evidence
that
the
vetting
and
database
screening
protocol
is
motivated
by
an
intention
to
discriminate
on
the
basis
of
an
impermissible
classification
because
equal
protection
is
not
a
viable
option
to
challenge
the
no
fly
list
as
the
screening
is
applied
in
a
purportedly
equal
manner
the
use
or
misuse
of
data
driven
tools
has
been
central
to
the
inquiry
in
the
federal
courts
specifically
no
fly
list
litigation
has
been
primarily
successful
through
procedural
due
process
claims
though
many
plaintiffs
also
originally
raised
substantive
due
process
claims
n
the
due
process
challenge
to
the
no
fly
list
is
relevant
here
because
that
challenge
attacks
the
workings
of
the
vetting
and
screening
processes
and
importantly
how
identity
management
technology
can
lead
to
stigmatization
and
reputational
harms
allegedly
on
the
basis
of
classification
for
the
purposes
of
this
discussion
therefore
it
is
helpful
to
concurrently
examine
the
due
process
analysis
of
two
similar
no
fly
list
cases
though
acknowledgeable
differences
exist
between
them
in
both
ibrahim
v
department
of
homeland
security
n
and
latif
v
holder
n
federal
courts
analyzed
due
process
claims
that
the
plaintiffs
rights
to
travel
were
infringed
upon
by
their
inclusion
on
the
no
fly
list
in
latif
the
plaintiffs
argued
that
the
no
fly
list
burdens
a
protected
liberty
interest
n
without
due
process
of
law
namely
that
their
placement
on
the
no
fly
list
burdened
their
liberty
interests
in
the
freedom
of
travel
n
and
freedom
from
the
false
stigmatization
and
association
with
terrorists
and
terroristic
activities
implicit
in
inclusion
on
the
no
fly
list
n
similarly
the
plaintiff
in
ibrahim
alleged
deprivations
of
her
liberty
and
property
interests
without
due
process
of
law
n
once
a
protected
liberty
interest
in
either
the
travel
or
reputational
interest
was
established
in
each
case
the
plaintiffs
were
required
to
satisfy
the
three
part
due
process
test
set
forth
in
mathews
v
eldridge
n
under
mathews
the
court
weighs
the
private
interest
that
will
be
affected
by
the
official
action
the
risk
of
an
erroneous
deprivation
of
such
interest
through
the
procedures
used
and
the
probable
value
if
any
of
additional
or
substitute
procedural
safeguards
and
the
government
s
interest
including
the
function
involved
and
the
fiscal
and
administrative
burdens
that
the
additional
or
substitute
procedural
requirement
would
entail
n
for
example
under
the
first
mathews
factor
in
latif
the
plaintiffs
contended
that
protected
liberty
interests
reside
in
freedom
of
travel
and
movement
and
in
reputational
concerns
n
under
the
second
factor
the
plaintiffs
argued
that
the
redress
procedure
inherently
risks
an
unacceptably
high
error
rate
because
it
does
not
allow
plaintiffs
or
other
individuals
placed
on
the
no
fly
list
the
opportunity
to
confront
or
rebut
any
evidence
used
in
determining
the
appropriateness
of
their
placement
on
the
list
n
in
other
words
the
vetting
and
screening
protocol
of
the
no
fly
list
allowed
for
discrimination
on
the
back
end
in
that
those
singled
out
as
potential
threats
had
no
meaningful
redress
finally
regarding
the
third
factor
although
national
security
is
a
significant
government
interest
the
procedural
protections
provided
to
plaintiffs
were
insufficient
given
the
lack
of
notice
and
wholly
ineffective
procedures
of
the
protocol
n
the
no
fly
list
due
process
challenges
are
necessary
to
challenge
back
end
discrimination
because
there
is
no
other
way
to
interrogate
the
classification
mechanism
used
to
assess
threat
risk
or
what
data
might
be
deemed
suspicious
in
other
words
there
may
be
alleged
commonalities
among
those
finding
themselves
on
the
no
fly
list
such
as
being
muslim
american
arab
american
a
citizen
of
a
muslim
majority
country
or
of
middle
eastern
descent
because
the
government
argues
that
the
no
fly
list
involves
classified
information
including
database
screening
systems
and
vetting
protocols
that
make
predictive
judgments
there
is
no
meaningful
way
to
interrogate
how
and
why
that
characteristic
predominates
among
those
selected
by
the
algorithm
or
digital
watchlisting
technology
n
the
closest
plaintiffs
on
the
no
fly
list
have
come
to
determining
whether
and
how
they
faced
classification
based
discrimination
is
through
a
deconstruction
of
the
digital
watchlisting
architecture
and
an
analysis
of
the
databases
that
may
be
implicated
in
the
vetting
and
screening
protocols
n
the
complaints
and
trial
records
appear
to
suggest
that
the
no
fly
list
results
in
a
disparate
impact
n
the
algorithms
and
databases
present
themselves
as
neutral
without
bias
thus
due
process
protection
allows
for
some
interrogation
of
the
vetting
and
database
screening
systems
and
its
errors
human
error
can
become
unimpeachable
truth
but
for
legal
challenges
database
error
risks
a
form
of
unimpeachable
truth
without
a
legal
theory
to
challenge
it
what
are
the
reasons
for
being
wrongly
placed
on
the
no
fly
list
how
does
one
prove
discriminatory
animus
in
vetting
and
screening
protocols
how
does
one
establish
algorithm
derived
discrimination
the
no
fly
list
litigation
shows
that
equal
protection
as
a
theory
fails
to
shield
those
suffering
disparate
treatment
or
de
facto
back
end
discrimination
under
the
current

in
korematsu
governmental
action

in

may
be
viewed
as
legitimately
containing
risk
and
may
not
be
construed
as
targeting

on
the
basis

plessy

korematsu
represent
two
discredited

a

as
those

provide
an
opportunity
to
examine
the
impact
of

technologies
it
explores
some
future
implications
of
these
technologies
including
the
possibility
of
morality
testing
in
civilian
background
tests
which
was
originally
at
issue
in
the
case
exploring
the
impact
of
such
identity
management
technologies
including
the
possibility
of
morality
testing
is
also
important
given
the
stated
purposes
for
extreme
vetting
procedures
set
forth
in
president
trump
s
executive
orders
on
immigration
the
january
order
specifically
states
that
its
purpose
is
to
include
an
assessment
of
the
ideological
and
constitutional
posture
of
immigrants
through
extreme
vetting
in
order
to
protect
americans
the
united
states
must
ensure
that
those
admitted
to
this
country
do
not
bear
hostile
attitudes
toward
it
and
its
founding
principles
the
united
states
cannot
and
should
not
admit
those
who
do
not
support
the
constitution
or
those
who
would
place
violent
ideologies
over
american
law
n
although
the
march
order
does
not
include
this
language
the
screening
and
vetting
requirements
set
forth
in
section
are
more
expansive
and
ambiguous
for
instance
instead
of
focusing
on
constitutional
ideology
section
casts
a
wide
precrime
net
stating
that
the
screening
and
vetting
standards
will
analyze
for
example
the
risk
of
causing
harm
n
the
september
order
increases
the
ambiguity
of
the
screening
and
vetting
mandate
even
further
in
section
a
of
the
september
order
it
states
that
the
purpose
and
policy
of
the
proclamation
is
to
protect
its
citizens
from
terrorist
attacks
and
other
public
safety
threats
screening
and
vetting
protocols
and
procedures
associated
with
visa
adjudications
and
other
immigration
processes
play
a
critical
role
in
implementing
that
policy
n
the
september
order
does
not
define
how
threat
risks
will
be
assessed
nor
does
it
provide
specific
details
on
the
screening
and
vetting
protocols
and
procedures
that
are
prescribed
however
in
several
sections
including
sections
b
c
i
and
d
the
order
refers
to
the
need
to
implement
identity
management
and
information
sharing
protocols
and
procedures
n
the
opacity
of
these
protocols
and
procedures
reemphasizes
the
ambiguity
of
the
precrime
mandate
suggested
by
the
orders
nelson
therefore
is
particularly
relevant
to
understanding
the
ambition
of
the
orders
as
the
hspd
program
that
was
challenged
in
nelson
was
intended
to
help
implement
identity
management
and
information
sharing
protocols
and
procedures
after
the
terrorist
attacks
of
september
in
nelson
nasa
contractors
argued
that
the
background
check
required
by
the
hspd
program
violated
a
constitutional
right
to
informational
privacy
the
court
ruled
against
the
nasa
contractors
holding
that
the
background
check
process
that
was
challenged
consisted
of
reasonable
employment
related
inquiries
that
further
the
government
s
interests
in
managing
its
internal
operations
n
the
supreme
court
s
decision
in
nelson
was
widely
anticipated
by
privacy
experts
and
scholars
over
three
decades
have
passed
since
the
court
referred
broadly
to
a
constitutional
privacy
interest
in
avoiding
disclosure
of
personal
matters
n
when
the
court
granted
certiorari
therefore
some
were
hopeful
that
nelson
presented
a
ripe
opportunity
to
reaffirm
the
role
of
a
constitutional
right
to
information
privacy
in
safeguarding
private
individuals
here
privately
employed
scientist
contractors
performing
low
security
risk
research
for
nasa
through
a
private
university
from
unnecessarily
overbroad
disclosure
requirements
by
the
government
and
the
risks
of
inadvertent
or
malicious
exposure
of
personal
information
that
could
result
from
the
government
s
digitalized
data
collection
procedures
as
one
amicus
brief
filed
in
the
case
explained
constitutional
privacy
safeguards
are
particularly
important
in
this
case
because
nasa
s
failure
to
meet
its
obligations
under
the
privacy
act
and
the
agency
s
poor
data
security
practices
pose
substantial
risks
to
the
scientists
personal
information
n
given
the
significance
of
the
case
especially
in
light
of
increasing
public
concerns
about
suspicionless
data
mining
by
the
government
and
recent
well
publicized
cases
of
database
compromise
through
hackers
some
were
surprised
when
the
court
issued
its
decision
rather
quickly
and
summarily
fairly
soon
after
oral
argument
in
a
relatively
brief
opinion
the
supreme
court
assumed
without
deciding
that
the
constitution
protects
a
privacy
right
n
the
court
then
concluded
that
nasa
s
background
check
newly
implemented
to
bring
the
federal
agency
into
compliance
with
hspd
did
not
violate
a
right
to
privacy
if
one
were
to
assume
that
such
a
right
might
exist
n
the
court
held
that
the
government
s
interests
as
employer
and
proprietor
in
managing
its
internal
operations
combined
with
the
protections
against
public
dissemination
provided
by
the
privacy
act
of
u
s
c
a
ed
and
supp
iv
satisfy
any
interest
in
avoiding
disclosure
that
may
arguably
have
its
roots
in
the
constitution
n
with
its
decision
the
supreme
court
overturned
a
preliminary
injunction
that
had
ordered
the
suspension
of
nasa
s
background
check
process
after
the
ninth
circuit
found
aspects
of
the
government
s
questions
to
be
in
violation
of
the
scientists
constitutional
right
to
privacy
n
the
supreme
court
explained
that
the
ninth
circuit
was
in
error
because
the
questions
challenged
by
respondents
are
part
of
a
standard
employment
background
check
of
the
sort
used
by
millions
of
private
employers
n
yet
the
significance
of
this
case
is
misstated
and
misunderstood
when
cast
as
a
simplistic
battle
over
background
check
protocol
under
the
government
s
hspd
program
and
whether
that
protocol
may
or
may
not
implicate
constitutional
privacy
interests
both
the
supreme
court
and
the
ninth
circuit
focused
on
a
series
of
drug
related
questions
presumed
to
be
the
most
objectionable
to
the
scientists
and
that
are
listed
on
the
standard
form
questionnaire
for
non
sensitive
positions
sf
n
sf
asks
whether
an
employee
has
used
possessed
supplied
or
manufactured
illegal
drugs
in
the
last
year
n
in
issuing
the
preliminary
injunction
the
ninth
circuit
concluded
that
the
form
s
open
ended
and
highly
private
questions
were
not
narrowly
tailored
to
meet
the
government
s
interests
in
verifying
contractors
identities
and
ensuring
the
security
of
the
jet
propulsion
laboratory
at
nasa
n
in
a
footnote
the
court
noted
a
compelling
question
raised
by
the
scientists
that
had
been
dismissed
by
the
ninth
circuit
as
unripe
and
had
not
been
made
the
subject
of
a
cross
petition
a
question
of
the
so
called
suitability
criteria
that
the
government
used
to
determine
employment
eligibility
at
jet
propulsion
laboratory
n
these
factors
include
consideration
of
a
candidate
s
financial
and
emotional
health
as
well
as
things
like
carnal
knowledge
n
the
suitability
criteria
were
derived
from
a
ninety
four
page
government
vetting
protocol
document
titled
nasa
desk
guide
for
suitability
and
security
clearance
processing
version
n
specifically
understanding
the
scientists
constitutional
informational
privacy
claim
requires
an
understanding
of
the
morality
and
character
testing
criteria
that
were
open
for
questioning
and
evaluation
during
the
background
check
process
required
under
nasa
s
implementation
of
hspd
on
page
sixty
five
of
the
desk
guide
nasa
includes
an
issue
characterization
chart
that
allows
nasa
to
assess
individuals
character
and
suitability
based
on
more
than
itemized
characteristics
n
these
items
appeared
to
assess
good
moral
character
and
trustworthiness
characteristics
on
the
evaluation
include
drunk
bad
check
pattern
of
irresponsibility
as
reflected
in
credit
history
carnal
knowledge
indecent
proposal
sodomy
voyeurism
or
peeping
tom
mailing
selling
or
displaying
obscene
material
beastiality
pattern
of
excessive
substance
abuse
as
reflected
in
inability
to
function
responsibly
and
medical
treatment
or
poor
health
disorderly
conduct
attitude
and
personality
conflict
trespassing
and
minor
traffic
violation
n
upon
successful
completion
of
the
nasa
suitability
and
security
clearance
processing
protocol
the
desk
guide
authorizes
the
agency
to
issue
the
nasa
employee
or
private
contractor
a
biometric
id
card
in
accordance
with
hspd
n
failure
to
pass
this
newly
implemented
clearance
process
results
in
the
termination
of
employment
n
while
the
suitability
criteria
were
not
before
the
court
the
acting
solicitor
general
nevertheless
felt
compelled
to
assert
at
oral
argument
that
nasa
will
not
and
does
not
use
such
objectionable
criteria
to
make
contractor
credentialing
decisions
n
the
need
for
such
assurance
indicates
the
scientists
did
indeed
have
real
privacy
concerns
even
if
they
did
not
crystallize
into
part
of
a
live
claim
before
the
court
thus
lost
in
this
case
was
a
real
concern
about
what
information
nasa
or
any
other
government
agency
is
allowed
to
seek
under
the
identity
verification
procedures
imposed
by
hspd
and
whether
the
constitution
under
a
privacy
right
imposes
any
fundamental
limiting
principles
on
that
identity
verification
process
the
acting
solicitor
general
s
assurance
that
intimate
personal
details
regarding
credit
card
debt
and
carnal
knowledge
for
example
will
not
be
considered
by
nasa
is
nothing
more
than
that
just
an
assurance
meanwhile
the
suitability
criteria
that
could
be
used
to
determine
the
denial
of
the
issuance
of
a
biometric
id
card
under
hspd
makes
clear
that
fears
that
government
identity
management
programs
may
become
overbroad
and
overintrusive
are
not
paranoid
or
baseless
nelson
by
affirming
hspd
may
now
pave
the
way
for
the
implementation
of
a
biometric
credentialing
program
and
uniform
biometric
based
dataveillance
program
on
a
national
scale
nelson
also
demonstrates
how
suitable
character
testing
or
morality
testing
can
be
built
into
modern
vetting
protocols
in
civilian
background
checks
as
the
facts
of
the
case
demonstrated
that
nasa
employees
and
contractors
were
required
to
demonstrate
trustworthiness
and
good
character
before
receipt
of
the
biometric
identification
card
under
a
universal
biometric
identification
system
however
suitability
testing
or
character
vetting
protocols
could
be
embedded
within
the
database
screening
system
itself
thus
the
morality
testing
would
not
necessarily
arrive
at
the
front
end
of
the
vetting
process
as
was
seen
in
nelson
rather
the
accumulation
of
biometric
and
biographic
data
enables
both
biometric
and
suitability
testing
rather
than
clearing
a
suitability
assessment
in
order
to
qualify
for
a
biometric
id
card
a
biometric
anchored
database
screening
system
could
allow
for
moral
and
suitability
criteria
testing
on
the
back
end
of
the
vetting
process
recent
disclosures
by
edward
snowden
for
example
explain
how
biometric
data
can
be
fused
with
biographic
data
to
assess
risk
n
this
development
in
supreme
court
jurisprudence
is
thus
significant
because
the
original
announcement
of
trump
s
muslim
ban
indicated
that
the
proposal
was
inclusive
of
u
s
citizens
specifically
on
december
shortly
after
then
candidate
trump
announced
plans
for
the
muslim
travel
ban
he
suggested
in
a
nationally
televised
interview
n
that
the
ban
could
possibly
extend
to
muslim
americans
n
trump
invoked
former
president
franklin
d
roosevelt
s
world
war
ii
proclamation
that
u
s
citizens
who
were
potentially
enemy
aliens
could
be
detained
n
on
january
one
day
after
president
trump
signed
the
executive
order
imposing
restrictions
on
the
travel
and
immigration
of
citizens
of
muslim
majority
nations
fox
news
asked
former
new
york
city
mayor
rudy
giuliani
whether
the
executive
order
was
in
fact
a
muslim
ban
n
guiliani
explained
when
trump
first
announced
it
during
the
campaign
he
said
muslim
ban
he
called
me
up
he
said
put
a
commission
together
show
me
the
right
way
to
do
it
legally
n
giuliani
elaborated
further
and
what
we
did
was
we
focused
on
instead
of
religion
danger
perfectly
legal
perfectly
sensible
and
that
s
what
the
ban
is
based
on
it
s
not
based
on
religion
it
s
based
on
places
where
there
are
sic
substantial
evidence
that
people
are
sending
terrorists
into
our
country
n
this
suggests
that
discriminatory
vetting
and
screening
protocols
can
evade
judicial
review
if
a
protected
class
is
targeted
indirectly
through
race
neutral
criteria
such
as
threat
risk
assessments
in
washington
v
trump
n
litigation
that
addressed
the
first
executive
order
the
ninth
circuit
disagreed
that
the
government
had
established
sufficient
evidence
of
an
impending
national
security
threat
n
on
february
in
upholding
the
western
district
of
washington
s
grant
of
a
temporary
restraining
order
halting
the
implementation
of
the
executive
order
the
ninth
circuit
concluded
the
government
has
not
offered
any
evidence
or
even
an
explanation
of
how
the
national
security
concerns
that
justified
those
designations
of
travel
and
immigration
restrictions
which
triggered
visa
requirements
can
be
extrapolated
to
justify
an
urgent
need
for
the
executive
order
to
be
immediately
reinstated
n
in
subsequent
litigation
the
fourth
and
ninth
circuits
agreed
that
the
government
had
failed
to
show
a
sufficient
justification
for
the
executive
order
in
hawaii
v
trump
n
the
ninth
circuit
panel
explained
that
the
president
had
not
made
a
sufficient
finding
that
entry
of
the
excluded
classes
would
be
detrimental
to
the
united
states
n
in
international
refugee
assistance
project
the
fourth
circuit
noted
that
while
the
government
argued
that
it
had
a
national
security
purpose
in
issuing
the
order
evidence
supporting
such
a
purpose
was
comparably
weaker
than
then
candidate
trump
s
statements
about
a
muslim
ban
subsequent
statements
on
the
issues

made
by
his
advisors
as
well
as
the
issuance
of
and

made
by
president
trump
and
his
advisors
regarding
the
second
executive
order
n
at
the
time
this
article
was
written
the
supreme
court
had
granted
certiorari
in
both
cases
and
consolidated
them
for
argument
n
on
february
the
associated
press
reported
that
a
leaked
memo
drafted
at
the
request
of
the
dhs
acting
under
secretary
for
intelligence
and
analysis
concluded
citizenship
is
an
unlikely
indicator
of
terrorism
threats
to
the
united
states
n
the
memo
states
that
the
analysis
undertaken
by
dhs
specifically
analyzed
the
threat
of
the
seven
countries
that
were
impacted
by
section
of
executive
order
n
the
dhs
memo
states
that
of
eighty
two
people
the
government
determined
were
inspired
by
a
foreign
terrorist
group
to
carry
out
or
try
to
carry
out
an
attack
in

since
the
syrian
conflict
commenced
in
march
just
over
half
were
u
s
citizens
born
in
the

n
the
dhs
memo
further
states
that
the
terrorists
were
from
twenty
six
countries
led
by
pakistan
somalia
bangladesh
cuba
ethiopia
iraq
and
uzbekistan
of
these
only
somalia
and
iraq
were
among
the
seven
nations
included
in
the
ban
n
both
the
ninth
and
fourth
circuits
discussed
this
memorandum
and
relied
on
it
in
their
rulings
n
importantly
the
original
january
order
states
that
vetting
policy
should
include
a
test
to
assess
fidelity
to
founding
principles
and
the
constitution
n
statements
by
trump
suggest
that
such
vetting
should
include
a
test
to
assess
loyalty
to
the
united
states
and
whether
an
individual
will
support
our
country
and
love
deeply
our
people
n
he
further
promoted
as
a
candidate
the
implementation
of
profiling
and
preventative
measures
such
as
mass
surveillance
to
assess
terroristic
risk
n
in
nelson
twin
innovations
in

policy
included
a
machine
readable
biometric
id
card
encoded
with
digitalized
biometric

and
other
personally
identifiable
data
as
was
required
by
the

program
in
the
suitability
criteria
developed
by
nasa
a
version
of
extreme
vetting
emerged
the
january
order
discusses
the
need
to
implement
loyalty
tests
that
demonstrate
pro
american
values
thus
extreme
vetting
may
be
expanded
to
encompass
similar
abstract
assessments
of
character
and
morality
as
a
part
of
threat
risk
assessments
by
affirming
the
credentialing
protocol
surrounding
hspd
and
sanctioning
an
identity
management
technology
nelson
opens
the
door
to
profound
questions
of
constitutional
law
electronic
privacy
law
and
policy
and
surveillance
policy
that
have
yet
to
be
resolved
these
questions
include
the
role
of
biometric
technology
and
dataveillance
in
national
security
policy
and
immigration
control
policy
it
now
remains
to
be
seen
whether
hspd
will
eventually
serve
as
a
programmatic
and
technological
prototype
for
a
national
biometric
id
system
such

the
threat

of
railway
companies
that
were
frustrated
with
their
gatekeeping
duties
under

n
railway
companies
opposed
the
segregation
law
on
the
ground
that
running
two
train
cars
one
for
white
passengers
and
one
for
black
passengers
was
economically
costly
especially
for
train
routes
on
which
ridership
had
proven
to
be
light

the
petitioners
also
argued
that
it

unlawful
to
delegate

gatekeeping
to
the
private
companies

would
be
fined
for

a
similar
de

may
be
emerging
in
the
modern

how
do

explained

once
again
asked
to
engage
in
discrimination

under
the
law
by
effectually
being
deputized
as
immigration
gatekeepers
specifically
the
wall
street
journal
described
irca
as
the
first
legislation
since
jim
crow
where
the
government
is
so
closely
aligned
with
a
process
that
produces
discrimination
n
from
the
s
to
the
present
immigration
laws
at
the
federal
and
state
level
have
attempted
to
restrict
immigrant
access
to
transportation
and
travel
employment
education
housing
and
benefits
n
in
contrast
to
historic
jim
crow
regimes
however
the
targeting
of
the
undocumented
immigrant
population
does
not
need
to
proceed
under
a
facade
of
equality
because
such
discrimination
is
often
construed
as
legally
permissible
undocumented
immigrants
with
important
exceptions
do
not
enjoy
the
broad
civil
rights
protections
and
constitutional
rights
afforded
to
u
s
citizens
n
even
lawful
immigrants
may
face
more
restricted
rights
than
u
s
citizens
n
those
arguing
in
favor
of
tough
immigration
actions
including
those
defending
the
executive
orders
have
explained
this
position
as
a
legal
defense
of
such
actions
n
yet
for
decades
lawful
immigrants
and
those
perceived
to
be
foreign
have
alleged
that
they
suffer
from
a
form
of
collateral
discrimination
an
assumption
of
undocumented
status
and
accidental
targeting
that
stems
from
restrictive
immigration
laws
n
studies
have
consistently
shown
that
vetting
and
screening
protocols
required
by
immigration
gatekeeping
sometimes
referred
to
as
show
me
your
papers
laws
incentivize
racial
profiling
n
in
other
words
mandatory
document
checks
often
target
those
perceived
to
be

who
may
be
isolated
on
the
basis
of

ethnicity
national
origin
religion
and

characteristics
n
such
as

and
a
failure
to
present

characteristics
n
in
response
to
growing
empirical
evidence
that
immigration
related
screening
and
delegated
gatekeeping
duties
by
the
government
reliably
led
to
discrimination
congress
increasingly
looked
to
technological
screening
methods
as
race
neutral
tools
to
achieve
the
same
means
n
throughout
the
s
until
the
present
immigration
reform
legislation
has
proposed
database
driven
methods
to
implement
screening
and
gatekeeping
functions
n
many
of
these
database
screening
methods
are
experimental
and
still
under
testing
n
nonetheless
the
terror
attacks
accelerated
the
rollout
of
these
experimental
vetting
and
screening
systems
n
the
immigrant
status
of
the
hijackers
led
to
calls
for
policy
initiatives
that
could
facilitate
the
identification
and
more
efficient
tracking
of
immigrants
and
potential
terrorists
through
cybersurveillance
and
dataveillance
technologies
n
many
of
these
technologies
were
dependent
upon
biometric
data
monitoring
and
database
facilitated
algorithmic
sorting
tools
n
the
impetus
was
not
so
much
to
avoid
bias
in
screening
but
to
harness
the
supposed
efficiencies
and
reliability
of
a
database
centered
means
of
screening
since
immigration
policy
and
national
security
policy
have
increasingly
converged
at
the
federal
level
this
convergence
could
be
seen
in
the
increasing
adoption
of
big
data
identity
management
systems
aimed
to
screen
the
population
to
determine
who
could
receive
rights
and
benefits
such
as
the
no

list

the
no

and
the
no

list
managed
by
secure

the
dhs
s
prioritized
enforcement
program
n
these
database
screening
and
digital
watchlisting
systems
purport
to
further
crime
control
immigration
control
and
counterterrorism
objectives
the
e
verify
database
has
not
only
been
used
to
restrict
employment
opportunities
but
it
is
alleged
that
landlords
have
used
the
database
to
screen
tenants
and
that
school
officials
have
used
the
database
to
screen
students
n
similarly
the
no
vote
list
save
n
and
hava
n
has
been
used
for
voter
purges
and
to
restrict
driver
s
licenses
as
well
as
access
to
welfare
benefits
n
after
the
federal
government
sought
a
sharp
increase
in
personnel
who
could
conduct
vetting
and
implement
screening
protocols
to
increase
the
effectiveness
of
immigration
gatekeeping
n
thus
the
federal
government
also
increasingly
invited
state
and
local
law
enforcement
to
participate
in
the
enforcement
of
federal
immigration
law
under
a
force

theory
n
of
delegation
of
immigration
gatekeeping
n
under
the
expanded
immigration

mandates
of

state
and
local
governments
were
granted
access
to
dhs
database
screening
systems
and
invited
to
screen
arrestees
through
these
systems
n
after
the
federal

also
experimented
with
the
merging
of

eliminate
the
separation
between

n
under

federalism

captured

each

strategy
as

resulted

an
unprecedented
expansion
of
document
inspection

n
arizona
s
aggressive
stance
on
restrictive
immigration
gatekeeping
is
enabled
by
the
introduction
of
big

and
database
screening
potentialities
often
conducted
through

the

life
and
while
it
is
a
system
to
screen
out
immigrants
at
the
national
level
and
in
the
national
security
context
newly
emerging
digital
watchlisting
and
database
screening
programs
such
as
the
no
fly
list
make
clear
that
database
screening
is
easily
adaptable
to
other
kinds
of
vetting
for
various
purposes
those
screened
or
vetted
will
individually
encounter
a
purportedly
neutral
and
colorblind
process
but
with
the
result
that
they
fall
into
groups
that
can
start
to
look
much
like
the
kinds
of
classifications
that
would
normally
offend
the
constitution
s
equal
protection
guarantees
consequently
the
extreme
vetting
protocols
and
the
implementation
of
a
muslim
registry
should
be
understood
within
the
context
of
delegated
database
screening
protocols
such
as
those
proposed
and
passed
by
arizona
as
can
be
seen
in
the
discussion

to
a
wide
range
of
contexts
including
employment

appears
to
be

effort
n
identity
management
technologies
that
rely
upon
the
internet
and
digital
databases
to
verify
identity
have
been
developed
to
help
execute
these
goals
as
a
presidential
candidate
trump
explained
that
immigration
control
and
counterterrorism
efforts
required
a
lot
of
systems
beyond
databases
n
because
these
statutes
are
perceived
as
targeting
primarily
those
born
in
foreign
countries
but
residing
here
the
questions
of
government
intrusion
and
disparate
impact
are
obscured
however
while
the
state
and
federal
laws
at
issue
may
be
immigration
laws
first
they
are
still
identity
screening
laws
and
the
entire
population
citizens
and
noncitizens
is
subject
to
their
vetting
and
screening
protocols
consequently
immigration
federalism
when
combined
with
national
security
federalism
is
driving
the
exponential
expansion
of
identity
management
programs
and
biometric
database
screening
given
the
historical
connection
between
mass
data
collection
and
mass
discrimination
n
federal
courts
may
require
an
inquiry
into
the
discriminatory
animus
in
the
design
of
the
vetting
protocols
and
the
database
screening
systems
that
inquiry
will
likely
start
from
an
assessment
of
the
disparate
impact
of
identity
management
technologies
relatedly
challengers
and
the
courts
must
contemplate
the
disparate
impact
of
the
algorithms
themselves
the
screening
inputs
that
produce
the
results
and
the
discriminatory
result
of
other
data
driven
decision
making
tools
rather
than
in
the
personal
animus
of
the
screener
judicial
review
should
evolve
to
question
analytical
assumptions
and
to
develop
evaluative
methods
to
interrogate
the
underlying
algorithms
informing
the
screening
and
vetting
systems
challengers
and
federal
courts
must
also
become
more
aware
of
other
types
of
discrimination
that
can
be
facilitated
by
digitalized
vetting
and
screening
protocols
although
data
driven
discrimination
is
not
currently
recognized
we
can
begin
challenging
the
collection
of
data
under
privacy
theories
and
attempt
to
limit
the
ways
in
which
judgments
can
be
made
based
on
the
analysis
of
such
data
nelson
for
example
challenged
data
driven
decisions
that
imposed
arbitrary
definitions
of
suitability
on
moral
proclivities
rather
than
decision
making
founded
on
a
secure
rational
basis
n
further
identity
management
technologies
and
algorithmic
jim
crow
may
force
innovations
in
constitutional
data
privacy
theories
these
may
include
for
example
asserting
a
reasonable
expectation
of
privacy
under
the
fourth
amendment
s
prohibition
of
the
search
and
seizure
of
data
the
original
complaints
filed
to
enjoin
lawa
s
mandatory
e
verify
database
screening
alleged
a
fourth
amendment
violation
n
among
other
challenges
the
chamber
of
commerce
argued
that
e
verify
required
an
unconstitutional
search
and
seizure
of
an
employee
s
personally
identifiable
information
by
arizona
employers
n
the
fourth
amendment
challenge
however
was
not
the
driving
force
behind
the
litigation
was
withdrawn
by
stipulation
before
the
district
court
n
and
was
not
before
the
supreme
court
in
whiting
which
focused
on
the
question
of
preemption
n
although
the
united
states
only
challenged
section
b
of
arizona
s
sb
on
preemption
grounds
the
american
civil
liberties
union
aclu
had
originally
raised
other
constitutional
claims
including
a
fourth
amendment
claim
to
the
implementation
of
section
b
which
required
mandatory
biometric
database
screening
of
those
suspected
of
unlawful
presence
n
once
again
the
fourth
amendment
claim
was
not
before
the
supreme
court
in
arizona
which
also
focused
on
preemption
n
it
is
important
to
note
as
well
that
similar
to
korematsu
the
no
fly
list
challengers
have
relied
on
due
process
rather
than
equal
protection
as
in
korematsu
the
government
has
defended
the
no
fly
list
as
a
national
security
program
that
does
not
target
classifications
of
individuals
but
rather
targets
risk
in
his
dissent
in
korematsu
justice
frank
murphy
stated
that
the
order
deprives
all
those
within
its
scope
of
the
equal
protection
of
the
laws
as
guaranteed
by
the
fifth
amendment
n
of
the
relationship
between
due
process
and
equal
protection
william
eskridge
has
observed
that
the
due
process
clause
announces
a
procedural
norm
n
to
the
extent
that
the
due
process
clause
is
recognized
to
carry
a
substantive
element
eskridge
explains
the
courts
demand
a
fit
between
the
reasonableness
of
the
deprivation
whatever
the
process
and
the
law
of
the
land
the
equal
protection
clause
requires
the
state
to
justify
any
difference
in
procedural
or
substantive
treatment
of
one
person
vis
a
vis
another
n
consequently
the
equal
protection
clause
may
be
less
useful
than
other
constitutional
options
that
can
force
political
change
such
as
the
due
process
clause
and
the
first
amendment
n
eskridge
suggests
however
that
the
due
process
clause
can
secure
important
rights
at
the
individual
level
n
he
notes
that
our
conception
of
due
process
is
more
elastic
and
can
track
changing
standards
of
social
progress
n
further
perhaps
the
most
fundamental
value
found
in
the
due
process
clause
is
the
idea
that
the
state
is
obligated
to
treat
every
person
as
a
presumptively
worthwhile
human
being
who
is
entitled
to
respect
and
humane
treatment
this
principle
is
the
key
reason
buck
v
bell
and
korematsu
were
wrongly
decided
n
eskridge
signals
that
the
time
might
be
right
to
view
equal
protection
and
due
process
as
interchangeable
and
interdependent
in
the
vindication
of
individual
rights
n
there
are
benefits
to
prevailing
under
an
equal
protection
claim
n
namely
the
equal
protection
clause
alone
offers
a
minority
group
a
potential
constitutional
jackpot
at
the
wholesale
level
that
is
in
challenges
to
an
array
of
interconnected
discriminations
in
state
benefits
as
well
as
burdens
n
eskridge
posits
however
that
due
process
can
yield
similar
wholesale
benefits
to
protection
as
the
equal
protection
clause
under
the
constitution
there
is
no
theoretical
or
historical
limit
to
extending
wholesale
rights
to
classes
of
individuals
under
a
due
process
theory
n
in
fact
a
destabilizing
due
process
that
offers
multiple
opportunities
to
challenge
discrimination
can
result
in
an
evolutive
equal
protection
n
thus
the
equal
protection
process
may
need
to
be
pushed
to
evolve
to
realize
new
forms
of
discrimination
once
the
due
process
clause
forces
the
federal
courts
to
confront
the
unreasonableness
of
wholesale
deprivations
and
the
need
to
grant
wholesale
benefits
to
challengers
alleging
the
infringement
in
the
context
of
algorithmic
jim
crow
however
the
interrelationship
between
due
process
and
equal
protection
is
more
pragmatic
challenging
algorithm
driven
vetting
and
screening
protocols
under
due
process
claims
means
demanding
answers
about
the
black
box
processes
that
may
flag
individuals
as
potential
risks
or
threats
n
as
the
algorithms
and
data
analytic
processes
become
more
transparent
equal
protection
violations
can
no
longer
be
as
easily
disguised
this
destabilization
or
disruption
of
government
deprivations
made
possible
by
due
process
challenges
can
give
new
evaluative
impetus
to
the
evolution
of
the
types
of
protections
offered
under
the
equal
protection
clause
arguably
this
process
of
destabilizing
algorithmic
due
process
is
already
occurring
under
due
process
and
equal
protection
challenges
among
others
the
no
work
list
has
been
implicated
in
an
equal
protection
challenge
n
the
no
vote
list
has
been
challenged
n
under
section
of
the
voting
rights
act
n
and
the
day
provision
of
the
national
voter
registration
act
n
the
no
citizenship
list
has
been
challenged
under
both
procedural
due
process
and
equal
protection
claims
under
the
fifth
and
fourteenth
amendments
n
as
well
as
under
the
fourth
amendment
n
in
addition
the
subsequent
litigation
of
the
no
citizenship
list
was
found
to
implicate
the
tenth
amendment
under
the
anticommandeering
doctrine
n
the
no
fly
list
and
terrorist
watchlist
have
been
challenged
under
multiple
legal
claims
and
constitutional
theories
n
including
procedural
due
process
and
substantive
due
process
under
the
fifth
amendment
n
algorithmic
jim
crow
may
not
be
challenged
successfully
on
equal
protection
grounds
but
rather
on
other
legal
grounds
such
as
informational
privacy
grounds
the
legal
claim
in
nelson
nelson
is
especially
useful
to
the
analysis
here
as
it
involves
a
challenge
to
both
a
mandatory
biometric
id
program
and
the
vetting
protocols
associated
with
the
program
n
like
the
loyalty
requirements
imposed
by
the
january
order
n
the
vetting
protocols
challenged
in
nelson
also
involved
screening
criteria
to
determine
trustworthiness
morality
and
suitability
criteria
subsequently
criticized
by
the
court
as
subjective
and
objectionable
n
consequently
legal
responses
to
algorithmic
jim
crow
may
require
preconceiving
identity
management
harms
to
encompass
a
broad
range
of
legal
theories
as
in
the
no
fly
list
litigation
the
government
will
likely
defend
disparate
impact
consequences
as
justified
based
upon
risk
assessments
terroristic
classifications
data
screening
results
deemed
suspect
and
characteristics
establishing
unsuitability
n
these
are
classifications
and
characteristics
not
protected
by
equal
protection
jurisprudence
to
acknowledge
the
harms
emerging
from
algorithmic
jim
crow
equality
law
should
be
broadened
to
recognize
data
driven
discrimination
and
recognition
of
algorithm
and
big
data
derived
disparate
impact
rather
than
limiting
protection
to
only
animus
based
classification
driven
discrimination
conclusion
algorithmic
jim
crow
regimes
are
distinguished
from
historic
jim
crow
regimes
in
several
significant
respects
algorithmic
jim
crow
is
cybersurveillance
driven
and
dataveillance
dependent
built
around
the
transparency
of
biometric
identity
and
other
technologies
of
identity
management
monitoring
internet
and
social
media
activity
and
contact
lists
through
telephony
databases
database
screening
and
digital
watchlisting
enforcement
and
other
emerging
big
data
surveillance
techniques
in
contrast
traditional
jim
crow
is
law
driven
built
around
the
transparency
of
racial
identity
monitoring
economic
educational
political
and
social
activity
and
utilizing
traditional
criminal
enforcement
and
detention
tools
as
well
as
small
data
surveillance
techniques
algorithmic
jim
crow
describes
an
equal
but
separate
system
of
de
jure
and
de
facto
discrimination
rather
than
the
separate
but
equal
discrimination
of
historic
jim
crow
the
goal
of
algorithmic
jim
crow
is
not
physical
separation
per
se
rather
all
individuals
subjected
to
an
algorithmic
jim
crow
regime
may
be
equally
vetted
through
database
screening
and
digital
watchlisting
systems
the
separation
however
is
achieved
through
data
discrimination
applied
on
the
back
end
of
screening
and
vetting
protocols
rather
than
overt
social
and
economic
discrimination
and
legal
apartheid
applied
on
the
front
end
of
segregationist
regimes
the
equal
but
separate
impact
of
algorithmic
jim
crow
will
likely
manifest
itself
in
the
big
data
assessment
of
risk
factors
that
purport
to
predict
terroristic
and
criminal
threat
rather
than
segregation
systems
of
racial
or
ethnic
classification
in
other
words
individuals
will
be
at
risk
of
disparate
treatment
on
the
basis
of
suspicious
algorithmic
results
and
anomalous
data
or
foreignness
characteristics
thus
disparate
treatment
stemming
from
cybersurveillance
and
dataveillance
may
not
be
characterized
as
traditional
discrimination
discrimination
on
the
basis
of
a
historically
protected
class
for
instance
race
color
ethnicity
national
origin
and
sex
this
type
of
identity
management
technology
based
discrimination
may
therefore
fall
outside
current
interpretations
of
the
scope
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
s
equal
protection
clause
and
outside
the
reach
of
the
protection
of
civil
rights
statutes
algorithmic
vetting
and
biometric
identification
especially
once
deployed
across
an
entire
citizenry
will
likely
lead
to
discriminatory
profiling
and
surveillance
on
the
basis
of
suspicious
digital
data
and
internet
and
social
media
activity
deemed
suspect
as
well
as
classification
based
discrimination
such
as
the
isolation
of
those
emigrating
from
muslim
majority
nations
these
systems
are
likely
to
result
in
both
direct
and
collateral
discrimination
on
the
basis
of
citizenship
status
national
origin
and
religion
in
particular
in
addition
recent
immigration
control
policies
and
programs
demonstrate
the
government
s
willingness
to
delegate
screening
and
vetting
duties
to
private
actors
such
as
employers
and
local
law
enforcement
which
can
exacerbate
issues
of
racial
profiling
and
discrimination
this
discrimination
may
face
limited
or
lenient
review
by
a
federal
judiciary
that
generally
grants
broad
deference
in
matters
of
immigration
and
national
security
because
algorithmic
jim
crow
may
appear
to
offer
equality
in
theory
it
may
not
be
challenged
successfully
on
equal
protection
grounds
under
the
current
equal
protection
framework
thus
the
jurisprudence
must
evolve
to
encompass
new
harms
and
recognize
the
disparate
impact
harms
of
algorithmic
jim
crow
regimes
at
the
same
time
algorithmic
jim
crow
must
be
challenged
under
other
legal
theories
including
search
and
seizure
of
data
under
the
fourth
amendment
procedural
due
process
and
informational
privacy
rights
under
substantive
due
process
guarantees
of
the
fifth
and
fourteenth
amendments
first
amendment
theories
and
other
statutory
and
constitutional
theories
wholesale
disruptions
to
algorithmic
jim
crow
under
a
wide
range
of
legal
theories
will
likely
force

middle
eastern
professor
anila
daulatzai
a
pakistani
american
became
a
victim
when
on
september
she
boarded
a
flight
in
baltimore
expecting
to
land
in
los
angeles
a
few
hours
later
to
take
care
of
her
elderly
father
after
informing
flight
attendants
of
her
non
life
threatening
allergy
to
dogs
she
seated
herself
in
the
back
of
the
aircraft
away
from
two
dogs
on
the
plane
and
prepared
to
grade
her
students
papers
she
was
suddenly
requested
by
the
flight
crew
to
provide
medical
documentation
of
her
allergy
which
she
had
already
mentioned
was
not
serious
and
upon
not
being
able
to
produce
it
was
told
to
exit
the
aircraft
when
she
refused
the
police
came
and
violently
dragged
her
off
the
plane
as
seen
in
a
video
of
the
incident
that
went
viral
following
the
incident
multiple
charges
were
issued
against
her
including
disorderly
conduct
and
failure
to
obey
a
reasonable
and
lawful
order
daulatzai
s
lawyer
arjun
sethi
classified
the
arrest
as
the
confluence
of
sexism
racial
profiling
and
discrimination
formerly
national
legislative
counsel
for
human
rights
and
national
security
related
affairs
for
the
american
civil
liberties
union
and
presently
co
chair
of
the
american
bar
association
s
national
committee
on
homeland
security
counterterrorism
and
treatment
of
enemy
combatants
arjun
has
spent
most
of
his
career
focused
on
countering
racial
and
religious
profiling
advancing
counterterrorism
reform
and
combating
hate
motivated
violence
i
first
met
arjun
who
has
a
sikh
background
a
few
years
back
following
a
talk
i
gave
at
the
national
press
club
launching
my
book
the
thistle
and
the
drone
after
the
programme
he
came
up
to
me
and
began
discussing
his
civil
and
human
rights
work
on
behalf
of
not
only
muslim
americans
but
minorities
throughout
the
us
i
was
impressed
he
was
fighting
for
justice
within
the
system
when
i
invited
arjun
to
speak
before
my
world
of
islam
class
at
american
university
recently
he
made
some
core
points
related
to
the
rise
in
hate
related
incidents
against
muslims
since
noting
they
are
trending
at
least
five
times
higher
than
prior
to
the
attacks
he
said
we
are
living
in
an
open
season
of
prejudice
against
muslims
perpetual
war
in
iraq
and
afghanistan
has
contributed
to
prevailing
negative
attitudes
he
argued
and
the
guantanamo
bay
detention
facility
in
cuba
stands
as
a
testament
to
negative
treatment
of
muslims
suspected
of
terrorist
activities
arjun
also
spoke
of
police
tactics
that
often
serve
to
perpetuate
discrimination
he
shared
how
a
team
of
associated
press
reporters
revealed
that
covert
domestic
surveillance
programs
established
in
new
york
city
following
for
example
were
explicitly
designed
to
monitor
muslim
citizens
representing
an
abandonment
of
rights
to
privacy
that
all
americans
are
entitled
to
enjoy
none
of
the
surveillance
was
based
on
reasonable
suspicion
or
probable
cause
but
instead
solely
based
on
identity
the
surveillance
did
not
result
in
a
single
conviction
these
surveillance
programs
he
noted
have
been
complemented
by
watch
lists
there
are
three
types
of
watch
lists
administered
by
the
transportation
security
administration
a
terrorist
watch
list
of
million
individuals
suspected
of
terrorist
activities
a
selectee
list
which
requires
listed
individuals
to
undergo
enhanced
screening
measures
before
flying
and
a
no
fly
list
of
some
which
forbids
listed
individuals
from
boarding
an
airplane
the
consequences
of
these
watch
lists
are
serious
those
listed
may
be
unable
to
see
their
families
or
even
apply
for
loans
and
employment
listed
individuals
are
generally
considered
too
dangerous
to
fly
but
not
dangerous
enough
to
be
arrested
which
keeps
them
in
an
uneasy
limbo
with
broad
consequences
arjun
also
discussed
the
efficacy
of
countering
violent
extremism
cve
programs
which
are
designed
to
target
individuals
who
may
become
terrorists
these
programs
are
a
form
of
predictive
policing
he
explained
as
they
use
an
individual
s
prior
history
to
determine
threat
scores
and
geographic
analysis
of
criminal
activity
to
assess
potential
hot
spots
arjun
believes
these
programs
are
based
on
abstract
methods
and
junk
science
that
ultimately
serve
as
another
mechanism
for
surveillance
of
muslim
citizens
arjun
argued
that
the
us
government
needs
to
begin
addressing
the
structural
racism
discrimination
and
criminalisation
that
foster
hate
and
violence
against
muslims
who
remain
disproportionately
targeted
by
american
national
security
policy
arjun
also
pointed
to
media
representations
that
encourage
islamophobia
he
cited
a
media
matters
study
conducted
on
three
days
of
media
reporting
after
the
recent
muslim
ban
their
findings
revealed
that
of
guests
on
fox
news
cnn
and
msnbc
the
three
major
broadcast
news
networks
only
guests
were
actual
muslims
viewing
the
compassion
he
brings
to
his
work
i
could
not
but
think
of
the
wisdom
of
the
founder
of
his
faith
guru
nanak
who
famously
said
those
that
have
loved
are
those
that
have
found
god
while
pakistan
has
somewhat
of
a
reputation
as
encouraging
religious
intolerance
in
fact
the
birthplace
of
guru
nanak
which
i
visited
not
long
ago
is
in
nankana
sahib
pakistan
and
i
can
report
that
it
is
spotlessly
clean
and
tended
with
special
reverence
and
affection
by
the
local
administration
here
in
america
arjun
sethi
is
championing
the
great
guru
s
message
of
humanity
by
fighting
for
the
civil
rights
of
muslims
and
of
all
americans

a
stunning
report
claimed
that
a
computer
program
used
by
a
us
court
for
risk
assessment
was
biased
against
black
prisoners
the
program
correctional
offender
management
profiling
for
alternative
sanctions
compas
was
much
more
prone
to
mistakenly
label
black
defendants
as
likely
to
reoffend
wrongly
flagging
them
at
almost
twice
the
rate
as
white
people
to
according
to
the
investigative
journalism
organisation
propublica
compas
and
programs
similar
to
it
were
in
use
in
hundreds
of
courts
across
the
us
potentially
informing
the
decisions
of
judges
and
other
officials
the
message
seemed
clear
the
us
justice
system
reviled
for
its
racial
bias
had
turned
to
technology
for
help
only
to
find
that
the
algorithms
had
a
racial
bias
too
how
could
this
have
happened
the
private
company
that
supplies
the
software
northpointe
disputed
the
conclusions
of
the
report
but
declined
to
reveal
the
inner
workings
of
the
program
which
it
considers
commercially
sensitive
the
accusation
gave
frightening
substance
to
a
worry
that
has
been
brewing
among
activists
and
computer
scientists
for
years
and
which
the
tech
giants
google
and
microsoft
have
recently
taken
steps
to
investigate
that
as
our
computational
tools
have
become
more
advanced
they
have
become
more
opaque
the
data
they
rely
on
arrest
records
postcodes
social
affiliations
income
can
reflect
and
further
ingrain
human
prejudice
the
promise
of
machine
learning
and
other
programs
that
work
with
big
data
often
under
the
umbrella
term
artificial
intelligence
or
ai
was
that
the
more
information
we
feed
these
sophisticated
computer
algorithms
the
better
they
perform
last
year
according
to
global
management
consultant
mckinsey
tech
companies
spent
somewhere
between
bn
and
bn
on
ai
mostly
in
research
and
development
investors
are
making
a
big
bet
that
ai
will
sift
through
the
vast
amounts
of
information
produced
by
our
society
and
find
patterns
that
will
help
us
be
more
efficient
wealthier
and
happier
it
has
led
to
a
decade
long
ai
arms
race
in
which
the
uk
government
is
offering
six
figure
salaries
to
computer
scientists
they
hope
to
use
machine
learning
to
among
other
things
help
unemployed
people
find
jobs
predict
the
performance
of
pension
funds
and
sort
through

and
customs
casework
it
has
become
a
kind
of
received
wisdom
that
these
programs
will
touch
every
aspect
of
our
lives
it
s
impossible
to
know
how
widely
adopted
ai
is
now
but
i
do
know
we
can
t
go

one
computer
scientist
says
it
s
impossible
to
know
how
widely
adopted
ai
is
now
but
i
do
know
we
can
t
go
back
but
while
some
of
the
most
prominent
voices
in
the
industry
are
concerned
with
the
far
off
future
apocalyptic
potential
of
ai
there
is
less
attention
paid
to
the
more
immediate
problem
of
how
we
prevent
these
programs
from
amplifying
the
inequalities
of
our
past
and
affecting
the
most
vulnerable
members
of
our
society
when
the
data
we
feed
the
machines
reflects
the
history
of
our
own
unequal
society
we
are
in
effect
asking
the
program
to
learn
our
own
biases
if
you
re
not
careful
you
risk
automating
the
exact
same
biases
these
programs
are
supposed
to
eliminate
says
kristian
lum
the
lead
statistician
at
the
san
francisco
based
non
profit
human
rights
data
analysis
group
hrdag
last
year
lum
and
a
co
author
showed
that
predpol
a
program
for
police
departments
that
predicts
hotspots
where
future
crime
might
occur
could
potentially
get
stuck
in
a
feedback
loop
of
over
policing
majority
black
and
brown
neighbourhoods
the
program
was
learning
from
previous
crime
reports
for
samuel
sinyangwe
a
justice
activist
and
policy
researcher
this
kind
of
approach
is
especially
nefarious
because
police
can
say
we
re
not
being
biased
we
re
just
doing
what
the
math
tells
us
and
the
public
perception
might
be
that
the
algorithms
are
impartial
we
have
already
seen
glimpses
of
what
might
be
on
the
horizon
programs
developed
by
companies
at
the
forefront
of
ai
research
have
resulted
in
a
string
of
errors
that
look
uncannily
like
the
darker
biases
of
humanity
a
google
image
recognition
program
labelled
the
faces
of
several
black
people
as
gorillas
a
linkedin
advertising
program
showed
a
preference
for
male
names
in
searches
and
a
microsoft
chatbot
called
tay
spent
a
day
learning
from
twitter
and
began
spouting
antisemitic
messages
these
small
scale
incidents
were
all
quickly
fixed
by
the
companies
involved
and
have
generally
been
written
off
as
gaffes
but
the
compas
revelation
and
lum
s
study
hint
at
a
much
bigger
problem
demonstrating
how
programs
could
replicate
the
sort
of
large
scale
systemic
biases
that
people
have
spent
decades
campaigning
to
educate
or
legislate
away
computers
don
t
become
biased
on
their
own
they
need
to
learn
that
from
us
for
years
the
vanguard
of
computer
science
has
been
working
on
machine
learning
often
having
programs
learn
in
a
similar
way
to
humans
observing
the
world
or
at
least
the
world
we
show
them
and
identifying
patterns
in
google
researchers
fed
their
computer
brain
millions
of
images
from
youtube
videos
to
see
what
it
could
recognise
it
responded
with
blurry
black
and
white
outlines
of
human
and
cat
faces
the
program
was
never
given
a
definition
of
a
human
face
or
a
cat
it
had
observed
and
learned
two
of
our
favourite
subjects
this
sort
of
approach
has
allowed
computers
to
perform
tasks
such
as
language
translation
recognising
faces
or
recommending
films
in
your
netflix
queue
that
just
a
decade
ago
would
have
been
considered
too
complex
to
automate
but
as
the
algorithms
learn
and
adapt
from
their
original
coding
they
become
more
opaque
and
less
predictable
it
can
soon
become
difficult
to
understand
exactly
how
the
complex
interaction
of
algorithms
generated
a
problematic
result
and
even
if
we
could
private
companies
are
disinclined
to
reveal
the
commercially
sensitive
inner
workings
of
their
algorithms
as
was
the
case
with
northpointe
less
difficult
is
predicting
where
problems
can
arise
take
google
s
face
recognition
program
cats
are
uncontroversial
but
what
if
it
was
to
learn
what
british
and
american
people
think
a
ceo
looks
like
the
results
would
likely
resemble
the
near
identical
portraits
of
older
white
men
that
line
any
bank
or
corporate
lobby
and
the
program
wouldn
t
be
inaccurate
only
of
ftse
ceos
are
women
even
fewer
just
have
a
bme
background
when
computers
learn
from
us
they
can
learn
our
less
appealing
attributes
joanna
bryson
a
researcher
at
the
university
of
bath
studied
a
program
designed
to
learn
relationships
between
words
it
trained
on
millions
of
pages
of
text
from
the
internet
and
began
clustering
female
names
and

with
jobs
such
as
receptionist
and

bryson
says
she
was
astonished
by
how
closely
the
results
mirrored
the
real

gender
breakdown
of
those

in

government

a
nearly
correlation
people
expected
ai
to
be
unbiased
that
s
just
wrong
if
the
underlying

reflects

or
if
you
train
ai
from
human
culture
you
will
find
these
things
bryson
says
people
expected

that

about

outsourcing

says
it
s
generally
the
most
vulnerable
in
society
who
are
exposed
to
evaluation
by
automated
systems
a
rich

is
unlikely
to
have
their

application
screened
by
a
computer
or
their
loan
request
evaluated
by
anyone
other
than
a
bank
executive
in
the
justice
system
the
thousands
of
defendants
with
no
money
for
a
lawyer
or
other

would
be
the
most
likely
candidates
for
automated
evaluation

hackney

took

and
fed

predpol

a
daily
map
of
likely
crime
hotspots
that
police
could
deploy
to
based
on
information
about
where
police
had
previously
made
arrests
the
program
was
suggesting
majority
black
neighbourhoods
at
about
twice
the
rate
of
white
ones
despite
the
fact
that
when
the
statisticians
modelled
the
city
s
likely
overall
drug
use
based
on
national
statistics
it
was
much
more
evenly
distributed
as
if
that
wasn

bad
enough
the
researchers
also
simulated
what
would
happen
if
police
had
acted
directly
on
predpol

hotspots
every
day
and
increased
their
arrests
accordingly
the
program
entered
a
feedback
loop
predicting
more
and
more
crime
in
the
neighbourhoods
that
police
visited
most
that
caused
still
more
police
to
be

a
virtual
mirror
of

criticisms
of
initiatives
such
as
new

city
s
controversial
stop

frisk
policy
by
over
targeting
residents

police
arrested
them
at
an
inflated
rate
which
then
justified
further
policing
predpol

acknowledged
the
concerns
when

he
claimed
that
to
combat

drug
arrests
and
other
offences
that
rely
on
the
discretion
of
officers
were
not
used
with

because
they
are
often
more
heavily
enforced
in
poor
and
minority
communities
and
while
most
of

don

hamid
khan
an

coalition
a
community
group
addressing

surveillance
in
los

says
that
people
do
recognise
predictive
policing
as
another
top
down
approach
where
policing
remains
the
same
pathologising
whole
communities
there
is
a
saying
in
computer
science
something
close
to
an
informal
law
garbage
in
garbage
out
it
means
that
programs
are
not
magic
if
you
give
them
flawed
information
they
won
t
fix
the
flaws
they
just
process
the
information
khan
has
his
own
truism
it
s
racism
in
racism
out
it
s
unclear
how
existing
laws
to
protect
against
discrimination
and
to
regulate
algorithmic
decision
making
apply
in
this
new
landscape
often
the
technology
moves
faster
than
governments
can
address
its
effects
in
the
cornell
university
professor
and
former
microsoft
researcher
solon
barocas
claimed
that
current
laws
largely
fail
to
address
discrimination
when
it
comes
to
big
data
and
machine
learning
barocas
says
that
many
traditional
players
in
civil
rights
including
the
american
civil
liberties
union
aclu
are
taking
the
issue
on
in
areas
such
as
housing
or
hiring
practices
sinyangwe
recently
worked
with
the
aclu
to
try
to
pass
city
level
policies
requiring
police
to
disclose
any
technology
they
adopt
including
ai
but
the
process
is
complicated
by
the
fact
that
public
institutions
adopt
technology
sold
by
private
companies
whose
inner
workings
may
not
be
transparent
we
don
t
want
to
deputise
these
companies
to
regulate
themselves
says
barocas
in
the
uk
there
are
some
existing
protections
government
services
and
companies
must
disclose
if
a
decision
has
been
entirely
outsourced
to
a
computer
and
if
so
that
decision
can
be
challenged
but
sandra
wachter
a
law
scholar
at
the
alan
turing
institute
at
oxford
university
says
that
the
existing
laws
don
t
map
perfectly
to
the
way
technology
has
advanced
there
are
a
variety
of
loopholes
that
could
allow
the
undisclosed
use
of
algorithms
she
has
called
for
a
right
to
explanation
which
would
require
a
full
disclosure
as
well
as
a
higher
degree
of
transparency
for
any
use
of
these
programs
the
scientific
literature
on
the
topic
now
reflects
a
debate
on
the
nature
of
fairness
itself
and
researchers
are
working
on
everything
from
ways
to
strip
unfair
classifiers
from
decades
of
historical
data
to
modifying
algorithms
to
skirt
round
any
groups
protected
by
existing
anti
discrimination
laws
one
researcher
at
the
turing
institute
told
me
the
problem
was
so
difficult
because
changing
the
variables
can
introduce
new
bias
and
sometimes
we
re
not
even
sure
how
bias
affects
the
data
or
even
where
it
is
the
institute
has
developed
a
program
that
tests
a
series
of
counterfactual
propositions
to
track
what
affects
algorithmic
decisions
would
the
result
be
the
same
if
the
person
was
white
or
older
or
lived
elsewhere
but
there
are
some
who
consider
it
an
impossible
task
to
integrate
the
various
definitions
of
fairness
adopted
by
society
and
computer
scientists
and
still
retain
a
functional
program
in
many
ways
we
re
seeing
a
response
to
the
naive
optimism
of
the
earlier
days
barocas
says
just
two
or
three
years
ago
you
had
articles
credulously
claiming
isn
t
this
great
these
things
are
going
to
eliminate
bias
from
hiring
decisions
and
everything
else
meanwhile
computer
scientists
face
an
unfamiliar
challenge
their
work
necessarily
looks
to
the
future
but
in
embracing
machines
that

text
introduction
every
year
federal
state
and
local
governments
invest
more
than
billion
to
provide
housing
for
people
who
cannot
otherwise
afford
shelter
n
in
addition
to
this
housing
assistance
policymakers
also
make
a
variety
of
choices
that
impact
the
landscape
of
affordable
housing
including
in
zoning
infrastructure
housing
finance
more
broadly
and
in
a
myriad
of
other
policy
domains
n
these
policies
can
make
a
profound
difference
for
the
millions
of
individuals
and
families
helped
but
are
too
often
undertaken
with
only
the
vaguest
visceral
sense
of
their
consequences
beyond
the
bare
facts
of
putting
roofs
over
people
s
heads
however
affordable
housing
policy
is
beginning
to
experience
a
shift
in
perspective
to
the
extent
that
policymakers
have
collected
data
on
impact
the
focus
traditionally
has
been
primarily
on
outputs
these
measures
included
the
number
of
units
built
through
a
given
investment
the
number
of
people
served
under
a
given
program
the
number
of
construction
or
property
management
jobs
created
and
the
like
but
outputs
are
not
always
indeed
not
often
the
same
as
outcomes
the
actual
short
and
long
term
consequences
of
policy
interventions
for
those
served
by
affordable
housing
programs
and
the
communities
at
issue
n
in
recent
years
researchers
and
policymakers
have
begun
to
evaluate
the
results
of
policy
interventions
for
people
in
subsidized
housing
on
measures
such
as
income
educational
achievement
physical
and
mental
health
and
even
subjective
wellbeing
n
rather
than
merely
track
whether
people
have
housing
at
a
given
level
of
affordability
this
new
focus
understands
that
housing
is
a
platform
for
a
variety
of
life
outcomes
and
that
housing
policy
choices
can
meaningfully
impact
the
arc
of
those
outcomes
this
emphasis
on
outcome
measures
reflects
a
broader
embrace
of
the
use
of
data
for
decision
making
by
managers
and
policymakers
across
the
private
and
public
sectors
n
the
ability
to
collect
data
in
a
more
rigorous
and
systematic
way
and
the
development
of
tools
to
make
that
information
actionable
particularly
to
make
transparent
patterns
that
would
otherwise
be
opaque
is
beginning
to
change
a
range
of
decisional
processes
this
shift
can
been
seen
in
everything
from
how
professional
baseball
teams
select
players
to
how
facebook
google
and
other
companies
target
their
advertising
to
how
investors
seek
value
n
and
data
increasingly
means
big
data
an
admittedly
fuzzy
and
arguably
hackneyed
concept
that
roughly
refers
to
the
use
of
relatively
large
data
sets
often
aggregated
across
previously
disconnected
areas
mined
for
the
predictive
value
of
underlying
patterns
and
trends
n
although
much
has
been
written
about
data
driven
policymaking
the
specific
role
of
the
legal
system
in
improving
program
design
and
implementation
deserves
deeper
exploration
n
across
a
range
of
affordable
housing
examples
explored
below
n
new
data
tools
are
starting
to
sharpen
policy
but
also
creating
a
positive
feedback
loop
in
which
agencies
provide
data
to
grantees
to
shape
how
they
implement
policy
gather
more
information
about
outcomes
and
then
share
all
of
that
information
with
other
regulators
or
advocates
to
help
advance
other
legal
mandates
notably
around
enforcement
and
private
rights
of
action
the
confluence
then
between
emerging
analytic
tools
and
a
deepening
understanding
of
the
connection
between
inputs
and
outcomes
makes
affordable
housing
a
particularly
fruitful
policy
arena
in
which
to
explore
law
s
potential
to
generate
as
well
as
facilitate
the
deployment
of
data
to
improve
policy
n
new
data
analytic
tools
are
by
no
means
a
panacea
incorporating
big
data
into
affordable
housing
law
and
policy
raises
serious
concerns
that
are
well
rehearsed
in
the
literature
but
worth
reiterating
in
this
context
on
a
structural
level
data
quality
and
integrity
poses
a
basic
challenge
as
does
the
perennial
risk
that
policies
driven
by
what
can
be
measured
such
as
bricks
and
mortar
metrics
will
inherently
misdirect
resources
away
from
goals
that
are
less
quantifiable
such
as
policies
that
reflect
the
felt
experience
of
people
living
in
communities
of
concentrated
poverty
legal
scholars
have
also
raised
important
concerns
about
privacy
and
data
security
and
perhaps
most
importantly
there
is
a
genuine
risk
that
the
very
people
whose
lives
should
be
at
the
center
of
affordable
housing
policy
will
be
even
more
marginalized
than
they
currently
are
when
measurability
is
privileged
over
meaning
there
are
potential
answers
to
each
of
these
concerns
data
must
be
taken
in
context
and
with
appropriate
skepticism
data
should
be
anonymized
and
aggregated
to
the
extent
possible
and
policymakers
must
find
ways
to
be
sensitive
to
the
dignitary
harms
that
attend
quantification
but
an
alternative
that
fails
to
measure
impact
is
hardly
palatable
and
the
potential
benefits
of
enhancing
the
ability
of
policymakers
to
understand
the
consequences
of
their
actions
can
actually
advance
the
dignitary
interests
of
those
served
by
affordable
housing
policy
this
all
may
seem
somewhat
technical
and
dry
rarely
has
the
heart
fluttered
for
the
ephemeral
value
of
well
analytics
those
motivated
to
engage
in
affordable
housing
or
other
areas
of
poverty
law
and
policy
by
compassion
may
recoil
at
discussions
of
number
crunching
that
is
entirely
understandable
but
data
and
compassion
need
not
stand
in
opposition
for
policy
to
be
effective
we
need
both
the

the
emerging

looks
at
several

strong

of
this

i
want
to
break
the
authorial
fourth
wall
for
a
moment
to
address
a
question
about
our
current
context
this
article
grew
in
part
out
of
my
experience
working
in
the
u
s
department
of
housing
and
urban
development
hud
general
counsel
s
office
early
in
the
first
obama
administration
n
there
i
worked
with
the
team
that
developed
the
agency
s
affirmatively
furthering
fair
housing
affh
rules
i
was
also
exposed
to
the
agency
s
work
discussed
below
to
embrace
data
driven
decision
making
more
generally
n
since
beginning
this
article
however
the
election
of
donald
trump
has
injected
uncertainty
into
affordable
and
fair
housing
policy
especially
with
dr
ben
carson
s
appointment
as
secretary
of
housing
and
urban
development
n
to
the
extent
that
dr
carson
has
a
record
with
respect
to
hud
s
mission
it
consists
primarily
of
voicing
skepticism
about
the
ability
of
the
government
to
address
segregation
n
although
dr
carson
in
his
confirmation
hearing
seemed
more
open
to
the
work
of
the
agency
n
this
together
with
the
trump
administration
s
general
skepticism
about
regulation
might
cast
some
of
what
this
article
argues
in
doubt
although
it
is
certainly
too
early
to
know
but
it
is
not
clear
that
data
will
be
less
important
even
if
hud
moves
away
from
promoting
integration
economic
opportunity
deconcentration
of
poverty
and
other
goals
broader
than
simply
subsidizing
housing
moreover
the
longer
term
trend
will
still
favor
data
driven
decision
making
state
and
local
efforts
will
continue
and
seeds
planted
in
recent
years
may
flower
in
other
domains
i
why
might
big
data
matter
to
affordable
housing
policy
this
section
provides
a
brief
primer
on
big
data
s
potential
for
policy
improvement
it
then
turns
to
the
start
of
the
embrace
of
outcome
driven
policymaking
in
affordable
housing
big
data
and
outcome
driven
policymaking
of
course
are
not
synonymous
the
former
has
many
applications
and
the
latter
does
not
require
novel
data
tools
but
their
intersection
raises
intriguing
possibilities
a
big
data
and
policy
to
state
the
obvious
policymakers
have
long
relied
on
data
to
make
decisions
indeed
categorization
record
keeping
sorting
and
similar
bureaucratic
informational
management
tools
have
so
long
been
inherent
to
the
administrative
state
that
we
rarely
pause
to
note
the
ubiquity
of
the
phenomenon
n
in
this
sense
modern
policy
has
always
been
data
driven
n
and
a
broad
array
of
policymakers
have
embraced
the
idea
of
evidence
based
interventions
n
what
is
changing
today
is
the
availability
of
significantly
more
data
and
more
powerful
computing
capabilities
n
big
data
is
one
of
those
clich
d
terms
that
is
hard
to
pin
down
precisely
and
it
is
not
necessary
to
do
so
here
generally
though
the
term
encompasses
a
set
of
related
phenomena
n
first
big
data
refers
to
the
capacity
to
collect
and
aggregate
massive
datasets
and
similar
information
this
is
what
is
big
about
the
phenomenon
as
opposed
to
well
just
data
n
before
i
started
research
for
this
article
i
had
no
idea
what
an
exabyte
was
turns
out
to
be
one
billion
gigabytes
and
a
gigabyte
is
about
the
amount
of
data
it
takes
to
digitally
store
a
feature
length
movie
n
but
the
world
is
apparently
currently
generating
two
and
a
half
times
that
much
data
every
day
n
second
big
data
also
often
involves
the
aggregation
of
information
across
heterogeneous
sources
billions
of
twitter
posts
can
reveal
certain
information
but
twitter
posts
correlated
to
other
social
media
inputs
adds
new
insights
social
media
posts
correlated
to
seemingly
disconnected
data
about
say
where
people
live
and
their
spending
habits
may
reveal
even
deeper
patterns
third
big
data
generally
refers
to
a
set
of
analytic
tools
that
can
mine
and
activate
that
data
these
new
capabilities
are
facilitated
not
only
by
the
digital
footprints
people
increasingly
leave
as
they
navigate
the
online
world
but
also
by
the
spread
of
new
sensing
technologies
n
these
analytics
can
be
used
for
actionable
prediction
not
just
to
understand
past
trends
but
to
offer
insights
into
how
to
act
moving
forward
the
most
important
caveats
to
this
somewhat
idealized
version
of
the
promise
of
big
data
are
discussed
below
n
but
for
policymakers
it
is
this
last
function
impact
evaluation
and
prediction
that
has
the
greatest
relevance
examples
of
the
use
of
big
data
are
becoming
increasingly
common
for
example
google
famously
began
real
time
tracking
of
flu
outbreaks
in
by
linking
common
search
terms
with
flu
data
from
the
centers
for
disease
control
n
google
also
transformed
spell
checking
from
an
educated
guess
by
engineers
at
the
most
common
errors
and
their
corrections
to
a
much
more
accurate
approach
that
harnessed
a
massive
database
of
actual
errors
and
the
way
people
corrected
them
n
similar
examples
of
information
aggregation
and
new
analytic
capabilities
abound
in
the
private
sector
and
are
becoming
increasingly
central
to
managerial
planning
and
decision
making
n
policymakers
are
also
recognizing
the
value
of
these
emerging
tools
perhaps
most
controversially
defense
and
national
security
agencies
such
as
the
cia
nsa
and
department
of
defense
have
embraced
big
data
raising
significant
civil
liberties
and
privacy
concerns
n
more
prosaically
big
data
is
becoming
increasingly
important
in
fields
such
as
public
safety
n
traffic
management
n
public
health
n
fraud
prevention
n
and
many
other
areas
n
to
see
the
potential
for
affordable
housing
we
need
to
delve
into
another
emerging
trend
the
shift
from
outputs
to
outcomes
in
that
policy
arena
b
from
outputs
to
outcomes
in
affordable
housing
traditionally
affordable
housing
policymakers
have
focused
on
outputs
but
are
beginning
to
focus
on
outcomes
this
shift
has
the
potential
to
open
much
broader
horizons
to
improve
how
affordable
housing
is
developed
and
delivered
to
the
extent
that
policymakers
have
tracked
the
results
of
inputs
such
as
subsidies
or
less
direct
interventions
in
housing
they
have
long
focused
on
the
immediate
results
of
a
given
program
or
policy
for
instance
hud
has
long
monitored
and
reported
on
basic
measures
relating
to
housing
such
as
the
number
of
units
built
or
supported
construction
and
management
jobs
created
as
well
some
indicia
of
the
quality
of
the
resulting
housing
such
as
levels
of
overcrowding
n
even
as
hud
has
moved
in
recent
years
to
broaden
its
planning
and
evaluation
horizon
the
department
still
focuses
to
a
large
extent
on
metrics
that
concretely
measure
immediate
outputs
for
example
in
its
five
year
strategic
plan
for
the
period
from
to
the
department
listed
a
comprehensive
series
of
goals
related
to
housing
notable
examples
included
the
number
of
households
experiencing
worst
case
housing
needs
which
hud
defines
as
having
an
income
below
fifty
percent
of
area
median
income
ami
not
receiving
public
assistance
and
paying
more
than
half
of
income
on
rent
living
in
severely
inadequate
conditions
or
both
n
the
proportion
of
very
low
income
renters
facing
severe
rent
burdens
n
the
percentage
of
rental
units
built
in
the
preceding
four
years
that
are
affordable
to
very
low
income
renters
n
and
the
production
of
rental
units
n
these
are
very
important
core
metrics
and
the
fact
that
the
department
has
set
clear
quantifiable
goals
around
its
central
mission
is
commendable
nevertheless
these
output
measures
say
relatively
little
about
the
lives
of
the
people
in
the
housing
or
the
larger
community
impacts
of
the
housing
investments
and
other
policy
interventions
other
performance
indicators
in
the
hud
strategic
plan
do
attempt
to
measure
the
difference
federal
investments
are
making
for
recipients
beyond
these
immediate
output
indicators
for
example
under
the
heading
of
economic
prosperity
hud
now
tracks
the
p
ercentage
of
participants
enrolled
in
the
fss
family
self
sufficiency
program
who
have
increased
wages
n
that
begins
to
get
at
the
connection
between
housing
and
consequences
for
residents
linking
a
housing
facilitated
policy
intervention
to
employment
outcomes
yet
in
other
places
the
department
decries
the
lack
of
performance
measures
around
topics
such
as
health
outcomes
n
as
noted
at
the
outset
however
researchers
and
policymakers
are
starting
to
link
housing
to
longer
term
life
outcomes
more
thoroughly
for
example
raj
chetty
nathanial
hendren
and
lawrence
katz
recently
published
the
results
of
a
study
of
hud
s
moving
to
opportunity
experimental
voucher
program
under
the
experiment
hud
offered
randomly
selected
families
subsidies
to
move
from
high
to
low
poverty
neighborhoods
allowing
researchers
to
compare
relatively
similar
families
who
did
not
have
the
same
opportunity
the
researchers
found
that
children
who
moved
before
age
thirteen
had
a
thirty
one
percent
higher
average
income
were
sixteen
percent
more
likely
to
attend
college
lived
in
lower
poverty
neighborhoods
and
were
less
likely
to
be
single
parents
as
adults
than
peers
who
did
not
have
the
same
exposure
to
low
poverty
neighborhoods
n
work
in
this
vein
has
also
tracked
improvements
from
interventions
that
moved
people
to
lower
poverty
neighborhoods
not
only
in
terms
of
the
immediate
benefits
of
such
neighborhoods
such
as
family
safety
but
also
in
terms
of
individuals
longer
term
mental
health
physical
health
and
subjective
well
being
n
this
is
not
to
over
read
the
data
much
of
the
emerging
neighborhood
effects
literature
remains
contested
n
but
beginning
to
understand
the
consequences
of
the
locational
context
of
affordable
housing
can
help
sharpen
decisions
about
siting
mobility
transit
connections
and
more
a
shift
from
outputs
to
outcomes
raises
a
number
of
questions
among
which
is
an
essentially
functional
one
how
can
policymakers
realistically
operationalize
this
change
n
among
other
things
doing
so
requires
gathering
and
understanding
significant
amounts
of
information
which
is
most
likely
why
agencies
have
often
focused
on
much
simpler
metrics
such
as
the
number
of
units
built
in
a
year
given
the
rise
of
big
data
however
there
is
potential
to
operationalize
new
approaches
both
to
targeting
resources
and
to
linking
related
but
often
functionally
isolated
policy
areas
ii
big
data
in
affordable
housing
law
and
policy
with
that
background
we
can
turn
to
the
details
of
where
the
shift
toward
data
driven
decision
making
is
beginning
to
emerge
in
affordable
housing
as
well
as
examples
of
areas
where
more
sophisticated
aggregation
and
analytical
capacities
seem
to
have
particular
promise
this
section
focuses
on
siting
decisions
and
locational
choice
resident
relations
and
services
and
portfolio
management
and
property
oversight
especially
across
the
subsidized
and
unsubsidized
stock
of
affordable
housing
these
examples
are
of
necessity
addressed
below
at
a
fairly
high
level
of
generality
but
should
give
a
sense
of
some
primary
areas
of
affordable
housing
policy
and
practice
where
new
data
tools
have
particular
potential
the
part
thus
concludes
with
some
reflections
on
what
these
examples
suggest
for
the
role
of
big
data
in
improving
affordable
housing
policy
and
law
in
improving
the
availability
of
that
data
a
some
examples
of

s
potential
in
affordable

siting
decisions
mobility
and
neighborhood
effects
the
first
step
beyond
simple
outcomes
metrics
in
affordable
housing
involves
the
impact
of
neighborhood
and
regional
context
which
means
that
locational
choice
is
particularly
amenable
to
emerging
analytics
hud
s
new
policy
framework
around
affh
provides
a
modest
but
promising
attempt
to
use
data
to
address
among
other
goals
the
locational
consequences
of
housing
siting
decisions
the
policy
grows
out
of
the
federal
fair
housing
act
s
mandate
that
recipients
of
federal
housing
funding
affirmatively
further
the
purposes
of
the
act
n
in
a
recently
adopted
rule
n
hud
has
created
a
national
planning
framework
under
which
the
department
will
supply
data
to
state
and
local
governments
and
public
housing
agencies
phas
across
the
country
almost
all
local
governments
get
hud
funding
and
there
are
thousands
of
phas
with
a
range
of
uniform
data
on
integration
and
segregation
housing
needs
and
indicia
of
economic
opportunity
n
the
rule
then
requires
that
these
program
participants
engage
in
their
own
analysis
of
fair
housing
based
on
that
data
and
their
own
additional
insights
to
identify
integration
and
segregation
patterns
and
trends
based
on
race
color
religion
sex
familial
status
national
origin
and
disability
within
the
jurisdiction
and
region
racially
or
ethnically
concentrated
areas
of
poverty
within
the
jurisdiction
and
region
significant
disparities
in
access
to
opportunity
for
any
protected
class
within
the
jurisdiction
and
region
and
disproportionate
housing
needs
for
any
protected
class
within
the
jurisdiction
and
region
n
this
data
driven
exercise
is
a
significant
advance
and
has
the
potential
to
shed
light
on
a
wide
range
of
decisions
that
local
governments
and
phas
make
that
are
currently
without
a
great
deal
of
context
for
example
understanding
longitudinal
patterns
of
the
demographics
of

can
help
inform
siting
decisions
and
shape
affirmative
marketing
plans
it
can
also
help
policymakers
understand
questions
such
as
concentration
and
agglomeration
effects
n
each
jurisdiction
will
use
the
data
differently
but
the
underlying
theory
is
that
grantees
will
not
only
address
obvious
barriers
to
fair
housing
choice
but
will
also
deploy
the
planning
tool
data
to
guide
housing
siting
will
also
target
enforcement
resources
and
make
other
policy
decisions
in
light
of
the
patterns
that
the
data
reveals
one
challenge
in
this
emerging
framework
is
that
the
data
tools
that
the
agency
and
its
grantees
rely
on
are
relatively
broad
scale
in
that
they
by
necessity
must
be
available
for
every
jurisdiction
in
the
country
metrics
such
as
neighborhood
demographics
racial
and
ethnic
concentration
of
poverty
school
quality
job
proximity
transit
costs
and
environmental
health
reveal
a
great
deal
about
broad
patterns
and
context
for
housing
policy
choices
but
require
a
significant
amount
of
interpretation
to
shape
decision
making
n
here
big
data
can
produce
a
richer
understanding
of
the
link
between
inputs
and
outcomes
in
terms
of
the
consequences
of
locational
choice
new
tools
can
do
so
by
introducing
much
greater
detail
in
terms
of
specific
communities
but
also
by
helping
to
tackle
one
of
the
greatest
challenges
in
understanding
impact
the
longitudinal
effects
of
policy
interventions
the
affh
framework
can
give
an
accurate
point
in
time
picture
of
where
the
categories
protected
by
the
fair
housing
act
intersect
with
opportunity
and
housing
investments
but
it
will
take
additional
data
and
more
sophisticated
analytical
tools
to
ferret
out
how
that
context
changes
in
light
of
specific
policy
choices
ultimately
these
tools
could
not
only
target
community
level
outcomes
but
potentially
even
city
wide
and
metro
level
shifts
if
aggregated
across
localities
they
could
also
help
policymakers
focus
on
broader
outcomes
such
as
neighborhood
change
tracking
for
example
the
pace
of
gentrification
and
displacement
from
various
public
investments
this
will
not
make
the
decision
to
put
a
given
housing
development
in
site
a
versus
site
b
necessarily
easier
given
the
significant
market
and
political
constraints
on
all
affordable
housing
nor
will
it
resolve
the
debate
about
place
versus
mobility
n
nevertheless
it
can
at
least
make
the
consequences
of
individual
subsidy
decisions
and
the
larger
structure
of
subsidies
more
transparent
housing
portfolio
management
a
second
general
arena
of
affordable
housing
policy
in
which
new
data
tools
have
particular
promise
involves
market
conditions
as
well
as
the
oversight
and
management
of
housing
assets
in
these
examples
the
emphasis
is
less
on
data
sharpening
our
understanding
of
where
to
deploy
resources
in
terms
of
outcomes
and
more
on
using
technology
to
aggregate
information
to
improve
affordable
housing
practice
and
pragmatic
policy
implementation
a
subsidy
targeting
and
market
conditions
big
data
tools
can
be
useful
in
understanding
how
rent
subsidy
levels
align
with
market
conditions
as
matthew
desmond
recently
argued
better
targeting
of
subsidies
could
free
up
substantial
housing
resources
n
the
challenge
as
desmond
points
out
is
that
the
broader
the
area
for
which
rent
subsidy
levels
are
set
the
more
over
and
under
inclusive
they
are
likely
to
be
compensating
landlords
in
some
neighborhoods
above
market
while
simultaneously
preventing
mobility
to
higher
income
areas
hud
has
begun
to
shift
from
metropolitan
level
housing
choice
voucher
fair
market
rents
to
much
more
targeted
zip
code
level
measures
in
those
metropolitan
areas
that
are
facing
problems
with
voucher
holders
being
concentrated
in
high
poverty
neighborhoods
n
but
this
is
a
pilot
program
and
it
only
targets
a
subset
of
markets
in
a
single
program
by
aggregating
information
about
much
more
narrowly
targeted
market
rents
as
well
a
host
of
related
transactional
data
policymakers
could
get
a
much
more
fine
grained
window
into
market
conditions
and
thus
appropriate
subsidy
levels
across
a
range
of
programs
n
b
enforcement
and
housing
quality
new
capacities
to
aggregate
and
analyze
large
data
streams
likewise
hold
promise
to
help
policymakers
more
efficiently
and
effectively
ensure
the
quality
of
housing
and
target
interventions
to
remedy
housing
quality
issues
currently
local
governments
collect
a
great
deal
of
property
level
data
from
code
enforcement
nuisance
complaints
fire
and
police
dispatches
and
other
sources
while
states
and
the
federal
government
collect
information
about
housing
quality
through
subsidy
programs
but
rarely
is
this
information
brought
together
let
alone
used
in
a
way
to
improve
oversight
n
this
kind
of
aggregation
could
be
particularly
important
in
the
context
of
the
link
between
housing
quality
and
health
outcomes
for
example
the
evidence
linking
indoor
lead
paint
and
problems
with
childhood
development
is
overwhelmingly
clear
n
no
comprehensive
database
of
lead
in
housing
exists
although
some
state
and
local
governments
do
track
lead
paint
inspections
and
violations
n
a
big
data
approach
could
consolidate
multiple
sources
of
information
home
inspections
transactional
data
lead
law
citations
complaints
and
provide
a
much
more
comprehensive
picture
not
only
of
the
landscape
of
risk
but
also
of
more
or
less
effective
mitigation
n
there
are
many
other
examples
where
data
can
improve
policy
around
the
nexus
of
housing
and
health
outcomes
including
indoor
air
quality
vectors
of
chronic
illness
related
to
damp
cold
and
mold
and
even
injuries
n
big
data
could
also
be
used
to
track
better
and
worse
landlords
both
to
target
enforcement
resources
and
ultimately
to
influence
choices
about
which
housing
developers
or
managers
should
receive
assistance
hud
currently
manages
a
process
known
colloquially
as
the
process
to
spot
providers
who
pose
particular
financial
or
operational
risks
n
hud
recently
revamped
this
process
n
which
until
relatively
recently
involved
paper
submissions
and
individual
review
but
both
hud
and
other
housing
providers
often
have
challenges
assessing
the
risk
of
potential
grantees
let
alone
using
past
performance
to
influence
subsidy
decisions
in
conditions
of
scarcity
bringing
information
about
providers
their
management
structures
and
their
past
experience
not
only
with
specific
subsidy
programs
but
with
other
housing
ventures
could
not
only
streamline
this
kind
of
past
participation
review
but
could
also
help
policymakers
understand
the
operational
and
managerial
factors
that
distinguish
lower
risk
partners
from
higher
risk
partners
c
unifying
the
subsidized
and
unsubsidized
housing
portfolio
in
this
vein
new
data
tools
may
have
particular
promise
in
finding
practical
ways
to
bridge
the
subsidized
and
unsubsidized
portfolios
of
affordable
housing
for
understandable
reasons
affordable
housing
policy
tends
to
focus
on
the
portion
of
the
housing
stock
available
to
low
income
residents
that
is
publicly
subsidized
as
harvard
s
joint
center
for
housing
studies
has
noted
however
about
three
quarters
of
the
stock
of
affordable
housing
is
unsubsidized
n
the
portion
of
the
portfolio
that
is
not
part
of
any
direct
subsidy
program
is
often
relatively
invisible
to
policymakers
tends
not
to
be
supervised
in
any
meaningful
way
except
to
the
extent
the
portfolio
intersects
with
nuisance
claims
and
individual
code
enforcement
and
is
not
integrated
into
holistic
programs
n
with
improved
data
collection
and
analytics
it
would
be
possible
to
start
to
unify
this
shadow
n
inventory
with
the
much
more
transparent
subsidized
portfolio
in
a
variety
of
ways
from
gathering
cost
data
related
to
development
and
operations
to
including
outcomes
related
to
the
unsubsidized
portfolio
in
locational
analyses
to
offering
tools
to
assist
with
property
management
and
tenant
relations
new
aggregation
tools
could
also
be
used
to
better
connect
residents
in
the
shadow
portfolio
to
the
kinds
of
services
often
more
readily
available
to
residents
of
the
subsidized
portfolio
resident
relations
and
services
moving
finally
from
subsidy
market
conditions
and
portfolio
management
to
individual
residents
there
is
much
that
a
big
data
approach
to
affordable
housing
could
facilitate
in
terms
of
individual
residents
to
begin
data
aggregation
tools
can
be
used
to
track
demand
and
even
help
with
wait
lists
to
foster
more
functional
even
potentially
regional
markets
in
many
cities
wait
lists
for
available
subsidized
housing
can
be
months
and
in
some
high
demand
jurisdictions
even
years
long
n
given
the
mix
of
subsidies
as
well
as
the
reality
that
much
of
the
housing
that
might
serve
low
income
communities
is
not
subsidized
low
income
housing
markets
are
often
fragmented
and
challenging
to
navigate
n
jurisdictions
could
benefit
from
clearinghouses
or
unified
waiting
lists
with
new
data
tools
greatly
enhancing
the
ability
of
providers
to
match
demand
an
even
more
significant
way
to
use
new
data
aggregation
and
analytical
tools
would
be
to
build
on
the
idea
of
housing
as
a
platform
to
make
that
platform
work
better
across
social
services
housing
is
a
particularly
appropriate
locus
for
a
wide
range
of
interventions
from
educational
support
for
children
living
in
affordable
housing
to
job
training
for
adults
to
a
range
of
wrap
around
services
for
the
formerly
homeless
in
a
housing
first
approach
n
big
data
could
be
used
here
both
to
target
services
and
to
understand
the
consequences
of
those
interventions
in
terms
of
targeting
given
that
many
residents
of
affordable
housing
encounter
services
across
a
range
of
areas
providers
could
access
multiple
sources
of
information
to
understand
the
needs
of
their
clients
without
residents
having
to
aggregate
that
information
themselves
in
terms
of
impacts
understanding
the
outcomes
of
various
services
could
help
providers
over
time
focus
on
the
relative
efficacy
of
individual
supports
and
the
appropriate
mix
of
support
over
large
populations
being
served
this
kind
of
an
approach
is
not
distinctive
to
affordable
housing
and
social
service
agencies
could
use
any
other
point
of
entry
if
however
policymakers
could
match
education
records
employment
records
family
disruption
data
and
myriad
other
sources
they
could
potentially
target
assistance
with
much
greater
efficacy
b
synthesis
and
reflections
on
the
role
of
law
to
take
a
step
back
and
synthesize
the
examples
above
they
generally
point
to
several
functions
for
big
data
to
improve
affordable
housing
policy
first
new
data
tools
can
improve
policymakers
ability
to
target
resources
whether
in
terms
of
direct
subsidies
enforcement
activities
or
the
larger
policy
context
in
which
affordable
housing
exists
second
and
perhaps
most
promising
in
the
short
run
new
data
tools
can
help
policymakers
providers
and
advocates
coordinate
across
silos
vertically
technology
can
better
integrate
federal
state
and
local
operations
horizontally
data
tools
can
help
bridge
gaps
across
agencies
at
each
level
of
government
as
well
as
across
states
and
localities
at
the
sub
federal
level
where
appropriate
if
big
data
did
nothing
else
but
facilitate
this
kind
of
information
sharing
it
would
still
have
great
potential
to
improve
the
provision
of
services
respond
to
regional
housing
needs
and
link
housing
data
to
other
inputs
such
as
environmental
quality
public
safety
employment
opportunities
and
education
just
as
the
affh
approach
has
begun
to
do
finally
new
data
tools
could
add
private
information
to
the
decisional
matrix
and
to
understanding
outcomes
this
is
perhaps
most
challenging
legally
but
also
where
law
has
the
clearest
role
to
play
to
be
clear
in
the
immediate
term
policymakers
may
find
the
best
value
in
what
might
be
called
medium
data
n
rather
than
attempting
to
connect
the
dots
from
billions
of
data
points
akin
to
searches
on
google
policymakers
in
affordable
housing
may
be
able
to
utilize
new
analytic
capabilities
to
make
predictions
about
subsidies
and
related
policy
choices
by
aggregating
relatively
accessible
information
about
market
conditions
demographics
specific
properties
and
subsidies
the
longer
term
potential
to
increase
this
to
a
much
more
sophisticated
look
at
for
example
dynamics
of
neighborhood
change
and
the
relative
impacts
of
various
policy
levers
is
intriguing
but
should
not
deter
from
shorter
term
more
manageable
deployment
this
is
not
to
be
na
xef
ve
about
the
genuine
costs
and
other
practical
barriers
to
implementing
any
data
effort
that
would
truly
yield
new
insights
at
scale
n
the
most
obvious
reason
why
affordable
housing
policymakers
have
defaulted
to
simple
output
measures
to
the
extent
that
they
have
tracked
outcomes
is
that
it
is
just
simply
hard
to
do
anything
more
perhaps
if
the
value
of
tracking
and
making
predictions
about
impact
through
new
data
tools
were
clearer
the
cost
benefit
might
shift
but
given
the
choice
between
investing
in
sophisticated
analytics
or
investing
in
another
unit
of
housing
most
rational
subsidy
or
housing
providers
will
tend
to
prefer
the
immediate
impact
of
a
roof
over
the
head
of
someone
in
need
one
answer
may
come
by
looking
to
hud
s
approach
to
affh
which
shows
the
potential
role
for
federal
investment
in
data
tools
if
local
governments
public
housing
authorities
and
non
profit
housing
providers
do
not
have
the
resources
to
invest
in
analytics
and
most
do
not
then
the
federal
government
can
step
in
and
do
so
at
scale
indeed
hud
has
recently
launched
a
broad
scale
initiative
as
part
of
an
interagency
agreement
with
the
census
department
to
provide
qualified
researchers
with
access
to
certain
hud
sponsored
evaluation
datasets
n
this
agency
data
democratization
effort
is
slated
to
expand
to
a
broad
range
of
hud
administrative
and
other
information
sources
n
ideally
information
could
flow
not
only
to
researchers
but
from
researchers
to
providers
and
policymakers
n
if
affordable
housing
provides
numerous
examples
of
where
new
data
tools
can
help
shape
policy
it
is
possible
at
this
juncture
to
focus
on
how
law
can
improve
the
flow
of
that
information
currently
statutory
and
administrative
mandates
play
a
relatively
modest
role
in
either
generating
or
utilizing
the
potential
of
big
data
law
is
essentially
mostly
parasitic
to
data
efforts
if
not
directly
a
hindrance
but
there
can
be
a
dialectic
relationship
between
law
and
data
for
policy
making
legal
mandates
can
help
bring
information
to
the
surface
and
can
create
structures
to
capture
and
facilitate
the
analysis
of
that
information
that
information
can
then
be
used
to
sharpen
policy
the
new
affh
framework
for
example
reflects
an
agency
implementing
a
statutory
mandate
through
planning
tools
that
aggregate
information
across
a
variety
of
sources
that
mix
government
generated
data
with
information
collected
on
a
mandatory
basis
from
grantees
grantees
then
deploy
this
data
to
analyze
plan
and
act
the
results
of
this
nexus
can
then
be
collected
and
fed
back
to
grantees
to
identify
more
or
less
effective
policies
thus
the
legal
system
is
facilitating
the
generation
of
data
data
are
aggregated
and
deployed
to
guide
policy
decisions
and
the
process
is
then
iterated
equally
important
patterns
revealed
through
this
cycle
which
might
otherwise
be
hard
to
see
can
help
inform
how
regulators
and
advocates
advance
other
legal
mandates
including
enforcement
and
private
rights
of
action
data
and
deeper
structural
analysis
can
thus
be
used
in
tandem
with
substantive
liability
standards
to
target
issues
like
discrimination
this
could
be
the
basis
for
litigation
whether
individual
or
structural
the
home
mortgage
disclosure
act
hmda
particularly
after
amendments
in
that
made
much
more
detailed
information
about
the
demographics
of
applicants
and
borrowers
required
n
is
a
model
for
this
dynamic
under
hmda
lenders
are
required
to
provide
detailed
information
about
lending
practices
which
advocates
and
regulators
can
then
use
to
challenge
patterns
of
discrimination
n
thus
the
law
requires
private
actors
to
disclose
activity
and
that
disclosure
can
reveal
patterns
that
yield
liability
and
most
importantly
change
behavior
n
iii
big
data
s
dark
side
caveats
and
some
responses
to
this
point
it
would
be
fair
to
read
this
article
as
something
of
an
unalloyed
paean
to
big
data
s
potential
value
for
affordable
housing
but
there
are
a
number
of
reasons
to
be
cautious
in
any
exploration
of
the
phenomenon
s
potential
several
caveats
emerge
from
the
literature
on
big
data
worth
attending
to
both
from
a
structural
perspective
and
in
terms
of
the
individuals
that
are
the
inevitable
subjects
to
use
that
term
advisedly
of
any
big
data
project
to
begin
with
structural
concerns
many
commentators
have
noted
that
big
data
as
much
as
traditional
data
and
perhaps
more
so
has
the
potential
to
suffer
from
basic
challenges
with
informational
quality
n
moreover
it
is
not
just
that
the
quality
of
any
analysis
is
inherently
limited
by
the
quality
of
the
sources
and
maintaining
data
governance
can
be
a
costly
exercise
measurability
itself
can
be
a
misleading
proxy
for
policy
outcomes
that
might
be
harder
to
quantify
but
are
no
less
or
even
more
important
n
these
alternatives
might
be
concrete
but
harder
to
measure
just
as
units
produced
are
easier
to
measure
than
long
term
subjective
well
being
but
there
is
also
the
risk
that
values
that
are
not
measurable
fairness
dignity
will
be
lost
there
are
no
definitive
answers
to
these
structural
concerns
and
the
best
response
is
not
so
much
legal
but
practical
policymakers
to
the
extent
they
are
going
to
rely
on
data
especially
the
potentially
unwieldy
reams
of
information
in
a
big
data
approach
must
focus
on
continuous
improvement
and
a
feedback
loop
that
can
come
from
actually
deploying
the
data
in
practice
data
quality
and
data
management
challenges
also
auger
strongly
for
a
measure
of
skepticism
in
not
allowing
the
data
to
be
overly
determinative
in
decision
making
as
hard
as
it
is
to
resist
the
allure
of
the
concrete
shifting
to
the
people
whose
lives
and
experiences
generate
the
data
on
which
big
data
lives
and
whose
lives
will
be
influenced
by
decisions
made
based
on
that
data
the
rise
of
new
analytic
tools
raises
genuine
concerns
not
just
about
privacy
but
also
about
the
loss
of
control
of
one
s
identity
n
closely
related
to
this
is
a
concern
with
the
risk
that
datafication
will
undermine
the
dignity
and
individual
humanity
of
the
people
being
quantified
numbers
can
speak
louder
than
individual
voices
and
seemingly
implacable
data
can
obscure
the
very
real
life
experiences
this
affects
policy
as
a
structural
matter
but
it
also
affects
people
because
it
reduces
who
they
are
to
a
series
of
numbers
and
quantifiable
outcomes
graduation
rates
health
assessments
and
the
like
and
this
can
all
exacerbate
existing
power
dynamics
that
risk
minimizing
the
agency
of
people
served
by
affordable
housing
programs
these
are
important
issues
and
clearly
policymakers
must
be
sensitive
to
the
perspectives
of
those
served
and
power
dynamics
but
they
are
ultimately
manageable
in
the
affordable
housing
context
much
of
the
data
that
would
be
a
part
of
any
effort
to
sharpen
our
understanding
of
outcomes
is
amenable
to
anonymization
and
must
be
treated
on
an
aggregated
basis
and
privacy
for
residents
as
well
as
providers
must
be
central
to
how
data
is
collected
stored
and
analyzed
but
privacy
and
the
importance
of
preserving
individual
voice
should
not
be
an
insuperable
barrier
to
gaining
practical
value
from
new
data
tools
consumers
currently
make
choices
on
a
daily
basis
to
share
information
with
technology
companies
in
order
to
improve
the
collective
information
base
available
to
all
users
when
someone
accesses
google
maps
on
a
mobile
device
they
are
both
receiving
and
sending
information
about
location
and
traffic
conditions
and
the
like
n
and
it
is
reasonable
to
trade
privacy
for
the
value
of
that
information
exchange
a
similar
dynamic
can
pertain
with
affordable
housing
and
related
areas
of
policy
more
fundamentally
it
is
worth
asking
as
compared
to
what
for
those
appropriately
concerned
about
individual
voice
and
the
dignity
of
residents
it
is
not
so
clear
that
our
current
affordable
housing
system
is
serving
the
most
vulnerable
right
now
as
well
as
it
could
indeed
it
is
fair
to
argue
that
we
do
not
pay
enough
attention
to
residents
and
clients
in
the
current
structure
of
housing
policy
n
fundamental
values
can
be
advanced
by
better
tools
and
these
are
not
ultimately
incommensurate
goals
we
can
focus
on
humanity
and
dignity
in
practice
and
use
data
to
advance
that
there
is
at
least
the
potential
that
for
all
the
problems
with
quantifiability
data
can
center
housing
policy
choices
on
outcomes
that
put
residents
rather
than
buildings
or
providers
more
clearly
at
the
center
of
policy
focus
in
many
critical
areas
of
public
policy
including
providing
affordable
housing
for
the
most
vulnerable
limited
public
resources
could
be
used
much
more
effectively
data
as
an
engine
of
decision
making
and
the
individual
dignity
of
those
served
by
public
programs
can
and
no
doubt
often
do
clash
but
they
can
just
as
well
interact
data
of
course
cannot
solve
fundamental
policy
disputes
that
implicate
not
just
comparative
outcomes
but
also
relative
and
at
times
incommensurate
priorities
as
well
as
differing
political
economies
n
thus
no
amount
of
impact
assessment
will
necessarily
conclusively
resolve
the
perennial
debate
in
housing
policy
about
mobility
versus
community
investment
n
this
debate
will
always
reflect
marginal
trade
offs
in
an
environment
of
scarcity
and
also
interaction
effects
with
other
policy
interventions
and
market
forces
but
beginning
to
understand
the
trajectory
of
the
investments
we
make
in
the
name
of
affordable
housing
can
sharpen
the
focus
of
those
investments
that
might
not
be
sufficiently
ambitious
but
would
still
be
an
improvement
conclusion
this
article
has
sought
to
illuminate
the
potential
benefits
and
significant
challenges
of
deploying
new
data
aggregation
and
analytic
tools
to
advance
affordable
housing
policy
whether
informing
siting
decisions
understanding
the
regional
housing
market
consequences
of
local
zoning
policy
transforming
management
and
resident
services
or
other
areas
of
affordable
housing
and
recognizing
the
practical
barriers
to
implementation
there
is
undeniable
promise
at
a
minimum
to
make
better
decisions
in
this
arena
we
are
beginning
to
see
a
cycle
in
which
law
facilitates
the
generation
of
data
that
can
be
grouped
across
disparate
areas
to
provide
a
clearer
picture
of
the
consequences
of
public
investments
and
other
policy
choices
that
data
can
also
be
used
to
drive
other
legal
mandates
particularly
around
enforcement
as
noted
we
must
proceed
cautiously
in
embracing
these
new
tools
they
will
remain
inherently
limited
in
their
ability
to
accurately
capture
ground
level
reality
and
they
must
be
used
with
a
keen
appreciation
for
the
people
whose
lives
are
being
measured
and
whose
voice
is
too
often
ignored
but
the
alternative
of
continuing
to
muddle
through
is
even
less
palatable

liberties
union
and
presently
co
chair
of
the
american
bar
association
s
national
committee
on
homeland
security
counterterrorism
and
treatment
of
enemy
combatants
arjun
has
spent
most
of
his
career
focused
on
countering
racial
and
religious
profiling
advancing
counterterrorism
reform
and
combating
hate
motivated
violence
i
first
met
arjun
who
has
a
sikh
background
a
few
years
back
following
a
talk
i
gave
at
the
national
press
club
launching
my
book
the
thistle
and
the
drone
after
the
programme
he
came
up
to
me
and
began
discussing
his
civil
and
human
rights
work
on
behalf
of
not
only
muslim
americans
but
minorities
throughout
the
us
i
was
impressed
he
was
fighting
for
justice
within
the
system
when
i
invited
arjun
to
speak
before
my
world
of
islam
class
at
american
university
recently
he
made
some
core
points
related
to
the
rise
in
hate
related
incidents
against
muslims
since
noting
they
are
trending
at
least
five
times
higher
than
prior
to
the
attacks
he
said
we
are
living
in
an
open
season
of
prejudice
against
muslims
perpetual
war
in
iraq
and
afghanistan
has
contributed
to
prevailing
negative
attitudes
he
argued
and
the
guantanamo
bay
detention
facility
in
cuba
stands
as
a
testament
to
negative
treatment
of
muslims
suspected
of
terrorist
activities
arjun
also
spoke
of
police
tactics
that
often
serve
to
perpetuate
discrimination
he
d
how
a
team
of
associated
press
reporters
revealed
that
covert
domestic
surveillance
programs
established
in
new
york
city
following
for
example
were
explicitly
designed
to
monitor
muslim
citizens
representing
an
abandonment
of
rights
to
privacy
that
all
americans
are
entitled
to
enjoy
none
of
the
surveillance
was
based
on
reasonable
suspicion
or
probable
cause
but
instead
solely
based
on
identity
the
surveillance
did
not
result
in
a
single
conviction
arjun
pointed
to
media
representations
that
encourage
islamophobia
he
cited
a
media
matters
study
conducted
on
three
days
of
media
reporting
after
the
recent
muslim
ban
their
findings
revealed
that
of
guests
on
fox
news
cnn
and
msnbc
the
three
major
broadcast
news
networks
only
guests
were
actual
muslims
these
surveillance
programs
he
noted
have
been
complemented
by
watch
lists
there
are
three
types
of
watch
lists
administered
by
the
transportation
security
administration
a
terrorist
watch
list
of
million
individuals
suspected
of
terrorist
activities
a
selectee
list
which
requires
listed
individuals
to
undergo
enhanced
screening
measures
before
flying
and
a
no
fly
list
of
some
which
forbids
listed
individuals
from
boarding
an
airplane
the
consequences
of
these
watch
lists
are
serious
those
listed
may
be
unable
to
see
their
families
or
even
apply
for
loans
and
employment
listed
individuals
are
generally
considered
too
dangerous
to
fly
but
not
dangerous
enough
to
be
arrested
which
keeps
them
in
an
uneasy
limbo
with
broad
consequences
arjun
also
discussed
the
efficacy
of
countering
violent
extremism
cve
programs
which
are
designed
to
target
individuals
who
may
become
terrorists
these
programs
are
a
form
of
predictive
policing
he
explained
as
they
use
an
individual
s
prior
history
to
determine
threat
scores
and
geographic
analysis
of
criminal
activity
to
assess
potential
hot
spots
arjun
believes
these
programs
are
based
on
abstract
methods
and
junk
science
that
ultimately
serve
as
another
mechanism
for
surveillance
of
muslim
citizens
arjun
argued
that
the
us
government
needs
to
begin
addressing
the
structural
racism
discrimination
and
criminalisation
that
foster
hate
and
violence
against
muslims
who
remain
disproportionately
targeted
by
american
national
security
policy
arjun
also
pointed
to
media
representations
that
encourage
islamophobia
he
cited
a
media
matters
study
conducted
on
three
days
of
media

the
recent
muslim

their
findings
revealed
that
of
guests

and
msnbc
the
three

news
networks
only
guests
were
actual
muslims
viewing
the
compassion
he
brings
to
his
work
i
could
not
but
think
of
the
wisdom
of
the
founder
of
his
faith
guru
nanak
who
famously
said
those
that
have
loved
are
those
that
have
found
god
while
pakistan
has
somewhat
of
a
reputation
as
encouraging
religious
intolerance
in
fact
the
birthplace
of
guru
nanak
which
i
visited
not
long
ago
is
in
nankana
sahib
pakistan
and
i
can
report
that
it
is
spotlessly
clean
and
tended
with
special
reverence
and
affection
by
the
local
administration
here
in
america
arjun
sethi
is
championing
the
great
guru
s
message
of
humanity
by
fighting
for
the
civil
rights
of
muslims
and
of
all
americans
