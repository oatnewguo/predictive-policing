the

has
garnered
yet
another
accolade
the

being
named
as
one
of

of
by
none
other
than

magazine
in
the

the

was
praised
for
helping
the
department
get
ahead
of
the

it
joins
the
ranks
of
such
inventions
as
the

we
are

to
be
recognized
by

magazine
for
our
predictive

program
said

innovation
is
the
key
to
modern
policing
and
we
re
proud
to
be
leveraging
technology
in
a
way
that
keeps
our
community
safer
the
program
which
uses
technology
based
on
earthquake
prediction
technology
has
been
praised
by
media
outlets
and
law
enforcement
agencies
around
the
nation
for
its
innovation
including
features
in
the
new
york
times
and
on
abc
world
news
with
diane
sawyer
among
others
being
recognized
by
time
is
a
big
honor
but
what
s
more
important
is
that
since
the
program
was
implemented
the
department
has
seen
a
large
reduction
in
crimes
said
zach
friend
spokesman
and
crime
analyst
for
the
department
we
re
focused
a
lot
less
on
the
coverage
and
the
accolades
than
we
are
on
the
actual
reduction
said
friend
who
was
instrumental
in
bringing
the
program
to
santa
cruz
friend
first
read
about
the
predictive
policing
program
being
worked
on
by
santa
clara
university
s
dr
george
mohler
in
the
los
angeles
times
last
year
and
decided
to
approach
mohler
about
implementing
it
in
santa
cruz
mohler
developed
the
program
with
a
team
of
ucla
researchers
using
an
earthquake
aftershock
model
to
determine
where
future
crimes
will
occur
initially
using
data
from
the
los
angeles
police
department
it
s
similar
to
the
predictability
of
an
aftershock
after
an
earthquake
in
that
the
model
predicts
that
there
will
be
so
called
after
crimes
following
an
initial
crime
friend
and
santa
cruz
police
leaders
met
with
mohler
and
provided
him
with
crime
data
from
with
a
focus
on
property
crimes
the
department
became
the
first
in
the
nation
to
use
the
predictive
program
which
it
implemented
in
july
and
since
then
they
ve
already
seen
a
decrease
in
the
targeted
crime
types
which
includes
burglaries
and
motor
vehicle
thefts
in
january
the
police
department
will
work
with
the
researchers
to
do
a
full
analysis
of
the
program
after
the
first
six
months
of
implementation
other
police
departments
are
also
looking
into
implementing
the
program
which
lapd
has
started
testing
in
one
of
its
divisions
friend
and
lt
bernie
escalante
visited
lapd
earlier
this
week
to
speak
to
members
of
the
division
which
is
three
times
the
size
of
the
entire
santa
cruz
police
department
about
using
the
program
and
how
its
worked
in
santa
cruz
the
program
can
also
help
ease
the
pain
of
departments
dealing
with
shrinking
staffing
due
to
budget
cuts
a
matter
of
increasing
importance
given
the
nation
s
economic
troubles
technological
programs
like
this
can
help
equalize
the
gap
there

simple
as
a
crime
map
seemingly
as
far
fetched
as
esp
such
scenes
are
becoming
more
common
police
departments
from
minneapolis
to
los
angeles
are
turning
to
the
emerging
science
of
using
recent
crime
data
to
predict
where
criminals
will
strike
next
the
potentially
revolutionary
step
could
fundamentally
alter
the
nature
of
police
work
the
idea
is
that
everyone
even
criminals
are
creatures
of
habit
with
enough
information
about
past
crimes
it
s
possible
to
forecast
their
future
target
we
usually
look
at
the
last
week
and
say
this
is
what
happened
in
the
last
week
said
minneapolis
chief
tim
dolan
well
we
ve
added
to
that
saying
this
is
what
we
think
s
going
to
happen
next
week
that
kind
of
thinking
has
just
begun
in
minneapolis
but
dolan
says
it
s
already
paid
off
in
north
and
southwest
minneapolis
areas
that
led
the
city
last
year
in
reducing
overall
crime
rates
the
strategy
looks
slightly
different
everywhere
it
s
used
but
predictive
policing
relies
mainly
on
a
police
department
s
ability
to
accumulate
deep
databases
of
crime
information
that
detail
time
location
methods
and
numerous
other
bits
of
revealing
data
crunched
by
a
computer
analyst
the
numbers
reveal
patterns
that
s
the
task
facing
a
crew
of
five
such
crime
analysts
who
work
out
of
a
second
floor
office
in
city
hall
every
day
they
pore
over
recent
crime
data
slicing
it
different
ways
and
sometimes
using
software
to
crunch
it
further
if
a
pattern
emerges
they
mark
it
down
for
consideration
on
an
internal
crime
map
that
gets
passed
along
to
the
chief
for
his
weekly
meeting
with
top
inspectors
and
lieutenants
a
handful
of
police
departments
around
the
country
have
spent
tens
of
thousands
of
dollars
on
more
advanced
software
or
are
working
with
university
researchers
and
technology
companies
on
algorithms
to
help
them
spot
crime
trends
it
s
akin
to
predicting
where
an
earthquake
s
aftershocks
will
be
felt
says
a
santa
clara
university
mathematician
developing
formulas
for
such
police
work
as
for
hughes
prediction
of
where
the
minneapolis
robber
would
strike
next
it
was
made
using
free
software
distributed
by
the
national
institute
of
justice
the
software
examines
the
location
and
timing
of
each
crime
to
draw
its
conclusions
the
estimate
of
the
robber
s
next
target
turned
out
to
be
a
mile
off
but
in
the
world
of
crime
prediction
that
s
still
counted
as
a
success
the
kind
of
information
that
could
put
a
patrol
car
close
to
the
action
hughes
who
hopes
the
minneapolis
department
will
eventually
use
more
high
powered
software
for
predictive
policing
said
that
his
maps
have
accurately
predicted
the
locations
of
percent
of
the
city
s
violent
crime
i
have
a
better
batting
average
than
joe
mauer
hughes
said
stocking
pop
tarts
to
better
understand
predictive
policing
consider
the
pop
tarts
story
businesses
such
as
wal
mart
have
long
anticipated
customers
needs
based
on
weather
and
time
of
year
coastal
stores
knew
that
as
hurricanes
approached
customers
stocked
up
on
bottled
water
and
duct
tape
those
things
made
sense
but
looking
more
closely
at
customer
data
and
comparing
it
to
weather
patterns
analysts
at
wal
mart
noticed
that
customers
anticipating
a
hurricane
also
bought
more
strawberry
pop
tarts
it
s
the
sort
of
anecdote
that
the
emerging
industry
of
predictive
policing
embraces
because
it
shows
how
analyzing
data
can
turn
up
surprises
things
that
can
be
used
to
predict
future
behavior
the
promise
of
doing
the
same
thing
with
crime
has
prompted
some
large
police
departments
such
as
los
angeles
to
invest
in
partnerships
with
university
researchers
to
devise
predictive
algorithms
or
formulas
as
exotic
as
it
sounds
it
s
just
the
next
step
in
the
changing
world
of
police
work
said
william
bratton
the
celebrated
former
chief
of
police
in
los
angeles
and
new
york
city
it
s
really
the
continuation
of
the
evolution
of
policing
bratton
said
starting
in
the
s
when
police
began
using
crime
reports
to
identify
hot
spots
the
focus
has
been
on
putting
police
officers
near
high
crime
areas
putting
laptops
in
squad
cars
and
publishing
crime
maps
helped
shorten
response
time
now
police
departments
can
quickly
analyze
a
lot
of
crime
data
to
spot
crime
trends
as
they
re
occurring
so
after
two
or
three
incidents
we
can
put
a
stop
to
it
instead
of
waiting
for
or
said
bratton
who
now
works
as
an
independent
security
consultant
this
is
potentially
labor
saving
he
said
that
s
very
important
because
as
we
re
going
into
very
tough
times
with
public
financing
it
s
going
to
become
more
and
more
critical
the
hope
is
that
predictive
policing
will
help
supplant
random
patrolling
which
studies
have
shown
doesn
t
work
well
it
s
not
enough
to
send
people
out
and
expect
that
they
will
have
an
impact
on
crime
said
chuck
wexler
executive
director
of
the
police
executive
research
forum
in
washington
narrowing
the
field
minneapolis
police
estimate
that
half
of
the
city
s
most
serious
crime
takes
place
on
percent
of
its
land
area
many
of
the
worst
areas
are
under
video
surveillance
as
the
city
expands
its
use
of
closed
circuit
cameras
but
even
within
those
high
crime
areas
there
might
be
a
few
blocks
that
are
particularly
rough
on
any
given
week
said
sgt
jeff
egge
the
head
of
the
department
s
crime
analysis
unit
his
staff
of
five
analysts
make
predictions
by
printing
color
coded
maps
that
show
blocks
or
small
sectors
where
they
expect
crimes
such
as
burglary
robbery
and
aggravated
assaults
the
techniques
are
less
effective
for
episodic
crimes
such
as
homicide
which
are
more
random
the
strategy
adds
a
predictive
element
to
the
department
s
codefor
program
begun
in
to
map
the
city
s
crime
hot
spots
when
we
started
codefor
we
looked
at
where
crime
occurred
last
week
said
deputy
chief
rob
allen
what
we
ve
asked
people
to
do
is
to
focus
more
on
where
we
anticipate
crime
is
going
to
occur
next
week
we
ve
made
it
sort
of
future
oriented
rather
than
assuming
the
same
patterns
will
continue
it
s
had
its
successes
police
say
last
october
two
felons
walked
into
the
dunn
brothers
coffee
shop
in
uptown
pistol
whipped
one
of
the
two
clerks

them
up
in
a
back
room
and
took
a

of
cash
witnesses
called
police
arrived
in
time
to
catch
the
robbers
the
two
now
face
federal
charges
due
to
their
criminal
histories
fifth
precinct
inspector
ed
frizell
said
it
was
no
coincidence
that
officers
arrived
so
quickly
fifth
precinct
officers
were
looking
out
for
storefront
robberies
along
lake
street
as
part
of
the
precinct
s
predictive
analysis
the
officers
of
the
fifth
precinct
have
absolutely
made
this
thing
work
frizell
said
they
have
total
buy
in
frizell
said
he
knows
the
color
coded
maps
issued
by
the
crime
analysis
unit
are
taken
seriously
by
his
patrol
officers
because
he
sees
them
taking
notes
off
of
fresh
maps
hung
in
the
precinct
it
s
easier
than
handing
an
officer
a
stack
of
the
latest
intelligence
said
lt
jeff
rugel
who
runs
the
gang
enforcement
team
out
of
the
department
s
new
strategic
information
center
a
commander
issuing
orders
can
say
see
where
it
s
red
go
be
where
it
s
red
rugel
said
it
makes
it
very
easy
to
see
what
s
going
on
as
opposed
to
charts
and
charts
of
data
it
can
be
tough
to
gauge
the
success
of
predictive
policing
because
analysts
don
t
know
whether
added
police
presence
at
predicted
hot
spots
deters
the
predicted
crime
you
can
t
measure
things
that
don
t
happen
said
capt
amelia
huffman
commander
of
the
criminal
investigations
division
if
a
prediction
helps
police
catch
someone
doing
a
lot
of
crimes
the
effect
on
local
crime
rates
can
be
remarkable
for
example
said
huffman
if
a
prolific
burglar
is
captured
burglary
dots
on
the
weekly
crime
maps
will
melt
away
plain
common
sense
sometimes
predictive
policing
looks
a
lot
more
like
common
sense
than
science
fiction
said
egge
who
gave
the
example
of
how
his
unit
analyzed
years
of
data
on
burglaries
that
occurred
each
year
during
the
week
the
university
of
minnesota
started
classes
laptops
gps
units
ipods
and
other
expensive
items
are
often
left
in
cars
or
hallways
as
students
unpack
and
many
are
stolen
this
past
fall
crime
analysts
hughes
and
susan
mcphee
came
up
with
maps
of
the
dinkytown
area
that
highlighted
the
spots
that
historically
have
the
most
crime
during
opening
week
then
crime
prevention
specialists
warned
students
in
that
area
to
use
caution
while
officers
kept
an
eye
on
the
worst
spots
crimes
were
down
sharply
police
said
last
month
chief
dolan
spoke
at
the
grand
opening
of
a
police
intelligence
center
where
a
few
officers
can
monitor
hundreds
of
live
video
feeds
from
across
the
city
on
three
movie
screens
they
just
have
to
know
where
to
look
dolan
said
predictive
policing
has
just
begun
in
minneapolis
and
will
grow
as
the
department
becomes
more
accustomed
to
it
in
the
end
he
said
it
s
just
one
more
tool
to
put
police
where
they
should
be
the
most
efficient
thing
we
can
do
is
prevent
a
crime
dolan
said
solving
a
crime
is
all
good
once
a
crime
s
occurred
it
is
much
more
efficient
to
be
trying

parking
garage
in

california
one

was

to

the
other
was
carrying
illegal
drugs
but
the
presence
of
the
police
officers
in
the
garage
that
friday
afternoon
in
july
was
anything
but
ordinary
they
had
been
directed
to
it
by
a
computer
program
that
had
predicted
that
car
burglaries
were
especially
likely
there
that
day
the
program
is
part
of
an
unusual
experiment
by
the
santa

police
department
in
predictive

deploying
officers
in
places
where
the
computer
projects
crimes
are
likely
to
occur
in

in
july
santa
cruz
began
testing
the
prediction
method
for
property
crimes
like
car
and
home
burglaries
and
car
thefts
so
far
said
zach
friend
the
police
department
s
crime
analyst
the
program
has
helped
officers
pre
empt
several
crimes
and
has
led
to
five
arrests
the
notion
of
predictive
policing
is
attracting
increasing
attention
from
law
enforcement
agencies
around
the
united
states
as
departments
struggle
to
fight
crime
at
a
time
when
budgets
are
being
slashed
we
re
facing
a
situation
where
we
have
percent
more
calls
for
service
but
percent
less
staff
than
in
the
year
and
that
is
going
to
continue
to
be
our
reality
mr
friend
said
so
we
have
to
deploy
our
resources
in
a
more
effective
way
and
we
thought
this
model
would
help
efforts
to
systematically
anticipate
when
and
where
crimes
will
occur
are
being
tried
out
in
several
cities
the
chicago
police
department
for
example
created
a
predictive
analytics
unit
last
year
but
santa
cruz
s
method
is
more
sophisticated
than
most
based
on
models
for
predicting
aftershocks
from
earthquakes
it
generates
projections
about
which
areas
and
windows
of
time
are
at
highest
risk
for
future
crimes
by
analyzing
and
detecting
patterns
in
years
of
past
crime
data
the
projections
are
recalibrated
daily
as
new
crimes
occur
and
updated
data
is
fed
into
the
program
on
the
day
the
women
were
arrested
for
example
the
program
identified
the
approximately
one
square
block
area
where
the
parking
garage
was
as
one
of
the
highest
risk
locations
for
car
burglaries
in
contrast
compstat
and
other
crime
tracking
systems
in
use
in
many
cities
are
calibrated
less
frequently
rely
more
on
humans
to
recognize
patterns
and
allocate
resources
based
on
past
crimes
rather
than
predicted
future
offenses
the
program
used
in
santa
cruz
was
developed
by
a
group
of
researchers
including
two
mathematicians
george
mohler
and
martin
short
an
anthropologist
p
jeffrey
brantingham
and
a
criminologist
george
e
tita
in
a
project
that
used
data
provided
by
the
los
angeles
police
department
which
is
hoping
to
begin
using
the
program
later
this
year
we
re
watching
closely
what
is
going
on
in
santa
cruz
said
capt
sean
malinowski
of
the
los
angeles
department
s
foothill
patrol
division
who
worked
with
the
researchers
when
he
was
head
of
the
department
s
crime
center
under
the
police
chief
at
the
time
william
j
bratton
captain
malinowski
envisions
a
time
when
the
police
would
issue
crime
forecasts
the
same
way
the
national
weather
service
issues
storm
alerts
it
would
certainly
be
safer
for
everyone
and
more
effective
he
said
postulating
you
re
having
a
rash
of
shootings
and
the
computer
says
it
s
going
to
continue
in
these
places
and
on
these
days
of
the
week
he
added
now
if
we
have
a
problem
we
throw
a
lot
of
cops
at
it
and
unfortunately
with
the
economy
being
the
way
it
is
we
don
t
have
as
many
cops
available
the
compstat
system
captain
malinowski
said
was
a
big
advance
for
policing
but
the
use
of
computer
programs
takes
prediction
to
the
next
level
with
compstat
and
other
similar
approaches
we
look
at
these
maps
and
they
re
as
accurate
as
we
can
get
them
he
said
but
i
m
looking
at
a
map
from
last
week
and
the
whole
assumption
is
that
next
week
is
like
last
week
the
computer
eliminates
the
bias
that
people
have
for
the
santa
cruz
trial
eight
years
of
crime
data
were
fed
into
the
computer
program
which
breaks
santa
cruz
into
squares
of
approximately
feet
by
feet
or
meters
by
meters
new
data
are
added
each
day
officers
are
given
a
list
of
the
highest
probability
hot
spots
of
the
day
at
roll
call
they
check
those
areas
during
times
that
they
are
not
out
on
service
calls
before
the
program
started
they
made
such
pass
through
checks
based
on
hunches
or
experience
of
where
crimes
were
likely
to
occur
mr
friend
said
that
the
reaction
to
the
prediction
method
among
officers
had
been
quite
positive
the
feedback
i
ve
received
is
that
there
is
appreciation
that
it
has
validated
intuition
or
provided
a
new
focus
area
that
wasn
t
known
he
said
how
accurate
the
program
really
is
has
yet
to
be
demonstrated
its
success
will
be
evaluated
after
six
months
the
worst
case
scenario
is
that
it
doesn
t
work
and
we
re
no
worse
off
said
mr
friend
who
had
enlisted
mr
mohler
a
professor
at
santa
clara
university
mr
friend
said
the
early
indications
were
encouraging
burglaries
were
down
percent
in
july
compared
with
july
suggesting
that
the
carefully
directed
policing
may
have
a
deterrent
effect
he
said
in
los
angeles
captain
malinowski
said
the
police
department
hopes
to
expand
the
program
to
include
some
violent
crimes
like
gang
shootings
predicting
crime
with
computer
programs
is
in
some
ways
a
natural
outgrowth
of
the
technology
that
companies
like
wal
mart
now
use
routinely
to
predict
the
buying
habits
of
customers
said
scott
dickson
a
crime
analyst
for
the
police
department
in
killeen
texas
who
discussed
the
santa
cruz
experiment
on
his
blog
law
enforcement
agencies
mr
dickson
noted
have
great
warehouses
of
data
that
can
be
used
to
feed
predictive
programs
and
in
the
end
he
said
it
s
cheaper
to
prevent
a
crime
than
to
solve
a
crime
and
that
s
where
i
think
the
promise
lies

but
what

is
that
since

the

has
seen
a
large
reduction
in

said
zach

spokesman
and
crime

for
the

we
re
focused
a
lot
less
on
the

the
accolades

reduction
said
friend
who
was
instrumental
in
bringing
the

to
santa

friend
first
read
about
the
predictive

program
being
worked
on
by
santa

university
s
george
mohler
in
the
los

times
last
year
and
decided
to
approach
mohler
about
implementing
it
in
santa
cruz
mohler
developed
the
program
with
a
team
of
ucla
researchers
using
an
earthquake
aftershock
model
to
determine
where
future
crimes
will
occur
initially
using
data
from
the
los
angeles
police
department
it
s
similar
to
the
predictability
of
an
aftershock
after
an
earthquake
in
that
the
model
predicts
that
there
will
be
so
called
after
crimes
following
an
initial
crime
friend
and
santa
cruz
police
leaders
met
with
mohler
and
provided
him
with
crime
data
from
with
a
focus
on
property
crimes
the
department
became
the
first
in
the
nation
to
use
the
predictive
program
which
it
implemented
in
july
and
since
then
it
has
already
resulted
in
a
decrease
in
the
targeted
crime
types
which
includes
burglaries
and
motor
vehicle
thefts
in
january
the
police
department
will
work
with
the
researchers
to
do
a
full
analysis
of
the
program
after
the
first
six
months
of
implementation
other
police
departments
are
also
looking
into
implementing
the
program
which
lapd
has
started
testing
in
one
of
its
divisions
friend
and
lt
bernie
escalante
visited
lapd
earlier
this
week
to
speak
to
members
of
the
division
which
is
three
times
the
size
of
the
entire
santa
cruz
police
department
about
using
the
program
and
how
its
worked
in
santa
cruz
the
program
can
also
help
ease
the
pain
of
departments
dealing
with
shrinking
staffing
due
to
budget
cuts
a
matter
of
increasing
importance
given
the
nation

economic
troubles
technological

on

during

he

friend

friend
said
the
targeted
patrols
since

have
netted
about

but
the
emphasis
is
on
crime
prevention
the
intent
has
not
been
to

our
way
out
of
problem
it
s

friend
said
if
the
criminal
is
familiar
with
policing
patterns
and
you
re
breaking
that
pattern
through
targeted
patrol
then
they
re
less

that
friday
afternoon
in

was
anything

ordinary
they
were

to
the

by
a

that

were

likely
there
that
day
the

is

by
the
santa

in
predictive

deploying
officers
in
places
where
crimes
are
likely

occur
in

in

santa

began
testing
the
prediction

car
and
home
burglaries
and
car
thefts
so

said
zach

the
police
department
s
crime
analyst
the
program
has
helped
officers
pre
empt
several
crimes
and
has
led
to
five
arrests
the
notion
of
predictive
policing
is
attracting
increasing
attention
from
law
enforcement
agencies
around
the
country
as
departments
struggle
to
fight
crime
at
a
time
when
budgets
are
being
slashed
we
re
facing
a
situation
where
we
have
percent
more
calls
for
service
but
percent
less
staff
than
in
the
year
and
that
is
going
to
continue
to
be
our
reality
mr
friend
said
so
we
have
to
deploy
our
resources
in
a
more
effective
way
and
we
thought
this
model
would
help
efforts
to
systematically
anticipate
when
and
where
crimes
will
occur
are
being
tried
out
in
several
cities
the
chicago
police
department
for
example
created
a
predictive
analytics
unit
last
year
but
santa
cruz
s
method
is
more
sophisticated
than
most
based
on
models
for
predicting
aftershocks
from
earthquakes
it
generates
projections
about
which
areas
and
windows
of
time
are
at
highest
risk
for
future
crimes
by
analyzing
and
detecting
patterns
in
years
of
past
crime
data
the
projections
are
recalibrated
daily
as
new
crimes
occur
and
updated
data
is
fed
into
the
program
on
the
day
the
women
were
arrested
for
example
the
program
identified
the
approximately
one
square
block
area
where
the
parking
garage
is
situated
as
one
of
the
highest
risk
locations
for
car
burglaries
in

compstat

were
likely
to
occur
mr
friend
said
that
the
reaction
to
the
prediction
method
among
officers
had
been
quite
positive
the
feedback
i
ve
received
is
that
there
is
appreciation
that
it
has
validated
intuition
or
provided
a
new
focus
area
that
wasn
t
known
he
said
how
accurate
the
program
really
is
has
yet
to
be
demonstrated
its
success
will
be
evaluated
after
six
months
the
worst
case
scenario
is
that
it
doesn
t
work
and
we
re
no
worse
off
said
mr
friend
who
enlisted
dr
mohler
a
professor
at
santa
clara
university
mr
friend
said
the
early
indications
were
encouraging
burglaries
were
down
percent
in
july
compared
with
july
suggesting
that
the
targeted
policing
may
have
a
deterrent
effect
he
said
in
los
angeles
captain
malinowski
said
the
police
department
hopes
to
expand
the
program
to
include
some
violent
crimes
like
gang
shootings
predicting
crime
with
computer
programs
is
in
some
ways
a
natural
outgrowth
of
the
technology
that
companies
like
wal
mart
now
use
routinely
to
predict
the
buying
habits
of
customers
said
scott
dickson
a
crime
analyst
for
the
police
department
in
killeen
tex
who
discussed
the
santa
cruz
experiment
on
his
blog
law
enforcement
agencies
mr
dickson
noted
have
great
warehouses
of
data
that
can
be
used
to
feed
predictive
programs
and
in
the
end
he
said
it
s
cheaper
to
prevent
a
crime
than
to
solve
a
crime
and
that
s
where
i
think
the
promise
lies

said
santa

police
now
use
maps
of
reported
crime
crime
statistics
neighborhood
complaints
and
old
fashioned
officer
intuition
to
combat
crime
in
the
new
system
police
anticipate
that
officers
will
receive
instructions
in
their
roll
call
meetings
before
each
shift
to
talk
about
places
and
times
to
perform
extra
checks
friend
said
supervisors
also
might
discuss
predicted
spikes
in

mohler
a
year
old
assistant
professor
said
he
is
doing
the
work
at
no
charge
he
said
he
wants
to
build
his
repertoire
of
published
research
mohler
said
burglars
who
successfully
steal
from
a
home
or
car
often
return
there
because
they
knew
it
worked
no
one
was
at
a
home
when
it
was
broken
into
at
p
m
for
instance
and
burglars
often
use
that
knowledge
to
return
or
break
in
to
another
house
in
the
neighborhood
in
santa
cruz
mohler
has
found
that
repeat
car
and
home
burglaries
tend
to
happen
four
days
after
a
crime
in
los
angeles
and
long
beach
he
said
the
recurrence
takes
seven
to
eight
days
mohler
said
it
s
unclear
why
but
mohler
said
that
kind
of
data
could
help
police
whether
a
person
returns
four
days
later
or
six
days
later
might
not
be
intuitive

santa

has
been
using
mohler
s

only
long
enough
to
know
it
s
very
promising
in
the
first
few
weeks
officers
have
seen
a
high
correlation
between
when
and
where
the

says
a
certain
type
of
property
crime
burglary
car
break
ins

auto

will
occur
and
reports
of
that

being

it

be
months
he
adds
before
crime
fighters
in

city
will
be
able
to
determine
its
overall

but
more
important
for
now
is
what
mohler

has
to
say
to
every
school
kid
struggling
with

wondering
what
possible
use
there
could

this
number
crunching
in
a

of
curious

mohler
shows
just
where
those
minds
can
lead
us
this
all
started
for
him
at
uc

when
he
was
tinkering
with
computer

that
might
help
those
working
with

other

create

it
was
a
heady
mix
of

a
little

humor
there
then
onto
ucla
his
stop
before
santa

where
he
joined
a
team
studying
crime
patterns
in
los

mohler
started
noodling
around
with
notions
of
how
to
spot
patterns
in
seemingly
random
events
you
know
like
earthquakes
and
bingo
what
happens
when
a
sizable
earthquake
hits
an
area
aftershocks
and
it
turns
out
that
when
one
house
on
a
street
is
burglarized
it
s
not
unusual
for
nearby
houses
or
even
the
same
house
to
be
hit
later
it
seems
burglars
like
most
of
us
hate
long
commutes
they
prefer
to
strike
near
home
which
is
one
reason
for
follow
on

in

mohler
says
you
can
see
it
he
says
of
the

data
he
s
crunched

property

mohler
began
searching
for
studies
covering
earthquake
prediction
models
which
have
been
around
for
years
google
is
an
invaluable
tool
love
those

he
read

pondered
and
sought

from

he
determined
that

could
be
tweaked
