los

is
now
one
of
the
safest
big
cities
in
the
nation
once
derided
as
the
nation
s
capital
of
gang
violence
and
imagined
as
a
violent
metropolis
of
drive
by
shootings
and
rampant
crime
l
a
has
managed
a
dramatic
turnaround
according
to
statistics
compiled
by
the
los
angeles
police
department
overall
crime
is
down
but
even
more
exciting
is
the
big
drop
in
the
city
s
murder
rate
in
los
angeles
reported
the
lowest
number
of
homicides
since
when
the
city
had
percent
fewer
people
there
were
murders
last
year
way
down
from
a
peak
of
killings
in
l
a
is
certainly
not
alone
crime
rates
have
significantly
dropped
in
other
major
cities
such
san
diego
chicago
and
detroit
nobody
can
say
for
sure
why
crime
is
on
the
decline
but
modern
policing
strategies
technological
advances
like
dna
analysis
and
tougher
sentencing
laws
have
likely
played
a
role
and
in
los
angeles
it
s
very
likely
that
the
remaking
of
the
lapd
through
reform
and
increased
police
hiring
have
played
a
role
in
the
decline
in
crime
the
lapd
is
a
larger
more
efficient
modern
and
community
minded
police
agency
than
it
was
in
the
s
that
s
why
there
is
so
much
at
stake
as
los

and
california
struggle
with
a
budget
crisis
that
will
further
squeeze
public
safety

this

how

it
also

that
this

if
you
read

you
see
that

down

he

it

the

retracted
its

and

study

showed
that

increased
after
medical

dispensaries
closed
and
suggested
that

may

the

raised

it
looked
at

reports
for
the
days
before
and
after
hundreds
of
dispensaries
were
ordered
closed
by
the
city
of
los

that
seemed
a
small
window
of
time
to
determine
a

trend
in

the

assumed
all
dispensaries
actually
closed
when

to
and
many
didn

the

attorney

office
which
has
been

complained
the

rand
heard
those

rand
is

redoing

the
report
lives
on

on

dozens
of
stories
detail
the

reducing

why
does
the

the
report
didn

the

no

concludes
it
s
surprising
that
a

group
would
allow
the
release
of
a
study
that
seemed
so
flawed
but
then
nothing
involving

should
surprise
us
anymore
california

our

even
as
the

celebrating
the
superior

s

to
uphold
its

rules
a
recent
appellate
court
decision
has
thrown
into
question
whether
cities
can
even
permit
dispensaries
because
marijuana
is
illegal
under
federal
law
the
result
usher
said
is
that
many
cities
may
end
up
just
banning
dispensaries
until
the
courts
figure
out
how
to
reconcile
california

allow

prohibition
on

the

gang
activity

beck
said
summer
night
lights
which
villaraigosa
called
an
unmitigated
success
expanded
to
parks
this
year
including
sun
valley
and
lanark
parks
it
s
not
just
putting
police
officers
on
the
street
villaraigosa
said
it
s
changing
the
culture
compared
to
when
villaraigosa
took
office
violent
crime
is
down
percent
with
murders
down
percent
while
statistics
are
the
numbers
that
represent
our
progress
villaraigosa
said
the
true
results
are
in
the
number
of
lives
saved
the
families
that

never
experience

los

saw
its
lowest
level
of
homicides
in
more
than
years
in
but
law
enforcement
and
community
leaders
can
t
seem
to
agree
on
why
violent
crime
has
fallen
on
tuesday
los
angeles
mayor
antonio
villaraigosa
and
los
angeles
police
department
chief
charlie
beck
announced
that
the
city
of
los
angeles
finished
with
murders
quite
a
drop
from
the
s
when
annual
homicides
regularly
topped
today
i
am
proud
to
announce
that
last
year
in
los
angeles
had
fewer
murders
than
at
any
point
since
mayor
villaraigosa
said
at
a
downtown
press
conference
tuesday
even
during
tough
economic
times
we
have
kept
our
sights
on
a
more
hopeful
promising
and
safer
future
and
the
statistics
once
again
shed
light
on
a
much
brighter
outcome
for
our
city
the
homicide
rate
per
people
was
the
lowest
since
when
los
angeles
had
a
per
capita
rate
of
police
unions
urban
policy
analysts
and
the
aclu
all
released
statements
praising
the
lapd
s
efforts
at
building
bridges
with
the
communities
it
serves
the
lapd
took
three
major
steps
that
turned
what
arguably
was
once
the
nation
s
poster
police
agency
for
racism
abuse
violence
and
brutality
into
a
model
of
professionalism
efficiency
and
community
sensitivity
says
earl
ofari
hutchinson
president
los
angeles
urban
policy
roundtable
mr
hutchinson
says
the
lapd
markedly
reduced
the
number
of
officer
shootings
and
the
use
of
force
through
training
and
diligent
discipline
the
lapd
made
a
concerted
effort
to
improve
relations
with
the
african
american
community
through
meetings
town
halls
increased
use
of
foot
and
bike
patrols
and
visible
accessibility
and
access
of
police
officials
interacting
with
black
leaders
he
says
the
announcement
comes
as
cities
including
chicago
detroit
and
san
diego
claim
significant
progress
against
crime
for
instance
chicago
police
superintendent
jody
weis
monday
said
the
city
had
homicides
its
lowest
number
since
generally
speaking
improvements
in
technology
video
dna
testing
and
cell
phones
have
made
solving
homicides
far
easier
resulting
in
fewer
cold
cases
says
lisa
smith
a
professor
of
criminal
law
at
brooklyn
law
school
but
she
and
other
analysts
are
wary
of
heaping
too
much
praise
on
police
departments
for
driving
crime
rates
down
it
is
instructive
to
look
at
the
individual
precincts
and
compare
their
year
to
year
homicides
says
ms
smith
how
many
of
those
homicides
involve
strangers
and
how
many
are
interpersonal
disputes
how
many
homicides
are
solved
versus
unsolved
more
analysis
is
needed
to
draw
proper
conclusions
she
says
indeed
further
study
could
suggest
that
other
national
and
local
trends
might
have
had
as
much
affect
on
the
homicide
rate
as
police
efforts
for
one
the
national
economy
could
be
a
factor
a
slow
economy
usually
means
less
people
out
and

getting
into
confrontations

alert
at
the
jane
addams
college
of
social
work
at
the
university
of
illinois
in
chicago
the
police
departments
always
try
to
take
credit
for
drops
in
crime
but
its
not
clear
to
me
or
most
criminologists
what
exactly
causes
the
stats
to
fluctuate
adds
lance
hannon
a
sociologist
at
villanova
university
in
pennsylvania
sometimes
you
find
out
that
the
crime
rate
was
going
down
long
before
the
police
did
anything
different
and
was
also
going
down
in
other
cities
as
well
the
numbers
also
befuddle
some
observers
chicago
has
been
struggling
against
the
perception
that
violence
has
been
spiraling
out
of
control
i
am
dubious
of
these
claims
that
crime
is
dropping
says
mary
powers

of
the

coalition
on

accountability
she
notes
that
the

comes
just
as
a
new
chicago
mayor
s
race
approaches
it
s
very
hard
to
sort
out
if
crime
is
really
dropping
or
if
politicians
are

the

there

such
a

los

one

safest
big
cities
in

once

violence
and
imagined
as
a
violent
metropolis
of
drive
by
shootings
and
rampant
crime
l
a
has
managed
a
dramatic
turnaround
according
to
statistics
compiled
by
the
los

police
department
overall
crime
is
down
but
even
more
exciting
is
the
big
drop
in
the
city
s
murder
rate
in
los

reported
the
lowest
number
of
homicides
since
when
the
city
had
percent
fewer
people
there
were
murders
last
year
way
down
from
a
peak
of
killings
in
l
a
is
certainly
not
alone
crime
rates
have
significantly
dropped
in
other
major
cities
such
san
diego
chicago
and
detroit
nobody
can
say
for
sure
why
crime
is
on
the
decline
but
modern
policing
strategies
technological
advances
like
dna
analysis
and
tougher
sentencing
laws
have
likely
played
a
role
and
in
los
angeles
it
s
very
likely
that
the
remaking
of
the
lapd
through
reform
and
increased
police
hiring
have
played
a
role
in
the
decline
in
crime
the
lapd
is
a
larger
more
efficient
modern
and
community
minded
police
agency
than
it
was
in
the
s
that
s
why
there
is
so
much
at
stake
as
los

and
california
struggle
with
a
budget
crisis
that
will
further
squeeze
public
safety
dollars
and
force
the
public
to
make
hard
choices
about
where
to
put
the
diminishing
resources
in
los
angeles
that
choice
will
come
soon
in
the
coming
months
there
will
be
a
legitimate
debate
between
the
city
council
and
mayor
antonio
villaraigosa
over
whether
it
makes
sense
to
keep
hiring
cops
while
using
police
officers
to
fill
vacant
civilian
lapd
jobs
and
if
the
march
ballot
measure
that
gives
libraries
more
funding
passes
it
could
force
action
right
away
but
one
thing
should
not
be
up
for

public

what
good
is

trash
pickup
or
monday
library
hours
when

are
afraid
to

this
will
be
an
even
more
important
question
in
the
coming
year
as
more
criminals
are
put
back
on
the
streets
strict
sentencing
laws
have
put
more
and
more
criminals
in
jail
for
longer
periods
yet
the
state
is
under
court
order
to
reduce
prison
overcrowding
and
that
could
result
in

mass
inmate

by

such
as

and
continued
in

jean

acquired
the
sobriquet
age
of
enlightenment
or
age
of

simply
put
the
movement
sought
to
exalt
the
power

philosophy
and
science
over
the
kinds
of
traditional
dogmatic
and
superstitious
beliefs
that
dominated
the
middle
ages
thereby
advancing
knowledge
and
both
reforming
and
transforming

the

an

of
incredible
intellectual

spiritual
growth
the

of

by
contrast
may
one

be
dubbed
the

of
incompetence
as
a
modestly
sentient
being
i
find
it
hard
not
to
notice
that
we
are
surrounded
by
supposed
experts
who
it
seems
cannot
master
even
the
most
rudimentary
premises
of
their
nominal
area
of
expertise
perhaps
worse
we
have
grown
accepting
when
faced
with
bungled
performance
we
simply
shrug
our
shoulders
and
say
oh
well
one
need
not
look
too
terribly
hard
to
find
examples
the
herald
recently
in
a
single
edition
reported
on
two
the
first
involved
a
study
performed
for
california
american
water
by
rbf
consulting
of
the
projected
cost
of
a
proposed
moss
landing
deep
water
desalination
project
as
well
as
the
cost
of
other
potential
alternatives
rbf
pegged
the
proposed
cost
of
that
one
project
at
million
the
most
expensive
of
the
studied
possibilities
but
rbf
made
a
tiny
mistake
that
fortunately
was
discovered
by
a
monterey
peninsula
water
management
district
engineer
it
seems
that
rbf
s
projected
cost
was
off
by
a
scant
million
how
does
an
expert
make
such
an
error
one
that
overstates
the
projected
cost
by
a
whopping
percent
and
then
there
was
the
definitive
study
by
the
rand
corporation
a
prestigious
think
tank
of
the
effect
on
crime
when
los
angeles
shuttered
pot
dispensaries
based
on
its
analysis
of
crime
data
rand
s
investigation
concluded
that
crime
increased
within
three
blocks
of
those
closed
dispensaries
in
the
days
following
their
closure
and
that
crime
decreased
the
farther
one
went
from
those
clinics
it
turns
out
that
the
crime
data
analyzed
did
not
include
any
from
the
los
angeles
police
department
performing
an
analysis
of
los
angeles
crime
data
without
data
from
the
lapd
is
akin
to
reporting
on
the
weather
without
a
thermometer
when
questions
were
raised
by
others
rand
had
the
decency
to
investigate
its
own
report
and
then
remove
it
from
its
website
reminds
one
of
gilda
radner
s
emily
litella
character
on
saturday
night
live
never
mind
had
rbf
s
error
not
been
discovered
by
someone
else
we
would
have
made
choices
on
how
best
to
solve
our
water
shortage
by
relying
on
grossly
inaccurate
cost
estimates
if
not
debunked
the
rand
study
could
have
had
profound
effects
on
our
policy
decisions
about
pot
dispensaries
yet
nobody
seems
to
be
particularly
bothered
by
either
error
there
was
no
outcry
nor
even
the
voicing
of
muted
criticism
do
we
simply
not
care
or
have
we
grown
used
to
and
are
accepting
of

low

a
new
study
casts
doubt
on
many
law
enforcement
agencies
assertion
that
medical
marijuana
dispensaries
contribute
to
local
street
crime
in
fact
minor
crime
rises
markedly
in
surrounding
neighborhoods
when
dispensaries
close
at
least
over
the
short
term
according
to
a
study
released
tuesday
by
the
nonpartisan
rand
corp
overall
crime
increased
almost
percent
in
the
blocks
surrounding
closed
clinics
in
the
days
following
their
closing
the
study
said
researchers
studied
crime
before
and
after
a
large
number
of
dispensaries
were
shut
in
los
angeles
and
found
that
incidents
such
as
break
ins
rose
near
the
closed
dispensaries
when
compared
to
neighborhoods
where
dispensaries
remained
open
the
study
suggested
several
theories
for
what
might
drive
these
results
including
the
loss
of
on
site
security
and
surveillance
a
reduction
in
foot
traffic
a
resurgence
in
outdoor
drug
activity
and
a
change
in
police
efforts
steph
sherer
executive
director
of
oakland
based
americans
for
safe
access
a
medical
marijuana
advocacy
group
said
her
organization
has
reached
the
same
conclusions
but
law
enforcement
has
largely
ignored
or
refuted
these
findings
as
various
cities
have
closed
dispensaries
put
a
moratorium
on
new
ones
or
banned
them
altogether
dispensary
regulations
bring
greater
oversight
and
less
crime
to
local
communities
she
said
the
california
police
chiefs
association
in
issued
a
white
paper
on
marijuana
dispensaries
that
provided
anecdotal
evidence
to
back
its
claim
that
they
attract
or
cause
numerous
ancillary
social
problems
as
byproducts
of
their
operation
the
most
glaring
of
which
are
other
criminal
acts
the
association
declined
to
comment

on
the
rand
study
the

not

los

police
department
spokesman
cmdr
andrew
smith
hadn
t
seen
the
study
so
wasn
t
able
to
discuss
it
in
detail
saying
we
do
know
that
there
have
been
many
reported
crimes
at
these
medical
marijuana
facilities
including
burglaries
robberies
and
even
murder
but
we
haven
t
seen
their
analysis
of
the
crimes
around
them
so
we
can
t
comment
the
rand
researchers
looked
at
crime
data
for
days
before
and
days
after
the
june
closures
of
dispensaries
in
los
angeles
researchers
combined
the
data
with
information
from
the
los
angeles
city
attorney
s
office
on
the
exact
locations
of
dispensaries
that
were
either
subject
to
closure
or
allowed
to
remain
open
they
analyzed
crime
reports
within
and
miles
of
dispensaries
that
closed
and
compared
the
results
to
crime
in
neighborhoods
where
dispensaries
remained
open
in
all
they
looked
at
days
of
crime
reports
for
dispensaries
that
remained
open
and
that
closed
the
san
jose
city
council
last
week
decided
to
allow
only
dispensaries
ending
nearly
two
years
of
debate
as
nearly
dozen
dispensaries
spread
across
the
city
what
we
ve
experienced
here
in
a
lot
of
our
dispensaries
is
not
an
increase
or
decrease
in
or
around
the
area
where
the
dispensary
is
it
s
the
actual
dispensary
that
s
being
victimized
including
armed
takeovers
san

police
spokesman
sgt
jason
dwyer
said
tuesday
although
this
is
an
interesting
report
from
a
credible
source
he
said
i
think
the
key
is
that
further
research
is
necessary

are
the
types
of
things
you
need

innovation

the
key
to

and
we

proud
to
be

in
a

that

safer
the

technology
has
been
praised
by

times
and
on

world
news
with
diane
sawyer
among
others
being
recognized
by
time
is
a
big
honor
but
what
s
more
important
is
that
since
the
program
was
implemented
the
department
has
seen
a
large
reduction
in
crimes
said
zach
friend
spokesman
and
crime
analyst
for
the
department
we
re
focused
a
lot
less
on
the
coverage
and
the
accolades
than
we
are
on
the
actual
reduction
said
friend
who
was
instrumental
in
bringing
the
program
to
santa
cruz
friend
first
read
about
the
predictive
policing
program
being
worked
on
by
santa
clara
university
s
dr
george
mohler
in
the
los
angeles
times
last
year
and
decided
to
approach
mohler
about
implementing
it
in
santa
cruz
mohler
developed
the
program
with
a
team
of
ucla
researchers
using
an
earthquake
aftershock
model
to
determine
where
future
crimes
will
occur
initially
using
data
from
the
los
angeles
police
department
it
s
similar
to
the
predictability
of
an
aftershock
after
an
earthquake
in
that
the
model
predicts
that
there
will
be
so
called
after
crimes
following
an
initial
crime
friend
and
santa
cruz
police
leaders
met
with
mohler
and
provided
him
with
crime
data
from
with
a
focus
on
property
crimes
the
department
became
the
first
in
the
nation
to
use
the
predictive
program
which
it
implemented
in
july
and
since
then
they
ve
already
seen
a
decrease
in
the
targeted
crime
types
which
includes
burglaries
and
motor
vehicle
thefts
in
january
the
police
department
will
work
with
the
researchers
to
do
a
full
analysis
of
the
program
after
the
first
six
months
of
implementation
other
police
departments
are
also
looking
into
implementing
the
program
which
lapd
has
started
testing
in
one
of
its
divisions
friend
and
lt
bernie
escalante
visited
lapd
earlier
this
week
to
speak
to
members
of
the
division
which
is
three
times
the
size
of
the
entire
santa
cruz
police
department
about
using
the
program
and
how
its
worked
in
santa
cruz
the
program
can
also
help
ease
the
pain
of
departments
dealing
with
shrinking
staffing
due
to
budget
cuts
a
matter
of
increasing
importance
given
the
nation
s
economic
troubles
technological
programs

this

equalize

if

discussing
his
talents
i
have
no
doubts
about
my
professional
ability
he
said
still
he
sounded
surprised
and
genuinely
vulnerable
when
he
discussed
how
he
feels
when
real
women
outside
of
his
pages
actually
like
him
i
grew
up
without
women
and
i
wanted
them
and
when
women
finally
became
available
i
was
absolutely
flabbergasted
he
said
his
recent
memoir
ended
with
twice
divorced
ellroy
finally
settling
into
a
happy
relationship
although
we
had
a
fight
last
night
we
are
still
very
happy
he
said
i
m
a
happy
man
personally
professionally
life
is
good
and
he
said
that
there
s
something
ultimately
positive
and
life
affirming
about
city
of
demons
despite
its
wildly
seamy
storylines
i
think
to
get
to
the
light
you
have
to
go
through
the
dark
he
said
local
law
enforcement
agencies
will
be
participating
tuesday
in
national
night
out
an
outreach
program
designed
to
get
residents
involved
in

programs
the
los

county
sheriff

department
and

departments
in
los

burbank
and
glendale
are
among
the
agencies
that
will
be
hosting
potlucks
open
houses
block
parties
and
community
outreach
because
national

out
draws
people
out
of
their
homes
and
into
their
neighborhoods
you
get
to
know
who
your
neighbors
are
which
is
good
for
anything
like
situations
involving
crime
and
disaster
said
glendale
sgt

when

a

community

is
even
more
important
during

officials
say
because

relies
on

be
their

the
idea
is

weeks
of

says

instead
the

held
a

friday
for
the

from

remains
in

the

has
resonated
loudly
shaking
a
dodgers
franchise
that
is
one

beating
other
than

game
between

it
s
troubling
to
see
people
become
targets
for
violence
for
wearing
the

jersey
of

the

brought
increasing

rates
and
declining

values
law
enforcement
pushed
to
get
its
arms
around
the
issue
quickly
establishing
gang
suppression
teams
solely
for
the
high
desert
region
in
the
district

s
office
established
a

unit
to
focus
solely
on
the
escalating
gang
problem
in
the
county
britt
imes
a
supervising
deputy
district
attorney
in
the
gang
prosecution
unit
said
prosecutions
of
gang
members
have
remained
fairly
consistent
since
hitting
a
peak
in
due
to
three
large
scale
gang
investigations
one
involving
the
vagos
outlaw
motorcycle
gang
he
said
the
ebb
and
flow
of
gang
members
in
the
high
desert
can
mainly
be
attributed
to
territory
and
market
when
one
gang
leaves
another
moves
in
to
establish
a
corner
of
the
drug
market
in
that
area
it
s
a
steady
existence
whether
they
re
gang
members
from
ontario
norwalk
compton
or
the
san
fernando
valley
we
run
into
them
on
a
fairly
regular
basis
and
prosecute
them
on
a
regular
basis
imes
said
if
one
gang
disappears
another
shows
up
to
take
its
place
for
example
when
prosecutors
began
cracking
down
on
one
pomona
based
gang
who
set
up
shop
in
the
high
desert
the
heat
became
too
intense
for
the
gang
their
activity
cooled
and
they
eventually
moved
on
or
wound
up
in
prison
imes
said
then
another
gang
moved
in
to
take
their
place
usually
the
next
generation
thinks
they
re
smarter
than
the
first
they
see
it
as
open
territory
where
they
can
make
money
and
do
business
those
two
aspects
probably
contribute
a
lot
to
how
the
high
desert
area
is
viewed
by
gang
members
said
imes
when
