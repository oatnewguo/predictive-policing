L.A. crime rate continues to fall

The city of Los Angeles is on track to have its lowest crime rate since the
early1950s, but the number of officers who opened fire on suspects is up
significantly from last year.

In a news conference Thursday, Police Chief Charlie Beck said the number of
violent crimes   homicides, robberies, aggravated assaults and rapes   from
January through August fell 11 percent compared with the same period in 2012.

The drop was even steeper compared with 2011   18 percent.

Gang-related crimes also plunged 18 percent.

If we continue on this trajectory, we will end this year with under 100,000 Part
I crimes in Los Angeles,  Beck said, referring to the types of violent crimes
and property crimes measured by the FBI.

That would be the first time for this to happen since the early 1950s,  he
added.  It would be an amazing accomplishment if it holds true.

The number of officer-involved shootings, however, rose 45 percent, from22 to
32, compared to last year.

It s always a concern but officer-involved shootings are very difficult to
predict,  said LAPD spokesman, Lt. Andrew Neiman, adding that drawing a gun is
sometimes necessary  when officers are confronted with deadly situations.

How burglars targeted holidaying Los Angeles Times subscribers

BYLINE: Roy Greensladeguardian.co.uk

LENGTH: 328 words

ABSTRACT

They used lists of readers who had asked for deliveries to be suspended

FULL TEXT

Three men have been arrested on suspicion of breaking into scores of homes of
Los Angeles Times newspaper subscribers while they were on vacation.

Police said one of the suspects had obtained lists of subscribers who had asked
a vendor to suspend deliveries while they were away.

According to the Los Angeles county sheriff's department, they have identified
25 victims but believe there are more than 100. The three burglars allegedly
stole $1m in property over the last three years.

About $100,000 worth of personal property, including artwork, golf clubs and
guitars, has been recovered as a result of a six-month investigation. But
detectives believe the thieves stole many more items including jewellery and
collectible coins that they later fenced.

"They took everything from televisions right down to the toothpaste," said
Sergeant Michael Maher of the sheriff's office.

Officials have named Duane Van Tuinen as the person who is believed to have
supplied the burglary crew with addresses from stolen vacation lists. He
serviced machines in the newspaper vendors' distribution centres.

Nancy Sullivan, an LA Times spokeswoman, said the newspaper has made changes in
its delivery policies since the incident.

She said: "The Times sympathises with those who have been harmed and joins the
other victims in thanking the sheriff's department for their hard work."

Police said the thieves would case the home of the subscribers who had submitted
"vacation holds" to make sure the owners were away before striking.

A break in the case came last summer when police pulled over one of the suspects
who had a list of addresses as well as stolen property. Detectives spent weeks
studying the list and eventually realised the addresses belonged to Times
subscribers.

They first thought the list was obtained through computer hacking but eventually
determined it was an inside job.

Former police officer a suspect in shooting of couple, officers;
Los Angeles police say suspect in overnight Riverside cop killing is former LA
officer

LOS ANGELES (AP) - A former Los Angeles police officer sought for two weekend
killings - and who threatened to kill police - is a suspect in an overnight
shooting in nearby Riverside that killed one officer and critically wounded
another, police said Thursday.

The shooting happened early Thursday morning in the Los Angeles suburb of
Corona. The wounded officer is in surgery. A third officer suffered a graze
wound.

Two Newton station officers on security duty in the same area were also involved
in a shooting overnight, but they weren't hurt, police said.

Former Los Angeles police officer Christopher Jordan Dorner is the suspect who's
wanted in the killings of Monica Quan and her fiancé, Keith Lawrence, who were
found shot to death in their car at a parking structure Sunday night, Irvine
police Chief David L. Maggard said at a news conference Wednesday night.

Dorner, 33, implicated himself in the killings with a multi-page "manifesto"
that he wrote that included threats against several people, including members of
the LAPD, police said.

Autopsies showed that Quan and Lawrence were killed by multiple gunshot wounds
in the parking structure at their condominium in Irvine, Orange County sheriff's
spokesman Jim Amormino said earlier Wednesday.

Police do not know Dorner's whereabouts, and authorities were seeking the
public's help in finding him.

"We have strong cause to believe Dorner is armed and dangerous," Maggard said.

Mickey Cohen: The Life and Crimes of L.A.'s Notorious Mobster

BYLINE: Stephen L. Hupp

SECTION: REVIEWS; Audio; Pg. 62 Vol. 138 No. 3

LENGTH: 239 words


Tereba presents a fascinating account of the interconnection among organized
crime, politics, and Hollywood. Mickey Cohen (1913-76), a rough kid who
unsuccessfully tried his hand at boxing, later became involved in organized
crime and rose through the ranks in the Cleveland, New York, and Los Angeles
mobs. When Benjamin "Bugsy" Siegel was murdered in 1947, Cohen stepped in and
took control of most of the criminal activity in L.A. The colorful Cohen enjoyed
fancy clothes, publicity, gambling, and rubbing shoulders with movie stars and
producers, the police, and politicians. However, he was hampered by infighting
among mobsters and constantly hounded by federal investigations that resulted in
his being jailed twice for tax evasion. Another inmate attacked Cohen during his
second prison stay, leaving him permanently disabled. This fascinating audiobook
provides an excellent overview of racketeering and how it shaped L.A. during the
middle of the 20th century. Narrator Kate Reading does an excellent job of
presenting the story.

VERDICT This work is recommended to anyone interested in true crime. ["For
readers who revel in old movies, stories about gangsters in double-breasted
suits, and midcentury Los Angeles," read the review of the ECW hc, LJ 5/1/12.
Sean Penn's new film Gangster Squad about the life of Cohen should attract
attention to this title as well.--Ed.]--Stephen L. Hupp, West Virginia Univ.

LOS ANGELES (AP) - Police say a paparazzo was hit by a car and killed after
taking photos of Justin Bieber's Ferrari sports car in Los Angeles.

Los Angeles police Officer James Stoughton says the man died at a hospital
Tuesday evening. Stoughton says Bieber was not in the car at the time.

Sgt. Rudy Lopez told the Los Angeles Times (http://lat.ms/ZTtuCt ) that the pop
star's friend was driving the car when it was pulled over for a traffic stop. It
was parked on a busy street when the photographer arrived.

Police say the man was struck by a car as he returned to his own car.

Stoughton says no charges are expected against the motorist who hit the man.

A call to a Bieber publicist was not immediately returned.

Gunman kills one and injures others at LAX airport in Los Angeles

BYLINE: Rory Carrolltheguardian.com

LENGTH: 705 words

ABSTRACT

Man reported to be in custody after exchange of fire with armed officers and
wounding of at least one TSA employee

FULL TEXT

A gunman opened fire with a high-powered rifle inside Los Angeles international
airporton Friday, killing a security agent, injuring at least seven people and
causing disruption to flights across the United States.

A man named as Paul Anthony Ciancia, said to be in his early 20s, used an
assault rifle to cause chaos in Terminal 3 before being shot and captured by
airport police.

The victim who died was an employee with the Transportation Security
Administration (TSA), which administers security checkpoints at US airports. The
TSA said a number of its agents were injured. At least one was in critical
condition.

Ciancia's condition was not immediately known but he reportedly had multiple
gunshot wounds. The Los Angeles fire department said seven people were hurt, of
whom six were taken to local hospitals. The Ronald Reagan UCLA Medical Center
said it received three male casualties, one of whom was in a critical condition.

Patrick Gannon, the airport police chief, told a news conference that the gunman
entered Terminal 3, home to airlines including Virgin America, Virgin Atlantic
and JetBlue, at 9.20am local time. He took an assault rifle out of a bag and
began shooting at the screening area, where security agents check passengers'
travel documents.

He breached the screening checkpoint and continued shooting as he entered deeper
into the airport, Gannon said, until police cornered him near a Burger King.
"Personnel officers responded immediately ... They tracked the individual
through the airport and engaged him in gunfire and were able to successfully
take him into custody. As you can imagine a large amount of chaos took place."

A California congresswoman, Loretta Sanchez, citing a briefing from law
enforcement officials, confirmed local media reports that named the shooter as
Ciancia.

Airports around California were put under heightened alert and the White House
was briefed. Paramedics set up a medical triage area outside the terminal. LAX
operated at reduced capacity after the incident. The Federal Aviation
Administration halted all flights to LAX that were not already in the air.

Brian Adamick, 43, was at Terminal 3 preparing to board a Spirit Airlines flight
to Chicago when people started running through the area. Adamicktold reporters
he went through an emergency exit, down stairs and out on to the tarmac, with
several other passengers.

"While I was on the tarmac, I heard two gunshots from the same area where the
people had been running and screaming," he said. Minutes later buses evacuated
passengers and a TSA agent with a bloodied ankle who appeared remarkably calm,
saying "I got shot, I'm fine", according to Adamick.

The agent told passengers not to worry about him and that he had been shot
before, Adamick said. "It looked like it was straight out of the movies." he
added.

A reporter for NBC4 News said he saw two injured people leave the terminal. One
was in a wheelchair, while another walked out accompanied by emergency
personnel, the reporter said.

Bill Reiter, a reporter for Fox Sports, said gunfire in the terminal had
prompted a "stampede". He said on Twitter, at 9.30am local time: "I was at the
Virgin terminal at LAX when gunfire broke out. Many of us have run on the
tarmac. I don't know what's happening but I'm fine."

He added: "When gunfire broke out there was a stampede people, all of us hiding
under seats we didn't fit under, we burst through the door to outside. After the
initial burst of gunfire and hiding, people started jumping over one another,
jumping off chairs,[#xfffd]pushing each other. Chaos & fear."

Another passenger told CBS of surreal moments as police surrounded the gunman:
"Some people were running for their lives, others remained calm."

The actor James Franco arrived at LAX as the incident was unfolding. "Some s**
tbag shot up the place," he tweeted.

His publicist confirmed to the Associated Press that Franco was a passenger on a
flight that landed Friday morning after the shooting occurred.

Police evacuated the terminal and dozens of flights were cancelled and diverted.
Road closures jammed traffic around the airport.

LA teacher may have molested 20 children;
More sex abuse allegations in LA elementary schools as teacher suspected of
molesting 20 kids

SECTION: A; Pg.3

LENGTH: 205  words


LOS ANGELES (AP) - A fourth-grade teacher who worked for nearly 40 years in the
Los Angeles Unified School District has been arrested on suspicion of sexually
abusing 20 students, a year after another veteran teacher accused of molesting
nearly two dozen students brought national attention to the district and the
problem of classroom sex abuse.

After a 10-month investigation, eight felony counts of continual sexual abuse
and seven counts of lewd acts upon a child were filed Wednesday against Robert
Pimentel of Newport Beach for abuse that allegedly took place at George De La
Torre Jr. Elementary in the Wilmington area, Officer Christopher No told The
Associated Press.

In addition to the 15 felonies, misdemeanor charges are expected for the
remaining incidents, No said. Pimentel's bail has been set at $12 million, and
an arraignment date hasn't been set.

Police and school officials also said Pimentel is suspected of the sexual abuse
of one adult, but did not say what role if any that person had at the school.

Pimentel, 57, left his fourth-grade teaching position last March when
allegations arose from several girls who told their parents he inappropriately
touched them during school and police opened an investigation.

Hamid Towfigh: L.A. Residents Trust Hamid Towfigh for Unparalleled Legal Counsel

LENGTH: 430  words


New Delhi, Nov. 24 -- For many, the search for an effective criminal defense
lawyer in Los Angeles can prove both difficult and time consuming. As one of the
most populous and diverse cities in the country, it can be hard to know which
criminal defense attorney to trust. However, for those who have worked with Los
Angeles murder defense lawyer Hamid Towfigh, the choice is always clear. For
over 16 years, Mr. Towfigh has represented those in Los Angeles who face severe
circumstances, and has garnered an unrivaled track record in the process.



Los Angeles has always been a highly desirable city to live in. Its diverse
population and beautiful climate continue to inspire many to make the city their
home. Nonetheless, the highly populated and culturally-rich area has also been
exceptionally volatile at times, with an organized crime presence in the early
20th century paving the way for gang activity that still serves as a dangerous
issue to this day. Even still, homicide rates in the city have been declining
for decades - a record that very well may end this year. As crime issues become
a serious concern once again, Angelenos can breathe a sigh of relief knowing the
renowned Hamid Towfigh is on hand to fight for justice.

Born and raised in Southern California, Mr. Towfigh cares deeply for the city
and its residents, a fact that even inspired Los Angeles County District
Attorney Gil Garcetti (and father to the current mayor Eric Garcetti) to choose
Mr. Towfigh as a Deputy District Attorney. As a top prosecutor, Mr. Towfigh was
chosen to handle a number of cases involving some of the city's highest profile
celebrities, including Dr. Dre, Master P. and supermodel Adriana Lima, to name a
few.

While Mr. Towfigh's legal acumen naturally garnered the interest of some of
L.A.'s most powerful residents, he nonetheless remained committed first and
foremost to the city's residents who need help the most. As a member of the
elite Hardcore Gang Division, the acclaimed attorney served as prosecutor for
some for the most serious murder trials involving criminal gangs like the
Mexican Mafia and the notorious 18th Street gang, as well as over a dozen
different Blood and Crip gangs.

Throughout his career, he has won virtually every murder jury trial and lost
only one felony jury trial - an unprecedented feat. Perhaps most impressively,
though, Mr. Towfigh continues to give back to the community through youth
mentoring and as a motivational speaker with Project L.E.A.D., where he lectures
at high schools and speaks to children about the dangers of gang activity.

FOR 10TH YEAR;
Violent crime in L.A. falls

SECTION: NEWS; Pg. A1

LENGTH: 723 words


Violent crime in the city of Los Angeles fell for the 10th year in a row to its
lowest level in decades, even as property crime reversed its downward trend and
posted a slight uptick, the mayor and police chief announced Monday.

"Our data shows that, in 2012, Los Angeles had the fewest violent crimes per
capita than any big city in the United States of America," Mayor Antonio
Villaraigosa said during a news conference.

"Last year, there was a citywide reduction in robbery, aggravated assault,
burglary and auto theft, and - for the third year in a row - we saw fewer than
300 homicides," he added.

Police Chief Charlie Beck said the 18,293 violent crimes recorded in 2012
represented an 8.2 percent slide from the year before. Statistics showed
significant decreases in robbery and aggravated assault offset increases in rape
and homicide.

"This is the lowest violent crime level in the city of Los Angeles since William
Parker was chief (of the LAPD in the '50s and '60s)," Beck said.

He added a 10.5 percent drop in gang-related crimes overall helped drive the
numbers down, noting the 152 gang-related homicides last year were the fewest in
decades.

The city, however, saw property crimes increase for the first time in years,
though by only 0.2 percent for a total of 85,866 thefts, burglaries and
carjackings.

Beck blamed the uptick on a 30 percent increase in cellphone thefts, in
particular, and he urged the public to take precautions to prevent their various
electronic gadgets from being stolen.

"Lock it, hide it and you'll keep it," he advised. "Put the responsibility on
yourself for keeping your property safe. If you do that, then I can continue to
reduce crime in the city of Los Angeles."

Beck also attributed some of the increase in property crime to realignment,
which took effect in October 2011. That law, backed by Gov. Jerry Brown,
included a provision that placed certain ex-cons on probation instead of parole.

"When realignment was originally announced, I predicted property crime would
increase in Los Angeles by a couple of percentage points because of it, and I
believe that has occurred," he said, calling for the law to be "tweaked" so that
police can monitor ex-cons more closely.

Taken together, the overall drop in violent crimes and property crimes in 2012
was 1.4 percent, the smallest percentage decline in the last five years.

In 2008, during the recession, overall crimes receded 7.6 percent. In 2011, the
drop was 4.6 percent.

Beck, however, bristled at the observation that last year's 1.4 percent drop in
the overall crime rate did not seem up to par.

"You're minimizing something that is a remarkable achievement," he said.

"Why don't you ask the other cities that had an increase? Why don't you ask New
York, Chicago, the county of Los Angeles, if they would like to have 1.4
percent."

Villaraigosa, whose term ends in June, said he hopes the incoming mayor -
whoever it may be - will make the continued hiring of police officers a
priority.

He said the LAPD recently hit a milestone when its ranks swelled to 10,000, but
added Los Angeles remains "the most underpoliced big city" in the country. He
refused to back a proposed ballot measure to boost the sales tax if the LAPD is
not allowed to continue growing.

"There is no way I would support a sales tax if we don't continue police
hiring," Villaraigosa said.

"These numbers (the declining crime rates) don't lie," he added. "These numbers
are a reflection of growing our police department, of our commitment to
community policing."

Beck vowed the LAPD would continue to lower crime rates by remaining data-driven
in its crime suppression strategies, and by working closely with the Mayor's
Gang Reduction and Youth Development Office.

He also vowed to expand "predictive policing, which uses logarithms to predict
where crime will occur and to control the response of officers," as well as more
officers long term to the toughest parts of the city so they can form deep
partnerships with the communities there.

He also intends to continue Operation Ceasefire, which calls for talking to gang
members so they know the consequences of continued violent crimes, and Operation
Laser, which closely tracks people who have committed violent crimes in the past
and are likely to do so again.
