In every csv,

Column D: occurences in first year range
Column E: occurences in second year range

For example, if the file is named 2010_2011_vs_2012_2014, D is 2010-2011, E is 2012-2014.

Words that occur frequently in 2012-2014 are at the top of the file, words that occur more
in 2010-2011 are at the bottom of the csv.
