introduction
the
future
of
policing
blinks
on
a
computer
screen
in
downtown
los
angeles
n
on
that
screen
police
have
predicted
the
next
area
of
potential
criminal
activity
n
based
on
crime
data
collection
analysis
and
computer
modeling
the
los
angeles
police
department
lapd
is
directing
patrol
officers
to
a
targeted
block
of
expected
crime
n
in
the
lapd
s
real
time
analysis
and
critical
response
division
a
new
concept
of
predictive
policing
is
being
developed
based
on
past
crime
patterns
and
sophisticated
computer
algorithms
n
promoted
as
the
next
smart
policing
weapon
in
the
war
on
crime
its
promise
is
to
predict
crime
before
it
happens
n
in
another
part
of
california
police
stake
out
an
area
of
predicted
criminal
activity
as
described
by
the
new
york
times
in
a
parking
garage
forecast
to
be
the
location
of
future
car
thefts
two
women
are
arrested
after
peering
into
car
windows
n
one
has
an
open
arrest
warrant
n
the
other
is
caught
carrying
drugs
n
without
the
predictive
tip
it
is
arguable
that
peering
into
windows
in
a
parking
garage
is
sufficient
reason
to
be
stopped
and
detained
by
police
n
but
with
the
predictive
technologies
the
constitutional
questions
become
more
difficult
can
a
computer
program
that
predicts
the
probability
of
future
crime
locations
change
fourth
amendment
protections
in
the
targeted
area
are
data
driven
hunches
any
more
reliable
than
personal
hunches
traditionally
deemed
insufficient
to
justify
reasonable
suspicion
n
what
measures
exist
to
examine
the
reliability
and
accuracy
of
these
new
policing
tools
n
these
questions
and
more
are
raised
by
the
use
of
any
predictive
policing
strategy
this
article
addresses
the
fourth
amendment
consequences
of
this
police
innovation
analyzing
the
effect
of
predictive
policing
on
the
concept
of
reasonable
suspicion
more
broadly
this
article
addresses
the
theoretical
and
doctrinal
impact
of
predictive
policing
on
the
fourth
amendment
leaving
for
future
projects
an
empirical
study
of
the
program
s
effectiveness
or
practical
results
in
its
current
form
the
technology
is
too
new
to
make
any
definitive
conclusion
on
its
merits
as
a
crime
suppression
technique
n
yet
as
can
be
seen
by
the
growing
interest
in
the
concept
of
predictive
policing
in
the
form
of
test
programs
major
government
grants
national
news
articles
and
awards
the
future
is
now
and
the
constitutional
implications
of
that
future
must
now
be
addressed
n
this
article
examines
predictive
policing
in
the
context
of
the
larger
constitutional
framework
of
prediction
and
the
fourth
amendment
many
aspects
of
current
fourth
amendment
law
are
implicitly
or
explicitly
based
on
prediction
n
search
warrants
are
predictions
that
contraband
will
be
found
in
a
particular
location
n
investigative
detentions
are
predictions
that
the
person
is
committing
or
about
to
commit
a
crime
n
fourth
amendment
concepts
like
probable
cause
reasonable
suspicion
n
informant
tips
n
drug
courier
profiles
n
high
crime
areas
n
and
others
are
based
on
evaluating
levels
of
probability
that
criminal
activity
will
occur
or
is
occurring
n
predictive
policing
both
fits
within
this
established
tradition
and
also
challenges
it
in
novel
ways
as
will
be
argued
predictive
policing
may
in
fact
necessitate
a
reconsideration
of
some
of
the
existing
reasonable
suspicion
doctrine
as
well
as
point
to
refinements
in
future
application
n
the
article
concludes
that
in
its
idealized
form
predictive
policing
will
impact
reasonable
suspicion
analysis
and
become
an
important
factor
in
a
court
s
fourth
amendment
calculus
while
never
enough
alone
this
predictive
information
will
be
used
to
justify
stops
under
existing
fourth
amendment
precedent
evolving
from
a
rich
academic
tradition
of
criminological
insights
around
crime
and
place
and
building
on
real
world
experiments
with
hotspot
policing
the
theory
of
predictive
policing
has
both
academic
and
practical
grounding
n
in
addition
in
its
initial
implementation
focused
on
specific
types
of
property
crime
in
specific
locations
under
controlled
tests
the
predictions
appear
to
have
positive
results
in
reducing
crime
n
at
the
same
time
the
underlying
rationale
of
why
predictive
policing
may
be
effective
for
certain
crimes
and
areas
may
actually
lead
to
a
limitation
on
its
applicability
these
limitations
should
inform
future
fourth
amendment
analysis
in
determining
reasonable
suspicion
further
these
limitations
raise
deeper
questions
about
the
reliability
transparency
and
application
of
the
technology
articulating
and
framing
those
theoretical
and
practical
limitations
is
the
task
of
this
article
part
i
of
this
article
canvasses
the
current
state
of
predictive
policing
in
the
united
states
placed
within
the
context
of
a
two
decade
evolution
to
data
driven
and
intelligence
led
policing
predictive
policing
is
the
next
logical
step
in
using
crime
data
and
mapping
technologies
to
reduce
crime
n
this
part
briefly
examines
the
history
theoretical
background
and
current
research
on
predicting
crime
patterns
with
a
focus
on
the
types
of
crimes
that
police
departments
and
researchers
are
using
to
test
the
predictive
policing
model
part
ii
of
this
article
examines
prediction
as
a
significant
if
unexamined
aspect
of
the
fourth
amendment
doctrine
predicting
criminal
activities
based
on
probabilities
rests
at
the
core
of
fourth
amendment
concepts
such
as
probable
cause
and
reasonable
suspicion
n
in
addition
the
supreme
court
has
addressed
the
predictive
value
of
information
including
informant
tips
profiling
and
high
crime
areas
in
a
range
of
cases
n
this
part
distills
the
principles
emerging
from
these
cases
in
an
effort
to
ground
an
analysis
of
predictive
policing
part
iii
applies
the
relevant
fourth
amendment
analogies
to
the
problem
of
predictive
policing
depending
on
the
fourth
amendment
analogy
chosen
for
analysis
tips
profiles
high
crime
areas
different
problems
arise
notably
however
under
any
of
the
analogies
courts
will
come
out
with
the
same
answer
under
current
law
as
will
be
argued
predictive
policing
will
alter
the
reasonable
suspicion
analysis
in
a
direct
way
changing
the
current
calculus
to
favor
a
finding
of
reasonable
suspicion
whether
viewed
positively
or
negatively
as
a
constitutional
matter
this
shift
points
to
larger
problems
with
a
weakened
reasonable
suspicion
standard
if
a
law
enforcement
computer
algorithm
can
change
fourth
amendment
freedoms
then
courts
have
an
extra
responsibility
to
ensure
that
the
technology
meets
reasonable
standards
of
reliability
and
accuracy
part
iv
of
the
article
addresses
the
present
and
future
concerns
with
using
predictive
policing
technologies
first
this
part
looks
at
the
importance
of
understanding
why
predictive
technologies
work
and
it
links
the
underlying
research
on
prediction
to
the
fourth
amendment
analysis
that
courts
will
soon
be
required
to
make
in
general
the
predictive
theories
that
have
been
studied
focus
exclusively
on
property
crimes
one
concern
with
the
adoption
of
these
technologies
is
that
they
may
become
divorced
from
the
underlying
logic
of
why
certain
crime
locations
can
be
predicted
in
other
words
the
studies
that
focus
on
property
crimes
in
fixed
areas
could
be
applied
unthinkingly
to
other
crimes
in
other
contexts
in
addition
this
part
looks
at
ways
to
assess
the
reliability
transparency
and
accuracy
of
the
programs
as
well
as
the
need
to
create
mechanisms
to
avoid
manipulation
bias
or
uneven
application
predictive
policing
like
many
new
law
enforcement
strategies
raises
issues
of
class
based
and
race
based
targeting
as
well
as
general
civil
liberty
concerns
finally
this
part
looks
at
some
of
the
potential
unintended
consequences
of
this
technology
that
may
actually
make
certain
police
stops
more
difficult
to
justify
as
a
constitutional
matter
i
predictive
policing
an
introduction
predictive
policing
refers
to
any
policing
strategy
or
tactic
that
develops
and
uses
information
and
advanced
analysis
to
inform
forward
thinking
crime
prevention
n
more
objective
than
a
patrol
officer
s
hunch
about
an
area
predictive
policing
uses
the
power
of
big
data
to
isolate
patterns
in
otherwise
random
acts
n
predictive
policing
has
become
a
generic
term
for
any
crime
fighting
approach
that
includes
a
reliance
on
information
technology
usually
crime
mapping
data
and
analysis
criminology
theory
predictive
algorithms
and
the
use
of
this
data
to
improve
crime
suppression
on
the
streets
n
in
simple
terms
predictive
policing
involves
computer
models
that
predict
areas
of
future
crime
locations
from
past
crime
statistics
and
other
data
n
a
simple
predictive
policing
model
might
take
historical
data
about
a
particular
type
of
crime
the
location
and
time
of
that
crime
and
plot
those
past
crimes
in
a
way
that
would
inform
crime
analysts
about
an
unusual
cluster
of
crimes
n
as
will
be
discussed
later
research
studies
support
the
accuracy
of
this
historically
based
prediction
for
certain
crimes
under
certain
circumstances
n
a
more
complex
predictive
policing
model
might
involve
event
based
concerns
such
as
arrests
calls
for
service
or
incident
reports
in
combination
with
place
based
concerns
such
as
addresses
of
known
gang
members
arrestees
parolees
or
places
of
frequent
violence
or
unrest
n
this
information
could
be
weighted
by
types
of
crime
violent
crime
property
crime
and
even
include
information
about
particular
individuals
n
gang
activity
traffic
patterns
environmental
factors
and
other
local
information
n
a
computer
algorithm
would
then
analyze
the
data
by
searching
for
patterns
in
areas
of
statistically
more
probable
criminal
activity
n
most
relevantly
this
predictive
information
would
then
inform
police
administrators
about
how
to
allocate
resources
to
target
that
specific
type
of
crime
and
in
some
sophisticated
programs
this
information
would
be
provided
to
officers
patrolling
the
streets
in
real
time
through
a
squad
car
computer
or
mobile
device
n
as
an
example
currently
the
los
angeles
police
department
has
undertaken
an
ambitious
pilot
project
to
test
the
feasibility
of
predictive
policing
n
under
the
leadership
of
former
police
chief
william
bratton
and
with
the
collaboration
of
scholars
at
several
california
universities
the
police
have
begun
to
test
the
effectiveness
of
predictive
policing
focusing
on
certain
crimes
in
certain
areas
n
as
developed
by
lapd
captain
sean
malinowski
and
based
on
the
algorithms
created
by
ucla
professor
jeffrey
brantingham
and
university
of
santa
cruz
professor
george
mohler
the
project
focuses
on
three
specific
types
of
property
crime
burglary
automobile
theft
and
theft
from
automobiles
n
based
on
three
years
worth
of
data
weighting
more
recent
crimes
more
than
older
crimes
and
observing
patterns
the
algorithm
seeks
to
identify
by
foot
areas
of
probable
criminal
activity
n
officers
are
then
directed
to
those
areas
of
predicted
crime
initial
results
have
been
successful
as
non
violent
crime
has
dropped
in
those
areas
further
testing
is
being
done
in
a
controlled
experiment
to
test
the
reliability
of
the
results
n
a
similar
experiment
is
being
conducted
in
santa
cruz
california
in
santa
cruz
officers
are
provided
daily
crime
forecasts
every
morning
at
roll
call
which
direct
them
to
patrol
certain
designated
areas
n
each
forecast
has
a
specific
prediction
for
example
there
is
a
likelihood
of
a
car
theft
in
a
particular
downtown
garage
on
a
particular
day
n
the
times
when
those
car
thefts
are
most
likely
to
occur
are
also
listed
n
based
on
the
research
conducted
by
professor
george
mohler
the
predictive
policing
algorithm
is
modeled
on
seismic
aftershock
theory
and
demonstrates
that
certain
property
crimes
again
burglary
auto
theft
and
theft
from
auto
can
be
identified
and
predicted
in
small
by
foot
areas
n
police
officers
are
then
sent
to
patrol
those
areas
as
part
of
their
regular
beats
n
according
to
a
santa
cruz
spokesperson
thirteen
people
have
been
stopped
in
the
designated
areas
in
the
first
six
months
of
the
experiment
n
it
is
those
individuals
stopped
within
a
predicted
area
that
are
the
subject
of
this
article
whether
or
not
predictive
policing
works
as
a
matter
of
crime
suppression
it
raises
fourth
amendment
challenges
for
individuals
stopped
in
those
areas
the
los
angeles
and
santa
cruz
police
departments
may
be
ahead
of
other
cities
in
testing
the
predictive
policing
model
but
they
are
by
no
means
the
only
law
enforcement
agencies
using
the
technique
jurisdictions
as
diverse
as
palm
beach
county
florida
n
memphis
tennessee
n
chicago
illinois
n
minneapolis
minnesota
n
and
dallas
texas
n
are
testing
predictive
policing
tactics
with
federal
seed
money
from
the
department
of
justice
other
jurisdictions
are
testing
the
technology
n
in
addition
cities
with
particularized
crime
problems
are
using
predictive
policing
to
combat
those
specific
issues
n
there
are
at
least
three
reasons
why
predictive
policing
has
drawn
national
attention
and
federal
financing
n
first
it
is
cost
effective
in
an
era
of
shrinking
municipal
and
state
budgets
n
second
it
offers
promise
of
a
high
tech
progressive
sounding
plan
to
stop
crime
which
offers
significant
public
relations
benefits
n
third
from
early
tests
in
admittedly
small
areas
the
strategy
appears
to
reduce
crime
with
minimal
disruption
to
regular
policing
responsibilities
n
while
the
jury
is
out
on
the
accuracy
n
and
cost
savings
attendant
to
adopting
a
predictive
policing
model
n
there
is
little
doubt
that
adoption
of
the
terminology
and
the
data
driven
technology
is
growing
and
will
influence
police
departments
courts
and
criminal
suspects
for
years
to
come
n
a
predictive
policing
in
context
predicting
future
crime
patterns
from
past
crime
statistics
is
neither
as
futuristic
nor
as
far
fetched
as
it
might
initially
sound
in
fact
predictive
policing
can
be
viewed
as
part
of
an
evolution
to
intelligence
driven
policing
techniques
that
rely
on
scientifically
grounded
principles
and
decades
of
criminological
theory
on
crime
and
place
n
this
section
briefly
sets
out
the
history
theory
and
research
studies
that
support
the
predictive
policing
model
while
current
models
of
predictive
policing
do
not
purport
to
be
directly
based
on
these
theories
this
criminological
research
informs
any
evaluation
of
its
legitimacy
as
a
tool
that
could
have
constitutional
consequences
intelligence
led
policing
and
theories
of
crime
and
place
in
recent
years
intelligence
led
policing
has
become
an
influential
theory
in
the
growing
study
of
law
enforcement
practices
n
distinct
from
other
theories
such
as
community
policing
n
or
the
broken
windows
theory
of
policing
n
intelligence
led
policing
focuses
on
crime
data
analysis
and
targeted
police
efforts
in
response
to
that
data
n
large
cities
such
as
new
york
city
los
angeles
and
chicago
have
embraced
crime
mapping
technologies
using
objective
crime
data
to
determine
police
staffing
and
patrols
n
problem
areas
are
identified
through
crime
statistics
and
significant
police
resources
are
directed
at
those
particular
areas
n
as
evidenced
by
a
significant
drop
in
crime
rates
in
these
cities
these
types
of
smart
policing
tactics
have
been
widely
hailed
as
successful
innovations
in
the
law
enforcement
community
n
at
one
level
predictive
policing
is
merely
the
next
iteration
of
this
intelligence
led
policing
concept
n
analysts
have
moved
from
identifying
past
crime
patterns
to
predicting
the
next
crime
location
within
that
pattern
n
to
take
an
easy
example
if
there
are
assault
arrests
every
saturday
evening
at
a
particular
bar
at
closing
time
then
it
would
not
be
difficult
to
predict
that
on
a
future
saturday
night
there
might
be
a
bar
fight
at
that
location
stationing
a
police
officer
at
the
door
at
closing
time
might
prevent
future
fights
the
theory
of
predictive
policing
is
that
by
aggregating
all
reported
crimes
with
similar
time
place
and
crime
criteria
important
insights
into
larger
crime
patterns
in
a
jurisdiction
could
be
obtained
this
focus
on
identifiable
places
of
criminal
activity
exists
within
a
well
developed
theoretical
construct
that
criminologists
have
been
developing
for
decades
it
is
now
generally
acknowledged
that
crime
does
not
randomly
disperse
across
a
geographic
area
n
instead
crime
is
clustered
in
particular
areas
that
usually
can
be
explained
as
a
function
of
certain
environmental
factors
that
create
vulnerabilities
for
victims
at
certain
times
n
these
hotspots
of
crime
have
been
well
documented
in
academic
literature
and
confirmed
by
daily
police
reports
n
the
result
is
that
crime
disproportionately
affects
certain
victims
at
particular
places
n
traditionally
this
type
of
hotspot
analysis
would
involve
a
retrospective
mapping
of
crime
clusters
in
a
particular
area
reported
crimes
would
be
mapped
by
coordinates
on
a
searchable
computer
map
and
areas
of
heightened
criminal
activity
would
be
noted
n
use
of
hotspot
technology
has
resulted
in
some
surprising
results
n
for
example
half
of
the
crime
in
seattle
over
a
fourteen
year
period
could
be
isolated
to
only
of
city
streets
n
similarly
researchers
in
minneapolis
minnesota
found
that
of
street
addresses
and
intersections
in
minneapolis
generated
of
all
dispatched
police
calls
for
service
n
this
type
of
analysis
can
be
broken
down
by
type
of
crime
and
location
researchers
in
boston
found
that
only
of
street
segments
accounted
for
of
all
street
robberies
over
a
twenty
eight
year
period
n
traditional
hotspot
analysis
can
also
isolate
patterns
in
time
of
crime
n
or
locations
of
crime
n
to
be
clear
traditional
hotspot
mapping
does
not
directly
present
a
theory
to
predict
future
crime
clearly
repeated
patterns
of
localized
crime
suggest
an
inference
that
the
environmental
conditions
are
ripe
for
future
crime
n
but
the
identification
of
hotspots
does
not
necessarily
involve
prediction
predictive
policing
takes
this
traditional
retrospective
analysis
and
applies
it
prospectively
different
theories
have
been
posited
for
why
concentration
of
criminal
activity
occurs
event
based
theories
like
the
routine
activities
theory
suggest
that
crime
is
likely
to
occur
when
motivated
offenders
converge
suitable
targets
exist
and
capable
guardians
are
lacking
n
place
based
theories
focus
instead
on
vulnerabilities
in
the
location
as
the
reason
for
the
criminal
activity
n
these
vulnerabilities
can
include
simple
factors
such
as
poor
lighting
lack
of
police
surveillance
attractive
victims
or
easy
escape
routes
among
many
other
possibilities
of
course
a
place
does
not
create
crime
n
so
more
contextual
theories
have
been
developed
such
as
pattern
theory
which
examines
the
environmental
backcloth
n
as
inviting
a
space
for
criminal
activity
n
other
scholars
have
offered
an
opportunity
theory
that
focuses
on
the
availability
of
criminal
targets
as
the
determining
factor
for
criminal
acts
since
criminals
tend
to
stay
local
and
look
for
easy
opportunities
n
no
matter
the
chosen
theory
the
recognition
that
the
risk
of
crime
increases
because
of
identifiable
environmental
factors
has
clear
implications
for
predictive
policing
n
if
police
can
identify
a
location
of
potential
crime
and
understand
the
relevant
environmental
factors
for
that
predicted
crime
then
police
can
focus
their
resources
on
those
locations
as
future
problem
areas
for
police
attention
n
this
insight
about
place
and
crime
answers
a
critical
question
for
any
policing
theory
in
asking
why
people
commit
particular
crimes
at
particular
locations
we
generate
information
not
only
about
when
they
may
commit
the
next
crime
but
also
how
to
stop
it
for
example
applying
routine
activities
theory
to
a
pattern
of
residential
burglaries
requires
the
presence
of
an
offender
a
target
and
the
absence
of
a
guardian
n
an
offender
will
target
a
home
or
homes
in
an
area
if
vulnerabilities
exist
such
as
the
absence
of
law
enforcement
weak
structural
protections
or
a
lack
of
community
vigilance
n
adding
a
guardian
a
police
officer
to
the
location
of
those
burglaries
will
likely
remove
the
vulnerability
decreasing
the
likelihood
of
another
burglary
similarly
the
opportunity
theory
might
argue
the
following
having
targeted
a
particular
home
for
the
first
time
a
burglar
acquires
knowledge
to
inform
future
targeting
decisions
this
may
concern
the
internal
layout
of
a
burgled
property
the
ease
of
access
and
escape
the
products
that
may
be
found
were
the
offender
to
return
the
risks
of
identification
and
so
on
this
knowledge
is
likely
to
reduce
uncertainty
about
nearby
homes
n
changing
the
ease
of
access
or
escape
or
adding
uncertainty
in
the
form
of
locks
police
presence
security
lights
etc
may
alter
the
calculus
for
a
potential
opportunity
thief
understanding
why
people
commit
the
crimes
by
understanding
the
environmental
vulnerabilities
can
affect
decisions
about
how
to
stop
the
next
crime
before
it
happens
predictive
policing
applies
these
criminological
insights
in
two
ways
first
it
recognizes
that
the
past
patterns
identify
an
opportunity
to
ask
why
what
in
the
environment
of
that
space
has
increased
the
risk
of
that
particular
crime
second
by
directing
law
enforcement
personnel
to
that
area
the
environmental
vulnerability
may
be
removed
by
disrupting
the
routine
activities
the
pattern
or
the
opportunity
police
may
be
able
to
prevent
the
next
crime
n
as
a
pure
law
enforcement
matter
this
disruptive
preventive
effect
may
be
the
most
important
result
crime
may
go
down
simply
by
establishing
a
police
presence
in
an
area
predictive
models
of
crime
the
general
theory
of
crime
and
place
has
been
refined
by
scholars
who
have
looked
at
different
crime
patterns
as
predictors
of
future
crime
n
this
research
gives
legitimacy
to
the
theory
behind
predictive
policing
even
if
the
research
is
not
directed
at
any
formal
examination
of
predictive
policing
itself
n
in
time
of

researchers
will
evaluate
the
reliability
and
validity
of
official
predictive

strategies
at
this
time

one
can
only
look
at
analogous
research
studies

examine
whether
the
predictive
policing
model
offers
a
reliable
and
valid
method
of
prediction
that
will
survive
fourth
amendment
scrutiny
as
will
be
discussed
in
part
iv
if
the
predictive
methods
are
not
reliable
valid
and
transparent
they
will
not

support
the
level

stop
two
representative
predictive

both
offer
sophisticated
theories
about
why

might
be
able
to

types
of

in
certain

a
key
point
in
understanding
these
studies
and
thus
the
reliability
of
analogous
predictive
models
is
to
identify
the
limitations
inherent
in
the
studies
as
will
be
discussed
the
predictive
policing
model
may
only
work
for
certain
types
of
crimes
in
certain
areas
a
near
repeat
theory
near
repeat
theory
seeks
to
identify
and
explain
the
phenomenon
that
certain
crimes
seem
to
generate
repeat
criminal
activity
at
the

place
n
the
theory
posits
that
once
a
particular
location
has
been
subject
to
a
crime
it
is
statistically
more
likely
that

events
during

frame
after
the

n
residential

automobile

and
theft
from
automobiles
share
certain
characteristics
that
make
reliable
prediction
more
likely
n
significant
research
has
been
done
on
residential
burglary
which
has
consistently
demonstrated
a
near
repeat
pattern
n
in
the
most
exhaustive
study
of
ten
different
jurisdictions
across
an
international
spectrum
residential
burglaries
showed
a
near
repeat
phenomenon
despite
different
cultural
environments
n
specifically
a
successive
burglary
occurred
within
meters
and
two
weeks
of
the
initial
burglary
at
a
statistically
significant
rate
n
noting
the
near
repeat
studies
one
scholar
stated
burglary

appears
to
be
contagious
in
the
wake
of
a

risks
as
well
n
studies
from
england
and
canada
show
that
the
chance
of
near

burglary
victimization
is
four
n
to
twelve
n
times
higher
than
a
random
occurrence
while
not
definitive
these
statistics
show
a
pattern
that
might
be
useful
for
predicting
future
burglaries
n
in
fact
some
proponents
of
predictive
policing
argue
that
with
the
appropriate
technology
they
can
predict
and
deter
about
percent
of
burglaries
in
a
given
area
n
two
theories
have
been
put
forth
to
explain
why
the
near
repeat
phenomenon
occurs
in
residential
burglaries
n
flag
theory
posits
that
some
properties
are
vulnerable
and
effectively
advertise
their
vulnerability
n
flag
theory
applied
to
burglaries
means
that
burglaries
at
the
same
location
may
simply
be
the
work
of
different
offenders
who
respond
to
similar
signals
of
target
attractiveness
or
accessibility
attractive
opportunities
are
overtly
flagged
for
all
to
see
n
boost
theory
in
contrast
argues
that
repeat
victimization
occurs
because
some
information
learned
by
the
original
offenders
enhances
boosts
the
vulnerability
of
the
home
n
as
one
article
has
described
the
rationale
was
that
having
burgled
one
property
offenders
would
become
more
familiar
with
and
consequently
target
nearby
households
good
reasons
for
this
hypothesis
exist
for
instance
houses
nearest
to
each
other
are
likely
to
share
more
features
that
may
inform
offender
targeting
decisions
than
those
located
further
away
such
features
include
access
and
escape
routes
internal
and
external
architectural
layouts
levels
of
natural
surveillance
and
the
availability
of
desirable
goods
as
already
noted
the
results
of
the
studies
validated
the
hypothesis
demonstrating
that
burglary
clusters
in
space
and
time
n
one
reason
for
repeat
victimization
may
be
simply
that
it
is
the
same
individuals
or
gangs
committing
the
crimes
n
one
researcher
found
that
of
the
burglars
he
interviewed
had
gone
back
to
a
number
of
houses
after
a
varying
period
of
time
to
burgle
them
between
two
and
five
times
n
however
the
research
also
suggests
that
the
boost
theory
may
account
for
the
change
n
essentially
certain
kinds
of
crime
might
be
considered
communicable
like
a
contagious
virus
that
infects
not
only
the
particular
burglarized
property
but
also
those
in
close
proximity
n
in
boost
theory
information
about
an
environmental
vulnerability
spreads
and
a
subsequent
crime
occurs
because
of
that
spread
n
if
accurate
this
type
of
information
can
inform
predictive
theories
and
direct
police
resources
to
stop
the
spread
of
burglaries
n
two
caveats
must
be
mentioned
about
these
studies
first
while
other
crimes
such
as
automobile
theft
n
and
theft
from
automobiles
n
have
been
analogized
to
residential
burglary
as
having
similar
near
repeat
effects
not
all
crime
fits
this
category
residences
are
not
only
fixed
but
nearby
residences
may
share
similar
designs
demographic
factors
transportation
infrastructures
housing
density
and
lighting
issues
n
such
similarities
may
not
exist
for
other
crimes
n
the
second
limitation
in
the
studies
recognizes
the
temporal
limitation
of
the
near
repeat
phenomenon
n
a
consistent
finding
in
the
studies
was
that
a
large
number
of
repeat
incidents
occur
within
week
of
an
antecedent
and
the
risk
of
repeat
victimisation
appears
to
decay
over
time
n
thus
any
predictions
of
future
burglaries
would
have
to
be
within
this
limited
window
the
conclusion
from
this
brief
overview
is
that
the
near
repeat
pattern
can
be
validated
for
some
types
of
crime
but
has
not
been
for
others
in
fact
the
very
reason
why
the
theory
might
work
for
property
crimes
such
as
burglary
and
automobile
theft
may
make
it
inappropriate
to
apply
to
other
interpersonal
or
violent
crimes
that
are
not
so
place
based
similarly
while
there
has
been
consistency
within
the
jurisdictions
tested
this
does
not
mean
that
the
theory
would
hold
for
all
jurisdictions
n
finally
it
is
important
to
note
the
relatively
few
studies
done
and
thus
there
is
a
justifiable
caution
about
expanding
the
findings
beyond
the
carefully
controlled
study
areas

rtm

a
way
of
looking
at

a

a
dynamic
interaction
between
social

identifies

system

creators
rtm
assigns
a
value
signifying
the
presence

at

place
throughout

of
the

when
all

are
combined
in

they
produce
a
composite
map
a
risk
terrain
map
where
every

throughout

is
assigned
a
composite
risk
value
that
accounts
for
all

the
particular
crime
outcome
the
higher
the
risk
value
the
greater
the
likelihood
of
a

event
occurring
at
that
location
n
for
example
in
analyzing
burglaries
in
morris
county
new
jersey
an
rtm
map
was
created
using
five
variables
past
burglaries
the
residential
location
of
individuals
arrested
for
theft
or
burglary
between
and
the
proximity
to
major
highways
the
geographic
concentration
of
males
between
the
ages
of

n
and
the
location
of
apartment
complexes

hotels
n
the
result
led
police
administrators
to
redirect
available
police
resources
to
those
identified
locations
and
ultimately
to
an
overall
decrease
in
both
general
crime
and
more
specifically
violent
crime
and
property
crime
n
by
isolating
variables
that
correspond
with
past
crimes

environmental
factors
rtm
was
able
to
focus
attention
on
the
likely
areas

been
applied
to

by

rtm
seems
to
offer
great
promise

rtm

four
risk

while
there
may
be
some
debate
about
the

otherwise
be

random

while

the
technology

see
the
attraction
of
this
type
of
innovation
that
potentially
reduces
violent

as
well
as

risk
terrain
mapping
for

offers
two
insights
similar
to
the
near

theory
for
residential

first
some
predictions
are
focused
on
the

themselves

might
engage
in
repeated
or
retaliatory
actions
n
the
violent
actions
occur
in
a
social
fabric
and
patterns
of
risk
are
also
communicable
as
gang
reacts
to
gang
or
individuals
seek
revenge
on
one
another
n
second
some
of
the
reasons
for
the
violence
are
due
to
environmental
factors
that
make
those
locations
more
conducive
to
shootings
n
this
summary
shows
that
sophisticated
mapping
and
analysis
technologies
exist
that
may
be
able
to
address
a
broader
range
of
crimes
jurisdictions
may
adapt
predictive
policing
techniques
beyond
property
based
crimes
to
more
complex
and
serious
violent
crimes
the
question
that
remains
of
course
is
not
whether
these
analytical
models
should
be
used
but
whether
law
enforcement
practices
arising
from
these
analyses
will
be
applied
consistently
with
constitutional
rights

predictive

future
cases
while
beyond
the
scope
of
this
paper
predictive
policing
models
are
also
being
considered
to
address
other
identifiable
risk
environments
predictive
models
can
be
used
to
locate
areas
for
heightened
surveillance
or
to
mitigate
risk
by
removing
or
altering
environmental
dangers
n
in
addition
predictive
models
are
being
used
to
target
known
human
risk
factors
such
as
criminal
gangs
n
for
example
one
study
has
applied
the
place
based
approach
to
gangs
that
also
exist
in
an
established
and
usually
contested
territorial
geographic
area
n
it
has
not
been
determined
whether
the
models
hold
for
these
types
of
crimes
but
some
jurisdictions
are
considering
the
possibilities
n
in
addition
one
could
imagine
that
predictive
policing
models
could
also
be
established
for
individuals
or
at
least
individuals
on
probation
or
parole
n
in
some
jurisdictions
predictive
evaluations
of
recidivism
are

n
many

there
is

the

is
inexact
one
could
imagine
a

situation
to
the

in
which
an

calls

to
predict

anonymous
tip
cases
the
fourth
amendment
requires
reasonable
suspicion
to
stop
a
specific
individual
based
on
a
tip
the
supreme
court
has
stated
that
an
informant
s
veracity
reliability
and
basis
of
knowledge
remain
highly
relevant
in
determining
the
value
of
the
tip
n
this
legal
standard
derives
from
illinois
v
gates
the
supreme
court
s
seminal
case
on
probable
cause
involving
an
anonymous
informant
n
gates
like
many
predictive
cases
involved
a
prediction
that
certain
contraband
would
be
in
the
possession
of
two
specific
named
individuals
who
had
been
identified
through
an
anonymous
letter
n
in
gates
police
had
no
information
about
the
informer
or
the
basis
of
knowledge
about
the
tip
n
however
many
of
the
details
in
the
tip
accurately
predicted
future
events
n
this
corroboration
of
predicted
actions
observed
by
police
officers
created
probable
cause
to
justify
the
search
n
gates
relied
on
draper
v
united
states
n
a
case
that
also
rested
a
finding
of
probable
cause
on
the
level
of
corroborated
detail
in
a
predictive
tip
n
in
draper
the
anonymous
informant
accurately
predicted
the
city
train
and
physical
and
clothing
description
of
the
suspect
who
was
thought
to
be
carrying
narcotics
n
the
supreme
court
reasoned
that
such
detailed
predictive
information
demonstrated
that
the
informant
had
inside
information
about
the
suspect
and
the
crime
and
thus
the
tip
was
reliable
n
both
gates
and
draper
stand
for
the
proposition
that
detailed
individualized
prediction
corroborated
by
police
observation
can
support
a
finding
of
probable
cause
n
the
predictive
judgment
of
probable
cause
is
to
be
considered
in
a
non
technical
manner
usable
by
officers
on
the
street
n
this
analysis
also
has
been
adopted
to
govern
the
reasonable
suspicion
calculus
for
informant
tips
n
the
supreme
court
has
explicitly
addressed
informant
tips
and
reasonable
suspicion
in
two
major
cases
providing
both
support
and
establishing
limits
for
the
use
of
informant
tips
first
in
alabama
v
white
an
anonymous
tip
that
was
corroborated
by
some
predictive
details
was
found
to
be
just
enough
to
establish
reasonable
suspicion
n
in
white
police
received
an
anonymous
call
stating
that
the
suspect
would
be
leaving
a
particular
apartment
at
a
particular
time
in
a
particular
brown
plymouth
station
wagon
with
the
right
taillight

broken

that

would
be
going

would
be
in

about
an
ounce
of

following
up
on
the
tip
police
observed
the
brown
plymouth
station
wagon
with
a
broken
taillight
at
the
correct
address
and
they
followed
the
vehicle
as
it
drove
the
most
direct
route
to
dobey
s
motel
when
the
vehicle
reached
the
mobile
highway
on
which
dobey
s
motel
is
located
corporal
reynolds
requested
a
patrol
unit
to
stop
the
vehicle
n
police
stopped
the
car
and
searched
it
with
ms
white
s
consent
n
following
the
reasoning
of
gates
the
supreme
court
found
the
prediction
detailed
enough
timely
enough
and
individualized
enough
to
justify
reasonable
suspicion
n
the
court
focused
on
the
substantial
corroboration
of
the
tip
what
was
important
was
the
caller
s
ability
to
predict
respondent
s
future
behavior
because
it
demonstrated
inside
information
a
special
familiarity
with
respondent
s
affairs
the
general
public
would
have
had
no
way
of
knowing
that
respondent
would
shortly
leave
the
building
get
in
the
described
car
and
drive
the
most
direct
route
to
dobey
s
motel
because
only
a
small
number
of
people
are
generally
privy
to
an
individual
s
itinerary
it
is
reasonable
for
police
to
believe
that
a
person
with
access
to
such
information
is
likely
to
also
have
access
to
reliable
information
about
that
individual
s
illegal
activities
n
the
court
emphasized
that
because
there
was
a
low
degree
of
reliability
and
no
information
about
the
basis
of
knowledge
such
a
tip
requires
more
corroboration
to
establish
reasonable
suspicion
n
in
other
words
the
weak
reliability
of
the
tip
has
to
be
compensated
for
with
greater
direct
corroboration
of
predicted
details
in
contrast
the
supreme
court
later
held
an
anonymous
tip
that
did
not
involve
predictive
detail
or
inside
information
to
be
insufficient
to
justify
reasonable
suspicion
for
a
stop
n
in
florida
v
j
l
an
anonymous
caller
reported
to
the
miami
dade
police
that
a
young
black
male
standing
at
a
particular
bus
stop
and
wearing
a
plaid
shirt
was
carrying
a
gun
n
in
response
to
this
tip
one
of
the
officers
approached
j
l
told
him
to
put
his
hands
up
on
the
bus
stop
frisked
him
and
seized
a
gun
from
j
l
s
pocket
n
as
the
court
acknowledged
while
the
general
description
of
the
suspect
was
predicted
apart
from
the
tip
the
officers
had
no
reason
to
suspect
j
l
of
illegal
conduct
the
officers
did
not
see
a
firearm
and
j
l
made
no
threatening
or
otherwise
unusual
movements
n
the
court
distinguished
white
because
in
white
the
tipster
had
inside
knowledge
about
the
suspect
and
therefore
it
was
reasonable
for
the
police
officer
to
credit
his
assertion
about
the
cocaine
n
in
j
l
the
prediction
did
not
mention
criminal
action
that
was
corroborated
by
police
observation
and
thus
the
prediction
alone
could
not
justify
reasonable
suspicion
n
four
important
principles
can
be
distilled
from
the
court
s
reliance
on
prediction
in
the
context
of
anonymous
informant
tips
first
the
prediction
must
be
individualized
not
only
to
a
specific
person
but
also
to
ongoing
criminal
activity
of
that
specific
person
second
the
predictive
tip
must
be
corroborated
by
police
observation
which
means
corroboration
of
both
the
specific
individual
and
the
ongoing
crime
n
third
the
predictive
value
of
the
tip
turns
on
the
level
of
particularized
detail
involved
in
the
prediction
fourth
the
timing
of
the
prediction
matters
as
tips
must
be
fresh
to
be
useful
n
these
themes
of
individualization
corroboration
particularized
detail
and
timing
are
central
to
the
fourth
amendment
analysis
for
reasonable
suspicion
known
informant
tips
while
focused
on
anonymous
tips
the
court
in
gates
also
recognized
that
known
informant
tips
or
police
informant
tips
can
sometimes
be
relied
upon
if
there
is
a
demonstrated
history
of
reliability
n
as
the
court
stated
if
for
example
a
particular
informant
is
known
for
the
unusual
reliability
of
his
predictions
of
certain
types
of
criminal
activities
in
a
locality
his
failure
in
a
particular
case
to
thoroughly
set
forth
the
basis
of
his
knowledge
surely
should
not
serve
as
an
absolute
bar
to
a
finding
of
probable
cause
based
on
his
tip
n
in
other
words
established
reliability
can
make
up
for
a
lack
in
basis
of
knowledge
thus
the
analysis
of
veracity
reliability
and
basis
of
knowledge
can
be
more
easily
evaluated
in
known
informant
cases
because
the
reliability
of
the
informant
can
be
more
easily
judged
n
in
so
holding
the
supreme
court
in
gates
and
later
cases
recognized
that
the
strength
or
weakness
of
a
tip
could
be
balanced
by
different
levels
of
direct
corroboration
through
observation
a
weak
unreliable
tip
could
be
bolstered
by
more
corroboration
n
a
strong
reliable
tip
needed
less
corroboration
n
this
balancing
along
a
continuum
of
suspicion
could
be
considered
in
the
totality
analysis
as
will
be
discussed
predictive
policing
may
be
more
analogous
to
a
known
informant
case
assuming
the
predictive
policing
model
is
reliable
it
may
matter
less
that
the
basis
of
knowledge
is
difficult
to
prove
b
profiles
predicting
criminal
activities
based
on
shared
characteristics
another
predictive
fourth
amendment
situation
involves
a
suspicion
that
a
person
sharing
certain
common
characteristics
will
be
committing
a
crime
most
easily
observed
in
profiling
cases
certain
shared
characteristics
or
actions
are
thought
to
predict
criminal
activity
in
certain
areas
drug
courier
profiling
illegal
immigration
profiling
and
group
profiling
have
been
addressed
by
courts
and
they
have
generally
been
acknowledged
as
a
relevant
factor
to
be
considered
in
determining
reasonable
suspicion
n
for
purposes
of
this
section
the
focus
is
on
how
courts
have
analyzed
the
predictive
weight
of
this
generalized
suspicion
in
certain
areas
n
in
addition
this
section
analyzes
the
use
of
pure
probabilistic
analysis
for
reasonable
suspicion
while
courts
are
reluctant
to
consider
pure
probabilities
in
evaluating
the
predictive
value
of
generalized
suspicion
there
has
been
significant
academic
debate
on
the
issue
since
predictive
policing
technology
actually
establishes
a
numerical
probability
that
a
particular
area
will
be
a
place
of
potential
crime
this
line
of
reasoning
will
be
addressed
as
well
profiling
as
prediction
courts
regularly
allow
generalized
suspicion
in
the
form
of
group
based
identifiers
to
justify
a
stop
in
a
robbery
case
individuals
who
fit
the
witness
s
description
of
the
suspect
can
be
stopped
n
on
a
known
drug
corner
individuals
suspected
of
participating
in
a
drug
buy
can
be
stopped
n
at
airports
train
stations
and
buses
people
fitting
general
profiles
for
a
drug
courier
can
be
stopped
and
questioned
n
along
the
border
individuals
who
are
suspected
of
being
illegal
immigrants
can
be
stopped
n
even
the
questionable
practice
of
racial
profiling
can
be
considered
a
series
of
predictive
suppositions
that
lead
to
suspicion
n
as
bernard
harcourt
has
observed
the
fact
is
that
the
police
do
not
profile
on
race
alone
they
also
profile
on
car
models
vehicle
attributes
rental
cars
stickers
location
direction
motorist
appearance
age
etc
the
police
use
these
various
attributes
as
well
as
possibly
race
to
narrow
down
the
pool
of
likely
suspects
n
each
of
these
fourth
amendment
police
citizen
stops
is
based
on
a
predictive
judgment
that
the
individual
will
be
engaging
in
criminal
activity
as
will
be
discussed
courts
have
upheld
the
use
of
these
profiles
against
repeated
fourth
amendment
challenges
n
most
clearly
the
supreme
court
has
referenced
the
drug
courier
profile
in
several
cases
without
directly
addressing
the
constitutionality
of
the
predictive
profile
n
united
states
v
sokolow
recognized
that
a
drug
courier
profile
is
not
an
irrelevant
or
inappropriate
consideration
that
taken
in
the
totality
of
circumstances
can
be
considered
in
a
reasonable
suspicion
determination
n
sokolow
involved
a
young
man
traveling
from
hawaii
to
florida
in
the
summer
with
a
two
day
stay
over
he
purchased
his
tickets

and
with
what
appeared
to
be
a
fake

n
while
none
of
these
factors
alone
were
criminal
or
suspicious
together
they
fit
a
drug

profile
as
established
by
the

acknowledged
the
probabilistic
basis
of
the
profile
but
it
avoided
any
sustained
analysis
of
what
level
of
probability
was
required
n
as
some
critics
have
pointed
out
the
government
failed
to
provide
empirical
proof
for
its
claim
that
the
drug
courier
profile
has
reliable
predictive
value
n
further
others
including
justice
marshall
in
dissent
pointed
out
that
even
if
predictive
in
the
short
run
the
profiles
have
questionable
utility
since
drug
couriers
will
just
change
their
behavior
to
avoid
suspicion
n
in
other
contexts
scholars
have
challenged
the
empirical
basis
of
the
predictive
value
of
profiling
and
found
it
lacking
n
nevertheless
the
current
law
from
the
supreme
court
and
other
courts
recognizes
that
a
predictive
profile
can
be
a
relevant
if
not
controlling
factor
for
reasonable
suspicion
n
the
drug
courier
profile
and
other
profiles
exists
as
an
example
of
predictive
evidence
predicated
on
the
belief
that
the
probability
that
a
person
who
engages
in
the
conduct
highlighted
by
the
profile
is
a
drug
courier
is
higher
than
the
probability
for
the
population
at
large
n
as
judge
charles
becton
has
acknowledged
in
his
article
on
drug
courier
profiling
the
predictive
value
of
profiles
combines
subjective
clinical
predictions
that
are
individualized
to
a
particular
person
with
statistical
predictions
that
are
based
on
general
formulas
with
predetermined
characteristics
of
generic
individuals
n
this
hybrid
model
gives
significant
power
to
the
officers
to
make
not
only
legitimate
individualized
judgments
but
also
illegitimate
arbitrary
judgments
that
can
be
retrospectively
justified
by
the
profile
n
because
the
profile
exists
and
is
generalized
enough
to
be
manipulated
n
it
is
hard
for
courts
to
decide
whether
the
stop
is
legitimate
or
not
n
further
because
the
agents
control
the
profile
they
can
create
a
self
fulfilling
prophesy
by
only
stopping
those
who
fit
the
profile
thus
strengthening
the
seeming
validity
of
the
profile
even
if
it
does
not
match
the
reality
of
who
is
engaged
in
drug
couriering
n
predictive
actions
a
less
defined
category
of
cases
involves
profiling
certain
actions
as
predictors
of
criminal
wrongdoing
flight
evasive
action
furtive
movements
hand
to
hand
exchanges
and
aggressive
driving
can
all
warrant
suspicion
based
on
predictive
judgments
that
such
actions
correspond
with
ongoing
criminal
activity
n
for
situations
in
which
there
is
an
expected
criminal
activity
in
a
particular
location
not
because
of
a
profile
but
because
of
generalizations
from
past
activities
the
group
trait
can
help
to
establish
individualized
suspicion
n
for
example
in
an
area
known
for
weapons
offenses
a
bulge
in
a
waistband
might
be
considered
a
sign
of
carrying
a
gun
n
on
a
known
drug
corner
a
hand
to
hand
exchange
of
money
for
small
objects
might
be
indicative
of
a
drug
deal
while
this
may
stretch
the
concept
of
prediction
a
bit
far
the
reality
is
that
underlying
the
suspicion
is
the
prediction
of
criminal
activity
in
each
of
the
cases
involving
profiling
group
traits
or
generalized
activities
several
principles
can
be
distilled
in
evaluating
reasonable
suspicion
n
first
the
profile
must
be
particularized
enough
to
distinguish
the
profiled
individual
from
the
rest
of
the
public
n
second
the
suspicion
based
on
a
group
trait
must
still
be
corroborated
by
direct
observation
of
the
officer
a
report
that
a
suspect
matched
a
drug
courier
profile
would
not
be
useful
if
the
officers
did
not
corroborate
that
in
fact
the
person
did
match
the
profile
upon
observation
third
suspicion
based
on
general
characteristics
is
limited
by
location
a
drug
courier
profile
would
not
be
useful
in
an
area
with
no
known
drug
problem
such
that
the
presence
of
an
established
drug
problem
should
be
part
of
the
profile
fourth
the
suspicion
must
be
connected
to
an
identifiable
on
going
specific
type
of
crime
it
would
not
be
sufficient
to
have
a
general
criminal
profile
that
covered
all
types
of
crimes
even
if
some
criminals
engage
in
multiple
criminal
acts
n
finally
the
profile
has
an
implicit
temporal
element
in
that
as
criminals
adapt
to
the
profile
the
existing
profiles
must
be
modified
or
abandoned
n
probabilities
as
prediction
a
final
related
concern
may
be
pure
probabilities
as
predictive
judgments
while
the
supreme
court
has
recognized
that
the
question
of
reasonable
suspicion
deals
with
probabilities
it
has
never
relied
on
a
purely
probabilistic
analysis
for
reasonable
suspicion
n
lower
courts
have
upheld
arrest
warrants
on
dna
matches
and
other
forensic
science
matches
based
on
pure
probabilities
but
there
has
never
been
a
supreme
court
case
in
which
the
probability
of
crime
explicitly
has
been
used
as
the
sole
justification
for
a
stop
n
this
does
not
mean
that
the
question
has
not
been
raised
and
addressed
in
the
abstract
as
professor
arnold
loewy
posed
in
an
article
on
the
fourth
amendment
suppose
that
in
a
particular
city
block
of
main
street
between
fourth
and
main
and
fifth
and
main
it
could
be
established
demographically
that
nine
out
of
every
ten
men
on
the
street
between
p
m
and
p
m
are
carrying
drugs
would
that
create
probable
cause
or
reasonable
suspicion
to
arrest
any
man
found
on
that
block
of
main
street
at
the
requisite
hours
the
answer
i
believe
is
no
probable
cause
and
reasonable
suspicion
require
more
than
demographic
probabilities
there
must
be
something
specific
to
the
defendant
to
create
the
probability
as
to
him
perhaps
a
furtive
gesture
an
informant
s
tip
excessive
nervousness
etc
n
other
scholars
might
disagree
and
would
hold
such
a
probability
is
sufficient
to
create
reasonable
suspicion
n
real
world
hypotheticals
can
easily
be
imagined
for
example
what
if
predictive
policing
technology
could
be
improved
such
that
on
a
notorious
drug
corner
the
likelihood
of
a
drug
sale
on
a
particular
day
was
or
higher
would
the
conclusion
that
police
need
more
than
just
the
probability
hold
n
similarly
what
if
the
probabilities
exist
but
are
statistically
quite
low
for
example
in
one
reported
situation
the
predictive
policing
information
provided
to
the
santa
cruz
police
officer
was
that
there
was
a
probability
of
a
crime
happening
that
day
at
a
particular
location
n
how
should
a
court
evaluate
the
predictive
impact
of
this
criminal
forecast
does
a
likelihood
create
reasonable
suspicion
must
there
be
a
determined
numerical
probability
such
low
probabilities
may
well
weigh
against
a
finding
of
reasonable
suspicion
based
on
the
forecast
data
finally
there
exists
the
problem
of
relative
probability
as
i
have
argued
elsewhere
in
the
high
crime
area
context
there
exists
a
denominator
problem
n
just
as
high
is
a
relative
term
that
requires
an
understanding
of
lower
crime
areas
drawing
lines
for
predictive
probabilities
presents
similar
problems
if
one
block
is
forecast
to
have
a
likelihood
of
burglary
and
another
block
a
likelihood
is
the
area
less
persuasive
because
there
are
other
higher
percentage
areas
so
far
courts
have
been
quite
uncomfortable
drawing
such
lines
but
the
questions
remain
c
high
crime
areas
predicting
criminal
activities
in
places
considerations
of
prediction
can
also
be
observed
in
courts
evaluations
of
the
high
crime
area
factor
in
reasonable
suspicion
cases
n
after
illinois
v
wardlow
the
high
crime
nature
of
an
area
can
be
considered
in
evaluating
the
officer
s
objective
suspicion
n
as
predictive
policing
technology
seeks
to
predict
certain
areas
of
higher
potential
criminal
activity
this
line
of
cases
has
clear
relevance
after
about
thirty
years
of
acknowledged
but
imprecise
usage
the
high
crime
area
term
of
art
reached
its
peak
in
wardlow
in
which
it
became
one
of
only
two
factors
considered
in
a
totality
of
circumstances
analysis
for
reasonable
suspicion
n
in
wardlow
high
crime
area
plus
unprovoked
flight
upon
noticing
the
police
resulted
in
reasonable
suspicion
to
stop
mr
wardlow
n
the
facts
in
wardlow
point
out
the
questionable
use
that
prediction
plays
in
many
high
crime
area
cases
in
wardlow
a
narcotics
unit
driving
in
a
caravan
observed
mr
wardlow
holding
a
white
opaque
bag
n
wardlow
was
standing
on
a
downtown
chicago
street
corner
at
about
noon
n
upon
sight
of
the
police
wardlow
ran
and
when
he
was
stopped
a
gun
was
recovered
from
the
bag
n
the
justification
for
the
stop
included
the
flight
in
a
high
crime
area
n
yet
as
was
revealed
in
the
lower
court
proceedings
the
observing
officers
had
no
information
about
that
particular
block
or
wardlow
and
happened
simply
to
be
riding
past
the
block
to
another
location
n
in
addition
the
proof
that
the
area
was
in
fact
a
high
narcotics
area
was
belied
by
the
crime
statistics
presented
to
the
courts
including
the
supreme
court
which
did
not
include
any
narcotics
arrest
data
n
while
the
area
in
question
chicago
s
district
was
a
low
income
area
known
for
violent
crimes
how
that
information
factored
into
a
predictive
judgment
about
a
man
holding
a
bag
in
the
afternoon
is
not
immediately
clear
n
more
relevantly
even
if
it
could
be
assumed
that
the
area
was
objectively
a
high
crime
area
it
is
not
clear
how
that
information
would
help
predict
that
mr
wardlow
as
opposed
to
any
one
of
the
people
who
lived
in
the
district
was
committing
a
crime
or
more
specifically
a
narcotics
crime
n
the
prediction
of
a
higher
level
of
criminal
activity
or
even
a
higher
level
of
narcotics
activity
simply
was
not
corroborated
by
the
actual
observation
in
this
situation
the
high
crime
area
label
is
more
of
a
retrospective
justification
for
a
stop
than
a
predictive
factor
n
the
court
s
flawed
reasoning
in
wardlow
might
be
unremarkable
except
that
there
have
been
thousands
of
post
wardlow
cases
that
have
relied
on
the
high
crime
area
designation
to
determine
reasonable
suspicion
n
while
a
handful
of
cases
have
explicitly
wrestled
with
the
predictive
value
of
this
label
most
have
simply
applied
it
without
considering
whether
it
offers
any
predictive
weight
n
numerous
judges
and
scholars
have
critiqued
the
use
of
the
high
crime
area
designation
almost
since
its
creation
n
critics
point
to
its
discriminatory
effect
on
low
income
areas
and
communities
of
color
n
its
use
has
raised
questions
of
infringements
on
civil
liberties
as
well
as
the
stigmatizing
effect
on
economic
development
and
community
police
relations
n
some
scholars
myself
included
have
suggested
retiring
the
high
crime
area
term
as
an
inexact
overly
general
term
of
art
that
is
inconsistent
with
the
existing
crime
mapping
technology
and
the
supreme
court
s
emphasis
on
particularized
suspicion
n
while
courts
routinely
use
the
term
high
crime
area
in
considering
the
totality
of
circumstances
to
support
reasonable
suspicion
there
is
less
emphasis
on
why
that
information
is
relevant
to
help
predict
a
particular
crime
as
stated
the
high
crime
area
in
wardlow
chicago
s
district
had
a
population
of
n
the
predictive
value
for
an
individual
among
that
number
of
people
is
negligible
similarly
the
lack
of
particularized
focus
on
the
type
of
crime
weakens
the
predictive
value
of
the
information
had
the
high
crime
area
been
localized
to
a
particular
block
or
a
particular
type
of
crime
the
value
of
the
predictive
information
would
be
more
relevant
some
federal
and
state
courts
have
required
this
nexus
between
a
particularized
area
crime
time
and
the
observations
of
the
police
officer
n
in
addition
most
of
the
current
predictive
policing
forecasting
programs
seem
to
embrace
the
importance
of
a
narrowly
tailored
area
with
a
focus
on
particular
crime
type
and
a
close
temporal
proximity
n
as
will
be
discussed
later
the
advent
of
predictive
policing
may
in
fact
signal
the
end
of
a
generalized
high
crime
area
analysis
by
replacing
it
with
more
precise
technology
and
terminology
d
principles
of
prediction
and
reasonable
suspicion
from
the
above
summary
of
fourth
amendment
cases
the
same
themes
emerge
to
analyze
reasonable
suspicion
first
no
matter
the
type
of
predictive
information
tip
profile
or
high
crime
area
the
information
alone
is
never
enough
to
control
the
reasonable
suspicion
analysis
in
every
case
this
information
is
considered
relevant
to
the
totality
of
circumstances
but
must
be
corroborated
by
direct
police
observation
second
the
predictive
information
must
be
particularized
to
a
person
a
profile
or
a
place
in
a
way
that
directly
connects
the
suspected
crime
to
the
suspected
person
profile
or
place
n
third
the
predictive
information
must
provide
sufficient
detail
to
identify
or
separate
the
targeted
person
profile
or
place
from
others
not
so
targeted
n
finally
the
predictive
value
of
the
information
declines
over
time
such
that
predictive
information
must
be
acted
on
quickly
or
be
lost
each
of
these
principles
informs
the
discussion
of
predictive
policing
and
reasonable
suspicion
the
subject
of
part
iii
iii
predictive
policing
and
reasonable
suspicion
if
crime
locations
can
be
predicted
and
the
current
fourth
amendment
doctrine
embraces
predictive
judgments
then
what
to
make
of
predictive
policing
certainly
an
accurate
prediction
of
a
particular
crime
in
a
specific
location
should
have
some
effect
on
police
officers
and
courts
whether
it
be
a
computer
algorithm
or
criminological
theory
the
identification
of
environmental
vulnerabilities
that
could
be
exploited
by
criminals
is
a
reasonable
factor
to
consider
in
evaluating
suspicious
activity
in
that
area
the
question
analyzed
in
this
part
is
how
to
apply
current
fourth
amendment
concepts
to
this
new
technological
innovation
two
basic
questions
exist
for
any
court
addressing
the
effect
of
predictive
policing
on
the
reasonable
suspicion
analysis
first
assuming
an
accurate
and
reliable
system
is
this
predictive
forecast
appropriate
to
consider
in
the
totality
of
circumstances
second
if
so
how
does
a
court
analyze
the
issues
under
the
fourth
amendment
the
short
answer
to
the
first
question
is
that
it
is
too
soon
to
evaluate
the
near
repeat
theories
and
the
risk
terrain
models
among
other
variations
are
only
now
being
developed
and
refined
n
the
underlying
theories
of
environmental
vulnerabilities
make
logical
sense
but
whether
that
logic
translates
into
accurate
crime
forecasts
will
take
several
years
to
determine
further
how
courts
interpret
these
predictive
forecasts
within
the
current
fourth
amendment
structure
may
in
fact
shape
the
technologies
judicial
demands
for
standards
of
precision
probabilities
and
procedures
will
likely
require
the
predictive
technologies
to
evolve
and
improve
n
lines
will
have
to
be
drawn
about
probabilities
and
the
predictive
reliability
of
the
models
tested
before
this
issue
of
legitimacy
is
resolved
however
a
predictive
policing
case
may
reach
a
trial
court
and
that
court
will
have
to
address
the
issue
using
the
existing
reasonable
suspicion
doctrine
as
to
the
second
question
the
existing
fourth
amendment
analogies
are
imperfect
but
informative
in
determining
how
courts
might
address
the
effect
of
predictive
policing
technologies
in
a
reasonable
suspicion
determination
as
detailed
below
a
careful
evaluation
of
the
available
analogies
cautions
against
adopting
any
of
them
as
models
for
examining
predictive
policing
at
the
same
time
revealingly
each
of
the
analogies
leads
to
the
same
ultimate
conclusion
predictive
policing
technologies
if
accurate
and
reliable
can
add
to
the
totality
of
circumstances
for
reasonable
suspicion
and
will
have
a
direct
effect
on
fourth
amendment
liberties
while
these
predictions
cannot
alone
establish
reasonable
suspicion
or
probable
cause
they
may
change
the
balance
of
suspicion
in
the
forecasted
areas
a
predictive
policing
as
a
data
driven
tip
as
examined
earlier
one
possible
fourth
amendment
analogy
for
predictive
policing
is
the
tip
cases
in
this
model
predictive
policing
technologies
provide
a
non
specific
tip
about
a
type
of
crime
in
a
particular
area
predictive
policing
as
an
anonymous
or
informant
tip
the
parallels
in
considering
predictive
policing
as
an
anonymous
or
informant
tip
are
obvious
and
yet
imprecise
n
unlike
a
tip
predictive
policing
includes
no
personal
knowledge
in
its
forecast
of
potential
criminal
activity
this
is
an
important
distinction
that
removes
predictive
policing
from
the
reasoning
of
draper
white
and
even
gates
in
that
there
is
no
inside
information
that
can
help
evaluate
the
reliability
of
the
tip
n
further
a
predictive
policing
tip
is
not
particularized
to
an
individual
while
a
particular
block
might
be
identified
as
being
the
location
of
a
particular
type
of
crime
the
algorithms
as
currently
used
are
no
help
in
identifying
particular
persons
suspected
thus
the
core
logic
of
the
tip
cases
falls
away
because
predictive
policing
does
not
provide
personal
knowledge
about
an
ongoing
crime
or
particularized
identification
of
the
suspect
involved
it
cannot
support
the
weight
of
reasonable
suspicion
n
as
such
if
considered
simply
like
a
tip
a
predictive
policing
forecast
should
not
support
reasonable
suspicion
to
stop
anyone
on
the
block
just
because
there
might
be
a
heightened
level
of
potential
criminal
activity
in
the

n
first
such
a

is
too
generalized
lacking
the
detail
required
in

to
identify
a

it
does
not
identify

actual

crime
as

n
third
there
is
no
corroboration
as
required
by
almost
all
the

cases
n
for

would
need
more
than
just
the
generalized
tip
including
substantial
direct
corroborative
observation
linking
the
tip
to
the
individual
observed
predictive
policing
as
a
tip
about
an
area
the
more
difficult
and
more
relevant
example
for
predictive
policing
focuses
on
when
a
known
informant
provides
a
tip
about
an
area
or
location
for
example
known
informant
tips
about
drug
houses
drug
corners
or
general
areas
of
criminal
activity
are
commonplace
in
law
enforcement
n
in
these
cases
officers
responding
to
those
identified
areas
have
been
allowed
to
rely
on
the
non
specific
predictive
tip
about
an
area
in
their
reasonable
suspicion
calculus
n
predictive
policing
then
can
be
considered
like
a
reliable
tip
of
generalized
information
about
an
area
n
two
points
need
to
be
emphasized
about
this
second
type
of
generalized
tip
first
traditional
application
of
the
totality
of
circumstances
test
does
not
quite
fit
n
the
reason
why
police
might
trust
a
known
informant
s
prediction
of
criminal
activity
is
not
the
same
as
the
reason
one
might
trust
a
computer
program
s
prediction
of
criminal
activity
while
reliability
is
key
to
both
it
is
a
different
reliability
on
one
hand
an
objective
well
functioning
computer
program
seems
more
reliable
than
your
typical
police
informant
the
computer
has
no
biases
no
past
bad
acts
and
no
agendas
on
the
other
hand
the
information
in
the
computer
is
generalized
and
that
fact
makes
it
less
reliable
by
analogy
if
the
human
informant
stated
that
based
on
past
experience
with
car
thefts
the
informant
has
a
general
feeling
that
a
car
theft
would
occur
at
a
location
most
courts
would
not
think
this
feeling
would
be
sufficient
for
reasonable
suspicion
n
even
if
the
informant
explained
that
the
past
experiences
were
regular
recorded
and
accurate
the
inference
that
one
could
generalize
from
that
experience
to
future
crimes
is
weak
most
courts
would
want
more
than
past
experiences
requiring
something
particular
and
detailed
about
this
area
now
again
the
reliability
turns
on
the
particularized
insight
about
a
specific
area
at
a
specific
time
a
generalized
sense
standing
alone
would
not
be
enough
while
insufficient
on
its
own
this
type
of
reliable
known
informant
tip
if
corroborated
might
result
in
reasonable
suspicion
the
key
remains
the
observations
that
corroborate
the
tip
similar
to
a
police
informant
who
provides
reliable
if
generalized
suspicion
about
a
drug
house
or
street
corner
the
information
can
color
what
a
reasonable
officer
observes
even
if
it
cannot
be
reasonable
suspicion
in
itself
in
addition
because
courts
have
recognized
that
a
reliable
tip
may
require
less
corroboration
than
an
anonymous
tip
n
if
considered
more
like
a
reliable
informant
tip
about
an
area
then
police
may
actually
need
less
corroboration
in
their
observations
this
conclusion
presents
a
significant
change
in
how
courts
could
apply
the
reasonable
suspicion
standard
it
means
that
a
computer
algorithm
could
alter
fourth
amendment
protections
in
certain
forecast
locations
returning
to
the
parking
garage
scenario
at
the
beginning
of
this
article
the
two
women
could
not
have
been
stopped
on
reasonable
suspicion
but
for
the
predictive
element
of
the
analysis
merely
looking
into
car
windows
is
not
sufficient
activity
to
warrant
the
reasonable
belief
that
criminal
activity
is
afoot
however
with
a
predicted
computer
tip
of
car
theft
it
might
be
analyzed
carefully
this
conclusion
means
that
the
potential
for
crime
in
an
area
can
alter
the
reasonable
suspicion
analysis
for
courts
assuming
the
reliability
and
accuracy
of
the
prediction
a
data
driven
tip
may
be
appropriate
to
factor
into
the
reasonable
suspicion
analysis
while
corroboration
is
still
required
predictive
policing
tips
may
require
less
corroboration
than
other
tips
and
may
affect
the
fourth
amendment
analysis
b
predictive
policing
as
profiling
in
an
area
of
forecast
crime
a
second
fourth
amendment
analogy
to
consider
is
predictive
policing
as
a
form
of
profiling
in
this
analogy
predictive
policing
technologies
would
forecast
a
profiled
crime
in
a
certain
geographic
area
such
that
anyone
in
the
area
who
acted
in
conformity
with
certain
recognizable
characteristics
could
be
stopped
based
on
reasonable
suspicion
whether
considered
profiling
or
probabilistic
suspicion
of
activities
in
an
area
the
supreme
court
s
acceptance
of
profiling
helps
frame
the
analysis
n
under
current
law
profiles
of
suspected
criminal
activity
in
particular
locations
for
specific
crimes
appear
to
be
constitutional
n
the
focus
here
is
on
the
actions
or
activities
of
individuals
that
match
actions
or
activities
generally
considered
to
be
indicative
of
criminal
activity
the
profile
includes
considerations
of
activity
place
and
general
characteristics
for
example
in
a
residential
neighborhood
with
a
burglary
problem
a
burglar
profile
could
be
created
so
that
otherwise
innocent
actions
like
loitering
with
bags
large
enough
to
carry
contraband
tools
ropes
and
gloves
in
warm
weather
could
be
considered
suspicious
someone
acting
like
a
burglar
on
a
particular
block
within
a
particular
time
frame
would
then
be
considered
the
same
as
someone
acting
like
a
drug
courier
arriving
from
a
known
source
city
for
drugs
the
result
would
be
that
profiles
of
generalized
criminal
activities
would
be
used
to
justify
stops
of
individual
suspects
if
they
happen
to
be
in
a
predicted
area
of
crime
n
profiling
suspicious
activities
is
not
new
and
it
mirrors
the
daily
practice
of
police
officers
who
informally
have
an
idea
of
stereotypical
criminal
activity
n
labeling
it
a
profile
or
merely
good
police
work
may
not
be
significant
what
is
significant
is
that
the
predictive
policing
forecast
in
combination
with
this
traditional
police
observation
will
change
the
fourth
amendment
calculus
for
reasonable
suspicion
for
example
in
one
hypothetical
case
a
police
officer
sees
a
man
loitering
on
a
corner
with
a
large
duffle
bag
looking
at
a
house
under
these
limited
facts
a
stop
based
on
reasonable
suspicion
would
be
difficult
to
justify
there
is
nothing
objectively
criminal
about
waiting
with
a
bag
even
if
the
officer
could
say
that
burglars
carry
bags
and
burglars
steal
from
houses
there
is
not
a
fit
with
anything
criminal
this
man
has
done
yet
imagine
in
a
second
hypothetical
case
a
police
officer
is
informed
that
a
specific
city
block
has
had
a
rash
of
home
burglaries
the
predictive
policing
algorithm
predicts
that
there
is
a
statistical
likelihood
of
another
burglary
on
that
block
at
this
time
police
are
told
to
be
on
the
lookout
for
burglars
and
are
given
an
appropriate
profile
in
this
second
case
a
stop
based
on
reasonable
suspicion
would
likely
be
upheld
notice
that
the
actions
of
the
man
have
not
changed
at
all
objectively
what
the
suspect
has
done
is
no
more
or
less
suspicious
or
criminal
yet
the
prediction
in
combination
with
a
profile
of
generalized
criminal
activity
can
change
the
constitutional
analysis
of
the
two
changed
elements
in
the
analysis
the
prediction
and
the
profile
arguably
the
profile
is
more
important
from
a
purely
probabilistic
model
even
if
the
computer
model
said
that
there
was
a
very
significant
likelihood
of
a
burglary
in
a
particular
block
if
all
the
police
officer
saw
was
a
man
on
the
street
no
bag
no
looking
at
the
house
then
even
a
very
high
probability
of
crime
would
not
be
enough
to
justify
a
stop
the
profile
because
it
serves
the
corroborating
function
of
linking
the
prediction
to
the
individual
suspect
matters
more
this
insight
again
reveals
a
common
theme
in
the
fourth
amendment
analogies
corroboration
of
individual
actions
is
required
for
reasonable
suspicion
n
a
profile
of
a
burglar
is
insufficient
standing
alone
a
prediction
of
a
burglary
is
insufficient
standing
alone
but
together
a
court
might
find
that
under
a
totality
of
circumstances
this
combination
could
be
sufficient
for
reasonable
suspicion
c
predictive
policing
as
a
micro
high
crime
area
the
final
fourth
amendment
analogy
is
to
consider
predictive
policing
as
creating
a
micro
high
crime
area
as
discussed
earlier
location
in
a
high
crime
area
is
an
accepted
factor
in
the
reasonable
suspicion
analysis
n
under
wardlow
and
its
progeny
the
ability
to
predict
a
specific
area
of
heightened
potential
criminal
activity
appears
to
directly
impact
the
reasonable
suspicion
analysis
n
for
example
as
practiced
in
los
angeles
and
santa
cruz
the
predictive
policing
model
has
targeted
three
specific
types
of
property
crime
and
then
focused
police
attention
on
by
foot
areas
n
assuming
that
the
predictive
analysis
is
based
on
past
crimes
and
established
crime
patterns
those
micro
areas
would
easily
fall
within
the
supreme
court
s
understanding
of
a
high
crime
area
n
in
fact
those
areas
small
in
size
responsive
to
immediate
crime
patterns
and
particularized
to
a
type
of
crime
are
superior
to
the
rather
amorphous
definition
of
a
high
crime
area
previously
accepted
by
the
courts
in
analyzing
reasonable
suspicion
there
seems
to
be
little
reason
why
an
officer
should
not
consider
the
predictive
information
he
or
she
has
been
given
before
patrolling
the
streets
n
the
information
is
objective
verifiable
and
particularized
to
a
certain
area
about
a
certain
crime
and
even
temporally
relevant
a
court
analyzing
the
reasonableness
of
the
officer
s
suspicion
based
on
objective
standards
should
take
this
information
into
account
to
return
to
our
burglar
example
an
officer
who
stops
the
man
standing
with
the
bag
outside
the
house
in
part
because
it
was
a
predicted
high
burglary
block
is
making
a
reasonable
decision
based
on
the
available
information
notice
however
again
the
critical
fact
in
the
argument
is
that
there
is
a
corroborative
observation
that
matches
the
predicted
forecast
n
if
the
predictive
policing
forecast
suggested
an
area
with
a
heightened
pattern
of
residential
burglary
and
the
police
officer
went
to
the
area
and
observed
a
hand
to
hand
transaction
suggestive
but
not
conclusive
of
a
drug
deal
the
predictive
information
would
be
irrelevant
for
the
predictive
technology
to
add
any
value
to
the
totality
of
circumstances
test
there
must
be
a
nexus
between
prediction
crime
and
observed
activity
a
disconnect
in
any
of
those
factors
removes
the
value
of
the
prediction
for
reasonable
suspicion
finally
the
predicted
area
must
be
limited
in
size
for
example
if
the
predicted
area
covered
an
entire
neighborhood
or
police
district
then
the
predictive
relevance
of
a
man
holding
a
bag
outside
a
house
is
weakened
the
chosen
metric
of
a
by
foot
area
appears
workable
and
appropriate
time
is
also
relevant
if
for
example
there
had
not
been
a
burglary
in
six
months
the
predictive
value
of
the
prediction
is
minimal
n
particularized
place
and
time
remains
critical
to
a
useful
high
crime
area
analogy
in
many
ways
predictive
policing
has
the
potential
to
add
some
discipline
to
the
rather
protean
high
crime
area
term
predicted
areas
may
no
longer
be
generic
high
crime
areas
encompassing
tens
of
thousands
of
residents
as
in
wardlow
but
single
blocks
with
information
about
particular
crimes
with
this
available
technology
courts
may
no
longer
need
to
rely
on
the
generalized
high
crime
area
terminology
when
more
particularized
and
more
relevant
information
is
available
as
will
be
discussed
in
the
next
section
the
precision
of
the
technology
may
in
fact
provide
more
protection
for
citizens
in
broadly
defined
high
crime
areas
while
at
the
same
time
presenting
difficulties
for
law
enforcement
that
has
gotten
used
to
the
generic
and
easily
adaptable
term
d
the
future
of
predictive
policing
and
reasonable
suspicion
a
police
stop
based
on
a
predictive
policing
forecast
soon
will
be
in
front
of
a
trial
court
in
a
motion
to
suppress
evidence
the
court
will
need
to
consider
the
effect
of
predictive
policing
on
the
fourth
amendment
the
court
will
also
have
to
graft
existing
fourth
amendment
caselaw
on
this
new
technology
while
courts
may
take
different
approaches
to
the
question
no
matter
the
doctrinal
analogy
chosen
the
result
is
the
same
predictive
policing
will
impact
the
reasonable
suspicion
calculus
by
becoming
a
factor
within
the
totality
of
circumstances
test
while
never
enough
alone
with
some
relevant
corroboration
a
predictive
tip
will
serve
as
the
basis
of
a
constitutional
stop
timing
will
matter
as
the
predictive
value
of
the
information
decays
with
time
the
particularized
nexus
will
also
matter
as
the
predicted
forecast
must
match
the
observed
actions
yet
as
demonstrated
the
weight
of
predictive
policing
in
the
totality
has
the
potential
to
be
significant
the
fact
that
predictive
policing
forecasts
can
affect
constitutional
rights
may
be
more
of
a
symptom
of
the
malleability
of
the
reasonable
suspicion
doctrine
rather
than
signifying
any
great
change
that
prediction
offers
n
as
has
been
discussed
in
other
contexts
the
reasonable
suspicion
standard
offers
less
protection
than
perhaps
originally
designed
and
it
has
been
further
eroded
with
an
ever
evolving
totality
of
circumstances
test
n
yet
the
fact
that
a
law
enforcement
designed
technology
can
alter
liberty
protections
in
certain
areas
raises
the
question
of
whether
the
supreme
court
s
reasonable
suspicion
test
is
being
exploited
if
police
can
define
away
certain
areas
using
computer
algorithms
or
define
generalized
activities
as
immediately
suspicious
in
certain
areas
it
becomes
quite
easy
to
escape
what
had
been
a
limiting
restriction
on
police
officers
n
this
speaks
less
to
the
police
and
prosecutors
that
are
fighting
crime
within
the
existing
legal
doctrine
than
to
the
doctrine
itself
which
may
need
a
counterweight
to
protect
liberty
interests
in
all
areas
including
areas
of
predicted
criminal
activity
iv
future
concerns
with
predictive
policing
predictive
policing
is
new
and
evolving
definitions
validation
studies
and
its
effectiveness
will
be
evaluated
as
the
technology
matures
its
effect
on
the
fourth
amendment
may
evolve
as
well
as
courts
and
litigants
must
pick
among
the
existing
reasonable
suspicion
precedents
for
suitable
analogies
for
analysis
its
impact
may
in
fact
cause
courts
to
rethink
the
current
overly
flexible
approach
to
reasonable
suspicion
based
on
a
concern
that
this
technology
could
be
manipulated
or
used
in
a
discriminatory
manner
this
part
addresses
some
of
the
main
concerns
that
courts
litigants
and
predictive
policing
supporters
should
consider
in
analyzing
the
constitutional
impact
of
predictive
policing
the
focus
here
again
is
on
the
fourth
amendment
concerns
not
the
effectiveness
of
the
technology
from
a
law
enforcement
perspective
the
focus
is
also
on
predictive
technologies
centered
on
the
property
based
near
repeat
phenomenon
and
not
the
risk
terrain
model
because
the
former
has
actually
been
implemented
in
law
enforcement
practice
a
understanding
the
logic
of
why
prediction
works
and
its
limits
central
to
the
use
of
predictive
policing
technologies
in
fourth
amendment
cases
must
be
an
understanding
of
why
prediction
works
predictive
algorithms
are
not
magic
boxes
that
divine
future
crime
but
instead
probability
models
of
future
events
based
on
current
environmental
vulnerabilities
creators
of
those
algorithms
understand
that
the
limitations
of
the
predictions
rest
in
the
limitations
of
the
data
and
the
conclusions
drawn
from
the
data
n
early
adopters
of
predictive
policing
technologies
have
focused
primarily
on
property
crimes
for
a
good
reason
the
accumulated
research
data
supports
the
near
repeat
effect
for
some
property
based
crimes
and
not
for
other
crimes
n
if
burglaries
are
contagious
then
it
makes
sense
to
focus
police
efforts
near
the
original
burglary
if
a
particular
parking
lot
generates
a
high
volume
of
car
thefts
it
makes
sense
to
focus
resources
at
that
location
however
the
reason
there
will
be
a
future
crime
is
not
that
there
was
a
past
crime
instead
the
reason
there
will
be
a
future
crime
is
that
the
environmental
vulnerability
that
encouraged
the
first
crime
is
still
unaddressed
this
insight
is
critical
to
incorporate
into
the
reasonable
suspicion
analysis
prediction
should
be
irrelevant
if
the
underlying
vulnerability
has
been
remediated
litigants
and
courts
must
understand
these
limitations
for
example
if
a
particular
block
suffers
a
statistically
high
number
of
car
thefts
over
a
month
period
a
predictive
model
might
forecast
that
the
same
block
will
be
the
locus
of
a
subsequent
theft
blind
adherence
to
the
predictive
forecast
might
mean
that
an
individual
observed
with
a
screwdriver
on
that
block
in
combination
with
the
forecast
might
result
in
reasonable
suspicion
for
a
stop
however
if
prior
to
the
stop
police
had
arrested
the
gang
responsible
for
all
the
prior
car
thefts
improved
the
lighting
in
the
area
and
posted
police
on
the
street
reliance
on
the
prediction
should
be
irrelevant
n
the
reason
why
the
future
crime
is
predicted
to
happen
no
longer
holds
incorporating
predictive
policing
into
the
reasonable
suspicion
analysis
of
the
court
then
would
not
be
appropriate
this
insight
will
require
litigants
challenging
a
predictive
policing
stop
to
understand
the
logic
of
predictive
policing
technologies
legal
motions
may
have
to
be
filed
to
open
up
the
data
or
to
challenge
the
underlying
computer
models
it
requires
courts
to
see
the
prediction
as
a
comment
on
the
environmental
vulnerabilities
that
generate
crime
it
also
means
that
the
environment
must
remain
unchanged
or
uncorrected
such
that
the
same
vulnerability
exists
during
the
time
of
prediction
as
can
be
observed
timing
is
important
the
near
repeat
theory
incorporates
a
natural
decay
such
that
the
prediction
is
only
valid
for
a
short
time
span
one
or
two
weeks
n
this
finding
reveals
the
importance
of
understanding
the
environmental
factors
over
time
those
factors
change
and
thus
cannot
be
the
unthinking
basis
for
a
valid
prediction
the
crime
type
is
also
important
programs
like
risk
terrain
modeling
that
model
violent
crimes
present
different
challenges
than
the
near
repeat
phenomenon
for
property
crimes
violent
crimes
such
as
robbery
might
correlate
with
environmental
factors
isolation
darkness
escape
routes
reasons
for
being
on
the
street
while
violent
crimes
such
as
shooting
correlate
with
very
different
factors
revenge
gangs
turf
borders
computer
algorithms
that
predict
these
latter
types
of
crimes
must
be
based
on
very
different
theories
of
crime
and
place
and
courts
that
rely
on
these
predictions
must
understand
the
differences
the
early
adopters
of
predictive
policing
have
taken
a
careful
approach
to
considering
the
effects
of
their
experiments
admirably
the
coordinators
of
the
study
at
the
lapd
have
looked
to
conduct
validated
studies
with
blind
testing
and
very
precise
areas
as
their
model
n
researchers
developing
rtm
have
also
been
intentional
in
recording
analyzing
and
limiting
their
studies
in
a
scientific
manner
n
the
initial
tests
while
successful
have
been
tempered
with
an
understanding
that
the
methods
are
experimental
and
the
conclusions
restrained
while
there
is
tremendous
interest
in
expanding
the
technology
the
current
predictive
policing
systems
are
being
conducted
in
a
careful
reflective
and
scientific
manner
n
whether
this
caution
will
remain
as
other
police
departments
adopt
the
technology
is
unclear
further
whether
new
adopters
or
courts
recognize
the
limitations
and
logic
of
the
technologies
is
uncertain
a
real
concern
is
that
the
allure
of
a
magic
black
box
that
can
predict
crime
will
become
divorced
from
the
underlying
logic
of
why
the
predictions
work
in
the
first
place
in
fact
as
can
be
seen
in
a
review
of
part
iii
of
this
article
there
is
little
room
in
the
fourth
amendment
legal
analysis
to
argue
the
underlying
principles
of
why
prediction
works
by
the
time
courts
are
addressing
the
issue
a
police
officer
will
have
acted
on
predictive
information
and
arrested
an
individual
blind
reliance
on
the
forecast
divorced
from
the
reason
for
the
forecast
may
lead
to
inappropriate
reliance
on
the
technology
in
addition
to
finding
the
proper
fourth
amendment
analogy
or
articulating
the
reasonable
suspicion
factors
courts
will
have
to
focus
on
why
certain
environmental
factors
might
contribute
to
future
crime
or
why
the
absence
of
those
environmental
vulnerabilities
could
undermine
the
logic
of
the
algorithm
further
courts
will
need
to
remember
that
predictive
policing
predicts
the
potentiality
of
a
crime
and
not
the
crime
itself
and
thus
the
true
test
will
be
the
observation
of
actual
corroborative
criminal
activity
n
keeping
these
issues
in
the
forefront
of
any
reasonable
suspicion
determination
is
an
important
responsibility
for
litigants
and
courts
b
ensuring
reliability
accuracy
and
transparency
underlying
the
question
of
legitimacy
rests
the
foundational
question
of
whether
predictive
policing
technologies
are
reliable
and
accurate
any
data
driven
policing
system
is
only
as
good
as
the
data
involved
n
if
the
data
collection
recording
analysis
or
retention
is
flawed
then
the
entire
system
is
called
into
question
n
prior
experience
with
data
driven
crime
mapping
systems
presents
several
cautionary
lessons
for
the
future
of
predictive
policing
n
reliability
and
accuracy
the
first
concern
rests
on
the
data
itself
predictive
policing
is
based
in
large
measure
on
extrapolations
from
past
crime
data
however
as
has
been
well
studied
not
all
crime
is
reported
not
all
crime
is
recorded
and
thus
not
all
crime
is
included
in
crime
databases
to
be
used
for
predictions
n
while
most
murders
are
reported
not
all
automobile
thefts
petty
thefts
or
domestic
violence
assaults
are
reported
n
further
in
areas
of
high
crime
among
groups
of
violent
criminals
not
all
retaliatory
acts
are
reported
thus
the
precision
assumed
in
a
statistical
probability
may
not
reflect
the
accurate
crime
numbers
current
predictive
policing
has
focused
on
burglary
and
car
theft
two
crimes
that
tend
to
be
reported
more
regularly
perhaps
due
to
the
fixed
nature
of
the
property
or
the
insurance
incentives
to
report
predictive
numbers
for
those
types
of
crimes
might
be
more
accurate
however
as
predictions
move
toward
more
violent
crimes
or
gang
crime
the
underlying
reporting
percentages
need
to
be
reexamined
reporting
of
crimes
must
also
result
in
recording
of
crimes
a
police
report
does
not
get
entered
into
the
system
unless
the
police
officer
records
it
accurately
in
terms
of
date
location
crime
type
and
time
n
this
means
police
paperwork
must
be
accurate
and
processes
must
be
in
place
to
make
sure
that
all
reported
crimes
are
entered
into
the
system
this
emphasis
on
accuracy
is
not
a
speculative
concern
for
example
one
of
the
early
adopters
of
predictive
policing
was
the
memphis
police
department
which
saw
immediate
success
with
its
blue
c
r
u
s
h
crime
reduction
using
statistical
history
program
n
like
many
predictive
policing
tactics
the
blue
c
r
u
s
h
system
was
heralded
as
a
revolutionary
breakthrough
that
reduced
the
crime
rate
in
the
city
of
memphis
n
however
in
an
internal
governmental
audit
discovered
the
existence
of
police
memos
in
which
potential
crimes
were
recorded
but
not
counted
in
the
crime
statistics
this
trove
of
documents
called
into
question
the
scope
of
the
crime
reduction
as
many
potential
crimes
were
simply
not
inputted
into
the
computer
system
n
while
the
city
audit
is
ongoing
it
may
mean
an
upward
revision
in
the
crime
statistics
and
questions
for
a
much
heralded
crime
prevention
program
n
the
imprecision
of
crime
reporting
and
recording
does
not
simply
affect
the
accuracy
of
the
data
but
the
underlying
focus
of
resources
for
law
enforcement
n
if
financial
fraud
or
high
end
drug
dealing
is
underreported
compared
to
car
thefts
then
a
system
based
on
predictive
policing
and
data
will
focus
on
the
latter
at
the
expense
of
the
former
one
might
even
be
able
to
predict
that
certain
areas
would
be
the
site
of
these
crimes
such
as
wall
street
or
certain
university
campuses
but
if
not
reported
the
predictive
analysis
will
never
incorporate
this
data
in
addition
to
accurate
reporting
there
also
must
be
timely
analysis
one
of
the
lessons
of
the
crime
and
place
studies
is
that
the
near
repeat
effect
decays
quite
rapidly
n
crime
reports
must
be
inputted
into
the
systems
in
a
timely
enough
fashion
to
be
useful
to
officers
on
the
street
this
means
a
move
to
more
real
time
reporting
such
that
the
predictive
numbers
will
change
at
least
weekly
if
not
daily
or
hourly
finally
the
algorithms
chosen
to
forecast
crimes
must
be
validated
tested
and
submitted
for
outside
study
in
general
academic
scholars
have
developed
these
algorithms
from
experiments
independent
of
the
world
of
law
enforcement
n
as
academics
are
versed
in
the
scientific
method
scholars
expect
testing
and
peer
validation
this
tradition
however
may
run
into
tension
with
traditional
law
enforcement
practices
of
maintaining
control
and
secrecy
over
tactical
operations
further
some
of
the
predictive
policing
programs
are
proprietary
and
opening
them
for
study
would
decrease
the
competitive
advantage
of
those
institutions
or
companies
that
own
the
programs
n
adopters
of
predictive
policing
technologies
will
have
to
balance
the
utility
of
tactical
secrecy
with
the
reality
that
courts
and
litigants
will
be
seeking
to
evaluate
the
reliability
of
the
programs
only
in
this
way
will
the
legitimacy
of
the
technology
be
accepted
for
use
in
courts
transparency
related
to
the
internal
data
collection
and
analysis
is
the
concern
of
how
that
information
gets
translated
to
courts
and
litigants
in
a
court
proceeding
predictive
policing
programs
will
need
to
be
explained
to
courts
in
a
way
that
accurately
addresses
concerns
with
data
collection
analysis
and
the
creation
of
the
probabilities
after
all
it
will
be
a
judge
that
agrees
or
disagrees
with
the
reliability
of
the
information
before
it
can
be
included
in
the
totality
of
circumstances
calculus
one
can
easily
imagine
the
situation
described
earlier
from
santa
cruz
in
which
a
police
officer
explains
to
the
court
that
at
roll
call
he
was
informed
that
a
particular
block
had
a
probability
of
a
car
theft
for
a
particular
time
and
that
is
why
he
stopped
a
suspect
near
a
car
n
the
questions
may
include
where
did
that
probability
number
come
from
how
accurate
is
it
how
timely
how
reliable
adopters
of
the
new
technologies
will
need
to
have
answers
that
will
satisfy
the
courts
in
a
contested
hearing
metrics
for
evaluation
will
need
to
be
created
and
then
it
will
be
up
to
courts
to
address
the
line
drawing
on
a
case
by
case
basis
this
type
of
questioning
could
probably
be
addressed
outside
the
courtroom
if
mechanisms
of
accountability
and
transparency
were
built
into
the
predictive
policing
systems
independent
oversight
boards
audits
and
other
methods
to
test
and
retest
the
data
collection
and
analysis
may
be
needed
n
regulations
standards
and
best
practices
will
have
to
be
developed
and
disseminated
litigants
will
need
to
know
about
internal
processes
and
be
able
to
compare
them
to
other
systems
in
other
jurisdictions
this
will
mean
allowing
access
into
the
systems
as
well
as
limiting
some
of
the
proprietary
or
secrecy
arguments
mentioned
above
all
of
these
improvements
in
transparency
will
be
needed
for
public
oversight
of
these
new
public
safety
initiatives
these
issues
have
been
recognized
by
some
of
the
early
adopters
of
predictive
policing
the
lapd
pilot
program
has
for
example
developed
a
blind
control
test
to
see
the
effect
of
its
program
and
this
pilot
project
is
being
overseen
by
academics
trained
in
the
scientific
method
n
in
addition
the
lapd
model
has
been
designed
to
avoid
the
self
fulfilling
prophecy
concern
that
predictions
will
lead
to
arrests
which
will
lead
to
additional
predictions
in
the
same
area
n
to
remedy
this
problem
the
lapd
model
looks
at
a
three
year
period
of
crimes
and
does
not
over
value
recent
arrests
into
the
model
n
this
pilot
program
was
designed
with
accountability
and
transparency
in
mind
and
should
likely
be
a
model
not
just
for
effectiveness
but
also
for
a
process
of
openness
in
developing
these
programs
as
the
programs
expand
across
the
country
adopting
these
control
mechanisms
may
be
equally
as
important
as
adopting
the
technology
c
hard
cases
predictive
policing
may
well
become
an
effective
tool
for
law
enforcement
yet
the
technology
will
also
create
tension
for
police
in
defending
fourth
amendment
challenges
by
defendants
most
notably
by
defining
particular
areas
of
high
crime
down
to
the
block
police
are
also
implicitly
demarcating
other
areas
as
not
predicted
areas
of
heightened
criminal
activity
n
this
move
changes
how
police
and
prosecutors
will
be
able
to
rely
on
the
generic
high
crime
area
designation
as
there
have
been
thousands
of
reported
cases
involving
a
high
crime
area
the
number
of
potential
cases
implicated
by
this
change
is
significant
n
for
example
assume
police
are
dispatched
to
a
predicted
block
of
heightened
car
theft
following
the
map
in
front
of
them
the
police
set
up
surveillance
for
the
forecast
crime
nothing
happens
and
after
a
while
the
police
drive
off
two
blocks
away
the
police
see
a
young
man
with
a
screwdriver
standing
near
a
parked
car
at
that
moment
the
police
are
no
longer
in
the
predicted
area
while
subjectively
the
police
are
no
doubt
influenced
by
the
concern
of
car
thefts
in
the
general
area
and
objectively
such
a
concern
might
be
reasonable
the
forecast
does
not
cover
that
block
it
is
not
a
micro
area
of
heightened
crime
the
man
does
not
fit
the
profile
plus
activity
model
the
tip
is
for
the
wrong
area
so
assuming
the
officers
go
ahead
and
stop
and
search
the
young
man
the
predictive
profiling
model
works
against
the
officers
for
fourth
amendment
purposes
the
officers
cannot
rely
on
the
forecast
while
the
officers
common
sense
response
is
probably
come
on
we
were
just
two
blocks
away
the
move
from
a
predicted
area
of
particular
crime
to
a
generic
and
undefined
high
crime
area
might
actually
weaken
the
justification
to
stop
a
similar
problem
may
arise
when
the
predictive
model
suggests
that
one
type
of
crime
will
occur
and
an
observing
officer
sees
suspicious
activity
of
another
type
of
crime
as
discussed
the
logic
of
the
prediction
is
based
on
certain
types
of
crimes
n
further
the
logic
of
the
relevance
of
the
stop
is
based
on
the
nexus
between
prediction
and
observation
yet
one
can
easily
imagine
that
the
stakeout
for
a
residential
burglary
will
result
in
the
observation
of
a
suspicious
activity
unrelated
to
burglary
whereas
in
the
past
an
officer
could
finesse
the
difference
by
alluding
to
the
high
crime
nature
of
the
neighborhood
now
the
precision
of
predictive
policing
might
undercut
that
argument
a
final
example
might
involve
the
problems
with
statistical
probabilities
one
of
the
consequences
of
developing
a
sophisticated
crime
prediction
model
is
that
the
predictive
percentages
will
be
available
for
all
to
see
a
police
officer
who
used
to
be
able
to
state
in
a
suppression
hearing
i
was
patrolling
a
high
theft
area
one
of
the
top
areas
for
car
thefts
in
the
city
now
might
be
faced
with
justifying
whether
a
likely
prediction
as
directed
by
an
algorithm
is
sufficient
to
change
the
reasonable
suspicion
calculus
or
as
described
earlier
an
officer
may
be
faced
with
arguing
that
a
increase
is
statistically
significant
n
in
the
traditional
situation
most
trial
judges
would
take
on
good
faith
the
officer
s
generalized
professional
judgment
with
the
statistics
however
now
the
court
can
evaluate
the
probabilities
on
its
own
and
it
may
reach
a
contrary
conclusion
in
each
of
these
cases
the
court
may
well
limit
the
often
malleable
reasonable
suspicion
doctrine
hard
data
has
a
way
of
hardening
previously
fuzzy
judgment
calls
to
be
clear
in
the
above
examples
courts
may
still
choose
to
keep
both
the
high
crime
area
designation
and
the
predictive
forecast
as
separate
and
independent
bases
for
reasonable
suspicion
but
a
new
reliance
on
precise
real
time
crime
statistics
is
going
to
undercut
the
utility
of
the
old
overbroad
designation
while
this
may
be
a
positive
development
it
is
a
consideration
that
adopting
jurisdictions
may
want
to
consider
d
discriminatory
use
or
discriminatory
effect
a
concern
with
all
law
enforcement
technology
is
that
it
could
be
used
in
a
discriminatory
fashion
on
its
face
objective
data
driven
police
tactics
should
reduce
not
increase
the
discriminatory
effect
of
certain
police
tactics
however
as
can
be
seen
in
a
few
real
world
examples
data
driven
law
enforcement
can
have
a
disproportionate
effect
on
certain
communities
that
perceive
it
as
discriminatory
the
new
york
city
police
department
has
led
the
nation
in
its
implementation
of
a
data
driven
law
enforcement
model
n
the
adoption
of
the
compstat
program
led
to
a
dramatic
drop
in
crime
in
new
york
city
n
at
the
same
time
numerous
complaints
arose
both
about
the
pressures
to
collect
data
make
arrests
as
well
as
its
impact
on
certain
communities
n
currently
new
york
city
is
being
sued
by
citizens
over
the
use
of
stop
and
frisk
policies
that
are
largely
focused
on
certain
communities
n
the
numbers
are
striking
as
over
half
a
million
citizens
were
stopped
and
frisked
every
year
for
the
last
few
years
n
most
of
those
citizens
were
people
of
color
n
whether
data
driven
or
not
the
focus
on
particular
communities
usually
poor
and
usually
communities
of
color
has
created
concerns
about
constitutional
equities
while
all
citizens
would
like
reduced
crime
for
citizens
in
higher
crime
areas
the
costs
of
that
reduction
in
terms
of
police
citizen
tension
liberty
infringements
and
occasional
physical
violence
have
not
always
been
squarely
balanced
n
in
addition
constitutional
freedoms
to
assemble
travel
and
participate
are
at
stake
in
theory
predictive
policing
should
improve
these
tensions
because
the
focus
is
on
single
blocks
not
neighborhoods
and
particular
crimes
not
general
neighborhood
reputation
in
addition
if
the
strategy
is
merely
to
direct
police
to
higher
areas
of
crime
in
order
to
disrupt
the
environmental
vulnerability
and
not
arrest
anyone
then
this
innovation
may
decrease
rather
than
increase
police
citizen
tension
on
the
other
hand
one
could
imagine
potential
discrimination
if
certain
groups
were
targeted
using
predictive
technologies
while
gangs
are
an
obvious
and
oft
stated
target
of
future
use
one
could
see
how
predictive
forecasts
of
gang
criminal
activities
coupled
with
corroboration
of
gang
presence
in
an
area
could
result
in
an
automatic
finding
of
reasonable
suspicion
to
stop
gang
members
on
the
street
while
perhaps
not
the
most
sympathetic
figures
for
protecting
fourth
amendment
freedoms
such
police
made
manufacturing
of
reasonable
suspicion
also
runs
counter
to
existing
constitutional
law
n
e
courtroom
effect
as
a
final
matter
courts
should
consider
the
practical
effect
of
allowing
predictive
policing
programs
to
influence
the
reasonable
suspicion
analysis
in
court
independent
of
concerns
with
reliability
accuracy
or
potential
manipulation
there
is
a
separate
issue
with
allowing
law
enforcement
to
control
the
factors
that
make
up
reasonable
suspicion
as
seen
in
the
creation
of
profiles
or
the
claim
of
suspicion
based
on
presence
in
a
high
crime
area
a
malleable
reasonable
suspicion
test
offers
little
protection
from
a
police
stop
the
concern
with
adding
a
prediction
model
to
an
already
weakened
reasonable
suspicion
standard
is
that
one
factor
can
control
the
totality
of
circumstances
in
finding
reasonable
suspicion
the
prediction
because
it
comes
from
an
objective
source
will
color
the
subjective
suspicion
of
the
officer
and
the
ultimate
objective
decision
of
the
court
in
practical
application
it
will
be
difficult
for
a
court
to
discount
the
weight
of
some
objective
support
for
the
officer
s
suspicion
to
allow
predictive
policing
such
influence
without
mechanisms
of
accountability
for
the
data
and
analysis
and
without
full
transparency
may
result
in
a
troubling
lack
of
protection
for
individuals
who
end
up
in
the
forecasted
areas
n
this
concern
should
inspire
courts
to
take
a
more
active
role
in
ensuring
that
the
predictive
policing
models
work
and
can
be
evaluated
this
will
result
in
new
battles
over
discovery
expert
reports
and
line
drawing
about
the
predictive
validity
of
the
claims
this
development
is
to
be
expected
and
welcomed
as
a
natural
course
of
new
technologies
being
introduced
into
courtrooms
conclusion
in
the
future
predictive
policing
will
affect
the
fourth
amendment
reasonable
suspicion
analysis
how
it
affects
it
and
whether
these
changes
weaken
or
strengthen
fourth

remains
unclear
this

has
attempted
to
provide
a
framework
for
analysis
for
developers

one
commonly

example
of
predictive

is
the
data
mining
that
police
in
richmond
va
employed
to
address
the
problem
of
gunfire
on
new
year
s
eve
categorizing
each
complaint
of
gunfire
by
time
and
location
the
police
discovered
that
most
of
the
shots
occurred
in
four
neighborhoods
during
a
narrow
time
window
around
midnight
on
december
by
concentrating
its
patrol
officers
in
those
areas
and
that
time
window
the
department
was
able
to
reduce
gunfire
complaints
boost
seizures
of
weapons
and
cut

do

make

that
go

it
could
skew
further

in

model
we
would
hope
to

only
and
then
hopefully
deny

the

it
might
seem
a

of
a
quarter
of

of
valuable
police
time
but
the
way
the
sergeant
sees
things
the
long
slow
tour
of
a
seemingly
normal
parking
lot
is
one
of
the
most
important
things
he
s
done
all
day
that
s
how
things
roll
in
the
brave
new
world
of
computerised
predictive
policing
a
hi
tech
crime
busting
technique
which
gomperz
is
helping
to
pioneer
and
which
has
the
potential
to
revolutionise
modern
law
enforcement
the
technique
revolves
around
a
single
mathematical
algorithm
developed
by
the
university
of
california
los
angeles
this
complex
equation
can
in
theory
predict
with
pinpoint
accuracy
where
criminal
offences
are
most
likely
to
happen
on
any
given
day
though
that
sounds
like
the
stuff
of
science
fiction
novels
the
principle
is
relatively
straightforward
it
mines
several
years
crime
statistics
to
tease
out
hidden
patterns
once
identified
they
are
projected
into
the
future
to
predict
where
cars
might
be
stolen
or
houses
burgled
on
any
given
day
the
forecasts
are
startlingly
specific
and
that
s
where
the
policing
comes
in
each
morning
gomperz
and
his
colleagues
in
the
foothill
area
of
los
angeles
where
the
technology
is
being
tested
are
given
maps
identifying
a
handful
of
boxes
measuring
ft
x
ft
the
supposed
crime
hot
spots
for
that
day
the
officers
are
instructed
to
visit
them
as
often
as
time
allows
once
inside
the
box
they
make
themselves
as
visible
as
possible
the
shopping
centre

park
which
gomperz
has
just
slowly
criss
crossed
is

the
middle

one

that
day
s

computerised
predictive
policing
is
still
in
its
infancy
but
all
the
early
signs
are
that
it
has
a
startling
effect
in
the
city
of
santa
cruz
california
where
it
was
first
trialled
this
summer
a
per
cent
drop
in
crime
was
recorded
meanwhile
in

a
sq
mile
portion
of
northern
los

the
number
of
non
violent
crimes
has
dropped
from
around
a
week
to
nearer
in
the
eight
weeks
since
trials
began
so
striking
have
the
results
been
that
ucla
s
system
will
this
year
be
rolled
out
across
los

one
of
america
s
largest
police
forces

it
could

officer
who
helped
to
develop
the
technology
will
showcase
it
to
delegates
at
the
defence
geospatial
intelligence
conference
in
london
anecdotally
it
seems
to
work
from
the
data
we
re
seeing
it
stops
crime
happening
malinowski
says
adding
that
an
era
of
declining
resources
the
lapd
currently
has
a
paid
overtime
ban
predictive
policing
can
be
a
particularly
valuable
tool
since
it
isn
t
labour
intensive
if
a
suspect
turns
up
say
to
steal
a
car
and
he
sees
a
police
officer
then
maybe
that
s
enough
to
stop
him
committing
a
crime
that
day
making
arrests
is
still
important
it
keeps
officers
motivated
and
in
this
trial
it
has
certainly
been
happening
when
officers
are
in
their
boxes
but
arresting
people
also
takes
up
a
huge
amount
of
time
booking
one
guy
can
take
up
most
of
a
shift
so
if
we
can
reduce
crime
without
doing
that
so
much
the
better
malinowski
struck
on
the
idea
for
computerised
predictive
policing
several
years
ago
when
he
was
asked
to
supply
ucla
with
crime
data
for
a
research
project
a
bookish
man
with
an
interest
in
academia
he
began
attending
lectures
there
and
soon
learnt
that
it
was
theoretically
possible
to
use
equations
to
model
naturally
occurring
events
such
as
animal
population
growths
or
migration
patterns
in
conjunction
with
several
ucla
academics
he
decided
to
create
an
equation
which
could
model
crime
patterns
the
algorithm
they
came
up
with
uses
three
pieces
of
information
about
each
crime
the
time
date
and
co
ordinates
before
teasing
patterns
out
of
the
data
jeff
brantingham
a
ucla
anthropologist
who
helped
to
develop
it
says
the
ongoing
trial
in
foothill
is
using
a
randomised
control
on
some
days
the
co
ordinates
of
the
boxes
officers
are
asked
to
focus
on
are
randomly
generated
on
others
they
use
the
algorithm
comparing
crime
on
the
days
we
use
the
algorithm
and
the
days
we
don
t
will
give
us
a
true
gold
standard
test
as
to
whether
it
really
works
he
says
we
are
also
trying
to
measure
appropriate
dosage
how
long
an
officer
needs
to
spend
in
a
box
for
it
to
be
effective
the
concept
of
predictive
policing
is
not
without
critics
civil
libertarians
are
concerned
it
might
lead
to
life
mirroring
the
film
minority
report
which
starred
tom
cruise
in
which
police
target
people
for
crimes
they
might
commit
at
some
undetermined
point
in
the
future
it
also
has
legal
complications
under
the
fourth
amendment
of
the
us
constitution
police
officers
are
forbidden
from
stopping
a
suspect
without
reasonable
suspicion
that
they
are
committing
a
crime
no
one
yet
knows
whether
simply
being
in
a
geographic
box
identified
by
a
computer
programme
represents
reasonable
suspicion
what
happens
if
officers
turn
up
at
a
ft
x
ft
area
on
the
look
out
for
burglaries
see
a
guy
with
a
black
bag
search
him
and
find
it
contains
stolen
goods
wonders
andrew
ferguson
an
assistant
professor
of
law
at
the
university
of
the
district
of
colombia
if
that
case
goes
to
court
there
will
be
the
question
of
whether
it
was
reasonable
for
the
officer
to
suspect
he
was
committing
a
crime
if
computerised
predictive
policing
catches
on
ferguson
expects
a
test
case
eventually
to
work
its
way
up
to
the
us
supreme
court
in
the
meantime
he
expects
noisy
kickback
from
civil
rights
groups
that
a
computer
can
effectively
curtail
the
fourth
amendment
rights
of
individuals
in
certain
areas
would
be
particularly
troubling
to
the
civil
liberties
lobby
he
says
there
will
also
be
concerns
that
if
police
wanted
to
target
certain
areas
or
demographics
then
they
could
simply
tweak
the
algorithm
to
ensure
officers
visit
certain
neighbourhoods
back
on
the

of

sergeant
gomperz
has
no
such
concerns

he
s

when
i

maybe

that

really

it
s

it

but
the
way
the

sees

the
long
slow
tour
of
a
seemingly
normal

is
one
of
the
most
important
things
he
s
done
all

that
s
how

of

a
hi

crimebusting
technique
which
gomperz
is
helping
to
pioneer
and
which
has
the
potential
to
revolutionise
modern
law
enforcement
the
technique
revolves
around
a
single
mathematical
algorithm
developed
by
the
university
of
california
los

this
complex
equation
can
in
theory
predict
with
pinpoint
accuracy
where
criminal
offences
are
most
likely
to
happen
on
any
given
day
though
that
sounds
like
the
stuff
of
science
fiction
the
principle
is
relatively
straightforward
it
mines
several
years
crime
statistics
to
tease
out
hidden
patterns
once
identified
they
are
projected
into
the
future
to
predict
where
cars
might
be
stolen
or
houses
burgled
on
any
given
day
the
forecasts
are
startlingly
specific
and
that
s
where
the
policing
comes
in
each

gomperz
and
his

in

foothill
area
of

the

is

are

measuring

the

hot

for

the

are
instructed
to

them
as
often
as
time
allows
once
inside

box
they
make
themselves

computerised
predictive

is
still
in

but
all
the
early
signs
are
that
it
has
a
startling
effect
in
the
city
of
santa
cruz
california
where
it
was
first
trialled
this
summer
a

drop
in

was
recorded
meanwhile
in

a

portion
of

la
the
number
of
non

crimes
has
dropped
from
around
a
week
to
nearer
in
the
eight
weeks
since
trials
began
so
striking
have
the
results
been
that
ucla

will
this

be
rolledout
across

s

who
helped
to
develop

will
showcase
it
to

at

anecdotally
it
seems
to
work
from
the

we
re

it
stops
crime
happening
malinowski
says
adding
that
in
an
era
of
declining
resources
the

currently
has
a
paid
overtime
ban
predictive
policing
can
be
a
valuable
tool
if
a
suspect
turns
up
say
to
steal
a
car
and
he
sees
a
police
officer
then
maybe
that
s
enough
to
stop
him
committing
a
crime
that
day
making
arrests
is
still
important
it
keeps
officers
motivated
and
in
this
trial
it
has
certainly
been
happening
when
officers
are
in
their
boxes
but
arresting
people
also
takes
up
a
huge
amount
of
time
so
if
we
can
reduce

so
much
the

malinowski
struck
on
the
idea
for
computerised
predictive
policing
several
years
ago
when
he
was
asked
to
supply
ucla
with
crime
data
for
a
research
project
a
bookish
man
with
an
interest
in
academia
he
began
attending
lectures
there
and
soon
learnt
that
it
was
theoretically
possible
to
use
equations
to
model
naturally
occurring
events
such
as
animal
population
growths
or
migration
patterns
in
conjunction
with
ucla
academics
he
decided
to
create
an
equation
which
could
model
crime
patterns
the
algorithm
they
came
up
with
uses
three
pieces
of
information
about
each
crime
the
time
date
and
co
ordinates
be

teasing
patterns
out
of

jeff
brantingham
a
ucla
anthropologist
who
helped

says
the
ongoing

in

is
using

on
some

the
coordinates

officers
are
asked

are

they
use

and
the

we
don

will
give
us
a
true
gold
standard
test
as
to
whether
it
really
works
he
says
we
are
also
trying
to
measure
appropriate
dosage
how
long
an
officer
needs
to
spend
in
a
box
for
it
to
be
effective
the
technology
is
not
without
critics
civil
libertarians
are
concerned
it
might
lead
to
life
mirroring
the
tom
cruise
film
minority
report
in
which
police
target
people
for
crimes
which
they
might
commit
at
some
point
in
the
future
it
also
has
legal
complications
under
the
fourth
amendment
of
the
us
constitution
police
officers
are
forbidden
from
stopping
a
suspect
without
reasonable
suspicion
that
they
are
committing
a
crime
no
one
yet
knows
whether
simply
being
in
a
geographic
box
identified
by
a
computer
programme
passes
the
test
what
happens
if
officers
turn
up
at
a
ft
x
ft
area
on
the
lookout
for
burglaries
see
a
guy
with
a

search

it

wonders
andrew

an

of

at

if
that

goes
to

there
will
be
the

of
whether
it
was
reasonable
for
the

to
suspect
he
was

seconds
later

the

however
a

to

by
using

might
occur
the
los

police
department
is
the
largest
agency
to
embrace
an
experiment
known
as
predictive
policing
which
crunches
data
to
determine
where
to
send
officers
to
thwart
would
be
thieves
early
successes
could
serve
as
a
model
for
other
cash
strapped
law
enforcement
agencies
but
some
legal
observers
are
concerned
that
it
could
lead
to
stops
and
searches
that
violate
fourth
amendment
protections
in
the
san
fernando
valley
where
the
program
was
launched
late
last
year
officers
are
seeing
double
digit
drops
in
burglaries
and
other
property
crimes
the
program
has
turned
enough
in
house
skeptics
into
believers
that
there
are
plans
to
roll
it
out
citywide
by
next
summer
we
have
prevented
hundreds
and
hundreds
of
people
coming

seeing
their
homes
robbed
capt
sean
malinowski
said
crime
mapping
has
long
been
a
tool
used
to
determine
where
the
bad
guys
lurk
the
idea
has
evolved
from
colored
pins
placed
on
a
map
to
identifying
hot
spots
via
a
computer
database
of
past
crimes
and
possible
patterns
over
the
past
decade
many
large
police
departments
including
los
angeles
and
new
york
city
have
used
compstat
a
system
that
tracks
crime
figures
and
enables
police
to
send
extra
officers
to
trouble
spots
the
new
program
used
by
the
lapd
and
police
in
the
northern
california
city
of
santa
cruz
is
more
timely
and
precise
proponents
said
built
on
the
same
model
for
predicting
aftershocks
following
an
earthquake
the
software
promises
to
show
officers
what
might
be
coming
based
on
simple
constantly
calibrated
data
location
time
and
type
of
crime
the
software
generates
prediction
boxes
as
small
as
square
feet
on
a
patrol
map
when
officers
have
spare
time
they
are
told
to
go
in
the
box
the
goal
is
not
to
boost
the
number
of
arrests
a
common
benchmark
to
reflect
crime
reduction
officers
want
to
intercept
a
crime
in
progress
or
deter
would
be
criminals
i
want
to
disrupt
an
activity
before
an
arrest
is
made
malinowski
said
jeff
brantingham
an
anthropology
professor
at
ucla
said
the
data
are
derived
in
part
from
criminal
behaviors
repeat
victimization
and
the
notion
that
criminals
tend
not
to
stray
too
far
from
areas
they
know
best
if
you
are
victimized
today
the
risk
that
you
ll
be
a
victim
again
goes
way
up
said
brantingham
who
co
founded
a
software
company
tapped
by
the
lapd
for
its
program
so
far
the
program
has
been
implemented
in
five
lapd
divisions
that
cover
square
miles
and
about
million
people
in
the
valley
s
foothill
division
where
more
than
half
of
the
crimes
committed
are
property
related
about
patrol
officers
are
spending
a
total
of
about
hours
a
week
working
in
the
boxes
in
one
instance
a
police
captain
questioned
sending
officers
into
a
box
that
was
on
the
edge
of
his
coverage
area
officers
went
out
and
didn
t
find
anything
but
returned
several
nights
later
and
found
a
man
breaking
a
window
the
division
leads
the
department
in
crime
reduction
malinowski
said
crimes
were
down
in
the
area
percent
following
the
rollout
compared
with
a
slight
uptick
across
the
rest
of
the
city
where
the
program
wasn
t
being
used
if
you
had
told
us
a
few
years
ago
you
could
get
an
algorithm
to
perform
the
same
as
a
crime
analyst
we
would
think
you
were
crazy
malinowski
said
even
the
most
skeptical
people
are
now
coming
up
to
me
and
saying
i
think
this
is
working
x
ac
x
other
police
departments
across
the
nation
are
using
similar
approaches
ibm
has
teamed
up
with

an

has
written
about

how
it

ferguson
said
the
trend
is
a
seductive
idea
for
law
enforcement
agencies
that
carry
a
lot
of
power
he
said
that
the
lapd
has
done
a
good
job
with
the
data
but
he
s
concerned
that
other
departments
could
abuse
the
process
with
racial
profiling
or
stereotyping
a
neighborhood
or
an
area
there
are
real
pressures
to
expand
this
nationally
and
see
it
succeed
ferguson
said
i
think
it
s
an
important
innovation
but
like
any
innovation
it
s
not
foolproof
and
looking
closely
at
the
data
is
important
to
ensure
it
doesn

harm

she

the

this
can
be
especially
useful
in
property
crimes
like
auto

and

where

you

says

it

occur
at

said
serious

fell

and

declined

since

john
williams
crime
analysis
manager
for
the

said
the
system
has
had
a
dramatic
impact
allowing
memphis
to
get
off
the
list
of
worst
us
cities
for
crime
if
the
data
is
indicating
a
hot
spot
we
are
able
to
immediately
deploy
resources
there
and
in
a
lot
of
instances
we
are
able
to
make
quality
arrests
because
we
re
in
the
right
area
at
the
right
time
he
said
although
beat
officers
can
use
their
instincts
for
similar
results
williams
said
the
software
could
be
far
more
precise
such
as
predicting
burglaries
in
a
small
geographic
area
between
pm
and
am
in
one
case
the
software
was
able
to
help
police
break
up
a
group
that
was
committing
armed
robberies
on
the
city
s
hispanic
population
there
were
robberies
but
we
had
no
idea
it
was
so
organized
williams
said
by
crunching
the
numbers
police
were
able
to
pinpoint
the
zone
and
time
of
likely
holdups
we
caught
a
group
of
robbers
in
progress
we
had
leads
on
additional
robberies
he
said
williams
said
police
officials
from
as
far
away
as
hong

rio

and
estonia
have
come
to
review
the
experience
in
memphis
in
los

another
program
developed
by

at
the
university
of
california
los

and
santa
clara
university
was
tested
in
a
single
precinct
and
resulted
in
a
percent
drop
in
crime
while
the
rest
of
the
city
saw
a
percent
increase
that
test
and
others
led
to
the
creation
of
a
company
called
predpol
and
los
angeles
will
expand
its
use
of
the
program
under

with
predpol
said
ceo
caleb
baskin
baskin
said
the
system
is
based
on
a
model
from
mathematician
george
mohler
which
is
very
effective
in
predicting
the
time
and
location
for
crimes
that
have
not
yet
taken

predpol
had
begun
working
with
other
cities
in
california
and
we
ve
had
inquiries
from
a
lot
of
places
in
the
us
and
international
locations
baskin
said
the
science
that
underlies
the
tool
will
work
anywhere
the
question
is
does
the
agency
maintain
a
database
that
we
can
plug
into
while
use
of
such
analytics
generally
wins
plaudits
for
helping
smarter
policing
it
does
raise
concerns
about
big
brother
like
snooping
andrew
guthrie
ferguson
a
law
professor
at
the
university
of
the

of
columbia
said
the
use
of
technology
could
be
positive
but
that
it
could
lower
the
threshold
for
constitutional
protections
on
unreasonable
searches
to
stop
you
and
frisk
you
and
search
you
a
police
officer
needs
reasonable
suspicion
so
my
question
is
how
will
this
affect
reasonable
suspicion
he
said
if
the
search
is
based
on
a
computer
algorithm
ferguson
said
and
the
case
comes
to
court
how
do
you
cross
examine
a
computer
ibm
s
cleverly
said
the
technology
can
in
many
cases
improve
privacy
you
can
pinpoint
the
record
of
who
has
access
to
information
you
have
a
solid
history
of
what
s
going
on
so
if

is
using

you
have
an

he
said
although
beat
officers
can
use
their
instincts
for
similar
results
williams
said
the
software
could
be
far
more
precise
such
as
predicting
burglaries
in
a
small
geographic
area
between
the
hours
of
pm
and
am
in
one
case
the
software
was
able
to
help
police
break
up
a
group
that
was
committing
armed
robberies
on
the
city
s
hispanic
population
there
were
robberies
but
we
had
no
idea
it
was
so
organised
williams
said
by
crunching
the
numbers
police
were
able
to
pinpoint
the
zone
and
time
of
likely
hold
ups
we
caught
a
group
of
robbers
in

we
had
leads
on

williams
said
police
officials
from
as
far
away
as
hong
kong
rio
de

and
estonia
have
come
to
review
the
experience
in
memphis
in
los

another
program
developed
by
scientists
at
the
university
of
california
los
angeles
and
santa
clara
university
was
tested
in
a
single
precinct
the
result
was
a
per
cent
drop
in
crime
while
the
rest
of
the
city
saw
a
per
cent
increase
that
test
and
others
led
to
the
creation
of
a
company
called
predpol
and
los
angeles
will
expand
its
use
of
the
programme
under
contract
with
predpol
said
ceo
caleb
baskin
baskin
said
the
system
is
based
on
a
model
from
mathematician
george
mohler
which
is
very
effective
in
predicting
the
time
and
location
for
crimes
that
have
not
yet
taken
place
predpol
had
begun
working
with
other
cities
in
california
and
we
ve
had
inquiries
from
a
lot
of
places
in
the
us
and
international
locations
baskin
said
the
science
that
underlies
the
tool
will
work
anywhere
the
question
is
does
the
agency
maintain
a
database
that
we
can
plug
into
while
use
of
such
analytics
generally
wins
plaudits
for
helping
smarter
policing
it
does
raise
concerns
about
big
brother
like
snooping
andrew
ferguson
a
law
professor
at
the
university
of
the
district
of
columbia
said
the
use
of
technology
could
be
positive
but
that
it
could
lower
the
threshold
for
constitutional
protections
on
unreasonable
searches
to
stop
you
and
frisk
you
and
search
you
a
police
officer
needs
reasonable
suspicion
so
my
question
is
how
will
this
affect
reasonable
suspicion
he
said
if
the
search
is
based
on
a
computer
algorithm
ferguson
said
and
the
case
comes
to
court
how
do
you
cross
examine
a
computer
ibm
s
cleverly
said
the
technology
can
in
many
cases
improve
privacy
you
can
pinpoint
the
record
of
who
has
access
to
information
you
have
a
solid
history
of
what
s
going
on
so
if
someone
is
using
the
system
for
ill
you
have
an
audit
trail
he
said
as
for
minority
report
and
its
predictive
software
cleverly
said
it
was
a
great
film
and
great
short
story
but
it

on

the

theory
suggests
a

between
low

that
is
if

a

adopted
order

such
as

this

introduction
the
last
fifteen
to
twenty
years
has
brought
a
paradigm
shift
in
local
policing
efforts
moving
from
a
reactive
approach
to
a
proactive
one
marked
by
community
engagement
and
proble
moriented
policing
processes
this
shift
spawned
the
rise
of
community
policing
as
a
dominant
trend
in
local
policing
community
policing
is
in
part
based
on
the
seminal
work
of
george
l
kelling
and
james
q
wilson
s
broken
windows
n
the
broken
windows
theory
links
minor
public
disorders
vagrancy
public
drunkenness
and
panhandling
to
name
a
few
to
violent
crime
if
such
small
offenses
are
allowed
to
pervade
a
community
they
will
inevitably
escalate
and
lead
to
a
community
plagued
by
violent
crime
building
on
social
psychology
theory
the
broken
windows
theory
views
maintaining
a
perception
of
community
orderliness
by
cracking
down
on
low
level
criminal
offenses
to
stop
their
proliferation
or
escalation
as
central
to
keeping
that
community
safe
community
policing
was
designed
on
these
premises
and
thus
many
local
governments
adopted
order
maintenance
laws
such
as
panhandling
ordinances
anti
gang
statutes
anti
homeless
statutes
and
anti
loitering
laws
to
take
aim
at
maintaining
order
in
their
communities
this
focus
on
low
level
offenses
led
to
increases
in
prosecutions
and
a
demand
for
attendant
needs
such
as
jails
prisons
and
other
social
services
related
to
the
criminal
justice
system
this
trend
in
local
policing
also
coincided
with
a
wave
of
tough
on
crime
political
rhetoric
and
policies
the
great
recessions
n
and
the
related
budget
deficits
faced
by
many
local
governments
are
forcing
local
governments
n
to
think
critically
about
their
commitment
to
community
policing
and
the
costs
associated
with
it
can
this
dominant
approach
to
local
policing
remain
intact
with
the
economic
realities
faced
by
local
governments
or
might
new
local
policing
philosophies
align
with
fledgling
movements
in
the
criminal
justice
and
social
service
systems
that
seek
to
make
difficult
but
cost
efficient
decisions
regarding
the
allocation
of
scarce
resources
this
article
explores
these
questions
to
determine
what
changes
are
in
store
for
local
governments
due
to
the
current
economic
crisis
and
what
their
implications
are
for
localities
this
article
will
also
examine
the
proposed
changes
to
the
criminal
justice
and
social
service
systems
that
seek
cost
efficient
approaches
that
hark
back
to
a
rehabilitative
approach
to
low
level
criminals
in
somewhat
stark
contrast
to
the
tough
on
crime
rhetoric
that
has
pervaded
the
political
debate
finally
this
article
will
assess
and
evaluate
the
broader
implications
of
these
coalescing
trends
on
local
policing
and
criminal
justice
and
social
service
systems

briefly
describes
the
broken

theory
which
serves
as
a

describes
some
of
the

has
affected
local

describes
the
difficult
funding
choices
communities
face
related

services
and
more
generally
because
of
these
changed
circumstances
part
vi
analyzes
how
cities
have
responded
to
reduced
funding
in
both
traditional
and
nontraditional
manners
part
vii
reflects
on
how
these
difficult
economic
times
may
provide
an
opportunity
for
a
more
creative
holistic
approach
to
policing
and
social
services
in
the
form
of
evidence
based
decision
making
that
remains
consistent
with
the
broken

theory
of
community
policing
while
adjusting
to
the
realities
of
current
local
government
budgets
part
vii
uses
milwaukee
county
as
an
example
of
how
some
localities
are
embracing

decision
making
to
reinvent
their

community
policing
the
term
community
policing
has
no
settled
definition
while
the
goal
of
this
article
is
not
to
delve
into
the
various
iterations
and
characteristics
that
collectively
define
community
policing
a
working
definition
and
understanding
proves
helpful
for
the
purposes
of
the
forthcoming
analysis
community
policing
is
a
theoretical
and
practical
approach
to
policing
that
focuses
on
crime
prevention
order
maintenance
and
partnership
with
the
community
to
achieve
these
goals
n
the
united
states
department
of
justice
s
office
of
community
oriented
police
services
defines
community
policing
as
a
philosophy
that
promotes
organizational
strategies
which
support
the
systematic
use
of
partnerships
and
problem
solving
techniques
to
proactively
address
the
immediate
conditions
that
give
rise
to
public
safety
issues
such
as
crime
social
disorder
and
fear
of
crime
n
as
described
further
below
community
policing
shepherded
in
a
new
model
of
policing
that
valued
decentralization
deep
community
partnerships
a
problem
solving
approach
to
crime
and
crime
prevention
and
citizen
satisfaction
n
community
policing
rose
to
prominence
in
the
s
after
a
general
consensus
formed
that
police
community
relationships
were
severely
strained
and
that
there
was
a
need
for
a
different
paradigm
for
the
legitimacy
and
effectiveness
of
local
police
forces
n
the
traditional
model
of
the
warrior
police
officer
the
detached
aloof
crime
fighter
battling
the
enemy
that
is
the
public
was
one
that
had
sown
deep
resentment
in
many
communities
n
law
enforcement
organizations
thus
sought
to
change
their
image
and
partner
with
their
respective
communities
to
better
achieve
a
mutual
goal
a
safe
environment
within
which
to
work
and
live
n
at
the
same
time
new
research
emerged
that
called
into
question
the
efficacy
of
traditional
policing
theories
and
practices
studies
questioned
whether
some
of
the
tenets
of
policing
leading
up
to
the
s
were
effective
increasing
the
number
of
passive
patrols
in
a
neighborhood
random
and
saturation
patrols
and
an
emphasis
on
rapid
response
times
for
calls
n
finally
crimes
rates
were
also
on
the
rise
during
this
time
which
led
to
considerable
fear
in
many
neighborhoods
n
the
confluence
of
these
three
forces
the
rise
in
crime
poor
relationships
between
many
police
departments
and
their
communities
and
research
questioning
the
effectiveness
of
traditional
police
strategies
led
to
an
environment
where
a
paradigm
shift
to
community
policing
could
and
did
occur
community
policing
thus
ushered
in
an
approach
to
policing
that
deemphasized
the
us
against
them
and
warrior
police
officer
versus
the
enemy
view
and
focused
instead
on
collaboration
and
partnership
with
the
community
n
in
this
model
instead
of
patrolling
neighborhoods
in
cars
police
officers
walk
a
beat
within
a
neighborhood
so
that
they
are
visible
easily
accessible
to
the
community
and
better
able
to
develop
strong
ties
with
community
stakeholders
n
the
collaborative
emphasis
of
community
policing
provides
the
community
with
an
opportunity
to
provide
input
regarding
the
services
that
it
receives
and
the
types
of
problems
it
would
like
addressed
n
community
policing
thus
embraces
collaboration
with
various
community
stakeholders
neighborhood
groups
grass
roots
organizations
property
owners
businesses
other
government
officials
and
agencies
and
the
like
in
making
common
cause
the
community
can
define
its
social
norms
and
values
partnering
with
the
police
department
ensures
that
those
norms
are
inculcated
and
respected
in
the
community
and
enforced
by
the
police
n
this
approach
also
allows
the
police
and
those
they
serve
to
tailor
specific
solutions
to
the
problems
and
challenges
facing
their
particular
community
n
this
ability
for
the
community
to
help
inform
police
decision
making
comports
with
the
problem
oriented
approach
to
policing
that
this
model
encourages
indeed
community
policing
envisions
a
problem
oriented
approach
where
police
officers
collaborate
with
key
stakeholders
in
a
community
this
collaboration
identifies
disorders
and
then
devises
solutions
that
seek
to
solve
the
underlying
problems
n
as
discussed
in
part
vii
not
all
of
these
underlying
problems
are
necessarily
crime
related
consequently
community
policing
expects
that
the
police
department
will
engage
and
collaborate
with
other
governmental
and
social
services
agencies
to
help
address
these
problems
n
with
the
financial
constraints
affecting
local
governments
today
this
holistic
approach
to
addressing
disorder
and
its
underlying
problems
may
prove
of
even
greater
importance
in
maintaining
community
policing
and
attempting
to
stay
true
to
the
broken
windows
theory
that
underlies
it
iii
broken
windows
theory
the
broken
windows
theory
of
policing
provides
one
of
the
key
philosophical
foundations
for
community
policing
n
george
l
kelling
and
james
q
wilson
first
outlined
the
theory
in
their
seminal
article
n
in
the
article
the
authors
describe
a
newark
new
jersey
neighborhood
that
implemented
a
police
foot
patrol
after
many
years
of
having
only
vehicle
control
n
the
foot
patrol
officer
kept
order
in
the
neighborhood
by
encouraging
normatively
desirable
behavior
for
example
the
officer
would
not
allow
drunks
to
sleep
on
the
main
streets
rather
only
in
alleys
and
he
arrested
people
for
breaking
informal
rules
of
vagrancy
n
interestingly
while
the
neighborhood
did
not
in
fact
see
a
reduction
in
crime
after
the
implementation
of
the
foot
patrol
residents
nevertheless
felt
safe
and
perceived
that
crime
rates
had
dropped
n
this
story
served
as
the
conduit
for
kelling
and
wilson
to
develop
their
theory
linking
disorder
to
violent
crime
while
acknowledging
that
for
many
the
link
seems
tenuous
at
best
kelling
and
wilson
claim
that
at
the
community
level
disorder
and
crime
are
usually
inextricably
linked
in
a
kind
of
developmental
sequence
n
to
this
end
the
authors
theorize
that
if
small
infractions
such
as
vagrancy
public
drunkenness
and
panhandling
the
broken
windows
are
allowed
to
pervade
a
community
then
crime
in
the
area
will
further
proliferate
and
the
neighborhood
will
eventually
be
riddled
with
violent
crime
n
these
obvious
and
visible
signs
of
disorder
undermine
the
social
law
abiding
norms
in
a
community
n
the
disorder
signals
that
the
community
either
cannot
or
will
not
enforce
basic
social
norms
a
clear
indication
of
a
breakdown
of
community
control
n
if
a
community
is
unwilling
or
unable
to
enforce
social
norms
it
provides
a
reasonable
inference
to
both
criminals
and
law
abiding
citizens
that
the
community
similarly
will
not
or
cannot
prevent
more
serious
crimes
n
this
disorder
leads
criminals
to
commit
more
serious
crimes
in
greater
numbers
and
instills
fear
in
the
law
abiding
stakeholders
in
the
community
conversely
if
criminals
see
more
arrests
for
drunkenness
driving
violations
or
other
disruptions
of
order
they
will
believe
arrest
is
more
likely
and
thus
will
be
deterred
from
committing
crimes
n
indeed
as
professor
dan
m
kahan
points
out
i
ndividuals
are
much
more
likely
to
commit
crimes
when
they
perceive
that
criminal
activity
is
widespread
n
if
there
is
no
visible
communal
moral
rebuke
of
small
crimes
people
in
the
community
will
likely
engage
in
such
behavior
themselves
because
they
perceive
such
actions
to
be
acceptable
with
low
risks
and
potentially
high
payoffs
n
social
psychology
supports
the
broken
windows
theory
if
people
see
a
weakening
in
the
orderliness
of
a
system
they
begin
to
doubt
whether
they
can
do
anything
to
prevent
such
disorder
n
this
doubt
feeds
on
itself
causing
those
in
a
disorderly
neighborhood
to
be
less
likely
to
report
a
crime
because
they
think
the
police
will
not
respond
in
time
or
will
not
be
able
to
do
anything
about
the
situation
n
this
devolving
cycle
leads
to
more
crimes
as
those
before
them
go
unreported
and
unpunished
n
the
increase
in
crimes
is
also
accompanied
by
a
greater
seriousness
in
the
type
of
crimes
that
are
committed
in
this
regard
disorder
leads
to
citizen
fear
which
causes
citizens
to
physically
and
socially
withdraw
n
such
withdrawal
spurs
increased
predatory
behavior
and
rising
crime
rates
leading
to
a
spiral
of
decline
in
the
neighborhood
n
therefore
according
to
the
broken
windows
theory
a
community
must
address
disorder
early
on
so
as
to
prevent
the
spiral
of
decline
from
eventually
occurring
the
broken
windows
theory
thus
spurred
policing
responses
that
sought
to
crack
down
on
low
level
criminal
offenses
to
stop
their
proliferation
escalation
or
both
n
for
when
police
enforce
basic
social
norms
and
when
community
stakeholders
both
obey
and
embrace
such
norms
the
community
signals
to
criminals
and
law
abiding
citizens
alike
that
it
is
intolerant
of
criminal
behavior
n
this
positive
messaging
broken
windows
theorists
posit
helps
avoid
the
downward
spiral
that
communities
with
rampant
disorder
experience
accordingly
police
seeking
to
adopt
broken
windows
policing
strategies
target
both
social
and
physical
disorder
social
disorder
includes
loitering
vandalism
gangs
public
drinking
drug
dealing
prostitution
and
street
harassment
n
physical
disorder
encompasses
building
abandonment
graffiti
litter
on
the
streets
and
sidewalks
abandoned
cars
junk
and
garbage
in
vacant
lots
and
the
like
n
these
small
quality
of
life
crimes
contribute
to
a
sense
of
disorder
and
danger
on
the
street
n
many
communities
thus
adopted
order
maintenance
laws
such
as
panhandling
ordinances
anti
gang
statutes
anti
homeless
statutes
anti
loitering
statutes
and
vagrancy
statutes
to
target
these
forms
of
disorder
and
avoid
the
devolution
toward
crime
that
the
broken
windows
theory
describes
n
police
departments
even
used
civil
laws
like
nuisance
abatement
and
forfeiture
laws
to
address
and
prevent
these
quality
of
life
criminal
activities
n
this
approach
supports
the
social
influence
theory
s
focus
on
how
a
community
s
norms
and
behavior
affect
its
conduct
and
the
conduct
of
others
entering
the
community
n
therefore
by
adopting
order
maintenance
laws
communities
can
use
social
influence
to
discourage
criminality
n
however
this
social
influence
aspect
of
the
broken
windows
theory
is
oftentimes
misunderstood
in
community
policing
literature
as
professor
k
babe
howell
notes
o
rder
maintenance
policing
as
described
in
broken
windows
neither
demands
nor
suggests
that
zero
tolerance
arrest
policies
are
efficient
desirable
or
effective
methods
to
achieve
order
and
reduce
fear
n
in
fact
the
broken
windows
approach
to
community
policing
is
not
entirely
based
on
arrests
for
example
the
police
officer
in
the
broken
windows
article
did
not
arrest
people
but
rather
enforced
social
norms
by
breaking
up
arguments
and
asking
drunks
to
move
to
different
areas
n
indeed
under
this
approach
police
seek
to
employ
non
arrest
approaches
and
interventions
such
as
discussion
persuasion
negotiation
counseling
and
ordering
in
an
attempt
to
ameliorate
the
problem
without
making
an
arrest
n
nevertheless
despite
this
philosophical
and
practical
approach
to
non
arrest
interventions
the
broken
windows
theory
has
led
to
a
significant
number
of
arrests
for
relatively
minor
offenses
during
the
community
policing
era
n
iv
the
costs
of
community
policing
whether
police
attempt
arrest
or
non
arrest
solutions
the
broken
windows
approach
to
community
policing
requires
significant
expenditures
and
resources
by
local
governments
n
foot
patrols
while
beneficial
for
establishing
better
community
relationships
are
less
efficient
for
police
in
terms
of
patrolling
portions
of
the
city
in
this
regard
a
police
department
needs
more
police
officers
than
it
previously
did
to
maintain
such
a
visible
presence
in
the
community
with
the
shift
to
community
policing
police
officers
spend
more
time
attending
community
meetings
and
developing
personal
relationships
with
key
stakeholders
in
the
neighborhood
in
order
to
help
understand
the
community
s
challenges
and
devise
strategies
for
addressing
them
while
an
effective
use
of
the
police
officer
s
time
in
the
theoretical
construct
of
community
policing
such
efforts
are
time
intensive
and
require
more
dedicated
officers
from
a
police
force
than
previous
approaches
to
policing
did
moreover
the
broken
windows
approach
to
community
policing
inevitably
leads
to
arrests
for
the
various
low
level
criminal
offenses
that
lead
to
disorder
in
a
community
there
are
also
tremendous
hidden
costs
in
the
time
money
and
personnel
required
for
extra
arrests
and
the
costs
to
the
local
criminal
justice
system
in
processing
and
prosecuting
each
misdemeanor
n
the
police
department
the
district
attorney
s
or
city
attorney
s
offices
the
public
defenders
offices
and
the
local
court
system
all
spend
a
significant
amount
of
resources
to
process
these
minor
offenses
through
the
criminal
justice
system
n
for
example
many
police
departments
face
substantial
overtime
expenses
to
pay
for
police
officers
and
other
staff
to
process
the
increase
in
these
quality
of
life
criminal
arrests
n
there
are
also
other
externalized
costs
borne
by
the
city
and
taxpayers
more
broadly
when
an
arrest
and
criminal
record
leads
an
individual
down
the
all
too
common
spiral
of
multiple
subsequent
arrests
incarceration
and
unemployment
n
this
is
to
say
nothing
of
the
significant
costs
to
the
individual
arrested
for
these
low
level
quality
of
life
crimes
the
arrestee
loses
significant
time
money
and
opportunity
each
time
he
or
she
is
booked
for
a
misdemeanor
he
or
she
typically
misses
two
to
four
days
of
work
or
school
which
may
lead
to
a
loss
of
employment
and
the
arrestee
must
also
pay
the
processing
fees
for
being
arrested
n
the
criminal
record
that
such
an
arrestee
may
wind
up
with
can
prevent
that
person
from
getting
a
loan
for
a
car
a
house
or
schooling
thus
limiting
his
or
her
options
and
potentially
leading
that
person
back
to
committing
more
crimes
n
the
arrestee
and
possibly
his
or
her
family
could
be
kicked
out
of
public
housing
n
all
of
these
costs
on
the
individual
affect
the
community
as
well
while
the
broken
windows
approach
to
community
policing
may
decrease
fear
in
the
community
it
might
also
result
in
economic
ruin
for
the
arrestee
and
thus
create
an
even
more
desperate
criminal
n
these
costs
have
become
more
magnified
in
the
past
few
years
as
the
great
recession
has
taken
a
devastating
toll
on
the
economy
more
generally
and
local
government
budgets
more
specifically
v
local
government
funding
and
the
great
recession
a
sources
of
local
government
funding
local
governments
receive
funding
from
six
main
sources
taxes
federal
government
assistance
state
government
assistance
special
assessments
fees
and
fines
and
borrowing
n
while
local
governments
do
not
have
an
inherent
power
to
levy
taxes
states
grant
localities
the
power
to
tax
through
their
constitutions
statutes
and
local
home
rule
charter
provisions
n
however
the
local
government
power
to
tax
is
often
quite
limited
and
not
universally
enjoyed
in
every
state
n
the
most
common
and
universal
form
of
local
government
tax
is
the
property
tax
while
some
localities
are
also
able
to
garner
funds
through
taxes
related
to
sales
and
other
excise
taxes
local
income
use
and
licenses
n
due
to
these
limited
taxation
sources
of
revenue
local
governments
rely
on
the
other
aforementioned
sources
of
non
tax
revenues
to
help
meet
their
budgets
the
federal
government
has
historically
given
substantial
financial
aid
to
local
governments
through
block
grants
categorical
grants
aimed
at
funding
particular
programs
with
specific
requirements
and
conditions
attached
which
gave
local
governments
more
discretion
to
use
such
funds
for
a
variety
of
policy
areas
n
state
governments
also
provide
funding
to
local
governments
through
direct
revenue
sharing
education
budgets
and
grants
in
aid
for
specific
purposes
or
uses
n
special
assessments
allow
local
governments
to
raise
revenue
by
funding
a
community
improvement
such
as
infrastructure
projects
by
assessing
a
fee
to
those
property
owners
who
will
benefit
from
it
n
localities
also
charge
various
fees
and
fines
on
businesses
individuals
properties
and
other
entities
for
various
regulatory
licensing
permitting
and
user
purposes
n
finally
local
governments
also
obtain
money
needed
to
meet
their
yearly
budgetary
obligations
by
borrowing
money
and
issuing
bonds
to
repay
their
debt
n
b
the
effects
of
the
great
recession
on
public
safety
budgets
before
the
great
recession
began
in
these
funding
sources
for
local
governments
were
relatively
stable
and
predictable
however
with
the
financial
downturn
that
the
united
states
and
the
world
more
generally
has
experienced
in
the
past
several
years
localities
experienced
severe
reductions
from
virtually
all
of
their
revenue
sources
that
dramatically
impacted
their
budgets
the
federal
government
significantly
cut
its
funding
to
local
governments
in
its
attempt
to
balance
its
budget
and
rein
in
the
national
debt
n
many
state
governments
cut
their
funding
to
local
governments
in
a
variety
of
different
areas
to
help
make
up
budget
deficits
n
cities
also
saw
a
significant
drop
in
tax
revenues
as
housing
prices
dropped
foreclosures
proliferated
and
spending
and
thus
sales
taxes
dropped
significantly
while
unemployment
rose
and
fear
of
worse
financial
circumstances
lingered
n
in
addition
some
cities
bore
additional
unexpected
costs
localities
in
california
for
example
were
forced
by
state
law
to
house
prisoners
formerly
imprisoned
in
state
facilities
in
an
attempt
to
save
money
at
the
state
level
n
police
departments
and
public
safety
budgets
more
generally
were
not
immune
to
these
difficult
economic
times
for
local
governments
a
study
conducted
by
the
police
executive
forum
revealed
that
fifty
one
percent
of
police
departments
responding
to
the
survey
had
their
budgets
cut
since
the
great
recession
began
n
the
average
cut
to
police
department
budgets
was
seven
percent
n
fifty
nine
percent
of
those
respondents
also
anticipated
cuts
to
their
budgets
in
n
another
study
showed
that
eight
five
percent
of
responding
police
departments
had
their
budgets
cut
in
with
more
than
half
of
them
experiencing
a
five
percent
cut
and
nearly
a
quarter
of
them
having
a
cut
of
ten
percent
or
more

still
another
study
detailed
that
seventy

percent
of
responding
major
city
police
departments
experienced
budget
cuts
by
an
average
of
n
as
nearly
any
newspaper
in
the
country
would
likely
report
police
departments
like
all
other
local
government
agencies
have
experienced
and
will
likely
continue
to
face
budget
cuts
during
this
economic
downturn
vi
local
government
responses
and
an
opportunity
born
a
traditional
approaches
cutting
costs
and
raising
revenue
the
challenging
economic
times
and
attendant
budget
cuts
have
forced
police
departments
to
make
difficult
decisions
to
balance
their
budgets
there
are
several
approaches
that
are
worth
analyzing
because
of
their
potential
impact
on
a
police
department
s
ability
to
continue
with
a
broken
windows
approach
to
community
policing
many
police
departments
have
laid
off
officers
and
made
other
reductions
in
their
workforces
some
police
departments
have
experimented
with
turning
to
private
security
firms
for
help
with
police
services
or
at
least
permitting
them
to
operate
in
certain
spheres
and
de
deputizing
certain
police
work
so
that
civilian
employees
can
perform
those
tasks
other
cities
and
suburbs
have
explored
combining
or
regionalizing
police
services
finally
many
cities
have
attempted
various
cost
saving
measures
and
looked
to
identify
new
nontraditional
revenue
sources
in
an
attempt
to
maintain
staffing
and
service
levels
reductions
in
police
department
workforces
to
address
budget
cuts
many
police
departments
have
laid
off
officers
made
other
personnel
cuts
or
left
various
jobs
unfilled
n
in
fact
the
united
states
department
of
justice
estimated
that
by
the
end
of
approximately
officers
would
have
been
laid
off
by
police
departments
and
nearly
law
enforcement
jobs
would
go
unfilled
n
some
examples
of
police
layoffs
are
breathtaking
the
city
of
camden
new
jersey
announced
in
january
that
it
was
cutting
nearly
half
of
its
police
force
n
the
city
of
flint
michigan
laid
off
of
its
police
officers
due
to
budget
cuts
n
the
city
of
paterson
new
jersey
eliminated
one
quarter
of
its
police
force
officers
to
help
combat
a
million
city
budget
deficit
n
the
effects
of
such
cuts
are
even
more
staggering
when
considering
the
significant
amount
of
crime
that
each
of
these
cities
experiences
such
a
reduction
in
police
officers
has
forced
police
departments
to
alter
and
reduce
some
of
their
traditional
services
and
practices
many
police
departments
are
prioritizing
emergency
calls
over
non
emergency
calls
n
others
are
making
similar
though
difficult
decisions
on
what
problems
to
focus
on
given
their
more
limited
resources
for
example
some
departments
are
no
longer
responding
to
motor
vehicle
thefts
n
the
city
of
detroit
michigan
recently
followed
the
lead
of

that
there
is
a

n
in
a
response
to
a
reduction
of
sworn
police
officers
the
city
of
san
jose
california
adopted
a
modified
response
policy
that
reduces
the
number
of
police
responses

non
emergency
situations

this
end
the
san

in
which
no
one
is
injured
fruit

and
illegal

n
the
sjpd
also
followed
a
national
trend
of
severely
reducing
if
not
eliminating
its
horse
mounted
police
force
n
other
police
departments
reduced
their
investigation
follow
ups
with
property
computer
and
financial
crimes
non
felony
domestic
assaults
narcotics
and
other
such
crimes
n
some
localities
are
reducing
or
eliminating
police
services
for
community
events
such
as
parades
funerals
and
high
school
football
games
n
finally
cutbacks
have
forced
some
police
departments
to
require
residents
to
file
their
own
reports
online
or
in
writing
for
lower
level
crimes
such
as
break
ins
n
with
the
reductions
in
police
personnel
that
many
cities
are
experiencing
some
police
departments
have
no
choice
but
to
make
such
difficult
decisions
partnering
with
private
security
firms
and
civilianizing
police
work
cities
and
their
police
departments
have
also
tried
to
cut
costs
by
working
with
private
security
firms
or
at
least
allowing
them
to
function
in
certain
capacities
and
locations
n
the
use
of
private
security
guards
in
specific
areas
of
a
city
in
downtown
or
particular
tourist
locations
was
not
uncommon
before
the
great
recession
n
however
the
recent
budget
cuts
have
led
some
police
departments
to
collaborate
with
or
even
hire
private
security
firms
to
help
them
with
providing
police
services
for
example
the
minneapolis
police
department
mpd
collaborates
with
private
security
officers
in
the
downtown
business
district
to
help
reduce
crime
through
enhanced
communication
wireless
cameras
placed
in
strategic
locations
and
mpd
training
of
these
private
security
officers
n
cities
such
as
las
vegas
nevada
wilmington
delaware
new
york
city
new
york
and
durham
north
carolina
have
all
collaborated
with
private
security
firms
to
reduce
their
costs
while
maintaining
their
effectiveness
n
some
cities
have
even
sought
to
go
further
than
such
collaborations
the
city
council
in
oakland
california
had
originally
voted
to
hire
private
armed
security
guards
to
patrol
high
crime
areas
of
the
city
but
the
contract
was
later
rescinded
when
the
company
with
whom
it
contracted
international
services
inc
was
indicted
for
fraud
n
with
the
significant
cost
savings
in
private
security
officers
compared
to
sworn
public
police
officers
it
is
no
wonder
that
many
cities
are
exploring
how
they
might
use
or
partner
with
private
security
firms
other
police
departments
have
increased
the
duties
of
civilian
workers
by
assigning
them
tasks
that
deputized
police
officers
have
traditionally
performed
by
shifting
such
clerical
and
non
law
enforcement
activities
to
civilians
police
departments
can
deploy
their
sworn
officers
into
the
field
to
deal
with
more
pressing
crime
needs
n
some
cities
have
explored
responsibilities
for
civilians
beyond
the
traditional
clerical
activities
for
example
the
city
of
mesa
arizona
created
a
civilian
investigation
unit
in
to
respond
to
low
level
crimes
and
conduct
investigations
n
these
civilian
investigators
take
initial
reports
and
collect
dna
and
fingerprints
at
the
crime
scene
but
they
are
not
armed
and
do
not
have
the
authority
to
make
an
arrest
n
the
city
of
chicago
illinois
has
similarly
sought
to
cut
costs
by
civilianizing
traditional
police
work
hiring
civilian
detention
aides
at
city
jails
and
transferring
the
police
officers
stationed
there
to
beat
patrols
n
such
civilianization
has
helped
many
cities
save
money
in
an
era
of
dwindling
budgets
n
combining
or
regionalizing
police
service
some
cities
and
suburbs
have
explored
the
idea
of
combining
or
regionalizing
police
service
modeled
after
regional
police
service
approaches
in
san
francisco
california
denver
colorado
las
vegas
nevada
and
san
antonio
texas
many
communities
have
sought
to
either
merge
city
police
departments
and
county
sheriff
departments
or
merge
small
suburban
police
forces
into
a
regional
police
force
n
in
one
survey
twenty
six
percent
of
responding
police
departments
reported
that
their
county
partnered
with
a
neighboring
county
to
consolidate
police
service
while
another
thirty
one
percent
of
respondents
have
had
discussions
with
other
localities
regarding
such
consolidation
n
other
cities
have
even
disbanded
their
police
departments
and
contracted
with
their
local
sheriff
s
department
for
police
services
n
while
such
proposals
to
combine
or
regionalize
police
services
are
often
met
with
resistance
and
controversy
because
of
concerns
about
centralizing
a
government
service
as
community
tailored
as
policing
and
crime
prevention
consolidation
regionalization
or
even
outsourcing
policing
services
to
the
local
sheriff
s
department
may
be
the
most
cost
effective
way
for
some
communities
to
deal
with
the
current
economic
times
cost
cutting
measures
and
new
revenue
sources
some
cities
are
attempting
to
counter
budget
reductions
through
various
cost
saving
measures
for
example
chicago
is
seeking
to
curtail
the
police
department
s
current
sick
leave
policy
and
to
close
underutilized
police
stations
n
many
police
departments
have
been
forced
to
cut
back
or
eliminate
plans
to
acquire
technology
to
aid
in
their
work
n
other
local
governments
have
sought
to
reduce
expenses
at
their
jails
given
that
medical
costs
are
the
largest
service
costs
for
most
local
government
jails
it
is
unsurprising
that
cities
have
sought
to
save
money
on
these
expenses
n
some
counties
have
begun
treating
patients
inside
of
the
jails
instead
of
transferring
them
to
external
facilities
switching
from
name
brand
medications
to
generic
ones
and
creating
better
monitoring
of
inmate
medication
distribution
and
use
to
decrease
the
amount
of
unused
medicine
n
other
local
governments
have
privatized
the
medical
services
that
they
provide
in
their
jails
in
an
attempt
to
save
money
n
some
counties
have
sought
to
reduce
the
cost
of
feeding
their
inmates
for
example
fourteen
counties
in
new
york
are
saving
money
by
purchasing
cook
chill
food
products
that
allow
a
mere
reheating
of
the
food
to
be
served
to
inmates
n
the
switch
to
this
type
of
food
preparation
model
is
estimated
to
save
these
counties
an
average
of
per
inmate
per
year
n
sauk
county
wisconsin
no
longer
provides
warm
breakfast
for
inmates
and
instead
serves
only
cold
cereal
saving
approximately
per
year
n
polk
county
florida
eliminated
peanut
butter
and
jelly
sandwiches
cornbread
coffee
and
juice
from
its
jail
menu
to
save
money
n
the
sandusky
county
jail
in
ohio
grows
produce
in
a
garden
to
use
for
meals
in
the
jail
an
effort
that
has
saved
in
food
costs
n
some
counties
have
also
pursued
privatization
of
their
food
services
which
will
save
one
county
at
least
per
year
n
local
governments
have
also
attempted
a
hodgepodge
of
other
cost
cutting
measures
to
address
the
financial
strains
their
budgets
face
to
save
on
electricity
costs
hays
county
jail
in
texas
moved
lights
out
from
a
m
to
p
m
n
the
barrow
county
detention
center
in
georgia
mandated
that
all
incoming
and
outgoing
mail
be
in
the
form
of
postcards
to
reduce
the
time
spent
on
opening
and
inspecting
mail
n
some
localities
have
used
inmates
for
general
labor
such
as
mowing
lawns
shoveling
snow
picking
up
litter
weeding
maintaining
parks
and
caring
for
buildings
which
enables
them
to
cut
the
costs
of
these
services
from
their
respective
budgets
n
finally
some
localities
are
considering
consolidating
jails
and
jail
services
in
order
to
save
money
n
these
are
just
some
examples
of
the
lengths
that
local
governments
are
going
to
in
order
to
cut
costs
given
the
current
budget
cuts
to
public
safety
spending
cities
are
also
looking
to
nontraditional
revenue
sources
in
an
attempt
to
maintain
current
staffing
and
service
levels
for
example
chicago
proposes
raising
million
in
new
revenue
through
the
reallocation
of
tax
increment
financing
tif
funds
in
order
to
hire
new
police
officers
n
many
localities
have
used
fundraising
and
community
philanthropic
efforts
to
raise
additional
revenue
n
several
counties
in
michigan
wood
county
in
wisconsin
and
riverside
county
in
california
have
all
started
billing
inmates
for
their
stay
in
jail
n
polk
county
florida
now
charges
male
inmates
for
underwear
a
move
that
has
an
estimated
savings
of
per
year
n
riverside
county
california
also
plans
on
charging
inmates
for
using
public
defenders
n
b
creative
alternatives
to
traditional
incarceration
other
local
governments
are
using
the
current
budget
crises
to
rethink
their
traditional
approaches
to
policing
including
the
broken
windows
approach
to
community
policing
which
have
focused
heavily
on
incarceration
indeed
the
financial
realities
of
an
incarceration
dominant
approach
to
policing
pose
an
expensive
challenge
for
most
local
governments
to
illustrate
the
point
a
city
or
county
often
spends
or
more
per
day
to
house
a
criminal
or
someone
accused
of
a
crime
a
daunting
figure
given
the
increase
in
the
number
of
incarcerated
individuals
in
most
jails
n
it
is
no
wonder
then
that
many
localities
are
rethinking
an
incarceration
dominated
approach
to
community
policing
but
to
simply
look
at
the
creative
alternatives
described
below
as
solely
money
based
would
be
to
oversimplify
these
cities
and
counties
motivations
as
this
sub
section
and
the
milwaukee
county
experience
detailed
below
demonstrate
those
in
the
criminal
justice
system
in
many
localities
are
seeking
to
approach
the
problems
of
crime
and
disorder
in
a
smarter
and
arguably
more
effective
manner
than
the
traditional
tough
on
crime
ethos
that
has
pervaded
the
criminal
justice
system
and
political
discourse
more
generally
for
decades
while
the
costs
of
the
current
system
may
be
a
significant
motivating
factor
for
why
these
communities
are
rethinking
their
approach
to
the
criminal
justice
system
the
communities
impetus
also
stems
from
a
desire
to
better
achieve
their
goals
for
a
safe
community
and
to
help
those
who
may
need
social
service
support
to
avoid
recidivism
and
problems
in
the
future
many
localities
are
using
house
arrest
for
pretrial
detainees
for
parolees
and
even
as
a
criminal
sentence
n
local
governments
design
these
programs
to
enable
those
who
commit
or
are
accused
of
committing
certain
low
level
nonviolent
crimes
to
serve
their
sentences
at
home
monitored
by
an
electronic
ankle
bracelet
n
one
obvious
benefit
for
these
localities
comes
in
the
form
of
cost
savings
such
as
not
having
to
pay
for
an
inmate
s
health
care
food
and
other
related
expenses
in
this
regard
the
results
have
been
promising
thus
far
scottsdale
arizona
for
example
saved
in
the
first
five
weeks
of
its
electronic
monitoring
program
for
drunk
driving
cases
and
cook
county
illinois
cut
its
cost
per
detainee
from
per
day
to
with
electronic
monitoring
n
however
such
programs
also
seek
to
avoid
substantially
disrupting
the
lives
of
those
accused
of
crimes
or
those
who
have
committed
low
level
crimes
in
doing
so
these
programs
aim
to
help
these
people
avoid
a
downward
spiral
of
more
frequent
and
more
serious
criminal
acts
because
they
have
lost
their
jobs
and
support
systems
for
example
house
arrest
and
electronic
monitoring
programs
aim
to
allow
these
low
risk
criminals
to
hold
or
continue
to
hold
jobs
and
enjoy
the
help
and
support
of
their
families
factors
that
can
help
these
criminals
avoid
recidivism
n
for
example
dallas
county
texas
saved
in
the
first
year
of
its
house
arrest
program
and
it
also
saw
out
of
the
offenders
successfully
complete
the
program
n
through
such
programs
local
governments
seek
to
help
ensure
that
those
accused
or
convicted
of
minor
crimes
who
are
not
serious
threats
to
the
community
can
maintain
some
semblance
of
their
normal
lives
and
thus
avoid
the
significant
costs
and
disruptions
that
often
come
with
being
arrested
or
convicted
of
such
low
level
crimes
localities
are
also
adopting
or
expanding
alternatives
to
traditional
incarceration
such
as
work
release
and
halfway
houses
work
release
programs
allow
nonviolent
misdemeanor
and
low
level
felony
offenders
to
maintain
jobs
in
the
community
while
serving
their
ordered
jail
sentence
n
in
order
to
be
eligible
for
and
complete
a
work
release
program
the
convicted
criminal
must
obtain
a
written
order
from
a
judge
comport
with
the
rules
of
the
program
and
maintain
a
job
n
some
counties
have
used
weekend
incarceration
and
work
release
in
conjunction
with
electronic
monitoring
to
enable
inmates
to
work
at
county
facilities
such
as
the
zoo
or
veterans
cemetery
and
also
allow
them
to
sleep
at
home
after
work
n
other
counties
have
linked
work
release
with
halfway
homes
a
scenario
where
inmates
sleep
at
the
halfway
house
at
night
but
leave
during
the
day
for
their
court
approved
work
n
finally
some
counties
have
established
day
reporting
centers
for
nonviolent
offenders
usually
alcohol
and
drug
abusers
who
cannot
make
bail
n
under
a
traditional
system
these
offenders
would
spend
weeks
in
jail
waiting
for
court
hearings
for
failure
to
post
bail
under
the
day
reporting
center
programs
these
offenders
report
daily
to
the
center
and
are
subject
to
random
drug
tests
n
in
addition
these
offenders
receive
vocational
training
and
if
they
complete
the
program
successfully
they
can
avoid
jail
altogether
and
hopefully
avoid
recidivism
in
the
future
n
counties
have
similarly
adopted
specialty
courts
to
complement
such
diversion
programs
in
an
attempt
to
help
offenders
with
their
underlying
problems
through
social
service
programs
and
to
avoid
recidivism
many
counties
set
up
these
courts
to
help
channel
those
whose
criminal
acts
stem
from
drug
addiction
or
mental
health
issues
into
treatment
programs
that
will
help
them
deal
with
their
underlying
problem
these
programs
serve
as
alternatives
to
simply
incarcerating
these
individuals
and
then
in
all
likelihood
releasing
them
to
commit
the
same
types
of
crimes
because
their
underlying
disorder
was
not
addressed
while
in
jail
n
for
example
the
city
of
greenwood
minnesota
uses
a
program
in
which
substance
abusers
enter
a
recovery
court
program
where
the
abuser
lives
at
home
but
cannot
use
drugs
or
alcohol
and
cannot
live
with
anyone
who
uses
drugs
n
recovery
court
supervisors
randomly
show
up
at
the
participant
s
house
to
check
for
alcohol
or
drug
use
and
ensure
compliance
with
the
program
s
requirements
n
the
program
also
forbids
participants
from
going
to
locations
where
drugs
or
alcohol
are
used
n
if
participants
break
these
rules
they
become
subjected
to
more
restrictive
rules
and
may
ultimately
be
sent
to
jail
n
as
this
example
demonstrates
the
purpose
of
such
specialty
courts
is
to
reduce
recidivism
by
helping
treat
the
criminal
offender
s
underlying
problem
while
at
the
same
time
saving
money
by
keeping
them
out
of
jail
initially
n
as
described
further
below
some
local
governments
are
moving
to
evidence
based
practices
to
make
smarter
decisions
as
to
how
to
police
their
communities
and
how
to
administer
their
criminal
justice
system
for
example
napa
county
california
designed
a
matrix
program
that
rates
prisoners
on
certain
factors
to
determine
who
is
too
dangerous
to
release
before
their
sentences
end
and
who
is
truly
nonviolent
and
could
be
eligible
for
diversion
or
early
release
programs
n
graduates
of
the
napa
county
matrix
program
have
a
employment
rate
and
only
a
recidivism
rate
compared
to
the
statewide
recidivism
rate
of
approximately
n
the
napa
county
model
has
been
so
successful
that
the
american
civil
liberties
union
has
called
upon
other
california
counties
to
develop
evidence
based
solutions
for
alternatives
to
incarceration
and
reentry
instead
of
adding
jail
beds
n
finally
many
local
governments
have
shifted
their
operational
models
to
include
enhanced
technology
that
allows
police
departments
to
improve
their
outcomes
and
increase
efficiency
n
some
police
departments
have
begun
to
use
certain
public
surveillance
systems
such
as
closed
circuit
televisions
and
light
based
intervention
systems
that
can
act
as
force
multipliers
through
incident
intervention
and
crime
prevention
without
requiring
the
immediate
presence
of
an
officer
n
other
police
departments
are
using
geographical
technology
such
as
the
tactical
automatic
vehicle
locator
which
reduces
response
times
by
providing
the
locations
of
patrol
cars
and
allowing
commanders
to
dispatch
the
closest
patrol
car
with
far
greater
precision
and
efficiency
n
other
police
departments
have
taken
greater
leaps
of
faith
with
technology
due
to
severe
budget
cuts
for
example
the
santa
cruz
police
department
scpd

the
scpd
started
experimenting
with
a
predictive

model
n
based
on
technology
that
helps
predict
aftershocks
of

this
predictive
policing
model
uses
crime
data
to
identify
specific
areas
and
even
specific
times
in
which
crime
is
most
likely
to
occur
n
this
model
enables
the
scpd
to
send
patrols
to
certain
hotspots
each
day
which
it
believes
serves
as
a
deterrent
and
allows
for
better
responsiveness
and
thus
likelihood
of
arrest
when
a
crime
occurs
n
based
on
the
perceived
success
of
the
scpd
s
predictive
policing
model
other
cities
such
as
los

are
hoping
to
develop
similar
models
including
ones
that
model
both

violent
crimes
n
in
an
era
of
budget
cuts

such
technological
advances
and
other
evidence

help
evolve

an
approach

with
the

that
they

years
some

have
concluded
that

must
change
their
approach
to
community
policing
to
continue
to
be
effective
in

the

by

entitled
getting

about

n
two
of
the
key
objectives
to
this
movement
were
to
reduce
reliance
on

term
incarceration
as
a
criminal
sanction
for
those
not
posing
a

launched
its

the
nic

initiative
was
driven
by
the
belief
that
research
could
better
inform

and
that
it
would
lead
to
better
outcomes
for
public

more
generally

in
this

the
confluence
of
these
events
helped
bring
greater
clarity
to
the
problems
challenges
and
needs
of
many
communities

their
criminal

the
goals
were
also

keeping

n
in

how
can

be
smarter
about
running

systems
given
the
changes
and
movements
in
the
criminal

in

n
evidence

that
has
been
popular
in
the
health
care
field
and
human

fields

apply
the
best
available

the

by
using
empirical
findings

can
use

all
aspects

from
policing
to

to
alter

cases
retool
long

approaches
that
are
no
longer
economically
sustainable
nor
perhaps
normatively
desirable
n
in
order
to
thoroughly
inculcate
evidence
based
decision
making
in
this
manner
local
governments
must
foster
meaningful
collaboration
between
the
partners
in
the
criminal

those
entities
providing
various

these

and
interconnected
decision
points
and
the
significant
number
of
decision
makers
and
stakeholder
groups
a
locality
s
emphasis
on
collaboration
is
critical
to
achieving
the
effectiveness
and
efficiency
sought
by
evidence
based
decision
making
such
collaboration
may
involve
the
police
working
with
prosecutors
and
other
law
enforcement
professionals
to
solve
a
problem
oftentimes
a
solution
along
the
lines
of
a
traditional
enforcement
strategy
such
as
arresting
an
individual
and
prosecuting
a
crime
n
however
under
the
evidence
based
decision
making
approach
law
enforcement
will
also
look
to
other
governmental
agencies
for
assistance
in
solving
various
problems
for
example
a
community
prosecutor
might
work
with
a
city
s
building
department
to
identify
code
violations
when
targeting
a
drug
house
n
however
under
this
model
interagency
collaboration
also
seeks
to
be
proactive
to
solve
a
community
s
problems
before
they
occur
or
in
a
manner
that
addresses
the
underlying
cause
of
the
externalized
problems
so
that
they
dissipate
over
time
for
example
having
identified
that
almost
half
of
the
violent
crime
victims
in
the
city
are
teenagers
chicago
has
sought
to
expand
after
school
and
summer
programs
to
engage
at
risk
youth
in
positive
activities
n
moreover
as
discussed
above
the
alternatives
to
incarceration
for
those
offenders
who
are
mentally
ill
or
suffer
from
drug
or
alcohol
addiction
also
provide
examples
of
such
collaboration
between
those
in
the
criminal
justice
system
and
social
service
providers
finally
and
perhaps
most
relevant
from
a
macro
level
perspective
these
various
stakeholders
and
decision
makers
must
collaborate
to
determine
how
the
research
they
have
compiled
and
analyzed
guides
their
decision
making
at
the
various
decision
points
in
the
criminal
justice
system
to
further
their
goals
set
their
priorities
and
allocate
their
resources
such
collaboration
can
lead
to
many
of
the
types
of
alternatives
to
incarceration
described
above
that
localities
have
implemented
there
is
no
doubt
that
part
of
what
drives
this
evidence
based
decision
making
approach
is
the
recognition
that
with
declining
revenues
and
budget
cuts
police
departments
and
criminal
justice
systems
must
stretch
their
resources
to
do
more
with
less
n
in
doing
so
evidence
based
decision
making
strives
to
improve
the
outcomes
and
the
efficiency
and
effectiveness
of
the
criminal
justice
system
while
also
saving
money
in
this
regard
evidence
based
decision
making
may
help
local
governments
remain
consistent
with
the
broken
windows
theory
of
community
policing
while
addressing
the
problems
presented
by
the
great
recession
n
b
questions
concerns
criticisms
and
challenges
to
be
sure
with
evidence
based
decision
making
still
in
its
infancy
in
policing
and
in
the
criminal
justice
system
there
are
still
many
questions
concerns
and
challenges
that
must
be
answered
and
resolved
n
for
example
politics
still
plays
and
will
likely
continue
to
play
a
critical
role
in
policing
and
the
criminal
justice
system
as
politicians
do
not
want
to
be
labeled
soft
on
crime
political
decision
making
on
public
safety
matters
does
not
always
comport
with
decisions
based
on
social
science
research
indeed
political
decisions
regarding
public
safety
matters
can
be
spurred
by
irrational
public
moral
panics
that
is
a
horrible
crime
that
leads
to
an
emotional
wave
of
public
repugnance
and
a
demand
for
quick
political
action
n
such
reactive
political
decision
making
may
not
always
be
grounded
in
social
science
research
but
rather
a
popular
political
fix
that
assures
the
community
that
its
public
officials
are
doing
what
constituents
think
is
best
whether
or
not
the
data
and
research
support
that
reaction
another
challenge
for
the
adoption
of
evidence
based
decision
making
either
from
a
normative
and
or
logistical
standpoint
is
that
there
are
such
divergent
visions
and
philosophies
for
the
optimal
approach
to
public
safety
and
the
criminal
justice
system
n
this
reality
is
exacerbated
by
the
fact
that
there
is
a
power
imbalance
among
the
various
agencies
and
stakeholders
in
the
criminal
justice
system
which
makes
the
collaboration
described
above
even
more
challenging
n
to
add
to
this
difficulty
there
is
systemic
fragmentation
in
the
way
that
various
states
and
local
governments
choose
to
structure
and
run
their
respective
criminal
justice
systems
n
this
lack
of
uniformity
creates
a
logistical
impediment
to
the
emergence
of
a
broad
evidence
based
decision
making
movement
as
one
model
cannot
be
so
easily
replicated
in
most
if
not
every
jurisdiction
n
finally
evidence
is
not
always
clear
and
can
even
be
contradictory
at
times
so
there
is
still
a
need
for
good
old
fashioned
judgment
in
making
decisions
involving
policies
programs
resources
and
the
like
in
policing
and
the
criminal
justice
system
judgment
that
will
no
doubt
draw
criticism
from
those
who
do
not
favor
the
decisions
made
moreover
in
the
criminal
justice
field
there
has
not
been
a
deeply
embedded
research
and
knowledge
based
culture
which
may
lead
to
great
resistance
in
adopting
evidence
based
decision
making
n
even
if
desired
such
a
cultural
shift
may
prove
even
more
difficult
because
the
leadership
in
many
criminal
justice
organizations
do
not
have
the
training
necessary
to
effect
organizational
change
n
nevertheless
despite
these
criticisms
questions
and
challenges
for
the
reasons
detailed
above
several
localities
have
moved
to
adopt
evidence
based
decision
making
in
their
police
departments
and
criminal
justice
systems
more
generally
as
part
of
an
evolution

their
approach

milwaukee
county
in

milwaukee
is
one
of
three
local
governments
from
around
the
country
that
won
a
grant
competition
sponsored
by
the
u
s
department
of

national
institute
of

to
encourage
and
help
fund
the
adoption

through
the
milwaukee

council
mccjc
a
collaboration

partnership
between
the
various
partners
in

milwaukee
has
sought
to
adopt
and
implement
evidence
based
decision
making
over
the
past
few
years
n
the
mccjc
s
guiding
principle
in
this
endeavor
has
been
the
following
i
n
assessing
an
offender
s
risk
of
reoffense
and
criminogenic
needs
and
in
matching
offenders
with
the
appropriate
supervision
treatment
and
jail
resources
systems
like
ours
should
employ
instruments
built
on
actuarial
data
as
opposed
to

judgment
alone
n
indeed
by
using
data
and
research
described
further
below
milwaukee
believes
it
can
reduce
the
number
of
people
being
held
in

save
significant
amounts
of
money
and
maintain
or
even
improve
the
level
of
public
safety
to
which
the
community
is
accustomed
n
moreover
consistent
with
one
of
the
key
tenets
of
evidence
based
decision
making
the
mccjc
brings
together
a
vast
array
of
partners
and
stakeholders
in
the
milwaukee
criminal
justice
system
the

at

times
they
are
united
in
advancing
a
meaningful
and
ambitious
evidence
based
decision
making
approach
to
the
criminal
justice
system
n
with
the
nic
grant
milwaukee
seeks
to
dramatically
expand
its
evidence
based
decision
making
particularly
in
four
key
areas
first
based
on
promising
results
from
pilot
projects
in
previous
years
the
milwaukee
police
department
will
train
more
of
its
field
officers
booking
officers
and
dispatchers
as
to
how
to
respond
effectively
to
those
who
are
mentally
ill
and
to
improve
communication
with
others
in
the
criminal
justice
system
those
in
jails
prosecutors
defense
attorneys
and
court
officials
regarding
the
challenges
that
these
individuals
will
face
as
they
progress
through
the
system
n
the
mccjc
will
also
be
able
to
identify
those
chronic
offenders
with
mental
illness
who
account
for
the
majority
of
police
service
calls
and
help
them
seek
treatment
for
their
underlying
condition
to
avoid
future
problems
n
to
gauge
its
success
in
this
effort
the
mccjc
has
set
a
goal
that
by
the
end
of
it
will
have
reduced
by
those
suffering
from
a
mental
illness
who
lose
their
benefits
or
housing
for
being
jailed
and
increase
by
those
who
have
a
mental
illness
who
reconnect
with
services
they
need
within
twenty
days
of
arrest
n
second
the
mccjc
intends
to
use
and
enhance
the
information
it
has
to
help
identify
cases
that
will
likely
be
successful
in
a
diversion
program
or
in
a
deferred
prosecution
scenario
n
the
mccjc
will
use
assessment
tools
to
gauge
the
risks
and
needs
of
offenders
and
negotiate
the
diversion
or
deferred
prosecution
agreement
accordingly
n
in
addition
it
will
create
an
evidence
based
matrix
that
delineates
incentives
and
sanctions
to
ensure
compliance
with
this
approach
n
to
evaluate
the
efficacy
of
this
program
the
mccjc
has
set
a
three
fold
goal
by
the
end
of
increasing
by
the
number
of
pretrial
detainees
safely
released
and
or
supervised
in
the
community
as
opposed
to
jail
saving
million
in
the
process
and
reducing
by
a
minimum
of
the
number
of
defendants
who
fail
to
follow
pretrial
rules
n
third
the
mccjc
seeks
to
aggressively
change
its
risk
needs
management
of
its
pretrial
population
currently
milwaukee
s
bail
hearings
are
done
in
an
ad
hoc
fashion
where
decisions
are
made
largely
on
the
basis
of
the
current
charge
the
defendant
s
criminal
history
and
the
judge
s
intuition
and
professional
judgment
n
the
mccjc
has
studied
other
jurisdictions
approaches
to
pretrial
decisions
and
has
developed
a
new
protocol
for
conducting
a
risk
assessment
for
each
individual
as
he
or
she
enters
the
criminal
justice
system
n
based
on
the
data
and
evidence
from
other
jurisdictions
this
protocol
will
award
points
to
a
person
based
on
factors
such
as
the
number
of
previous
criminal
cases
in
which
the
person
was
involved
the
person
s
record
for
appearing
in
court
in
those
cases
and
whether
he
or
she
is
employed
or
is
a
primary
caregiver
n
depending
on
the
number
of
points
the
person
gets
he
or
she
will
fall
into
one
of
four
categories
that
represents
the
risk
level
associated
with
that
person
under
the
protocol
n
this
categorization
will
then
be
considered
against
the
nature
of
the
crime
the
person
allegedly
committed
n
judges
will
be
equipped
with
a
grid
that
helps
them
determine
whether
and
at
what
amount
to
set
bail
and
what
conditions
if
any
should
be
placed
on
a
defendant
s
release
n
the
mccjc
envisions
this
type
of
informed
evidence
based
decision
making
will
ensure
maximization
of
the
various
pretrial
supervision
and
detention
options
n
in
order
to
gauge
whether
it
has
been
successful
with
this
program
the
mccjc
has
set
a
goal
of
increasing
by
ten
percent
the
number
of
successful
diversions
or
deferred
prosecutions
and
saving
a
minimum
of
in
doing
so
by
the
end
of
n
finally
the
mcjcc
wants
to
adopt
a
dosage
based
probation
plan
n
based
on
research
demonstrating
that
probation
services
are
unnecessary
after
a
certain
period
of
time
milwaukee
seeks
to
begin
a
pilot
program
that
provides
early
termination
of
probation
for
probationers
who
accomplish
certain
risk
reducing
objectives
n
the
mccjc
will
do
so
by
creating
a
program
based
on
evidence
from
this
research
developing
a
profile
of
the
type
of
probationer
that
might
be
successful
in
such
a
program
tracking
the
group
and
comparing
it
to
other
probationers
to
test
the
efficacy
of
the
program
n
probation
then
would
be
terminated
early
once
the
offender
received
sufficient
treatment
as
defined
by
this
program
to
measure
its
success
with
this
plan
the
mccjc
has
set
a
goal
to
be
able
to
prove
by
the
end
of
that
milwaukee
can
cut
probation
costs
and
reduce
recidivism
by
a
minimum
of
fifty
percent
n
in
these
regards
milwaukee
seeks
to
not
just
be
tough
on
crime
but
also
be
smart
on
crime
n
for
example
twenty
six
percemt
of
those
in
milwaukee
county
jails
awaiting
trial
have
bail
set
at
or
less
but
they
cannot
afford
to
pay
it
to
be
released
n
however
it
costs
milwaukee
per
person
per
night
to
keep
these
individuals
in
jail
n
moreover
and
perhaps
more
importantly
the
evidence
collected
by
the
mccjc
demonstrates
that
these
individuals
would
not
pose
even
a
moderate
risk
to
the
community
if
released
as
demonstrated
by
their
incredibly
low
bail
n
this
problem
demonstrates
economic
inefficiencies
in
the
current
system
that
do
not
protect
the
community
from
any
meaningful
risk
the
aforementioned
reforms
in
pretrial
decision
making
attempt
to
create
a
smarter
criminal
justice
system
in
milwaukee
based
on
evidence
that
informs
those
in
the
system
as
to
how
to
treat
on
the
one
hand
the
large
majority
of
cases
that
involve
low
level
non
dangerous
offenders
and
on
the
other
hand
those
that
involve
violent
or
dangerous
defendants
n
in
this
regard
the
mccjc
endeavors
to
protect
the
public
but
make
sensible
cost
effective
and
evidence
based
decisions
regarding
those
offenders
who
do
not
pose
a
meaningful
risk
to
the
community
and
who
have
a
high
likelihood
of
reform
through
various
interventions
in
doing
so
milwaukee
strives
to
stay
consistent
with
the
broken
windows
approach
to
community
policing
while
also
grappling
with
the
financial
realities
it
faces
viii
conclusion
will
the
great
recession
mark
the
beginning
of
the
end
of
community
policing
and
the
broken
windows
theory
it
is
highly
unlikely
on
the
other
hand
there
is
no
doubt
that
the
financial
and
budgetary
realities
that
cities
and
police
departments
currently
face
and
may
face
for
some
time
pose
challenges
to
continuing
a
broken
windows
theory
approach
to
community
policing
in
most
localities
while
some
of
the
non
essential
cost
cutting
measures
may
help
maintain
a
good
portion
of
the
police
and
criminal
justice
infrastructure
necessary
to
continue
this
approach
in
some
communities
the
reality
is
that
most
cities
are
experiencing
deep
enough
cuts
in
their
officer
ranks
non
officer
personnel
and
other
resources
that
some
impact
will
occur
police
departments
may
have
to
do
more
with
less
but
they
may
also
have
to
determine
that
certain
aspects
of
police
services
that
they
used
to
provide
e
g
responses
to
non
bodily
injury
traffic
accidents
illegal
parking
every
burglar
alarm
whether
it
is
confirmed
that
a
burglar
entered
the
home
or
building
and
the
like
are
no
longer
sustainable
at
current
staffing
and
funding
levels
an
interesting
possibility
to
watch
in
the
coming
years
is
whether
the
police
s
non
responsiveness
to
such
low
level
crimes
and
signs
of
disorder
wind
up
signaling
a
lack
of
social
order
in
those
communities
that
have
adopted
such
policies
and
whether
that
leads
to
a
devolution
in
crime
consistent
with
the
broken
windows
theory
these
difficult
economic
times
pose
such
a
challenge
for
many
communities
because
the
broken
windows
approach
to
community
policing
is
a
resource
and
time
intensive
model
for
dealing
with
crime
while
some
question
whether
this
approach
has
contributed
to
or
is
responsible
for
the
reduction
in
crime
during
the
past
two
decades
it
is
clear
that
the
law
enforcement
community
has
embraced
this
approach
and
is
likely
unwilling
to
abandon
it
unless
absolutely
necessary
n
however
as
detailed
above
changes
in
police
structuring
and
practices
have
already
begun
and
they
may
continue
for
years
into
the
future
as
the
effects
of
the
economic
downturn
are
still
impacting
local
governments
today
n
these
tumultuous
times
may
provide
an
opportunity
for
many
communities
to
rethink
their
broken
windows
theory
approach
to
community
policing
and
restructure
it
in
a
manner
that
remains
consistent
with
the
theory
but
properly
balances
the
economic
realities
that
they
face
the
evidence
based
decision
making
approach
in
milwaukee
is
by
no
means
a
singular
example
of
the
types
of
creative
and
potentially
more
efficacious
responses
to
the
criminal
justice
and
social
service
needs
in
a
community
that
attempt
to
comport
with
tighter
and
smaller
budgets
indeed
it
is
one
of
many
examples
that
could
become
a
trend
given
current
circumstances
for
in
such
challenges
may
lie
opportunity
for
police
departments
and
the
criminal
justice
and
social
service
systems
more
generally
to
innovate
become
more

still
remain

this
point
underscores
a
lesser
known
foundational
premise
of
the
broken

theory
that

that

do
consider

a
judgment
about
how
safe
their
neighborhood
is
n
id
n

the
broken
windows
moniker
derived
from
an
experiment
conducted
by
philip
zimbardo
where
he
left
a
car
sitting
in
the
bronx
in
new
york
city
new
york
and
another
in
palo
alto
california
id
the
bronx
at
the
time
was
filled
with
disorder
and
crime
and
the
car
was
vandalized
within
ten
minutes
the
car
left
in
palo
alto
an
affluent
community
with
low
crime
and
minimal
disorder
was
left
untouched
for
more
than
a
week
until
zimbardo
broke
one
of
its
windows
with
a
sledgehammer
within
hours
of
zimbardo
doing
so
the
car
was
entirely
ruined
by
others
id
a
similar
metaphor
is
an
abandoned
manufacturing
plant
building
that
remains
untouched
until
a
window
is
broken
which
triggers
more
windows
being
broken
followed
by
vandalism
and
other
crimes
and
eventually
the
building
being
burned
to
the
ground
both
metaphorical
examples
serve
to
demonstrate
the
theory
that
even
in
an
orderly
neighborhood
once
there
are
visible
signs
of
acceptance
of
disorder
further
disorder

greater

jharkhand

adopting

an

such

is
to
take

the
method
the

would

by
for

believers

the
project
which
allows

is
a
wasteful
exercise
it
is
being
argued
that

would
be
ineffective
instruments

peeping
into
the
unpredictable
human
nature
of

it
has

the
strengthening

of
these
arguments
are
valid
to

in

crime

may

the

complies
crime

the
software
then
analyses
the
data
and
produces

predicting
future
crime
in
terms
of
locations
and
the
nature
of
crime
the
method
does
sound
incredible
is
yet
not
without
successes
several
of
the
police
departments
of
the
developed
world
are
gradually
taking
help
of
software
for
predictive

with
impressive
returns
for

use

the
scotland
yard
in
britain
has
popularised
facewatch
a
smart
phone
application
that
provides
the
viewers
the
pictures
of
suspects
who
may
be
in
their
areas
coming
across
such
a
suspect
people
can
alert
the
police
department
by
simply
tapping
on
the
suspect
s
image
critiques
of
the
futuristic
policing
models
argue
that
the
analytic
capacities
of
the
software
infuses
no
additional
expertise
police
officials
use
past
data
and
their
own
analysis
to
identify
crime
patterns
while
that
is
true
it
is
also
a
fact
that
the
ability
to
identify
crime
patterns
is
intrinsically
linked
to
capacity
of
the
individual
officers
which
is
not
a
standard
quality
associated
with
all
police
officers
benefits
from
the
software
thus
could
be
immense
especially
for
states
which
have
dearth
of
officials
and
ground
level
personnel
vacancies
at
times
running
as
high
as
per
cent
the
software
would
provide
instantaneous
analyses
free
from
the
vagaries
of
delays
and
follies
associated
with
the
human
planning
the
system
would
thus
release
more
personnel
to
hit
the
road
tackling
crime
rather
than
being
busy
in
crime
trend
analyses
in
an
age
of
diminishing
budgets
police
departments
would
be
able
to
optimise
force
deployment
the
biggest
challenge
would
however
come
not
from
the
believers
in
conventional
policing
but
from
inside
the
police
establishment
and
the
legal
system
can
the
system
work
without
a
highly
responsive
and
alert
police
force
which
wholeheartedly
believes
in
the
new
operating
environment
would
the
courts
prosecute
suspects
arrested
on
the
basis
of
a
software
prediction
would
the
system
prevent
crimes
in
new
areas
the
fact
that
answer
to
all
these
questions
is
in
the
negative
does
not
take
away
anything
from
the
need
for
policing
to
go
futuristic
and
tech
savvy
the
predictive
policing
software
does
not
replace
the
conventional
policing
but
acts
as
an
enabler
it
facilitates
the
seamless
integration
of
the
merits
of
technology
with
the
skills
of
the
police
personnel
it
does
not
aim
at
solving
crimes
but
preventing
them
more
number
of
crimes
being
prevented
would
produce
less
criminals
in
the
court
and
aid
the
over
burdened
judiciary
of
all
the
states
jharkhand
is
probably
the
best
positioned
to
experiment
with
predictive
policing
carved
out
in
november
it
is
a
relatively
new
state
thereby
burdened
with
comparatively
less
data
to
be
fed
into
the
system
its
a
theatre
where
organised
crime
has
mixed
dangerously
with
extremism
and
conventional
criminal
activities
it
is
also
the
state
which
has
performed
exceptionally
well
in
terms
of
police
modernisation
especially
in
the
past
couple
of
years
jharkhand
s
success
would
possibly
spur
the
other
states
to
follow
suit

baskin
said
this

so
they
can
deter

actually
catch
someone
in
the

predpol
the
name
of
their
software
is
based
on
an
analytics
model
developed
by
a
group
of
researchers
including
mathematician
george
mohler
of
santa

university
the
model
used
data
gleaned
from
a
study
six
years
ago
at
the
los

police
department
the
lapd
which
started
testing
the
model
in
its
foothill
patrol
division
in

has
seen
a

drop
in
burglaries
and
a

reduction
in

crime
since
then
according
to
coonerty
by
comparison
crime
is
up

citywide
he
said
santa

zach

learned
about
the
model
in

and
began
working
with
mohler
last

to
test
it
at

santa
cruz
police
department
in
the
year
since
the
test
program
started
in
santa

burglaries
have
declined
by

friend
said
the
program
has
gained
international
media
attention
and
the
attention
of
law
enforcement
agencies
nationwide
many
asking
how
they
can
get
the
program
based
on
such
requests
friend
helped
coordinate
a
meeting
between
mohler
and
baskin

mcsorley
said
the
real

this

you
can
t
remember
the
hit
film
had
a
special
police
unit
which
was
able
to
arrest
murderers
before
they
committed
their
crimes
west
midlands
police
have
not
mentioned
murder
though
their
predictive
policing
scheme
will
deal
with
burglars
it
will
forecast
who
is
about
to
be
burgled
then
officers
can
go
round
and
warn
the
potential
victim
the
officers
won
t
just
tell
the
residents
that
they
re
under
threat
they
ll
check
to
see
if
their
door
locks
are
in
fully
working
order
and
see
if
they
ve
got
an
alarm
fitted
cops
are
also
going
to
check
the
routes
burglars
take
to
see
if
there
are
any
common
patterns
superintendent
alex
murray
who
is
leading
the
experiment
said
predictive
policing
is
about
understanding
where
crime
is
going
to
happen
before
it
s
taken
place
we
re
launching
two
experiments
to
see
if
we
can
make
an
impact
on
the
burglary
rates
before
burglary
has
actually
happened
apparently
previous
trials
took
place
in
the
suburbs
of
los
angeles
in
the
us
and
showed
promising
results
i
know
times
are
tough
but
does
the
force
really
think
this
type
of
tactic
is
going
to
make
up
for
axing
members
of
staff
in
a
bid
to
balance
budgets
the
home
office
seems
to
think
so
they
re
part
funding
the
scheme
it
might
be
dressed
up
as
some
kind
of
hi
tech
crime
fighting
gizmo
but
in
reality
this
has
got
all
the
originality
and
flair
of
discovering
that
bears
go
to
the
woods
to
relieve
themselves
apparently
the
pope
is
a
catholic
as
well
perhaps
instead
of
looking
to
the
future
they
should
look
at
those
ancient
laws
for
effective
ideas
to
help
burglary
victims
many
of
whom
feel
unsafe
in
their
own
homes
and
are
denied
the
right
to
protect
themselves
apparently
it

what

go

specialized

approximately
specialized
criminal
courts
in

the

on

largely
trapped

celebratory

expansion
of
these

as
a
peculiar
strategy
to
devise
alternatives
to

this

reveals
that
specialized

have
become

text
introduction
significant
change
is
afoot
in
u
s
criminal
law
there
remain
roughly
seven
million
people
incarcerated
on
probation
or
on
parole
in
the
united
states
n
a
quantum
of
criminal
law
oversight
roundly
condemned
by
commentators
across
the
political
spectrum
and
around
the
world
n
but
by
the
turn
of
the
twenty
first
century
largely
in
response
to
growing
censure
and
in
the
face
of
escalating
costs
states
across
the
country
committed
to
decrease
reliance
on
incarceration
n
alongside
state
initiated
reforms
federal
prison
conditions
litigation
contributed
further
incentives
to
decarcerate
most
notably
the
u
s
supreme
court
in
brown
v
plata
affirmed
an
order
of
a
specially
convened
three
judge
district
court
which
mandated
that
california
reduce
its
prison
population
by
prisoners
over
two
years
to
eliminate
unconstitutional
conditions
n
yet
while
pressures
to
decarcerate
mount
it
remains
unclear
how
it
will
be
possible
to
achieve
the
larger
scale
shifts
necessary
to
reach
and
sustain
markedly
lower
levels
of
criminal
prosecution
criminal
supervision
and
incarceration
n
as
one
part
of
a
broader
effort
to
reduce
reliance
on
conventional
probation
and
carceral
sentencing
beginning
in
the
early
s
state
court
judges
began
to
convene
specialized
criminal
courts
from
florida
to
california
michigan
to
texas
drug
courts
mental
health
courts
veterans
courts
and
reentry
courts
among
others
n
these
increasingly
popular
specialized
criminal
courts
of
which
there
are
approximately
in
the
united
states
and
its
territories
assume
various
legal
institutional
forms
and
divergent
jurisprudential
approaches
n
nonetheless
despite
considerable
variation
what
most
of
the
courts
share
in
common
is
the
goal
of
reducing
reliance
on
conventional
jail
and
prison
based
sentencing
in
favor
of
problem
oriented
alternatives
n
the
courts
also
empower
judges
to
adopt
neo
realist
problem
oriented
roles
embrace
less
adversarial
criminal
procedures
and
aspire
to
more
effectively
protect
public
safety
and
prevent
crime
n
it
is
uncertain
though
what
specialized
criminal
courts
actually
portend
are
these
courts
configured
in
a
manner
that
is
likely
to
facilitate
the
intended
goals
of
reduced
or
more
efficacious
criminal
supervision
and
reduced
incarceration
or
as
some
critics
charge
do
specialized
criminal
courts
improve
judges
experience
in
the
courts
by
emphasizing
anti
formalist
problem
oriented
proceedings
without
tending
to
resolve
the
legal
systemic
and
social
problems
the
courts
purport
to
address
n
this
article
offers
an
account
of
how
specialized
criminal
courts
may
enable
substantially
reduced
reliance
on
incarceration
as
well
as
more
general
transformative
criminal
law
reform
by
embracing
a
criminal
law
reformist
framework
which
i
term
a
decarceration
model
however
this
article
will
argue
that
in
their
currently
predominant
institutional
forms
specialized
criminal
courts
threaten
to
produce
a
range
of
unintended
and
undesirable
outcomes
unnecessarily
expanding
criminal
surveillance
diminishing
procedural
protections
and
potentially
even
increasing
incarceration
the
existing
scholarship
on
specialized
criminal
courts
treats
particular
substantively
specialized
criminal
courts
drug
courts
for
example
as
a
largely
undifferentiated
category
either
celebrating
or
proposing
the
abandonment
of
specialized
criminal
law
administration
across
the
board
on
the
one
hand
some
commentators
commend
specialized
criminal
courts
for
facilitating
a
quiet
revolution
among
american
criminal
courts
n
and
the
emergence
of
a
new
criminal
justice
paradigm
n
also
among
the
courts
supporters
are
those
who
herald
specialized
criminal
courts
as
experimentalist
governance
mechanisms
enabling
much
needed
social
and
legal
change
not
achievable
through
more
conventional
judicial
or
legislative
intervention
n
on
the
other
hand
the
courts
detractors
criminal
law
scholars
and
criminal
defense
lawyers
alike
have
called
for
the
abandonment
or
marked
scaling
back
of
specialized
criminal
courts
as
contraindicated
and
anathema
to
the
reformist
goals
the
courts
architects
hoped
to
achieve
largely
on
account
of
procedural
rights
concerns
n
both
of
these
sharply
divided
responses
approach
each
type
of
substantively
specialized
criminal
court
as
internally
homogeneous
and
either
entirely
praiseworthy
or
entirely
dangerous
accordingly
there
has
been
insufficient
attention
both
to
the
remarkable
variation
between
specialized
criminal
courts
and
to
the
different
consequences
potentially
associated
with
the
courts
divergent
approaches
this
article
demonstrates
instead
that
specialized
criminal
courts
have
become
the
locus
of
an
ongoing
contest
between
four
primary
competing
models
of
reformist
criminal
law
administration
these
models
are
characterized
by
dissimilar
legal
institutional
features
and
distinct
ideological
and
theoretical
commitments
and
these
divergent
approaches
push
in
quite
different
directions
in
terms
of
their
likely
effects
on
incarceration
practices
levels
of
criminal
supervision
and
other
desired
criminal
law
reforms
consider
this
motley
assortment
of
specialized
criminal
courts
and
the
various
criminal
offenses
sentences
ideologies
and
possible
outcomes
associated
with
each
first
the
veterans
court
of
okemos
michigan
and
the
case
of
staff
sergeant
brad
eifert
a
veteran
of
the
iraq
war
armed
with
a
caliber
pistol
eifert
initiated
a
shoot
out
with
police
in
the
woods
adjacent
to
his
home
the
police
were
out
there
somewhere
and
one
way
or
the
other
eifert
was
ready
to
die
he
raised
the
gun
to
his
head
and
then
lowered
it
then
he
fired
nine
rounds
leaving
his
weapon
he
ran
into
the
driveway
shouting
shoot
me
shoot
me
shoot
me
the
police
officers
subdued
him
with
a
taser
and
arrested
him
a
few
hours
later
he
sat
in
a
cell
at
the
ingham
county
jail
charged
with
five
counts
of
assault
with
intent
to
murder
the
officers
each
carrying
a
potential
life
sentence
eifert
having
pleaded
guilty
to
a
single
charge
of
carrying
a
weapon
with
unlawful
intent
a
felony
will
officially
enter
the
veterans
court
program
in
t
welve
to
months
if
he
adheres
to
the
strict
regimen
of
treatment
through
the
veterans
affairs
hospital
in
battle
creek
and
supervision
set
by
the
court
the
charge
could
be
dismissed
or
reduced
to
a
misdemeanor
n
compare
eifert
s
case
and
the
okemos
veterans
court
to
florida
s
broward
county
mental
health
court
in
the
words
of
broward
county
s
judge
ginger
lerner
wren
t
he
mental
health
court
is
a
strategy
to
bring
fairness
to
the
administration
of
justice
for
persons
being
arrested
on
minor
offenses
who
suffer
from
major
mental
disability
persons
with
major
psychiatric
disorders
and
or
mental
disabilities
can
live
and
thrive
in
the
community
with
individualized
care
treatment
and
community
support
n
whereas
eifert
s
case
involved
a
more
serious
weapons
charge
carrying
a
potentially
lengthy
prison
sentence
judge
lerner
wren
s
mental
health
court
concentrates
on
individuals
accused
of
minor
crimes
yet
both
the
broward
county
mental
health
court
and
the
okemos
veterans
court
rely
on
alternative
sanctions
that
entail
treatment
primarily
outside
the
specialized
criminal
court
other
specialized
criminal
courts
rely
heavily
on
judicial
monitoring
as
part
and
parcel
of
alternative
sentencing
rather
than
primarily
on
referral
to
social
services
outside
the
criminal
court
effectively
tasking
the
judge
with
the
work
of
a
probation
or
parole
officer
for
example
the
syracuse
new
york
drug
treatment
court
significantly
expands
judicial
surveillance
of
minor
drug
offenders
and
uses
arrest
and
incarceration
as
routine
sanctions
for
noncompliance
with
court
mandates
as
sociologist
james
nolan
explains
in
one
instance
a
participant
in
judge
mckinney
s
syracuse
new
york
drug
court
lost
his
job
mckinney
called
the
employer
and
learned
that
the
client
was
regarded
as
a
damn
good
employee
and
that
the
boss
would
hire
him
back
in
a
heartbeat
if
the
judge
could
guarantee
that
he
was
drug
free
and
that
he
wouldn
t
miss
any
work
so
the
judge
made
a
deal
with
the
employer
he
said
to
him
okay
i
ll
make
a
deal
with
you
you
take
him
back
and
i
ll
add
another
weapon
to
your
arsenal
if
he
doesn
t
come
to
work
when
he
is
supposed
to
doesn
t
come
to
work
on
time
i
ll
put
him
in
jail
on
your
say
so
the
judge
relayed
the
arrangement
to
the
defendant
telling
him
i
ll
get
your
job
back
for
you
but
you
ve
got
to
promise
you
ll
be
at
work
when
you
are
supposed
to
your
employer
is
now
on
the
team
of
people
who
are
reporting
to
me
when
he
calls
up
and
tells
me
that
you
are
late
or
that
you
re
not
there
i
m
going
to
send
the
cops
out
to
arrest
you
n
this
approach
may
extend
criminal
supervision
into
new
domains
such
as
the
employment
context
and
in
so
doing
may
increase
levels
of
at
least
short
term
incarceration
quite
distinctly
the
mental
health
and
veterans
courts
approaches
just
related
are
characterized
by
a
combination
of
diversionary
treatment
strategies
that
do
not
necessarily
rely
heavily
on
judicial
surveillance
or
other
forms
of
direct
criminal
supervision
by
the

these
examples
illustrate
some
of
the
considerable
diversity
in
the
institutional

and
conceptual
orientations
of
specialized
criminal

these
courts
may
focus
on
more
minor
offenses
or
more
serious
ones

may
rely

on
referrals
to
social

organizations

on

this
article
introduces
a
typology
and
critical
theoretical
account
of
four
criminal
law
reformist
models
at
work
in
specialized
criminal
courts
a
therapeutic
jurisprudence
model
a
judicial
monitoring
model
an
order
maintenance
model
and
a
decarceration
model
n
the
first
three
of
these
models
i
argue
possess
characteristics
that
pose
a
considerable
risk
of
deepening
and
extending
existing
pathologies
in
criminal
law
administration
exacerbating
overcriminalization
and
potentially
expanding
incarceration
but
the
fourth
model
a
decarceration
model
promises
to
begin
to
reduce
levels
of
criminalization
and
incarceration
and
to
develop
experimentalist
and
sociologically
informed
alternatives
to
criminal
law
intervention
these
four
models
consist
of
generally
interconnected
institutional
features
and
ideological
commitments
on
which
the
courts
draw
although
numerous
courts
reflect
some
characteristics
of
more
than
one
model
the
models
are
prototypes
to
which
existing
courts
roughly
adhere
in
identifying
these
basic
contrasting
approaches
this
typology
serves
to
illuminate
some
of
the
underappreciated
variation
between
and
among
different
specialized
criminal
courts
thereby
distinguishing
the
specific
risks
associated
with
distinct
bundles
of
legal
institutional
and
ideological
features
facilitating
more
informed
empirical
analysis
and
clarifying
the
contours
of
various
possible
reform
agendas
being
tested
in
the
specialized
courts
context
before
delving
in
greater
depth
into
the
four
models
and
their
associated
aspirations
risks
and
limitations
a
brief
overview
of
each
model
will
help
to
set
the
stage
for
the
analysis
to
follow
courts
operating
on
a
therapeutic
jurisprudence
model
adopt
a
neo
rehabilitative
approach
convening
courts
to
therapeutically
treat
offenders
and
in
some
instances
victims
n
on
a
therapeutic
jurisprudence
model
the
judge
personally
attempts
to
facilitate
a
therapeutic
process
in
court
through
routine
proceedings
intermediate
sanctions
and
in
some
instances
jail
or
prison
based
sentencing
substantial
efforts
are
devoted
to
making
court
proceedings
themselves
part
of
ongoing
psychotherapeutic
interventions
aimed
at
behavioral
modification
the
second
model
relies
upon
intensive
judicial
monitoring
focusing
on
deterrence
defendant
accountability
and
expanded
judicial
surveillance
as
an
alternative
or
adjunct
to
incarceration
n
a
court
operating
solely
in
conformity
with
a
judicial
monitoring
model
eschews
the
court
centered
rehabilitative
psychotherapeutic
ambitions
that
are
central
to
the
therapeutic
jurisprudence
model
and
instead
emphasizes
deterrent
judicially
administered
surveillance
a
third
model
emphasizing
order
maintenance
operates
largely
in
community
courts
which
address
relatively
minor
public
order
violations
through
locally
administered
intermediate
sanctions
such
as
community
service
n
courts
reflecting
an
order
maintenance
model
are
characterized
primarily
by
their
focus
on
low
level
quality
of
life
offenses
inspired
by
a
broken
windows
theory
of
policing
and
do
not
necessarily
embrace
either
therapeutic
or
judicially
surveillant
features
then
there
is
the
fourth
less
common
model
the
theoretical
orientation
and
reformist
potential
of
which
this
article
will
elaborate
a
decarceration
model
specialized
criminal
courts
adopting
a
decarceration
model
are
experimental
diversionary
programs
that
assign
otherwise
likely
jail
or
prison
bound
defendant
mental
health
and
drug
treatment

housing

other
services
in

incarceration
n
on
a
decarceration
model
integration
within
social
institutions
outside
the
criminal
court
substitutes
for
the
surveilling
function
of
criminal
supervision
and
incarceration
n
the
significant
reformist
possibility
in
a
decarceration
model
arises
principally
from
its
directly
diversionary
orientation
coupled
with
rigorous
ongoing
empirical
monitoring
of
court
experimentation
to
establish
whether
and
if
so
how
non
carceral
sentencing
may
be
applied
in
particular
contexts
without
undue
risk
to
public
safety
n
the
models
are
distinct
from
though
often
overlapping
with
the
self
definitions
and
names
of
the
courts
in
other
words
the
models
are
composed
of
bundles
of
legal
institutional
and
ideological
features
identified

research

of
quantitative
and
qualitative
empirical
studies
not
exclusively
or
even
primarily
in
reference
to
the
self
descriptions
of
the
various
courts
so
while
a
drug
court
might
conform
to
an
order
maintenance
model
or
a
therapeutic
jurisprudence
model
in
either
instance
the
court
may
still
be
called
simply
a
drug
court
likewise
a
mental
health
court
might
reflect
features
of
a
judicial
monitoring
model
but
be
referred
to
plainly
as
a
mental
health
court
courts
adopting
a
diversionary
decarceration
approach
are
similarly
not
called
decarceration
courts
but
are
identified
as
drug
courts
or
mental
health
courts
and
for
reasons
of
political
expedience
avoiding
the
decarceration
terminology
may
be
prudent
other
courts
with
characteristics
corresponding
to
a

tailor
the

reflect
their

the
following
table
illustrates
the
defining
characteristics
and
theoretical
bases
of
each
of
the
four
models
this
article
s
core
argument
is
that
the
therapeutic
jurisprudence
judicial
monitoring
and
order
maintenance
models
may
fall
short
in
reducing
criminal
supervision
and
incarceration
and
threaten
to
produce
otherwise
harmful
outcomes
a
decarceration
model
however
stands
to
facilitate
broader
transformative
criminal
law
reform
setting
in
motion
change
processes
that
could
over
time
reduce
reliance
on
criminal
prosecution
and
incarceration
as
a
way
of
regulating
an
array
of
complex
social
problems
the
risks
attributed
by
critics
to
any
one
particular
type
of
specialized
criminal
court
drug
courts
for
instance
are
thus
better
understood
as
potential
problems
with
particular
models
bundles
of
legal
institutional
and
ideological
features
of
reformist
criminal
law
administration
certain
of
which
may
even
tend
to
extend
surveillance
diminish
procedural
protections
and
expand
incarceration
n
due
to
this
variation
coming
to
terms
with
the
shifts
in
criminal
law
manifest
in
specialized
criminal
courts
will
not
be
achieved
either
by
simply
embracing
or
by
rejecting
the
turn
to
criminal
court
specialization
rather
the
effects
of
specialized
criminal
courts
will
depend
on
an
ongoing
competition
over
the
shape
and
ambition
of
these
courts
and
a
decarceration
focused
criminal
law
reform
agenda
emerging
in
specialized
criminal
courts
that
attempt
to
navigate
the
perils
and
harness
the
possibilities
identified
in
the
pages
to
follow
holds
the
promise
of
enabling
a
form
of
criminal
law
administration
more
narrowly
tailored
to
address
that
conduct
for
which
criminal
law
intervention
is
most
suited
allocating
to
other
sectors
the
management
of
a
range
of
social
concerns
from
addiction
to
mental
illness
importantly
then
the
impact
of
these
reformist
models
reaches
beyond
the
context
of
specialized
criminal
courts
at
this
moment
of
increasing
bipartisan
interest
in
criminal
law
reform
aimed
at
reducing
incarceration
the
models
at
work
in
specialized
criminal
courts
are
likely
to
take
on
wider
significance
informing
more
general
criminal
law
reform
strategies
for
this
reason
attention
to
these
contrasting
reformist
approaches
at
work
in

merits
the
sustained
attention
of
criminal

scholars
and
others
concerned
about
the
steep
costs
economic
and
human
of
the
status
quo
in
u
s
criminal

administration
and
about
the
harms
endemic
in
our
carceral
institutions
this
article
consists
of
four
parts
part
i
situates
the
contemporary
explosion
of
specialized
criminal
courts
within
a
range
of
ongoing
criminal
law
reforms
implemented
to
reduce
levels
of
criminal
supervision
and
incarceration
part
i
proposes
that
as
states
and
the
federal
government
aim
to
decrease
reliance
on
incarceration
specialized
criminal
courts
contribute
an
array
of
criminal
law
reformist
frameworks
that
may
inform
the
wide
ranging
largely
ad
hoc
changes
occurring
more
generally
in
u
s
criminal
law
part
ii
provides
a
typology
and
critical
analysis
of
four
criminal
law
reformist
models
reflected
in
the
rapidly
multiplying
assortment
of
specialized
criminal
courts
part
ii
considers
not
only
whether
these
models
are
likely
to
fulfill
their
stated
purposes
but
also
some
of
their
possible
broader
effects
an
implication
of
the
analysis
in
part
ii
is
that
the
study
of
specialized
criminal
courts
ought
to
proceed
in
a
different
way
than
it
has
to
date
by
attending
carefully
to
the
legal
institutional
and
conceptual
differences
between
the
various
criminal
law
reformist
models
that
the
typology
introduced
here
identifies
part
ii
contends
that
in
certain
legal
institutional
configurations
specialized
criminal
courts
may
well
thwart
the
courts
overarching
shared
ambition
of
countering
overcriminalization
and
overincarceration
and
that
they
may
cause
other
underappreciated
harms
yet
if
differently
configured
the
courts
contain
considerable
broader
reaching
reformist
possibilities
part
iii
explores
three
strategies
that
may
enable
a
decarceration
model
to
realize
its
reformist
potential
to
reduce
reliance
on
conventional
criminal
supervision
and
incarceration
as
well
as
to
facilitate
other
transformative
shifts
in
u
s
criminal
law
part
iii
proposes
that
though
it
is
unlikely
and
possibly
undesirable
that
specialized
criminal
courts
would
be
brought
to
scale
n
even
in
relatively
small
numbers
a
decarceration
model
may
effect
farther
reaching
reform
by
facilitating
cognitive
reframing
of
particular
categories
of
crime
and
punishment
engaging
in
institutional
reinvention
and
enabling
systemic
change
finally
part
iv
considers
the
perils
of
a
specialized
criminal
courts
law
reform
approach
more
generally
and
begins
to
respond
to
anticipated
objections
the
analysis
in
parts
i
through
iv
is
informed
by
observation
of
proceedings
in
an
array
of
specialized
criminal
courts

judges

administrators

previously
unexamined
studies
of
the

entities
n
i
a
shifting
criminal
law
dissatisfaction
with
the
status
quo
in
u
s
criminal
law
administration
has
led
to
a
range
of
attempts
to
establish
alternatives
the
precise
contours
of
what
such
alternatives
should
entail
are
uncertain
this
part
will
first
take
stock
of
the
broad
shifts
ongoing
in
u
s
criminal
law
although
these
shifts
lack
an
orienting

framework
specialized
criminal
courts
have
become
grounds

models

of

reform
efforts

in
the
arenas
of

in

is
an
increasing
openness
on
the
part
of

the
public
to
experiment
with
criminal

administrative
alternatives
but
across
the
numerous
contexts
of
ongoing
reform
there
is
no
common
conception
of
how
an
alternative
social

regime
may
operate
without
extensive
reliance
on
conventional
criminal
law
enforcement
importantly
as
well
the
ad
hoc
shifts
in
criminal
law
administration
are
occurring
in
the
absence
of

urged
by
liberal
criminal

scholars

criminologists

the

s

of

been
embraced

these
changing
approaches
and
attitudes
have
affected
every
level
of
criminal
law
administration
from

to
parole
and
probation
there
is
nonetheless
a
more
general
persistent
uncertainty
about
how
better
to
administer
criminal
law
so
as
to
depart
significantly
from
current
practices
and
perhaps
more
critically
how
to
expand
and
sustain
support
for
alternatives
to
incarceration
and
conventional
criminal
supervision
part
of
what
is
lacking
is
what
criminologist
mary
bosworth
describes
as
a
coordinated
conceptual
framework
to
help
shift
not
only
penal
institutions
and
practices
but
also
those
more
subtle
structures
of
feeling
and
belief
that
have

so
effective

n
specialized
criminal

are
engaged
in
the
work
of
shaping
coordinated
conceptual
and
institutional
frameworks
to
inform
criminal
law
reform
processes
and
there
are
at

four
distinct
reformist
approaches
represented
in
existing
specialized
criminal
courts
the
following

explores
the
emergence
of
contemporary
specialized
criminal
courts

heterogeneous
and
common
ambitions

and
ambits
before

a

critical
analysis
of
four
reformist
models
at

in
these
courts
b
criminal
court
reform
specialized
criminal
courts
the
contemporary
specialized
criminal
courts
movement
was
spearheaded
by
state
court
judges
dismayed
with
the
miscarriages
of
justice
they
witnessed
daily
in
their
courts
although
the
progenitors
of
specialized
criminal
courts
sought
initially
only
to
devise
different
solutions
for
their
respective
local
jurisdictions
the
specialized
courts
approach
took
off
and
the
courts
influence
expanded
nationally
as
specialized
criminal
courts
spread
across
the
united
states
the
courts
came
to
reflect
considerable
institutional
diversity
of
the
approximately
specialized
criminal
courts
in
the
united
states
the
original
and
most
numerous
are
drug
courts
beginning
in
the
late
s
and
early
s
judges
dissatisfied
with
their
role
in
processing
drug
cases
began
to
convene
drug
courts
to
reduce
reliance
on
incarceration
in
favor
of
treatment
and
other
monitoring
processes
for
drug
related
offenses
among
the
first
contemporary
adult
specialized
criminal
courts
the
miami
dade
drug
court
was
established
in
to
reduce
reliance
on
jail
and
prison
in
dealing
with
low
level
drug
offenders
n
to
promote
these
initiatives
state
court
judges
collaborated
with
prosecutors
public
defense
counsel
and
ultimately
state
legislatures
and
the
federal
government
former
attorney
general
janet
reno
when
she
was
a
local
prosecutor
in
florida
was
instrumental
in
establishing
the
miami
dade
drug
court
and
then
when
reno
became
attorney
general
of
the
united
states
she
used
her
control
over
federal
criminal
justice
spending
to
urge
other
states
to
adopt
similar
initiatives
n
subsequently
drug
courts
have
received
overwhelming
bipartisan
support
n
at
the
national
drug
court
conference
in
judge
jeffrey
tauber
oakland
california
s
first
drug
court
judge
and
then
president
of
the
national
association
of
drug
court
professionals
addressed
his
audience
of
more
than
drug
court
professionals
predicting
the
growing
influence
that
drug
courts
would
wield
in
coming
years
w
e
have
clearly
proven
through
the
work
that
we
ve
done
through
our
numbers
through
the
effectiveness
of
our
courts
that
this
field
this
movement
this
organization
is
ready
to
take
center
stage
is
ready
to
move
its
own
agenda
forward
on
the
local
state
and
national
levels
n
indeed
in
the
years
to
follow
drug
courts
sprung
up
around
the
country
as
the
number
of
drug
courts
increased
their
institutional
configurations
came
to
vary
substantially
like
the
first
miami
dade
drug
court
program
drug
courts
generally
aim
to
help
narcotics
involved
offenders
to
stay
off
drugs
by
offering
the
opportunity
to
enter
drug
rehabilitation
rather
than
incarceration
but
many
drug
courts
increasingly
address
a
range
of
other
crimes
presumably
associated
with
drug
use
such
as
shoplifting
prostitution
and
burglary
n
some
drug
courts
admit
defendants
with
lengthy
and
serious
felony
records
while
others
limit
eligibility
to
those
with
nonviolent
minor
charges
n
shortly
after
the
advent
of
the
drug
court
movement
mental
health
courts
community
courts
domestic
violence
courts
and
later
veterans
courts
sex
offense
courts
and
reentry
courts
emerged
in
jurisdictions
around
the
united
states
each
of
these
categories
of
specialized
criminal
courts
represents
a
largely
judicially
innovated
attempt
to
work
around
perceived
inadequacies
in
the
conventional
criminal
law
administrative
approach
in
the
area
in
question
whether
arrests
and
prosecutions
of
mentally
ill
individuals
veterans
persons
accused
of
domestic
violence
alleged
sex
offenders
or
parolees
criminal
law
administration
within
specialized
criminal
courts
generally
adopts
a
neo
realist
jurisprudence
which
its
proponents
call
problem
solving
justice
or
to
my
mind
more
accurately
problem
oriented
justice
n
this
has
led
some
commentators
to
label
all
specialized
criminal
courts
interchangeably
problem
solving
courts
n
a
term
that
connotes
an
aim
on
the
part
of
the
courts
to
address
problems
both
in
the
legal
system
and
in
the
lives
of
defendants
appearing
before
the
courts
n
it
is
noteworthy
that
judges
themselves
have
been
the
primary
driving
force
behind
the
specialized
criminal
courts
movement
working
cooperatively
with
prosecutors
defense
counsel
and
other
interested
elected
officials
to
convene
specialized
criminal
courts
as
criminal
law
enforcement
expanded
during
the
latter
decades
of
the
twentieth
century
and
many
more
cases
entered
the
criminal
courts
dockets
swelled
n
more
cases
meant
more
pressure
on
judges
to
resolve
cases
quickly
leading
to
reduced
judicial
morale
n
in
response
to
their
deep
dissatisfaction
with
their
own
role
in
criminal
law
administration
judges
sought
to
devise
an
alternative
legal
institutional
framework
for
at
least
some
categories
of
criminal
cases
obtaining
initially
the
support
of
locally
elected
prosecutors
and
subsequently
as
the
specialized
criminal
court
initiatives
expanded
broader
legislative
support
n
in
promoting
specialized
court
programs
as
a
criminal
law
reform
standard
judges
and
other
court
advocates
increasingly
have
collaborated
with
specialized
court
consultants
such
as
the
center
for
court
innovation
a
new
york
city
based
organization
and
with
legal
academics
n
state
legislatures
and
the
u
s
congress
have
endorsed
the
specialized
courts
approach
by
incorporating
diversionary
specialized
court
sentencing
into
statutory
provisions
and
by
authorizing
state
and
federal
funding
for
specialized
criminal
courts
in
this
regard
the
specialized
courts
movement
may
be
understood
as
a
widely
endorsed
work
around
of
political
process
defects
whereas
tough
on
crime
norms
make
decriminalization
or
other
downscaling
of
punishment
less
available
specialized
criminal

to
appear

than

to
reduce

responding
to
the
conduct

the
first
generation
of

largely
excluded

regimen

n
veterans
courts
convened
beginning
in
the
mid
s

specialized
courts
established
to
address
socially
disruptive
behavior
on
the
part
of
veterans

of
whom
are
suffering
mental

problems
arising
from

those

in
some
instances

participate
in

in

mental

courts

veterans
courts
domestic

courts
and
sex

courts
generally
operate
with
less
reference
to
rehabilitative
goals
instead
domestic
violence
and
sex
offense
courts
for
the
most
part
seek
to
provide
individually
tailored
monitoring
of
defendants
charged
and
or
convicted
in
domestic
violence
or
sex
offense
cases
and
in
some
instances
more
meaningful

some
domestic

courts
also
seek
to
reduce
reliance
on
incarceration
domestic
violence
and
sex

courts
with
an
incarceration
reduction
mission
intend
for
monitoring
and
services
to
serve
as
an
alternative
to
jail
or
prison
based
sentencing
and
to
work
to
break
preexisting
cycles
of
violence
and
abuse
so
as
to
limit
levels
of
reincarceration
as
brooklyn
s
felony
domestic
violence
court
judge
john
leventhal
explained
i
saw
people
going
to
jail
for
two
years
for
not
paying
child
support
which
is
a
condition
of
their
order
of
protection
and
i
was
surprised
to
see
such
a
large
violation
and
probation
calendar
i
wanted
to
cut
that
down
how
do
we
cut
that
down
we
bring
them
back
while
they
re
on
probation
before
they
re
really
violating
in
a
bad
way
to
keep
them
on
the
right
track
for
the
first
four
years
or
five
years
that
we
were
doing
it
we
had
half
the
violation
rate
of
the
general
probation
population
which
is
incredible
considering
that
you
have
targeted
victims
and
people
who
know
each
other
since
then
i
think
our
violation
rate
has
gone
down
even
further
n
so
in
domestic
violence
courts
such
as
judge
leventhal
s
judicial
monitoring
aims
to
reduce
carceral
sentencing
reoffending
and
reincarceration
even
though
these
goals
were
not
the
explicit
initial
motivations
for
convening
most
domestic
violence
courts
likewise
sex
offense
courts
have
been
promoted
to
more
effectively
monitor
persons
accused
or
convicted
of
sex
offenses
n
yet
some
of
these
courts
simultaneously
seek
to
shift
criminal
law
administration
in
sex
offense
cases
to
make
the
criminal
supervisory
regime
more
reasonable
and
less
likely
to
result
in
reincarceration
for
technical
violations
contrary
to
public
perception
most
convicted
sex
offenders
receive
little
prison
time
in
their
initial
sentence
and
are
subject
primarily
to
terms
of
probation
or
a
short
carceral
sentence
followed
by
parole
n
still
in
many
jurisdictions
the
vast
majority
of
convicted
sex
offenders
even
those
charged
only
with
an
offense
stemming
from
public
exposure
or
sex
with
a
person
just
a
few
years
younger
than
the
accused
are
subject
to
sex
offender
registration
and
residential
restrictions
that
make
life
extremely
difficult
and
may
encourage
criminal
behavior
by
socially
isolating
sex
offenders
n
sex
offense
courts
permit
modifications
of
certain
of
these
restrictions
where
doing
so
is
thought
to
be
reasonable
so
that
the
response
to
persons
charged
and
convicted
of
sex
offenses
may
unfold
with
greater
moderation
and
rationality
n
as
judge
james
mccarthy
the
first
presiding
judge
of
the
oswego
county
sex
offense
court
in
new
york
has
explained
the
ambition
of
his
court
in
offering
a
more
individualized
monitoring
regime
for
convicted
sex
offenders
is
in
part
to
make
it
such
that
the
sex
offender
can
live
somewhere
and
work
somewhere
without
being
demonized
while
still
being
closely
supervised
n
the
sex
offense
courts
may
also
be
conceptualized
in
some
instances
then
as
an
attempt
to
work
around
existing
criminal
law
regimes
that
appear
to
judges
and
other
interested
persons
to
be
irrational
or
excessively
harsh
where
more
thoroughgoing
legislative
modification
is
unavailable
the
courts
aim
to
devise
an
alternative
regime
to
mitigate
the
perceived
ill
effects
of
the
conventional
processes
and
to
develop
a
different
approach
that
may
have
as
an
important
side
effect
reduced
reliance
on
incarceration
in
response
to
technical
violations
n
there
are
as
of
this
writing
in
jurisdictions
across
the
united
states
approximately
mental
health
courts
n
domestic
violence
courts
and
thirty
community
courts
more
than
drug
courts
and
in
excess
of
other
specialized
criminal
courts
including
sex
offense
and
veterans
courts

those
states
with
numerous
specialized
criminal
courts
span
the
country
including
jurisdictions
as
diverse
as
alaska
california
indiana
and
new
york
n
there
is
no
single
foundational
document
to
which
all
specialized
criminal
courts
refer
and
no
unified
theory
that
captures
their
complicated
interrelationships
and
diverse
projects
but
although
the
initial
impetuses
for
convening
specialized
criminal
courts
differed
most
of
their
founders
share
in
common
the
hope
of
devising
better
substantially
non
carceral
approaches
to
criminal
law
administration
at
least
for
certain
categories
of
offenders
n
specialized
criminal
courts
have
now
reached
some
measure
of
maturity
and
there
are
at
least
four
legal
institutional
and
conceptual
reformist
models
to
which
the
existing
courts
roughly
correspond
in
fact
what
may
make
specialized
criminal
courts
politically
palatable
is
also
what
makes
their
eventual
outcome
uncertain
their
form
is
sufficiently
open
so
as
to
incorporate
any
or
several
of
these
four
often
quite
divergent
reformist
approaches
n
as
a
result
what
specialized
criminal
courts
ultimately
portend
for
u
s
criminal
law
remains
ambiguous

matter
over
which
there
should
be
much
more
rigorous
and
reasoned
debate

that
threaten

of

and

consequences

holds

promise

reform

part
part
iii
explores
in
greater
detail
three
criminal
law
reform
strategies
that
a
decarceration
model
may
set
in
motion
a
therapeutic
jurisprudence
model
specialized
criminal
courts
adopting
a
therapeutic
jurisprudence
model
are
at
work
in
every
state
in
the
country
and
increasingly
in
a
wide
range
of
foreign
jurisdictions
n
this
model
draws
heavily
on
a
theoretical
framework
developed
by
law
professors
david
wexler
and
bruce
winick
n
wexler
and
winick
s
fundamental
premise
is
that
law
may
operate
in
ways
that
are
therapeutic
or
anti
therapeutic
so
as
to
improve
or
undermine
people
s
psychological
well
being
n
according
to
wexler
and
winick
all
other
things
being
equal
legal
actors
should
seek
to
promote
therapeutic
outcomes
over
anti
therapeutic
ones
in
urging
attention
to
the
therapeutic
consequences
of
legal
arrangements
wexler
and
winick
recommend
w
e
should
see
if
the
law
could
be
reshaped
to
make
it
into
more
of
a
healing
force
a
therapeutic
force
n
in
a
certain
respect
in
the
criminal
law
context
a
therapeutic
jurisprudence
model
is
a
repackaging
of
a
rehabilitative
theory
of
sentencing
that
also
borrows
from
restorative
justice
approaches
but
therapeutic
jurisprudence
is
farther
reaching
n
the
judge
in
a
therapeutic
specialized
criminal
court
does
not
simply
assign
a
sentence
that
aims
to
rehabilitate
or
serve
a
therapeutic
or
restorative
function
instead
the
court
proceedings
themselves
whether
through
the
judge
s
warm
encouragement
or
tough
love
are
intended
to
promote
therapeutic
outcomes
the
entire
legal
process
in
fact
the
entire
institutional
operation
of
the
court
as
such
is
to
be
reconceived
on
the
therapeutic
model
although
wexler
and
winick
make
clear
that
therapeutic
concerns
ought
not
necessarily
take
precedence
over
other
considerations
they
do
not
provide
any
concrete
manner
to
evaluate
or
rank
therapeutic
priorities
relative
to
other
matters
leading
their
adherents
in
therapeutic
criminal
courts
to
prioritize
therapeutic
concerns
over
others
in
at
least
certain
contexts
when
conflicts
between
contending
values
emerge
n
accordingly
to
the
extent
earlier
critiques
leveled
against
rehabilitative
punishment
and
indeterminate
sentencing
may
apply
to
a
therapeutic
jurisprudence
model
they
apply
with
even
greater
force
because
on
a
therapeutic
jurisprudence
model
the
rehabilitative
or
therapeutic
ambition
stretches
beyond
sentencing
and
punishment
to
nearly
every
aspect
of
the
court
proceedings
n
once
a
defendant
opts
into
a
specialized
therapeutic
criminal
court
all
of
the
major
players
in
the
courtroom
judge
prosecutor
and
defense
attorney
explicitly
acknowledge
that
the
goal
is
to
change
the
defendant
s
behavior
moving
the
defendant
from
addiction
to
sobriety
and
from
a
life
of
crime
to
law
abiding
behavior
n
in
contrast
to
the
traditional
adversarial
model
of
the
disengaged
dispassionate
judge
whose
primary
task
is
to
decide
cases
fairly
and
impartially
n
therapeutic
judges
are
active
and
engaged

in
acquiring
expertise
regarding
the

over

may
qualify
for
deferred
prosecution
while
undergoing
mental

treatment
many
defendants
in
the
d

mental
health
diversion
court
also
suffer
from
co
occurring
drug
addiction
in
demonstrating
her
heartfelt
concern
for
the
defendants
clients
in
her
court
judge
davis
descends
from
the
bench
to
deliver
her
gifts
to
those
who
successfully
complete
her
prescribed
treatment
program
she
explains
that
the
coin
is
to
remind
them
of
their
hard
work
though
it
carries
no
monetary
value
in
the
spirit
of
therapeutic
jurisprudence
judge
davis
asks
defendants
who
fail
drug
tests
or
other
court
requirements
what
the
court
can
do
to
help
and
extends
and
intensifies
their
period
of
court
supervision
n
the
actual
therapeutic
or
other
effects
of
this
engagement
remain
uncertain
judge
davis
for
instance
who
was
once
a
public
defender
at
d
c
s
public
defender
service
conducts
her
court
in
a
therapeutic
manner
that
appears
eminently
humane
though
she
has
no
formal
psychotherapeutic
expertise
illustrating
the
bizarre
quality
and
uncertain
psychotherapeutic
impact
of
merging
judicial
and
therapeutic
roles
one
afternoon
in
mental
health
court
judge
davis
greeted
a
defendant
client
with
smiles
and
congratulations
telling
the
mentally
ill
defendant
client
how
proud
she
was
of
her
and
how
the
defendant
client
was
really
doing
well
about
which
the
judge
relayed
delight
but
the
clerk
interrupted
the
exchange
to
point
out
to
the
judge
that
the
day
prior
the
defendant
client
had
tested
positive
for
cocaine
judge
davis
then
desisted
in
her
praise
extended
the
defendant
client
s
term
in
the
criminal
supervisory
program
issued
a
stern
warning
about
noncompliance
and
ordered
the
defendant
client
to
talk
to
the
assigned
therapist
about
the
relapse
the
mentally
ill
defendant
client
looked
visibly
pleased
at
the
judge
s
initial
encouraging
approval
and
then
visibly
distraught
by
the
abrupt
turn
of
events
the
defendant
client
reported
to
the
judge
directly
not
through
counsel
having
difficulty
finding
an
available
individual
therapist
to
comply
with
the
court
s
orders
as
none
were
available
and
she
related
that
she
was
hanging
out
with
drug
users
which
made
it
hard
for
her
to
resist
using
drugs
it
appeared
unclear
whether
the
defendant
client
understood
that
the
role
of
the
judge
was
distinct
from
that
of
a
mental
health
care
provider
or
other
counselor
the
judge
listened
in
front
of
the
full
courtroom
and
then
called
the
next
defendant
client
whatever
uncertainties
attend
judge
davis
s
therapeutic
courtroom
methodology
and
indeed
she
appears
compassionate
and
well
intentioned
in
her
dealings
with
the
defendants
clients
who
appear
before
her
an
additional
potential
problem
posed
by
the
therapeutic
jurisprudence
model
is
that
in
promoting
itself
as
a
useful
treatment
approach
it
may
cause
other
criminal
justice
system
actors
particularly
police
and
prosecutors
to
likewise
view
the
court
as
a
treatment
outlet
this
may
lead
relatively
minor
cases
to
go
forward
offenses
that
perhaps
ought
not
to
be
prosecuted
in
the
first
instance
but
these
cases
come
to
the
court
for
extended
court
proceedings
rather
than
just
being
dropped
or
the
defendants
simply
referred
for
treatment
because
the
court
itself
rather
than
the
social
service
organization
conducting
therapeutic
treatment
is
understood
to
be
a
central
part
of
the
therapeutic
process
this
potential
net
widening
n
effect
of
a
therapeutic
model
of
specialized
criminal
law
administration
underscores
that
criminal
courts
are
part
of
a
working
institutional
and
social
system
not
simply
sites
for
interpersonal
conduct
modification
n
as
criminal
law
scholar
guyora
binder
has
persuasively
argued
punishment
is
not
a
behavior
but
an
institution
it
is
part
of
a
system
that
involves
conduct
norms
an
authoritative
procedure
for
generating
these
norms
an
authoritative
procedure
for
decisions
to
impose
sanctions
and
some
measure
of
practical
power
over
persons
or
resources
n
when
specialized
criminal
courts
operate
on
a
therapeutic
model
they
exert
system
wide
institutional
effects
likely
shaping
what
cases
are
brought
to
criminal
court
and
to
which
agencies
treatment
resources
are
allocated
and
all
the
while
therapeutic
judges
exercise
substantial
power
over
defendants
clients
given
the
authoritative
force
of
therapeutic
judges
determinations
a
further
set
of
problems
may
arise
if
judges
administering
criminal
law
on
a
therapeutic
model
believe
themselves
to
be
acting
in
the
therapeutic
interests
of
the
defendants
clients
before
them
but
are
not
as
humane
as
judge
davis
accounts
of
the
glynn
county
georgia
drug
court
suggest
that
the
former
presiding
judge
there
wielded
her
therapeutic
judicial
authority
with
an
iron
fist
n
for
infractions
as
minor
as
a
first
offense

forging
two
checks
totaling

young
woman
was
sentenced
to
ten

under

that

reported
spending

get
to
the

call
my

from

they
answer
it

i
heard
them
say

on

they
said

hang
that

up

i

like
ok

i
turn
around
and
the
y
tell
me
that

dills
reportedly
came
to
the
attention
of
the
jail
authorities
when
she
attempted
suicide
after
weeks
in
isolation
by
cutting
open
her
wrists
n
judge
williams
s
interest
in
starting
a
drug
court
was
personal
she
had
addiction
in
her
own
family
and
believed
in
tough
love
n
although
the
national
association
of
drug
court
professionals
discourages
such
a
punitive
approach
the
malleability
of
therapeutic
jurisprudence
when
administered
by
lay
therapist
judges
makes
it
all
too
likely
that
judges
will
confuse
therapy
with
punishment
and
that
their
unchecked
retributive
impulses
will
be
brought
to
bear
under
the
guise
of
therapeutic
jurisprudence
n
such
potential
miscarriages
of
therapeutic
jurisprudence
expose
another
significant
overlooked
feature
of
specialized
criminal
courts
operating
on
a
therapeutic
model
therapeutic
courts
attempt
to
rid
themselves
of
the
various
traditional
approaches
to
criminal
law
administration
and
punishment
retribution
deterrence
incapacitation
n
in
favor
of
a
therapeutic
approach
while
conventional
criminal
courts
generally
at
least
in
principle
administer
criminal
law
with
self
conscious
reference
to
a
compound
of
retributive
deterrent
and
other
punishment
approaches
specialized
criminal
courts
adopting
a
therapeutic
cast
seek
to
purify
the
administration
of
criminal
law
to
one
putatively
rehabilitative
therapeutic
variant
n
the
risk
of
this
attempted
purification
is
that
it
is
difficult
to
disentangle
deterrent
therapeutic
and
retributive
impulses
in
criminal
punishment
n
and
so
cordoning
off
certain
courts
as
purely
involved
in
therapeutic
interventions
may
both
misstate
what
is
actually
occurring
in
those
courts
and
undermine
judicial
self
consciousness
about
whether
the
punitive
effects
of
particular
decisions
are
proportional
to
the
offending
conduct
and
no
greater
than
necessary
to
deter
offending
behavior
n
indeed
some
judges
administering
specialized
criminal
courts
on
a
therapeutic
model
label
their
courts
sanctions
smart
punishment
but
propose
that
s
mart
punishment
is
not
really
punishment
at
all
but
a
therapeutic
response
n
although
the
problem
of
disproportionate
punitiveness
might
in
principle
be
resolved
by
having
all
specialized
criminal
courts
adopt
sentencing
ceilings
for
technical
violations
courts
operating
on
a
therapeutic
model
embrace
an
anti
formalist
problem
oriented
discretionary
approach
that
rejects
such
externally
imposed
pre
fixed
constraints
this
model
when
it
comes
to
predominate
over
other
approaches
to
criminal
law
administration
thus
threatens
to
place
judges
with
extraordinary
power
in
a
position
where
they
act
in
what
they
perceive
to
be
defendants
clients
therapeutic
interests
but
with
unchecked
potentially
punitive
effects
unimpeded
by
principles
of
proportionality
characteristic
of
a
retributive
theory
of
punishment
this
is
all
the
more
troubling
because
these
judges
may
lack
formal
psychotherapeutic
expertise
and
many
are
likely
exhausted
by
the
undoubtedly
difficult
work
of
dealing
with
criminally
accused
addicted
or
mentally
ill
individuals
often
in
under
resourced
environments
the
relaxation
of
procedural
safeguards
as
part
of
an
anti
formalist
team
based
therapeutic
approach
only
stands
to
exacerbate
these
problems
if
judges
are
not
particularly
conscientious
a
further
limitation
of
the
therapeutic
jurisprudence
model
has
to
do
with
the
difficulty
of
bringing
a
therapeutic
court
based
approach
to
scale
even
were
that
to
be
a
desirable
outcome
a
matter
on
which
the
preceding
analysis
should
cast
some
doubt
although
the
reformist
potential
of
a
therapeutic
model
rests
on
being
able
to
administer
therapy
to
individual
defendants
through
the
courts
these
courts
only
address
a
small
fraction
of
drug
cases
or
other
relevant
categories
of
cases
in
the
system
as
of
the
number
of
individuals
in
drug
court
programs
was
as
compared
to
a
population
on
probation
of
about
four
million
individuals
many
of
whom
are
drug
involved
offenders
n
to
reach
even
ten
percent
of
individuals
serving
a
probationary
sentence
the
number
of
therapeutic
drug
courts
would
need
to
increase
enormously
n
the
akron
mental
health
court
as
of
handled
at
one
time
approximately
clients
only
a
small
fraction
of
the
many
thousands
of
mentally
ill
individuals
likely
to
be
caught
up
in
ohio
s
criminal
justice
system
n
the
louisiana
mental
health
court
as
of
had
eighty
five
participants
and
operated
one
day
per
week
n
administering
therapeutic
jurisprudence
through
convening
separate
specialized
criminal
courts
is
also
relatively
costly
further
decreasing
the
likelihood
that
it
will
be
possible
to
bring
this
model
to
scale
even
were
this
to
be
a
sought
after
result
in
any
event
there
is
considerable
cause
to
question
whether
specialized
criminal
courts
adopting
a
therapeutic
jurisprudence
model
ought
to
be
brought
to
scale
given
that
proceedings
in
these
courts
appear
to
possess
certain
inherent
features
that
may
tend
to
exacerbate
some
of
the
most
troubling
problems
associated
with
the
adjudication
of
criminal
cases
in
conventional
courts
including
unnecessary
terms
of
incarceration
for
minor
or
technical
violations
and
prevalent
procedural
irregularities
on
a
therapeutic
model
any
judicial
tendencies
in
these
directions
are
more
likely
to
be
unchecked
worse
still
on
a
therapeutic
jurisprudence
model
procedural
shortcutting
or
unnecessary
incarceration
may
be
defended
as
therapeutic
rendering
it
less
susceptible
to
critical
engagement
n
for
instance
when
california
drug
court
judges
wished
to
amend
the
california
penal
code
to
reduce
the
privacy
rights
of
drug
court
defendants
clients
one
judge
defended
the
practice
as
follows
i
support
a
search
clause
for
drug
treatment
court
clients
because
i
think
a
search
clause
is
therapeutic
i
don
t
see
a
search
clause
as
a
sanction
so
much
as
an
additional
therapeutic
intervention
that
will
help
them
succeed
n
the
potentially
problematic
effects
of
this
curtailment
of
privacy
are
obscured
by
a
therapeutic
justificatory
approach
that
is
difficult
for
non
experts
to
critically
confront
on
its
own
terms
and
even
if
on
balance
relinquishing
some
privacy
protections
may
be
socially
desirable
because
it
serves
to
reduce
recidivism
casting
the
argument
for
this
approach
in
vague
psychotherapeutic
terms
obscures
rather
than
illuminates
the
relevant
considerations
at
stake
a
therapeutic
jurisprudence
model
thus
does
little
by
itself
to
reduce
reliance
on
criminal
supervision
and
incarceration
unless
administered
by
a
judge
already
inclined
to
reduce
carceral
sentencing
and
enable
other
positive
interventions
and
in
fact
in
the
wrong
judge
s
hands
a
therapeutic
approach
may
cause
significant
harm
reliance
on
jail
sentences
as
a
sanction
for
noncompliance
with
treatment
or
other
technical
requirements
can
actually
result
in
substantial
carceral
penalties
n
potential
net
widening
effects
associated
with
placing
criminal
courts
in
the
role
of
administering
therapeutic
interventions
also
threatens
to
increase
criminal
case
filings
and
hence
overall
levels
of
criminal
supervision
and
quite
possibly
incarceration
n
although
a
therapeutic
jurisprudence
model
nonetheless
appeals
to
many
because
it
repackages
and
resurrects
a
rehabilitative
sentencing
approach
it
does
so
with
considerable
risk
of
engendering
a
variety
of
unintended
and
undesirable
consequences
both
for
rule
of
law
principles
and
for
the
persons
it
is
intended
to
benefit
the
answer
to
these
problems
is
to
disentangle
reformist
criminal
law
administration
from
a
particular
set
of
predefined
therapeutic
jurisprudential
commitments
and
instead
to
experiment
with
jurisprudential
content
so
as
to
reduce
reliance
on
incarceration
and
to
divert
cases
to
other
sectors
that
may
more
meaningfully
address
social
goals
the
appropriate
reconceptualization
for
the
courts
is
as
a
strategy
to
enable
decarceration
their
unifying
feature
being
that
they
are
experimenting
with
criminal
law
administration
to
reduce
carceral
sentencing
in
favor
of
preferable
approaches
rather
than
adapting
a
therapeutic
methodology
for
criminal
law
but
before
turning
to
a
decarceration
model
it
remains
in
the
following
sections
to
explore
the
other
predominant
reformist
models
at
work
in
specialized
criminal
courts
b
judicial
monitoring
model
the
defining
characteristic
of
specialized
criminal
courts
operating
on
a
judicial
monitoring
model
is
that
they
rely
primarily
on
judges
to
engage
in
monitoring
of
defendants
or
participants
who
may
be
asked
to
submit
to
urine
tests
and
curfews
and
to
attend
court
appointments
as
often
as
several
times
per
week
n
the
theoretical
basis
of
the
judicial
monitoring
model
is
that
intensified
judicially
administered
criminal
surveillance
will
reduce
future
misconduct
at
lesser
cost
than
incarceration
and
with
greater
efficacy
than
conventional
probation
or
parole
as
distinct
from
the
therapeutic
jurisprudence
model
specialized
criminal
courts
operating
exclusively
on
a
judicial
monitoring
model
do
not
aim
to
generate
therapeutic
outcomes
through
courtroom
proceedings
instead
the
judge
is
empowered
to
closely
monitor
defendants
compliance
with
court
mandates
in
a
manner
akin
to
a
probation
or
parole
officer
on
the
judicial
monitoring
model
the
court
retains
jurisdiction
to
monitor
the
defendant
participant
during
pretrial
proceedings
and
when
the
court
assigns
a
non
carceral
sentence
the
judge
mandates
reporting
back
to
the
court
on
a
regular
basis
the
impetus
for
judicial
monitoring
courts
arose
largely
due
to
an
acute
sense
of
the
limits
of
conventional
probation
and
other
non
carceral
forms
of
criminal
supervision
although
probation
is
by
far
the
most
common
criminal
sanction
in
the
united
states
n
with
caseloads
of
up
to
probationers
per
officer
the
degree
of
supervision
is
frequently
minimal
n
judicial
monitoring
aims
to
improve
supervision
by
transferring
authority
to
judges
to
monitor
defendants
this
transfer
it
is
hoped
will
reduce
recidivism
and
thereby
reduce
incarceration
two
examples
of
specialized
criminal
courts
operating
primarily
on
the
judicial
monitoring
model
are
domestic
violence
courts
and
sex
offense
courts
though
certain
drug
courts
and
other
specialized
criminal
courts
also
function
primarily
as
judicial
monitoring
bodies
intensive
monitoring
of
defendants
in
domestic
violence
cases
aims
to
encourage
greater
compliance
with
protective
orders
and
attendance
of
anger
management
trainings
n
judicial
monitoring
sex
offense
courts
likewise
supervise
defendants
compliance
with
court
mandates
and
mandatory
treatment
n
a
judicial
monitoring
model
as
applied
to
drug
courts
extends
judicial
supervision
over
drug
offenders
in
some
jurisdictions
drug
courts
judicial
monitoring
is
coupled
with
a
therapeutic
jurisprudential
approach
in
other
jurisdictions
it
is
not
n
although
judicial
monitoring
relies
in
part
on
technological
devices
to
facilitate
monitoring
the
judicial
role
shifts
in
these
courts
in
ways
that
pose
considerable
risks
of
judicial
overreaching
expanded
surveillance
and
increased
incarceration
for
technical
violations
due
to
the
large
numbers
of
criminal
cases
disposed
of
with
probationary
sentences
and
the
tremendous
capacity
of
the
defense
computer
and
electronic
industries
there
is
an
extensive
market
for
electronic
monitoring
voice
verification
systems
and
inexpensive
on
site
drug
testing
on
which
monitoring
may
rely
n
but
the
central
feature
of
judicial
monitoring
as
opposed
to
probation
or
parole
is
that
the
judge
plays
an
active
role
in
overseeing
surveillance
of
defendants
and
once
a
judge
becomes
the
monitor
of
defendants
compliance
with
court
orders
the
judge
s
role
changes
from
one
of
at
least
in
principle
adjudicative
neutrality
to
more
active
investigative
supervision
on
behalf
of
the
state
simultaneously
a
judicial
monitoring
model
threatens
to
expand
rather
than
reduce
levels
of
criminal
supervision
and
at
least
short
term
incarceration
because
more
intensive
supervision
increases
the
likelihood
of
identifying
technical
violations
which
increases
the
likelihood
of
short
term
incarceration
this
increased
likelihood
is
true
particularly
because
in
many
judicial
monitoring
courts
incarceration
is
the
default
penalty
for
technical
violations
that
do
not
even
rise
to
the
level
of
criminally
chargeable
misconduct
n
one
particularly
striking
example
of
the
judicial
role
transformation
and
expanded
criminal
surveillance
associated
with
the
judicial
monitoring
model
can
be
found
in
the
ethnographic
work
of
sociologist
james
nolan
who
undertook
several
multi
year
studies
of
drug
courts
and
other
specialized
criminal
courts
as
related
in
this
article
s
introduction
in
judge
mckinney
s
syracuse
new
york
drug
court
nolan
found
that
judicial
monitoring
empowered
the
judge
to
delegate
reporting
authority
to
the
defendant
s
employer
to
whom
judge
mckinney
promised
a
deal
y
ou
take
the
defendant
back
and
i
ll
add
another
weapon
to
your
arsenal
if
he
doesn
t
come
to
work
when
he
is
supposed
to
doesn
t
come
to
work
on
time
i
ll
put
him
in
jail
on
your
say
so
n
invasive
judicial
monitoring
of
this
sort
may
result
in
part
from
the
court
s
understanding
of
itself
as
engaged
purely
in
deterrent
conduct
shaping
monitoring
rather
than
punishment
as
on
the
therapeutic
jurisprudence
model
which
is
ostensibly
solely
rehabilitative
in
its
focus
on
the
judicial
monitoring
model
specialized
criminal
courts
seek
to
purify
their
approach
to
a
solely
deterrence
based
framework
but
as
with
the
neo
rehabilitative
approach
of
the
therapeutic
jurisprudence
model
the
judicial
monitoring
model
is
unconstrained
by
concerns
of
proportionality
and
operates
without
self
consciousness
of
its
potentially
punitive
and
overreaching
rather
than
purely
deterrent
effects
also
because
the
judicial
monitoring
model
treats
the
unconstrained
authority
of
the
judge
to
solve
problems
as
central
to
its
mission
it
is
no
solution
simply
to
constrain
sanctions
for
technical
violations
to
those
that
would
have
been
available
had
the
defendant
gone
through
the
conventional
process
or
to
those
that
would
otherwise
be
proportional
to
particular
sorts
of
violations
further
because
a
judicial
monitoring
model
is
frequently
dominant
in
specialized
courts
where
retributive
responses
are
likely
to
be
triggered
such
as
domestic
violence
and
sex
offense
courts
the
threat
of
punitive
judicial
overreaching
in
carrying
out
purportedly
purely
deterrent
monitoring
is
of
special
concern
n
in
other
words
whereas
the
therapeutic
approach
tends
to
dominate
in
courts
addressing
more
sympathetic
cases
those
involving
drug
addicts
veterans
or
the
mentally
ill
the
punitive
excesses
of
judicial
monitoring
threaten
to
surface
with
particular
force
given
that
the
model
plays
a
central
role
in
courts
with
less
conventionally
sympathetically
received
defendants
there
is
even
a
risk
that
the
monitoring
courts
will
become
partially
insulated
from
conventional
adversarial
advocacy
because
they
are
specialized
anti
formalist
team
oriented
courts
and
judicial
monitoring
will
serve
as
a
vehicle
for
enhanced
punitiveness
for
unpopular
classes
of
defendants
those
charged
with
domestic
violence
or
sex
offenses
for
example
in
addition
to
the
liberty
infringing
risks
posed
by
courts
operating
on
a
judicial
monitoring
model
there
remain
fundamental
questions
about
the
ability
of
such
courts
to
reduce
recidivism
and
achieve
other
desired
ends
n
part
of
the
motivation
for
court
specialization
is
that
judges
in
a
specialized
judicial
monitoring
court
may
become
experts
with
regard
to
the
particular
offense
at
issue
n
but
problems
arise
when
judges
believe
they
possess
special
expertise
about
a
single
best
approach
to
monitoring
an
issue
when
in
fact
there
is
profound
uncertainty
as
to
how
best
to
handle
such
matters
for
example
there
is
preliminary
empirical
evidence
that
a
judicial
monitoring
approach
is
less
effective
than
might
be
anticipated
in
reducing
recidivism
in
domestic
violence
cases
a
study
of
the
bronx
misdemeanor
domestic
violence
court
tracked
randomly
assigned
groups
of
offenders
who
received
varying
combinations
of
judicial
monitoring
and
batterer
s
intervention
n
the
differential
rates
of
recidivism
of
violent
conduct
among
the
groups
including
those
who
received
no
judicial
monitoring
or
other
intervention
were
not
statistically
significant
n
this
result
suggests
that
the
routine
judicial
monitoring
interventions
of
the
domestic
violence
court
batterer
s
intervention
and
court
monitoring
may
have
limited
success
in
reducing
the
incidence
of
domestic
violence
n
so
while
in
at
least
one
jurisdiction
domestic
violence
recidivism
remained
unchanged
substantial
resources
were
devoted
to
a
judicial
monitoring
regime
that
threatens
to
significantly
transform
the
role
of
the
judge
with
other
uncertain
and
potentially
undesirable
effects
n
what
is
more
in
the
reentry
context
at
least
a
judicial
monitoring
model
has
been
associated
with
substantial
increases
in
reincarceration
for
technical
violations
a
study
of
the
harlem
parole
reentry
court
s
initial
judicial
monitoring
program
found
that
t
echnical
revocations
occurred
more
frequently
for
reentry
court
participants
than
comparison
parolees
for
all
three
years
of
the
study
an
effect
the
court
s
researchers
ascribe
to
a
supervision
effect
n
that
is
increased
discovery
of
punishable
violations
produced
by
increased
supervision
thus
the
harlem
parole
reentry
court
study
reflects
that
a
judicial
monitoring
approach
threatens
to
increase
incarceration
for
technical
violations
such
as
missed
curfews
or
other
failures
to
conform
with
the
court
s
monitoring
orders
n
these
findings
are
consistent
with
the
best
available
evidence
regarding
intensive
supervision
programs
isp
during
an
earlier
period
of
experimentation
with
intensive
criminal
surveillance
monitoring
aimed
at
deterrence
when
uncoupled
from
a
substantial
rehabilitative
component
tends
strongly
to
expand
incarceration
with
little
in
the
way
of
countervailing
benefits
according
to
stanford
criminologist
joan
petersilia
who
is
among
the
country
s
leading
experts
on
intermediate
sanctions
the
e
mpirical
evidence
regarding
intermediate
sanctions
is
decisive
without
a
rehabilitation
component
reductions
in
recidivism
are
elusive
in
sum
programs
were
seldom
used
for
prison
diversion
but
rather
to
increase
accountability
and
supervision
of
serious
offenders
on
probation
in
addition
programs
did
not
reduce
new
crimes
but
instead
increased
the
discovery
of
technical
violations
and
ultimately
increased
incarceration
rates
and
system
costs
n
the
ineffectiveness
of
judicial
monitoring
may
be
further
aggravated
if
judicial
monitoring
negatively
influences
defendants
perceptions
of
legitimacy
of
the
courts
diminished
perceptions
of
procedural
fairness
on
the
part
of
defendants
in
judicial
monitoring
courts
may
actually
undermine
compliance
with
court
orders
by
fostering
resentment
and
exacerbating
recidivism
n
so
as
with
the
therapeutic
jurisprudence
model
on
the
judicial
monitoring
model
the
role
of
the
judge
expands
potentially
dramatically
beyond
its
traditional
bounds
surveillance
increases
procedural
protections
are
curtailed
to
enable
judicial
monitoring
and
there
is
no
overriding
commitment
to
avoid
incarceration
in
the
instance
of
discovery
of
technical
violations
as
a
consequence
increased
periods
of
at
least
short
term
incarceration
threaten
to
follow
even
if
only
as
a
product
of
technical
violations
and
the
reach
of
the
criminal
law
threatens
to
radically
expand
n
monitoring
that
is
not
merely
extending
surveillance
for
its
own
sake
must
attend
to
what
forms
of
surveillance
actually
promote
socially
desirable
outcomes
by
eliminating
crime
and
reducing
incarceration
this
is
in
significant
part
the
ambition
of
a
decarceration
model
to
which
we
will
turn
after
exploring
the
order
maintenance
model

final
criminal
law

model

at

courts
c
order
maintenance
model
the
third
widely
occurring
criminal
law
reformist
model
operative
in
specialized
criminal
courts
seeks
to
advance
order
maintenance
by
convening
local
tribunals
devoted
to
prosecutions
of
relatively
minor
quality
of
life
crimes
although
the
general
goal
of
specialized
criminal
courts
was
to
address
the
impacted
and
poor
quality
of
conventional
criminal
law
administration
by
shifting
cases
out
of
conventional
courts
into
specialized
courts
in
the
view
of
some
advocates
in
many
cases
the
current
system
works
just
fine
such
as
in
handling
murders
rapes
and
robberies
they
believed
that
alternatives
for
prosecution
of
more
serious
offenses
would
be
inappropriate
n
consequently
efforts
focused
on
minor
crimes
prostitution
low
level
drug
possession
and
disorderly
conduct
that
conventional
criminal
courts
were
otherwise
inclined
to
ignore
n
the
theoretical
framework
underlying
the
order
maintenance
model
is
largely
derived
from
the
broken
windows
approach
to
policing
the
broken
windows
or
order
maintenance
hypothesis
maintains
that
minor
physical
and
social
disorder
turnstile
jumping

public
drinking

not
addressed
contributes
to

serious

n
a
specialized
order
maintenance
criminal
court
responds
to
public
order
violations
by
initially
assigning
intermediate
sanctions
such
as
community
service
it
is
hoped
that
imposition
of
these
sanctions
in
turn
will
improve
perceptions
of
the
law
s
legitimacy
and
hence
social
order
the
theory
as
applied
to
specialized
criminal
courts
holds
that
as
a
consequence
of
prosecuting
public
order
offenses
crime
overall
will
decline
and
with
it
more
general
reliance
on
criminal
arrests
and
incarceration
n
along
these
lines
community
courts
the
quintessential
order
maintenance
courts
aim
to
improve
social
order
by
providing
a
venue
for
the
prosecution
of
relatively
minor
quality
of
life
offenses
occurring
in
a
delimited
geographic
area

if
a
defendant
is
noncompliant

misdemeanor
defendants

in

to
community
courts
other
specialized
criminal
courts
may
also
operate
on
an
order
maintenance
model
for
example
drug
courts
operating
on
an
order
maintenance
approach
provide
a
local
forum
for
prosecuting
lower
level
drug
offenses
that
would
otherwise
receive
minimal
attention
in
conventional
criminal
courts
there
are
three
supposed
advantages
to
an
order
maintenance
model
of
specialized
criminal
court
administration
all
of
which
fail
to
withstand
close
scrutiny
first
proponents
suggest
that
these
courts
will
increase
potential
offenders
perceptions
of
the
criminal
law
s
legitimacy
and
hence
will
increase
law
abiding
behavior
overall
n
this
is
thought
to
be
the
case
because
the
courts
assign
presumably
more
meaningful
non
carceral
sanctions
n
but
order
maintenance
courts
are
often
perceived
as
harsher
and
less
legitimate
than
conventional
courts
in
their
response
to
public
order
violations
community
courts
are
less
inclined
to
dismiss
cases
with
time
served
sentences
and
where
jail
time
is
imposed
it
is
for
longer
periods
n
further
community
service
sentences
will
not
necessarily
be
perceived
as
more
legitimate
than
jail
sentences
one
sex
worker
sentenced
at
the
midtown
community
court
explained
community
service
is
all
day
cleaning
toilets
and
stuffing
envelopes
n
rather
than
improving
perceptions
of
legitimacy
routine
reliance
on
community
service
of
this
sort
as
a
sanction
may
reduce
opportunities
for
paid
work
in
a
jurisdiction
and
cause
further
economic
hardship
for
defendants
the
onerous
requirements
of
unpaid
community
service
work
coupled
with
associated
fines
may
even
increase
pressures
to
participate
in
criminalized
markets
a
second
purported
advantage
of
an
order
maintenance
model
is
that
it
will
reduce
reliance
on
conventional
carceral
sentencing
instead
introducing
more
effective
and
beneficial
intermediate
sanctions
like
community
service
but
when
defendants
fail
to
comply
with
intermediate
sanctions
they
are
often
punished
with
at
least
short
term
incarceration
indeed
empirical
analyses
establish
that
increased
short
term
incarceration
is
the
unintended
outcome
of
at
least
some
courts
operating
on
an
order
maintenance
model
n
additionally
in
a
manner
distinct
from
that

of

for

n
this

is
consistent
with
the
findings
of
professors
michael
tonry
and
norval
morris
who
demonstrated
in
their
famous
study
of

that
w

an

n
this
is
not
to
suggest
that
intermediate

are
never
appropriate
but
rather
that
there
is
a
risk
of
net
widening
where
such

are
made
available
and
order

stand
to
considerably
expand
the

prosecution
by
emphasizing
offenses
that
would
otherwise
be
unlikely
targets
for
prosecution
as
a
result
of
this
net
widening
tendency
an
order
maintenance
model
threatens
to
expand
criminal
supervision
and
increase
short
term
incarceration
when
individuals
are
unable
to
comply
with
intermediate
sanctions
whether
other
beneficial
effects
on
local
neighborhoods
follow
from
this
net
widening
criminal
law
enforcement
remains
uncertain
according
to
portland
s
district
attorney
mike
schrunk
a
proponent
of
portland
s
order
maintenance
specialized
criminal
court
as
a
prosecutor
y
ou
tend
to
blow
off
turnstile
jumping
or
petty
shoplifting
because
they
are
not
as
important
as
rape
and
robbery
n
yet
schrunk
justifies
emphasis
on
these
minor
offenses
in
order
maintenance
courts
on
the
grounds
that
what
really
drives
people
out
of
a
neighborhood
or
makes
a
neighborhood
rot
from
the
inner
core
is
the
small
petty
stuff
n
but
it
is
not
entirely
clear
why
turnstile
jumping
unless
absolutely
pervasive
and
reckless
would
undermine
the
quality
of
life
in
a
particular
neighborhood
although
petty
shoplifting
is
perhaps
more
harmful
to
local
businesses
it
is
not
apparent
why
such
offenses
must
be
prosecutorial
priorities
in
order
to
obtain
a
satisfactory
level
of
respect
for
private
property
in
targeted
neighborhoods
for
instance
local
business
organizations
could
instead
encourage
store
owners
to
adopt
store
policies
that
render
goods
less
readily
subject
to
theft
in
fact
the
available
evidence
indicates
that
police
arrest
less
than
one
percent
of
all
shoplifters
n
shoplifters
are
most
likely
to
steal
products
such
as
clothing
cds
and
dvds
which
are
concealable
removable
available
valuable
enjoyable
and
disposable
n
placing
unremovable
security
tags
on
these
products
and
or
storing
them
in
locked
shelving
units
along
with
other
store
design
and
stock
control
measures
substantially
reduce
the
opportunity
to
shoplift
n
for
these
reasons
store
owners
and
the
public
at
large
would
likely
be
better
served
by
adopting
environmental
and
business
practices
that
reduce
the
incidence
of
shoplifting
rather
than
investing
large
sums
of
public
resources
in
prosecuting
some
small
percentage
of
these
offenses
that
are
so
minor
as
to
otherwise
command
little
prosecutorial
attention
in
specialized
order
maintenance
courts
of
course
this
alternative
approach
transfers
the
costs
of
addressing
petty
crime
in
part
from
tax
payers
to
business
owners
but
the
business
costs
of
merchandising
and
related
policies
are
not
prohibitive
and
there
is
strong
reason
to
believe
they
would
prove
both
more
effective
and
less
costly
overall
n
what
s
more
although
there
may
be
positive
effects
associated
with
devoting
attention
to
disruptive
conduct
that
residents
of
affected
areas
care
about
for

the
prevalence
of
street
prostitution
may
cause
more
sexual
harassment
of
all
women
and
girls
there
are
also
significant
potential
negative
systemic
consequences
generated
by
bringing
more
people
under
criminal

would
otherwise
occur
in
particular
net

may
cause
criminal
courts
dockets
to
become
further
impacted
in
denver
colorado
for
example
the
number
of
drug
cases
filed
in
the
denver
district
court
grew
radically
after
the
introduction
of
a
drug
court
program
dedicated
to
prosecuting
low
level
drug
offenses
effectively
an
order
maintenance
drug
court
model
as
police
and
prosecutors
perceived
the
courts
to
be
capable
of
handling
the
sort
of
minor
offenses
that
would
previously
not
have
been
pursued
during
the
last
full
year
before
the
denver
drug
court
convened
drug
cases
were
filed
but
during
the
second
year
of
the
court
s
existence
in
there
were
filings
judge
morris
hoffman
of
the
denver
criminal
court
reported
that
the
denver
drug
court
caused
police
to
make
arrests
in
and
prosecutors
to
file
the
kinds
of
ten
and
twenty
dollar
hand
to
hand
drug
cases
that
the
system
simply
would
not
have
bothered
with
before
n
ultimately
in
large
measure
for
this
reason
denver
abandoned
its
drug
court
in
and
did
away
with
order
maintenance
drug
law
administration
n
expanding
the
range
of
individuals
subject
to
criminal
prosecution
in
order
maintenance
courts
is
not
simply
a
matter
of
burdening
court
dockets
net
widening
produces
other
broader
systemic
pressures
when
offenders
do
not
comply
with
intermediate
sanctions
administered

they
are
subject
to
short
term
incarceration
subsequently
even
those
offenders
who
receive
only
thirty
day
jail
sentences
often
cycle
back
through
the
criminal
courts
trapped
in
a
never
ending
series
of
criminal
supervisory
sentences
such
that
these
minor
law
breakers
end
up
doing
life
in
prison
thirty
days
at
a
time
n
this
pattern
imposes
tremendous
costs
on
the
public
and
often
irreparably
disrupts
the
lives
of
accused
minor
law
breakers
and
their
families
a
final
benefit
noted
by
supporters
of
an
order
maintenance
model
and
of
community
courts
in
particular
involves
the
courts
revival
of
local
democratic
participation
in
criminal
law
administration
while
democracy
is
not
an
unqualified
good
for
criminal
law
indeed
democratic
processes
have
often
resulted
in
later
regretted
criminal
law
and
policy
outcomes
democratic
excesses
could
in
principle
be
restrained
by
confining
community
participation
to
discrete
localities
in
which
the
members
would
themselves
internalize
the
costs
of
favored
policies
n
the
local
democratic
potential
of
community
courts
is
thought
to
derive
from
the
involvement
of
community
members
in
setting
the
courts
priorities
the
local
access
to
community
court
judges
and
more
general
increased
accessibility
and
transparency
of
the
courts
yet
the
actual
democratic
potential
of
order
maintenance
community
courts
is
unclear
given
that
as
multiple
studies
indicate
only
a
small
number
of
often
relatively
wealthy
or
unusually
vocal
individuals
participate
actively
in
community
court
programs
n
in
fact
there
is
some
evidence
that
these
courts
may
serve
to
advance
the
interests
of
a
moneyed
minority
interest
group
in
furthering
gentrification
to
improve
property
values
n
and
while
gentrification
may
be
a
positive
force
in
these
neighborhoods
engendering
improved
neighborhood
quality
of
life
and
increasing
property
values
it
is
nonetheless
questionable
whether
associated
court
reform
desirably
reconstitutes
local
democratic
practices
in
criminal
law
administration
control
of
a
local
criminal
law
enforcement
agenda
by
a
few
relatively
powerful
outspoken
community
members
hardly
represents
a
robust
form
of
local
democratization
of
criminal
law
whatever
may
or
may
not
be
the
other
advantages
of
gentrification
n
in
summary
the
criminal
law
reformist
benefits
ascribed
to
an
order
maintenance
model
are
uncertain
and
this
approach
poses
a
significant
risk
of
generating
otherwise
harmful
consequences
d
decarceration
model
a
decarceration
model
is
committed
foremost
to
reducing
reliance
on
incarceration
and
to
a
sociologically
and
empirically
informed
framework
that
links
court
participants
to
local
social
services
and
other
institutions
shifting
the
management
of
socially
disruptive
conduct
in
part
from
criminal
courts
to
other
sectors
the
ultimate
aim
of
a
decarceration
model
as
applied
to
specialized
criminal
courts
is
to
isolate
those
crimes
for
which
conventional
criminal
law
administration
may
be
most
fitting
contributing
gradually
to
the
de
facto
decriminalization
of
certain
categories
of
conduct
and
enabling
alternative
non
carceral
regulatory
approaches
to
a
range
of
social
ills
where
criminalization
remains
appropriate
the
basic
premise
underlying
a
decarceration
model
in
the
specialized
courts
context
is
that
overcriminalization
and
overincarceration
are
in
part
structural
problems
which
specialized
criminal
courts
may
begin
to
address
because
a
decarceration
model
aims
to
reduce
reliance
on
incarceration
while
achieving
other
social
goals
the
model
endeavors
to
respond
to
the
forces
that
led
incarceration
rates
to
rise
so
precipitously
in
the
first
instance
and
that
cause
them
to
remain
so
high
the
explanations
for
large
scale
incarceration
are
various
but
there
is
general
agreement
that
criminal
law
and
policy
contributed
significantly
to
the
growth
in
incarceration
n
expanded
sentences
for
drug
convictions
perpetuated
a
significant
portion
of
the
increase
in
state
prisoners
beginning
in
the
late
s
and
subsequently
much
of
that
growth
has
been
attributable
to
increased
penalties
for
violent
crimes
predominantly
robbery
and
assaults
and
public
order
offenses
n
as
a
result
criminal
law
and
policy
changes
stand
to
contribute
substantially
to
decarceration
but
one
single
policy
intervention
will
be
insufficient
to
bring
about
any
extensive
decrease
in
imprisonment
instead
the
scholarly
consensus
suggests
that
prison
commitments
must
be
reduced
and
prison
release
increased
and
return
to
prison
after
parole
failure
decreased
n
obstacles
to
achieving
these
ends
which
i
will
touch
upon
only
briefly
because
they
are
thoroughly
explored
elsewhere
include
the
difficulty
of
legislatively
retreating
from
the
pathological
politics
of
overcriminalization
and
overincarceration
n
the
organizational
cultures
of
police
and
prosecutors

that
encourage
vigorous
enforcement
of
existing
criminal
laws

and

in
the
efficacy

at

unavoidability
of
criminalization
and
incarceration
n
a
decarceration
model
may
function
to
circumvent
and
begin
to
reshape
some
of
these
barriers
courts
operating
predominately
on
a
decarceration
model
circumvent
some
of
the
legislative
impediments
to
changing
substantive
criminal
law
by
working
cooperatively
with
prosecutors
police
defense
counsel
and
elected
officials
at
the
local
level
to
shift
cases
out
of
the
conventional
criminal
courts
without
requiring
legislative
repeal
of
particular
criminal
statutes
these
courts
provide
a
venue
for
suspending
or
dropping
criminal
charges
in
drug
cases
a
range
of
misdemeanor
cases
and
in
some
instances
even
in
cases
involving
more
serious
felony
charges
as
well
as
in
a
range
of
matters
involving
mentally
ill
offenders
and
veterans
a
decarceration
approach
seeks
to
locate
alternative
fora
for
responding
to
these
matters
and
then
when
the
courts
have
obtained
a
certain
measure
of
broad
based
support
legislators
are
able
to
enact
statutes
that
legitimize
and
institutionalize
the
decarceration
regime
this
method
has
proven
to
be
more
politically
viable
than
seeking
directly
to
decriminalize
particular
conduct
and
alternative
diversionary
court
approaches
have
garnered
considerable
public
support
n
in
their
day
to
day
operations
on
a
decarceration
model
courts
act
as
diversionary
clearinghouses
for

resources
ensuring

of
individual
defendants
to
those
resources

ensure
that
incarceration
is
actually
reduced
and
to
ascertain
the
effect
of
various
alternative
sanctions
and
services
on
participants
and
other
relevant
variables
n
at
least
in
some
jurisdictions
courts
adopting
a
decarceration
model
assume
jurisdiction
over
those
charged
with
or
convicted
of
more
serious
felony
offenses
n
this
is
critical
to
reducing
reliance
on
incarceration
and
avoiding
net
widening
because
many
nonviolent
misdemeanor
offenses
are
already
dealt
with
through
non
carceral
sentences
in
the
conventional
courts
n
to
the
extent
courts
adopting
a
decarceration
approach
address
accused
offenders
who
might
otherwise
receive
probationary
sentences
the
diversionary
programming
orders
issued
may
make
it
less
rather
than
more
likely
that
defendants
will
be
subject
to
incarceration
in
the
future
by
facilitating
opportunities
for
law
abiding
livelihoods
the
theoretical
framework
that
informs
the
decarceration
model
focuses
on
deploying
social
structures
separate
from
criminal
law
administrative
components
such
as
local
neighborhood
networks
business
organizations
and
mental
health
public
health
job
training
and
other
social
services
to
reduce
criminal
offending
and
to
foster
socially
constructive
citizenship
behaviors
the
foundational
idea
is
that
social
institutions
outside
the
criminal
law
context
are
critical
to
the
maintenance
of
social
order
and
to
organizing
informal
surveillance
correspondingly
a
shift
away
from
current
carceral
practices
will
be
enabled
by
bolstering
opportunities
for
social
integration
and
institutional
involvement
particularly
for
those
persons
with
otherwise
limited
access
to
such
conventional
social
institutions
n
there
is
wide
ranging
empirical
and
theoretical
support
for
this
structural
approach
one
interesting
early
contribution
comes
from
the
work
of
sheldon
and
eleanor
glueck
married
co
authors
employed
at
harvard
law
school
from
the
late
s
to
the
s
who
conducted
a
seminal
study
of
the
lives
of
boston
juvenile
delinquents
n
the
gluecks
found
that
although
most
of
the
cohort
ceased
committing
crime
after
turning
twenty
five
a
small
minority
persisted
in
criminal
involvement
decades
later
harvard
sociologist
robert
sampson
and
criminologist
john
laub
reexamined
the
gluecks
data
to
determine
if
there
were
any
criteria
distinguishable
from
the
early
lives
and
criminal
offending
of
those
men
who
went
on
to
become
persistently
criminally
involved
over
the
course
of
their
lives
n
sampson
and
laub
could
not
identify
any
factors
present
during
childhood
or
adolescence
that
differentiated
those
young
men
who
would
pose
a
continuing
menace
and
those
who
would
desist
from
criminal
activity
following
adolescence
n
there
were
however
turning
points
in
the
men
s
lives
obtaining
and
maintaining
employment
and
establishing
contacts
with
conventional
institutions
and
groups
that
distinguished
those
who
continued
to
commit
crime
from
those
that
did
not
n
further
men
who
had
been
incarcerated
in
prison
were
substantially
more
likely
to
continue
to
offend
than
men
who
served
only
local
jail
time
or
probation
n
these
factors
rather
than
personality
characteristics
early
offense
characteristics
childhood
experiences
or
other
factors
appeared
to
differentiate
the
perpetual
offenders
from
those
that
went
on
to
lead
relatively
law
abiding
lives
n
additional
support
for
the
hypothesis
that
social
engagement
and
institutional
involvement
or
group
level
effects
cause
reduced
criminal
offending
derives
from
a
significant
body
of
further
studies
linking
structural
context
and
the
prevalence
of
effective
social
organizations
with
decreased
interpersonal
violence
and
neighborhood
disorder
n
as
important
this
theory
accords
with
known
social
facts
about
the
world
social
institutions
employers
community
organizations
families
convey
social
expectations
and
informally
surveil
those
who
participate
in
them
in
a
neighborhood
where
these
institutions
are
functioning
effectively
people
tend
to
be
discouraged
and
inhibited
from
engaging
in
criminalized
pursuits
and
they
will
tend
to
have
access
to
social
supports
in
the
event
they
find
themselves
struggling
with
addiction
or
other
personal
challenges
n
nevertheless
it
is
important
to
acknowledge
that
social
institutional
engagement
will
not
serve
to
dissuade
all
persons
from
criminal
conduct
and
some
conventional
social
institutions
may
even
be
criminogenic
n
indeed
employed
persons
operating
in
firmly
established
institutional
contexts
perpetrate
fraud
embezzle
funds
and
harm
others
n
but
conventional
institutional
engagement
provides
some
significant
constraint
on
particular
sorts
of
criminal
offending
and
lacks
the
criminogenic
and
other
harmful
characteristics
associated
with
prison
or
jail
on
a
decarceration
model
then
given
the
severe
harms
associated
with
large
scale
incarceration
and
the
compelling
evidence
that
social
institutional
engagement
may
address
certain
commonly
criminally
prosecuted
forms
of
socially
disruptive
conduct
more
effectively
than
incarceration
non
carceral
sentencing
is
preferred
the
only
circumstances
under
which
a
carceral
sentence
would
be
imposed
in
a
specialized
criminal
court
adopting
a
pure
decarceration
model
would
be
where
there
is
substantial
reason
to
believe
incarceration
is
necessary
to
protect
public
safety
or
is
otherwise
necessary
in
the
interests
of
justice
and
to
the
extent
there
is
doubt
as
to
this
determination
on
a
pure
decarceration
model
that
doubt
would
be
resolved
in
favor
of
non
carceral
sentencing
unless
and
until
incarceration
becomes
necessary
n
in
such
instances
for
example
in
cases
of
serious
violent
crime
where
the
defendant
is
adjudged
mentally
well
and
that
individual
s
prior
record
and
most
recent
criminal
conduct
suggests
a
serious
ongoing
risk
to
public
safety
it
is
unlikely
a
defendant
would
be
referred
to
a
specialized
diversionary
court
in
the
first
place
were
that
to
occur
however
the
case
would
be
referred
back
to
the
conventional
court
though
these
determinations
are
inevitably
complicated
and
involve
assessment
of
uncertain
risks
serious
violent
and
dangerous
defendants
who
would
continue
to
pose
a
grave
threat
even
if
subject
to
an
alternative
socially
integrative
sentencing
regime
of
mental
health
treatment
job
placement
and
social
service
reporting
are
a
substantially
smaller
demographic
than
that
of
the
current
population
incarcerated
in
the
united
states
n
a
decarceration
model
of
specialized
criminal
law
administration
operates
with
reference
to
this
framework
seeking
to
facilitate
greater
non
carceral
social
institutional
integration
of
persons
accused
of
an
array
of
criminal
offenses
but
apart
from
this
commitment
to
attempting
to
reduce
criminal
involvement
by
improving
access
to
other
social
institutions
a
decarceration
model
is
untethered
from
any
highly
specified
jurisprudential
or
institutional
content
its
sole
unifying
feature
is
that
of
closely
empirically
monitored
experimentation
with
criminal
law
administrative
alternatives
so
as
to
reduce
reliance
on
incarceration
consistent
with
maintenance
of
public
safety
and
to
forge
a
more
sociologically
and
empirically
oriented
criminal
justice
framework
courts
adopting
a
pure
decarceration
approach
would
reject
the
court
based
therapeutic
methods
of
certain
specialized
criminal
courts
and
the
commitment
to
judicial
monitoring
as
a
scalable
manner
of
deterring
criminal
conduct
a
focus
on
order
maintenance
is
abandoned
too
on
a
decarceration
model
along
with
the
associated
commitment
to
broken
windows
policing
the
purpose
of
a
decarceration
approach
more
conducive
to
adoption
by
conventional
courts
than
reformist
approaches
that
entail
providing
therapy
in
a
courtroom
context
or
transforming
judges
into
probation
officers
though
certainly
not
typical
of
traditionally
conceived
courts
is
to
oversee
the
adequate
provision
of
services
to
the
class
of
defendants
referred
to
those
services
and
appearing
before
the
diversionary
courts
predominately
by
monitoring
the
service
providers
this
is
a
role
somewhat
familiar
to
courts
from
the
structural
reform
litigation
context
n
critically
courts
adopting
a
decarceration
model
are
experimentalist
institutions
that
are
open
to
revision
in
light
of
ongoing
empirical
feedback
they
are
unfinished
self
correcting
reformist
organizations
the
aspiration
of
a
decarceration
model
of
specialized
criminal
law
administration
is
to
bring
about
criminal
law
reform
incrementally
revising
policies
in
response
to
input
from
defendants
judges
prosecutors
public
defenders
and
empirical
monitoring
entities
n
in
this
sense
a
decarceration
model
is
decidedly
unfinished
promising
gradual
reform
rather
than
a
bold
new
program
fully
specified
in
advance
n
a
further
advantage
of
a
decarceration
model
is
that
it
works
to
reduce
reliance
on
incarceration
while
closely
attending
to
the
particular
needs
and
risks
associated
with
specific
populations
of
defendants
the
hope
is
that
this
will
free
up
resources
currently
allocated
to
criminal
law
administration
and
make
them
available
for
other
sectors
better
suited
to
addressing
the
relevant
underlying
problems
this
may
help
to
negotiate
if
not
to
entirely
avoid
the
decarceration
trap
that
professors
robert
weisberg
and
joan
petersilia
have
cautioned
against
the
grave
risk
of
backfire
if
advocates
attempt
to
reduce
mass
incarceration
simply
for
the
sake
of
reduction
rather
than
coupling
advocacy
with
a
full
consideration
of
the
causes
of
recidivism
n
because
as
weisberg
and
petersilia
warn
even
if
small
increases
in
crime
by
released
prisoners
are
not
statistically
meaningful
they
may
reignite
the
political
demagoguery
that
contributed
to
mass
incarceration
in
the
first
place
n
a
decarceration
model
functions
in
an
incrementalist
fashion
to
reduce
reliance
on
incarceration
by
experimenting
with
alternatives
closely
tailored
to
the
needs
of
populations
currently
subject
to
criminal
supervision
while
attending
to
the
causes
of
recidivism
and
creating
a
record
of
demonstrated
positive
results
a
decarceration
model
also
promises
to
attend
to
the
risk
of
transinstitutionalization
which
professor
bernard
harcourt
has
identified
with
regard
to
mentally
ill
incarcerated
persons
n
transinstitutionalization
refers
to
the
disastrous
experience
encountered
during
the
earlier
attempt
to
deinstitutionalize
persons
living
in
mental
hospitals
without
accounting
in
any
meaningful
way
for
their
integration
elsewhere
following
the
deinstitutionalization
of
hospitals
for
the
mentally
ill
in
the
s
and
s
many
persons
released
from
mental
institutions
either
became
homeless
or
were
later
reinstitutionalized
in
prisons
and
jails
n
a
decarceration
model
works
to
avoid
this
outcome
of
transferring
persons
from
one
total
carceral
institution
prison
or
jail
to
another
total
institution
for
example
a
psychiatric
hospital
by
collaborating
closely
with
monitoring
and
shifting
resources
to
a
continuum
of
networked
though
independent
and
mostly
nonresidential
service
providers
that
address
housing
mental
health
medical
and
employment
needs
of
low
income
persons
in
a
given
delimited
geographic
area
n
it
is
imperative
to
underscore
though
that
in
diverting
certain
categories
of
cases
and
defendants
to
sectors
outside
the
criminal
law
administrative
context
a
decarceration
approach
should
be
understood
as
a
partial
strategy
for
decarceration
not
necessarily
as
a
permanent
criminal
law
administrative
fixture
nor
as
a
comprehensive
solution
to
the
problems
of
overcriminalization
and
overincarceration
rather
the
decarceration
model
s
more
modest
goal
is
to
shift
the
management
of
social
disorder
where
possible
from
criminal
courts
probation
or
parole
offices
jails
and
prisons
to
a
range
of
other
institutions
invariably
violent
and
otherwise
criminal
conduct
will
continue
to
intrude
upon
people
s
lives
and
conventional
criminal
law
administration
will
play
a
role
however
imperfect
in
responding
to
that
conduct
a
decarceration
model
promises
to
minimize
such
conduct
focus
conventional
criminal
law
resources
where
they
seem
most
plainly
called
for
and
begin
to
respond
to
the
problems
of
overcriminalization
and
overincarceration
by
enlisting
other
social
institutions
more
fully
in
managing
social
disorder
documented
successful
diversion
of
some
cases
may
form
the
basis
for
subsequent
decriminalization
of
certain
conduct
for
instance
of
particular
drug
offenses
while
other
offenses
may
entail
harm
that
warrants
a
retained
norm
of
criminalization
particularly
where
theft
or
violence
is
involved
even
as
successful
diversion
may
support
substantially
reduced
reliance
on
incarceration
for
that
category
of
offense
or
offender
the
remainder
of
this

will
explore
how
different
existing

criminal
courts
are
functioning

and
should
function

a
decarceration
model

more
generally
are
considered
in
part
iv
although
many
mental
health
courts
adopt
some
combination
of
a

and

mental

may
also
embrace
a
decarceration
model
shifting

ill
persons
from
the
criminal
courts

and

to

mental
health
courts
operating
on
a
decarceration
model
seek
to
remove
mentally
ill
individuals
from
conventional
criminal
processing
to
a
forum
where
the
focus
is
on
addressing
holistically
relevant
needs
so
as
to
prevent

offending

is
tremendous
potential
to
accomplish
significant
decarceration
by
addressing

disruptive

among
the
most
common
mental

suffer
are
schizophrenia

both
of
which
are
amenable
in

cases
to

intervention

the
mentally

the

used

when

there
is

if

may
function
on

decriminalization
by
sentencing

to

when
state
legislatures
pass
drug
court
acts
or

authorizing
this
non

the
effect
is
to
bypass
political
barriers
to
more
explicit
decriminalization
and
to
lend
democratic
legitimacy
to

courts
efforts
n
reentry
courts
may
also
operate
on
a
decarceration
model
parole
or
probation
violators
constitute
approximately
of
people
admitted
to
state
prison
and
about
half
of
these
individuals
are
re
incarcerated
for
technical
violations
n
reentry
courts
may
facilitate
access
to
social
services
and
employment
and
rely
on
those
referral
sources
for
notification
of
extremely
concerning
noncompliance
but
otherwise
sharply
limit
reincarceration
for
technical
violations
n
although
most
domestic
violence
courts
function
on
a
judicial
monitoring
model
of
limited
effectiveness
and
with
substantial
associated
rights
eviscerating
risks
domestic
violence
courts
could
shift
to
a
decarceration
model
for
certain
cases
arising
from
relatively
less
serious
and
less
violent
incidents
alternative
sentences
could
still
be
onerous
and
require
among
other
conditions
considerable
financial
support
of
and
physical
separation
from
the
complainant
these
provisions
might
better
serve
the
interests
of
the
complainant
spouse
than
incarceration
for
short
periods
of
a
spouse
who
is
the
primary
source
of
financial
support
for
the
family
n
courts
could
also
work
to
facilitate
services
for
complainants
as
do
many
domestic
violence
courts
currently
particularly
because
the
availability
of
alternative
living
arrangements
employment
opportunities
or
vocational
or
educational
training
may
empower
survivors
of
domestic
violence
to
leave
or
transform
abusive
relationships
and
hence
in
the
long
run
reduce
reoffending
re
arrests
and
reincarceration
sex
offense
courts
are
generally
conceptualized
primarily
on
a
judicial
monitoring
model
but
could
also
shift
to
a
decarceration
model
by
identifying
those
individuals
whose
convictions
are
such
that
carceral
sentencing
seems
unnecessary
for
instance
individuals
convicted
on
the
basis
of
public
urination
certain
other
forms
of
indecent
exposure
or
consensual
sex
with
a
person
not
significantly
younger
than
the
accused
n
in
all
of
these
separate
specialized
criminal
court
contexts
a
decarceration
model
does
not
purport
to
be
capable
of
solving
the
underlying
problems
instead
a
decarceration
model
frees
up
resources
that
might
be
allocated
to
sectors
better
able
to
address
relevant
problems
even
if
the
problems
ultimately
remain
in
some
measure
intractable
at
least
without
further
reaching
intervention
a
decarceration
model
is
minimalist
in
its
mission
as
compared
to
competing
criminal
law
reformist
models
at
least
with
regard
to
the
degree
of
intervention
taking
place
in
the
court
itself
empirical
monitoring
may
establish
the
basis
for
transferring
this
framework
outside
the
specialized
courts
context
facilitating
farther
reaching
transformative
criminal
law
reform
gradually
in
an
incremental
experimentalist
fashion
a
decarceration
model
may
begin
to
reform
criminal
law
more
broadly
by
working
to
address
the
compound
problem
of
the
criminal
law
s
relationship
to
social
order
maintenance
and
the
social
conditions
associated
with
targeted
conduct
moving
the
regulation
of
certain
matters
outside
criminal
law
administration
to
other
sectors
in
summary
the
upshot
of
the
article
s
analysis
to
this
point
is
that
if
specialized
criminal
courts
aim
to
begin
to
reduce
harshness
and
brutality
in
criminal
law
administration
and
to
limit
reliance
on
criminal
supervision
and
incarceration
while
addressing
socially
disruptive
conduct
they
should
organize
themselves
predominantly
on
a
diversionary
minimalist
experimental
sociologically
oriented
decarceration
model
the
therapeutic
judicial
monitoring
and
order
maintenance
models
represent
distinct
criminal
law
reformist
strategies
that
threaten
to
exacerbate
rather
than
unwind
existing
problems
in
criminal
law
administration
because
they
each
possess
inherent
features
that
tend
to
increase
reliance
on
criminal
supervision
and
that
may
even
expand
incarceration
radically
transforming
the
judicial
role
and
diluting
procedural
protections
more
significantly
than
on
a
decarceration
model
without
generating
other
demonstrated
desirable
outcomes
the
following
part
will
explore
in
more
detail
three
criminal

reform
strategies
that
courts
adopting
a
decarceration
model

in

iii
possibilities
of
a
decarceration
model
much
of
the
reformist
promise
of
a
decarceration
model
lies
in
the
associated
courts
ability
to
begin
to
redirect
criminal
law
administration
more
generally
through
three
primary
strategies
cognitive
reframing
institutional
reinvention
and
systemic
change
the
following
subsections
attend
to
each
of
these
three
strategies
in
turn
a
cognitive
reframing
specialized
criminal
courts
adopting
a
decarceration
model
hold
the
potential
to
reframe
shared
understandings
of
criminalized
conduct
developing
alternative
approaches
to
an
array
of
matters
currently
managed
in
large
part
through
criminal
supervision
and
incarceration
reframing
common
conceptions
of
crime
and
punishment
is
a
critical
component
of
any
decarceration
strategy
because
to
shift
the
management
of
social
order
from
criminal
law
administration
to
other
institutions
will
require
changed
public
understandings
of
when
incarceration
is
called
for
and
what
viable
alternatives
might
entail
before
turning
to
the
mechanisms
by
which
courts
adopting
a
decarceration
model
may
reframe
the
criminal
law
s
response
to
various
forms
of
criminally
charged
conduct
a
brief
detour
into
the
literature
on
framing
is
in
order
framing
is
a
process
explored
widely
in
psychological
n
political
science
n
sociological
n
and
legal
scholarship
n
so
i
will
only
quickly
define
the
dimensions
of
framing
relevant
for
present
purposes
in
short
a
frame
is
a
mental
structure
through
which
we
understand
the
world
and
which
serves
to
organize
perception
n
frames
are
generated
through
interactive
social
processes
n
and
they
shape
how
people
construct
meaning
identify
problems
and
determine
to
resolve
those
problems
often
operating
unconsciously
to
inform
individual
and
collective
decision
making
n
how
a
particular
problem
or
choice
is
framed
significantly
influences
the
way
in
which
people
proceed
to
address
the
situation
n
for
example
a
public
health
framing
of
the
problem
of
drug
use
might
suggest
drug
treatment
as
a
preferred
solution
a
moralistic
framing
of
drug
use
as
an
unethical
failure
of
will
might
suggest
a
criminally
punitive
response
likewise

the

introduce
a
different

of

entails
reframing

involved
the

and

of

to

defense

advocated
for

s
admission
and
ultimately
convinced
the

initially
though
the
prosecutor
s
office
was
not
going
to
play
at
all
according
to
eifert
s
counsel
but
eventually
as
eifert
s
lawyer
introduced
a
differently
framed
interpretation
of
the

calling
attention
to
the
severity
of

not

the

when
as

adjusted

to
engage
the

had
been
in

that
night
when

was
firing

had
been
debated

arguing
that

should
receive

end
the

were

one

who
stated
he
feared
for

that

concluded
i
don

think
any
of

there
s
a

between

between
those
two
figures
the

and

perfect
storm
of

going
wrong
may
not
in
fact
be
clear
at
all
in
the
vast
majority
of
criminal
cases
but
veterans
courts
reintroduce
a
determinist
frame
a
collectivist
frame
and
a
broader
time
frame
for
a
range
of
conduct
in
ways
that
shift
public

of
a
significant
group
of
defendants
veterans
and
a
variety
of
criminalized
conduct
ongoing

attention
to
specialized
criminal

carries
the
reframed
understandings
in
particular
jurisdictions
such
as
in
okemos
michigan
where
eifert
s
case
unfolded
to
a
broader
national
audience
judges
operating
in
specialized
criminal
courts
understand
that
they
are
engaged
in
a
strategic
undertaking
focused
in
large
part
on
shifting
public
perceptions
about
the
appropriate
scope
of
criminal
law
and
punishment
as
judge
ginger
lerner
wren
of
the
broward
county
mental
health
court
relayed
in
comments
excerpted
in
this
article
s
introduction
we
view
the
mental
health
court
as
a
strategy
to
bring
fairness
to
the
administration
of
justice
for
persons
being
arrested
on
minor
offenses
who
suffer
from
major
mental
disability
n
this
strategy
of
reframing
particular
defendants
and
criminalized
behaviors
as
suited
for
alternative
forms
of
social
response
apart
from
the
criminal
law
is
a
crucial
part
of
the
work
of
a
veterans
or
mental
health
court
and
of
a
decarceration
approach
more
generally
it
is
important
to
note
however
that
this
strategy
is
not
without
important
limits
the
success
of
reframing
and
of
admission
to
the
programs
depends
on
the
zealous
advocacy
of
defense
counsel
and
on
the
openness
of
the
judge
and
prosecutor
while
measures
could
and
perhaps
should
be
taken
to
limit
prosecutorial
discretion
in
the
referral
process
the
cooperation
of
prosecutors
contributes
to
the
reframing
work
in
which
the
court
is
engaged
in
any
case
despite
its
limits
through
this
strategy
specialized
criminal
courts
have
generated
some
significant
reconceptualization
of
how
to
approach
particular
categories
of
offenses
and
offenders
these
changes
generally
begin
with
judges
and
lawyers
working
within
the
courts
chief
judge
jonathan
lippman
of
the
new
york
court
of
appeals
for
instance
has
suggested
that
when
it
comes
to
non
violent
crime
we
have
changed
how
judges
and
lawyers
measure
success
no
longer
by
the
number
of
dispositions
convictions
or
acquittals
but
by
whether
we
are
able
to
break
the
cycle
of
addiction
and
crime
and
improve
public
safety
n
judge
clinton
deveaux
reports
that
although
his
judicial
colleagues
used
to
deride
his
specialized
criminal
court
work
as
that
of
a
social
worker
on
the
bench
in
due
course
other
judges
started
to
refer
cases
to
his
court
and
reported
adopting
some
similar
approaches
in
their
own
conventional
courts
acknowledging
that
this
is
the
only
way
to
deal
with
this
stuff
if
you
re
going
to
actually
stop
the
recidivism
and
actually
solve
some
of
the
problems
that
are
bringing
these
people
to
the
court
n
transfer
of
reframed
conceptions
also
is
likely
to
occur
through
the
transfer
of
judges
from
the
specialized
criminal
court
back
to
the
conventional
court
when
judges
move
between
a
specialized
criminal
court
and
a
conventional
court
many
report
that
they
continue
to
apply
in
part
the
approach
developed
in
the
alternative
court
context
to
the
extent
allowable
n
beyond
the
level
of
reshaping
the
perspectives
of
individual
court
personnel
judges
and
other
institutional
actors
frequently
adapt
the
courtroom
to
function
as
public
theatre
and
publicize
through
the
media
the
aspirations
of
their
respective
courts
as
a
consequence
large
numbers
of
cases
are
not
necessarily
required
for
the
courts
to
shift
understandings
on
a
broader
scale
n
this
addresses
one
challenge
for
specialized
criminal
courts
namely
that
they
cannot
reasonably
be
brought
to
scale
active
engagement
of
judges
lawyers
and
social
scientists
involved
with
diversionary
courts
in
reframing
certain
of
the
criminal
law
problems
at
stake
in
the
courts
allows
the
courts
broader
reach
than
that
provided
by
the
relatively
limited
number
of
cases
they
are
able
to
process
at
any
given
time
additionally
through
empirical
monitoring
of
the
courts
a
decarceration
model
helps
determine
whether
incarceration
is
necessary
or
advisable
for
certain
kinds
of
crimes
and
defendants
balancing
important
concerns
about
public
safety
and
criminal
law
reform
goals
many
administrators
of
specialized
criminal
courts
often
alongside
external
empirical
monitoring
entities
closely
track
the
outcomes
regarding
recidivism
and
other
variables
for
participants
in
non
carceral
programming
relative
to
similarly
situated
persons
subject
to
conventional
criminal
supervision
and
or
incarceration
if
a
decarceration
approach
is
able
to
demonstrate
that
reliance
on
incarceration
can
be
diminished
without
imperiling
public
safety
this
approach
may
reframe
public
attitudes
regarding
incarceration
more
broadly
providing
the
basis
for
a
large
scale
reasoned
rethinking
of
prison
and
jail
based
social
order
maintenance
n
the
process
of
disseminating
empirical
analyses
is
well
underway
with
drug
courts
in
a
quasi
experimental

in
june
a
team
of
social
scientists
working
with
the
urban
institute
and
funded
by
the
u

department
of

examined
the
outcomes
regarding

recidivism
and

relapse
for
participants
in
twenty
three

courts
and
six

of
statistical
techniques
to
correct
for

and
clustering
of

the
study
s
authors
found
that
drug
courts
significantly
reduce
criminal
recidivism
and
drug
use
after
eighteen
months
as
compared
to
the
outcomes
for
similar
individuals
in
the
comparison
sites
n
in
july
the
senate
judiciary
committee
convened
hearings
regarding
this
and
related
studies
to
explore
expanded
funding
for
specialized
criminal
courts
relying
on
alternatives
to
incarceration
with
specific
emphasis
on
drug
courts
and
veterans
courts
n
in
time
empirical
analyses
of
this
sort
may
facilitate
alternative
framings
that
would
enable
legislative
reforms
markedly
scaling
back
sentence
lengths
across
the
board
though
specialized
criminal
courts
have
generally
started
with
jurisdiction
only
over
a
very
limited
class
of
offenders
or
offenses
typically
the
courts
authority
expands
and
an
increasing
range
of
cases
come
before
the
courts
for
example
drug
courts
began
by
accepting
drug
possession
cases
but
over
time
have
expanded
to
include
individuals
arrested
for
forgery
burglary
and
other
crimes
believed
to
be
associated
with
drug
addiction
n
this
occurs
in
part
due
to
the
cognitive
reframing
that
the
courts
enable
drug
crime
is
characterized
to
include
not
only
narcotics
possession
and
sales
offenses
but
also
conduct
motivated
by
drug
addiction
once
diversionary
specialized
criminal
courts
have
become
an
established
alternative
means
of
addressing
drug
offenses
and
the
socially
disruptive
conduct
of
veterans
or
the
mentally
ill
broader
shifts
in
social
understanding
may
be
set
in
motion
the
diversionary
alternatives
introduce
a
new
institutional
framework
for
managing
the
problems
in
question
the
existence
of
these
programs
normalizes
the
alternative
responses
and
the
availability
of
a
parallel
diversionary
alternative
for
a
significant
class
of
cases
makes
available
a
set
of
reasons
why
diversion
may
be
preferable
in
other
contexts
a
potentially
transposable
reasoned
override
to
the
automatic
invocation
of
conventional
criminal
law
frameworks
n
the
contagion
of
the
diversionary
approach
is
confirmed
by
the
experience
of
the
past
decade
during
which
time
diversionary
courts
have
rapidly
multiplied
in
numerous
areas
and
expanded
to
cover
more
serious
offenses
the
alternative
framings
of
crime
and
punishment
emerging
through
the
work
of
specialized
criminal
courts
particularly
those
adopting
a
diversionary
decarceration
approach
hold
the
promise
to
shift
considerably
and
broadly

b
institutional

along
with
reframing

a

model
may
also
reshape

institutions
by
introducing
additional
tasks
for
judges
defense

and
prosecutors
further
a
decarceration
model
incorporates
novel
players
into
specialized
criminal
courts
work
in
part
by
facilitating
partnerships
with
local
organizations
and
social
service
providers
n
the
roles
of
the
judge
and
the
parties
on
a
decarceration
model
are
all
in
flux
but
unlike
on
the
therapeutic
jurisprudence
or
judicial
monitoring
models
these
role
shifts
are
relatively
consistent
with
preservation
of
conventional
values
respectively
associated
with
these
roles
the
primary
work
of
the
judge
on
a
decarceration
model
is
to
convene
the
parties
and
service
providers
to
oversee
the
negotiation
of
a
diversion
plan
to
monitor
performance
of
diversion
programs
and
then
to
be
available
to
adjudicate
motions
for
sanctions
should
major
noncompliance
become
an
issue
the
judge
on
a
decarceration
model
plays
a
far
less
active
role
than
on
a
therapeutic
judicial

order
maintenance
model
requiring
only
one
or
two
days
of
work
per
week
in
the

the

institutional
design
facilitates
conscientiousness
about
procedural
protections

in

proceedings

it
aims
to
make
transparent
the
reasons
behind

orders

informed
criminal

administration
n
defense
counsel
s
role
shifts
too
such
that
his
or
her
most
critical
function
involves
negotiating
the
terms
on
which
a
defendant
opts
into
the
diversionary
court

specialized
criminal
courts
are
configured
differently
with
regard
to
the
consequences
of
failure
in
terms
of
sentence
penalties
informed
counsel
at
this
stage
is
extremely
important
defense
counsel
continues
to
play
a
role
in
safeguarding
a
defendant
s
procedural
rights
and
other
interests
throughout
the
process
especially
when
motions
for
sanctions
arise
defense
counsel
may
play
a
critical
part
as
well
in
ensuring
that
the
court
actually
reduces
carceral
sentencing
as
opposed
to
on
a
therapeutic
approach
where
defense
counsel
may
acquiesce
in
a
carceral
sentence
for
its
presumed
therapeutic
effect
or
in
conventional
courts
where
much
defense
work
involves
brokering
plea
deals
and
rarely
actively
contesting
evidence
let
alone
conducting
trials
n
the
role
shift
on
a
decarceration
model
is
perhaps
most
dramatic
for
prosecutors
embracing
a
decarceration
approach
for
prosecutors
entails
that
their
offices
operate
not
simply
by
seeking
the
toughest
charges
and
sentences
for
criminal
defendants
but
that
they
work
also
on
strengthening
public
safety
and
advancing
justice
in
a
broader
context
n
prosecutors
on
a
decarceration
model
focus
their
conventional
prosecutorial
resources
on
more
serious
violent
or
property
crimes
where
conventional
criminal
proceedings
are
most
warranted
and
refer
to
specialized
courts
or
drop
charges
in
those
matters
where
non
carceral
sentencing
is
possible
prosecutors
committed
to
decarceration
also
devote
their
resources
in
part
to
enabling
alternatives
to
incarceration
taking
up
in
some
significant
manner
a
decarceration
agenda
the
brooklyn
district
attorney
s
office
for
example
has
pioneered
several
alternatives
to
incarceration
programs
these
initiatives
emerged
before
the
proliferation
of
specialized
criminal
courts
suggesting
that
a
decarceration
approach
may
have
broader
potential
to
restructure
a
prosecutorial
agenda
beyond
specialized
courts

to
enter

of
receiving
a

across
brooklyn
to

and
treatment
programs
n
this
work
does
not
require
prosecutors
to
cease
prosecuting
cases
of
serious
crime
but
it
suggests
that
prosecutors
can
play
an
important
part
in
decarceration
strategies
by
augmenting
the
prosecutorial
function
and
organizational
mission
beyond
reshaping
the
roles
of
existing
players
in
criminal
courts
a
decarceration
model
introduces
additional
players
one
notable
new
player
is

cross
sector
collaborative
efforts
of
the
courts
finally
specialized
criminal
courts
operating
on
a
decarceration
model
may
work
to
shift
the
institutional
form
and
function
of
the
courts
themselves
as
it
has
begun
to
adopt
to
a
greater
extent
a
decarceration
mission
the
reentry
court
in
harlem
for
example
has
appropriated
the
form
of
the
parole
revocation
court
but
has
become
less
court
like
functioning
simultaneously
as
a
clearinghouse
for
job
placement
mental
health
care
and
legal
advice
aiming
to
change
local
opportunities
for
ex
offenders
and
to
facilitate
more
general
economic
development
programs
in
east
harlem
n
over
time
as
these
courts
become
resource
clearinghouses
rather
than
primarily
sites
for
processing
guilty
pleas
or
parole
revocations
this
may
work
to
transform
diversionary
courts
from
criminal
courts
into
different
institutions
altogether
focusing
conventional
criminal
law
resources
on
the
most
serious
forms
of
violent
and
property
crime
and
lending
support
to
a
range
of
different
local
social
and
economic
development
initiatives
c
systemic
change
through
both
reframed
understandings
and
institutional
reinvention
a
decarceration
model
may
enable
broader
systemic
change
altering
conceptual
approaches
to
prevalent
social
problems
freeing
financial
resources
for
other
initiatives

the
level
of
accountability
of

providers
in
diversionary
collaborations
politicizing
court
actors
regarding
the
limits
of

alternative
programming
and
transforming
the
manner
in
which
criminal
law
is
administered
more
generally
first
by
marshaling
support
for
particular
types
of
social

interventions
a
decarceration
model
directs
attention
and
financial
resources
to
public
health
mental
health
housing
and
other
services
that
might
not
otherwise
be
available
n
particularly
during
times
of
fiscal
austerity
as
resources
are
cut
for
mental
health
and
other
public
health
programs
a
decarceration
approach
may
free
resources
that
could
be
allocated
to
treatment
initiatives
n
as
prisons
close
additional
resources
may
be
freed
for
other
initiatives
n
in
this
regard
specialized
criminal
courts
function
as
a
potential
vehicle
for
justice
reinvestment
as
the
former
executive
director
of
the
national
association
of
drug
court
professionals
karen
freeman
wilson
explained
the
ultimate
idea
is
to
shift
the
resources
from
the
departments
of
correction
and
other
places
where
that
money
could
be
put
to
better
use
n
these
courts
may
also
bring
about
systemic
change
by
influencing
how
the
problems
confronting
criminal
courts
for
instance
mental
illness
are
managed
in
other
parallel
institutions
such
as
in
cities
public
health
and
publicly
subsidized
housing
systems
monitoring
the
provision
of
services
in
diversionary
programs
provides
an
additional
layer
of
accountability
for
those
sectors
n
through
this
monitoring
the
courts
aim
to
encourage
improved
performance
in
related
fields
as
court
administrators
advocate
for
example
to
make
sure
there
are
enough
treatment
beds
treatment
slots
in
order
to
make
these
courts
functional
n
as
specialized
criminal
court
judges
and
advocates
run
up
against
the
limits
of
social
service
providers
to
accommodate
the
need
for
the
relevant
services
the
effect
in
many
instances
may
be
a
politicization
of
judges
and
other
court
advocates
regarding
the
structural
problems
afflicting
the
demographic
served
by
the
court
part
of
the
reformist
potential
of
a
decarceration
model
then
is
that
it
may
lead
court
participants
to
galvanize
broader
support
for
reallocation
of
resources
to
better
address
these
problems
some
mental
health
court
personnel
have
begun
this
process
by
locating
resources
for
housing
subsidies
and
by
serving
as
advocates
for
court
participants
with
potential
landlords
n
it
is
important
to
acknowledge
though
that
in
some
perhaps
even
in
many
circumstances
a
decarceration
model
may
run
up
against
a
sense
of
tragic
futility
and
the
court
and
related
diversionary
programs
may
be
unable
to
address
adequately
the
matters
at
hand
even
with
more
extensive
resources
for
treatment
and
other
social
service
alternatives
n
after
all
simply
improving
the
employment
and
life
prospects
of
particular
individuals
and
shifting
resources
to
institutions
that
may
support
those
individuals
to
become
more
socially
integrated
is
unlikely
to
do
a
great
deal
to
shift
the
structures
of
opportunity
in
blighted
urban
and
rural
neighborhoods
when
fundamentally
the
problems
the
courts
aim
to
address
are
deep
seated
systemic
problems
n
yet
under
such
circumstances
the
limitations
of
specialized
criminal
courts
may
facilitate
larger
scale
legislative
reform
that
support
effective
decriminalization
of
certain
offenses
reduced
incarceration
regarding
others
and
reinvestment
in
under
resourced
areas
for
instance
the
limited
capacity
of
drug
courts
in
california
to
address
treatment
and
other
needs
in
that
state
helped
to
facilitate
legislative
reform
along
these
lines
in
when
california
voters
passed
proposition
the
substance
abuse
and
crime
prevention
act
permitting
drug
arrestees
to
receive
probation
with
drug
treatment
instead
of
incarceration
the
public
was
responding
in
part
to
criticism
of
drug
courts
that
they
served
too
few
drug
offenders
and
involved
too
much
judicial
oversight
n
while
california
s
drug
courts
provided
treatment
to
approximately
individuals
annually
before
under
proposition
approximately
drug
offenders
each
year
were
receiving
probation
with
drug
treatment
by
n
further
supervision
is
delegated
from
the
judge
to
probation
officers
and
revocation
of
probation
is
only
considered
under
limited
specified
conditions
flash
incarceration
short
term
incarceration
for
technical
violations
is
not
permitted
n
the
utah
drug
offender
reform
act
provides
another
intriguing
window
on
to
the
systemic
shifts
set
in
motion
by
the
relatively
limited
capacity
of
specialized
criminal
courts
according
to
dan
becker
utah
s
state
court
administrator
the
focus
that
drug
courts
have
put
on
treatment
gave
rise
to
a
lot
of
interest
on
the
part
of
the
larger
criminal
justice
community
in
utah
all
of
the
criminal
justice
agencies
got
together
and
worked
for
several
years
on
crafting
legislation
that
s
called
the
drug
offender
reform
act
which
provides
for
screening
and
assessment
for
every
single
person
charged
with
a
felony
where
there

a

offense
involved

last
year
stepped
forward
and
funded
about
half
of
the
cost
of
implementation
they
ll
fund
the
other
half
next
year
hopefully
and
that
s
a
complete
shift
in
public
policy
i
suspect
you
could
trace
that
back
to
the
roots
of
drug
courts
putting
the
emphasis
on
treatment
n
as
court
personnel
struggle
against
structural
barriers
such
as
a
lack
of
adequate
public
health
and
mental
health
services
lack
of
affordable
housing
and
geographically
concentrated
underemployment
the
result
may
be
some
measure
of
consciousness
raising
and
potentially
responsive
legislative
change
but
also
an
acute
sense
of
the
impossible
situation
in
which
many
subjects
of
the
criminal
law
find
themselves
part
of
the
reformist
potential
of
a
decarceration
model
is
that
this
experience
will
lead
court
participants
to
work
to
address
more
comprehensively
the
structural
problems
at
issue
and
to
disseminate
more
widely
the
truth
that
criminal
courts
cannot
serve
as
a
cure
all
for
social
insecurity
social
risk
and
the
underlying
social
problems
the
courts
routinely
confront
moreover
specialized
criminal
courts
operating
on
a
decarceration
model
begin
to
expose
the
complexity
of
the
problems
at
hand
and
the
unavailability
of
a
complete
resolution
of
that
complexity
they
can
help
all
of
us
to
see
that
the
problems
that
have
found
their
way
to
criminal
courts
are
often
ones
for
which
there
is
no
ideal
solution
even
though
there
are
better
more
humane
responses
or
worse
more
brutal
carceral

of
imperfectly
addressing
these

these
various
respects

iv
perils
of

reform
it
remains
to
consider
the
perils
presented
by
a
specialized
criminal

reform
agenda
generally
as
distinct
from
the
potential
risks
addressed
above
with
regard
to
the
more
predominant
criminal
law
reformist
models
at
work
in
specialized
criminal
courts
specialized
criminal
courts
generally
pose
a
number
of
significant
and
concerning
risks
excessive
reliance
on
legal
frameworks
to
address
complex
social
concerns
dilution
of
the
expressive
retributive
or
deterrent
force
of
criminal
law
broadly
diminished
procedural
protections
inefficiently
proliferating
specializations
and
legitimation
of
harshness
in
conventional
courts
for
less
sympathetic
racial
minority
or
otherwise
stigmatized
defendants
this
part
will
begin
to
address
these
risks
and
the
ability
of
courts
adopting
a
decarceration
model
to
respond
to
them
a
excessive
legalism
critics
of
specialized
criminal
courts
reject
the
overarching
premise
that
criminal
courts
can
be
relied
upon
to
address
complex
social
problems
professor
jane
m
spinak
has
argued
that
court
based
approaches
will
be
incapable
of
managing
either
the
structural
problems
the
specialized
criminal
courts
aim
to
address
such
as
crippling
caseloads
in
conventional
criminal
courts
or
the
difficult
social
issues
the
courts
seek
to
handle
such
as
addiction
and
social
dislocation
n
specialized
criminal
courts
will
be
unable
to
manage
the
courts
structural
problems
spinak
contends
because
those
problems
are
produced
by
legislatures
and
public
policies
over
which
the
courts
exercise
little
control
simply
put
so
long
as
police
persist
in
arresting
and
prosecutors
persist
in
prosecuting
drug
offenders
the
volume
of
drug
offenders
in
the
criminal
courts
will
remain
high
moreover
spinak
maintains
the
societal
and
personal
problems
the
courts
seek
to
address
are
multifaceted
and
socially
entrenched
and
will
be
difficult
if
not
impossible
for
courts
to
mitigate
absent
broader
structural
shifts
to
substantiate
these
arguments
spinak
explores
the
history
of
the
early
family
courts
which
like
contemporary
specialized
criminal
courts
had
problem
oriented
ambitions
and
fell
short
in
resolving
the
relevant
problems
largely
because
of
the
complicated
socially
ingrained
character
of
family
dysfunction
n
spinak
concludes
that
we
need
to
develop
resources
beyond
the
court
and
focus
on
more
client
oriented
solutions
rather
than
therapeutic
or
court
interventions
n
in
spinak
s
view
though
any
conceptual
reorientation
within
the
courts
toward
building
resources
beyond
the
court
and
developing
client
oriented
solutions
is
not
enough
to
stem
the
tide
of
judicial
activism
that
situates
problem
solving
in
the
court
itself
rather
than
in
the
broader
structure
of
how
people
in
need
are
served
by
our
society
n
professor
mae
c
quinn
has
advanced
a
related
argument
against
the
legalist
orientation
of
a
criminal
law
reform
strategy
located
in
specialized
criminal
courts
quinn
s
analysis
draws
on
the
failure
of
another
earlier
progressive
era
attempt
to
address
a
range
of
social
problems
through
procedurally
informal
specialized
courts
quinn
provides
a
fascinating
history
of
how
one
progressive
era
female
judge
the
honorable
anna
kross
convened
specialized
courts
to
address
the
problems
of
domestic
violence
and
juvenile
delinquency
but
ultimately
judge
kross
s
experiments
were
disbanded
and
derided
as
failures
because
they
were
so
expensive
that
they
could
never
be
brought
to
scale
additionally
the
treatment
methods
coordinated
by
the
court
were
unable
to
address
the
broader
social
issues
at
hand
and
the
outsourcing
of
treatment
tasks
resulted
in
overreaching
and
privatization
of
the
judicial
system
n
the
progressive
era
endeavor
to
address
social
problems
through
specialized
courts
was
dismantled
legal
protections
for
accused
persons
were
expanded
and
observers
concluded
that
while
social
work
intervention
might
be
helpful
to
persons
in
distress
this
would
be
best
achieved
outside
the
context
of
criminal
law
administration
the
troubled
juvenile
courts
are
the
one
continuing
institutional
component
of
this
progressive
era
legacy
quinn
draws
from
this
historical
experience
to
suggest
that
contemporary
criminal
court
reformers
should
be
much
more
skeptical
than
they
are
about
the
claimed
newness
of
their
interventions
and
the
capacity
of
court
coordinated
treatment
to
resolve
the
targeted
legal
systemic
or
social
problems
n
spinak
and
quinn
s
respective
critiques
apply
with
particular
force
to
therapeutic
judicial
monitoring
and
order
maintenance
models
of
specialized
criminal
law
administration
a
decarceration
model
however
is
primarily
invested
in
shifting
problems
and
resources
to
other
extralegal
sectors
making
it
less
susceptible
to
the
charge
of
nai
xfe
ve
legalism
and
on
a
decarceration
model
the
diversionary
programs
are
open
to
all
persons
not
just
those
referred
through
the
court
so
it
is
not
principally
the
courts
themselves
that
are
determining
the
scope
of
the
populations
served
or
the
precise
content
of
the
service
providers
interventions
to
the
extent
courts
remain
involved
they
aim
to
ensure
some
measure
of
accountability
for
the
service
providers
in
response
to
the
concern
raised
by
spinak
that
the
structural
problems
at
issue
emanate
from
police
practices
legislatures
prosecutorial
prerogatives
and
the
desolation
of
poor
urban
and
rural
neighborhoods
and
so
cannot
be
resolved
by
court
innovation
a
decarceration
model
directs
attention
to
reframing
understandings
of
crime
and
punishment
in
ways
that
promise
to
shift
police
practices
and
prosecutorial
prerogatives
as
explored
earlier
in
part
iii
a
decarceration
model
does
not
purport
to
use
the
court
directly
to
resolve
the
broader
problems
but
in
reframing
and
publicizing
a
conception
of
drug
dependency
mental
illness
and
other
matters
as
structural
and
social
challenges
a
decarceration
model
a
makes
available
other
ways
of
conceiving
and
managing
these
concerns
and
b
actively
enlists
police
and
prosecutors
in
the
courts
work
thereby
influencing
those
agencies
perspectives
and
conduct
empirical
documentation
of
the
courts
progress
may
ultimately
provide
the
basis
for
legislative
change
as
described
earlier
in
part
iii
a
decarceration
model
thus
promises
to
effect
change
in
policing
prosecution
and
to
do
so
through
legislation
rather
than
assuming
that
a
legalist
court
based
strategy
on
its
own
will
effect
desired
change
finally
in
galvanizing
resources
for
blighted
social
service
sectors
and
neighborhoods
a
decarceration
model
may
begin
to
address
invariably
only
partially
some
of
the
broader
structural
deficits
to
which
therapeutic
judicial
monitoring
or
order
maintenance
models
are
less
attuned
due
to
the
almost
exclusive
focus
of
these
approaches
on
the
presumed
pathologies
of
individuals
a
decarceration
model
also
begins
to
account
for
quinn
s
objections
regarding
the
implausibility
due
to
cost
of
bringing
specialized
criminal
courts
to
scale
as
well
as
the
threat
of
judicial
overreaching
on
a
decarceration
model
the
courts
are
part
of
an
interim
decarceration
strategy
carried
out
by
reframing
particular
conceptions
of
crime
punishment
and
its
alternatives
by
partially
reshaping
the
institutional
roles
of
judges
defense
counsel
prosecutors
and
criminal
courts
and
by
shifting
resources
a
decarceration
model
need
not
be
brought
to
scale
to
stimulate
some
significant
measure
of
cognitive
reframing
institutional
reinvention
and
systemic
change
as
certain
specialized
criminal
courts
have
already
begun
to
do
the
problem
of
judicial
overreaching
to
which
quinn
attends
and
which
is
in
part
a
product
of
excessive
faith
in
legal
fora
to
facilitate
change
is
mitigated
on
a
decarceration
model
due
to
the
minimalist
diversionary
approach
characteristic
of
the
model
the
central
aspiration
of
courts
adopting
a
decarceration
model
is
to
divert
cases
to
other
social
sectors
which
fulfill
some
less
formal
surveillant
function
and
provide
social
services
without
enlisting
judges
in
that
work
although
as
with
any
court
based
reform
strategy
a
decarceration
model
runs
some
risk
of
excessive
legalism
the
experimental
empirically
and
sociologically
oriented
diversionary
approach
of
a
decarceration
model
mitigates
this
risk
considerably
one
might
wonder
then
why
involve
the
courts
at
all
if
a
decarceration
model
is
primarily
diversionary
the
answer
lies
in
the
fact
that
the
matters
at
issue
are
currently
lodged
in
criminal
courts
and
political
process
defects
have
left
the
task
of
addressing
these
matters
largely
to
judges
in
criminal
courts
themselves
judges
devised
specialized
criminal
courts
as
a
creative
work
around
of
these
political
process
defects
at
this
point
the
courts
hold
considerable
advantages
as
sites
for
reshaping
public
understandings
of
crime
and
punishment
for
shifting
institutional
roles
and
for
reallocating
resources
to
other
sectors
further
as
professor
michael
dorf
has
argued
specialized
criminal
courts
have
convening
power
as
well
as
disentrenching
capacity
to
impose
a
penalty
default
so
unpalatable
to
all
parties
that
they
have
no
choice
but
to
hammer
out
some
solution
n
also
courts
are
perceived
as
relatively
neutral
and
morally
authoritative
institutions
lending
greater
force
to
the
experimental
and
empirical
work
ongoing
there
finally
courts
may
provide
some
mechanism
through
which
to
render
service
providers
accountable
in
the
transition
to
a
diversionary
regime
along
these
lines
then
a
decarceration
model
may
navigate
some
of
the
excessive
legalism
potentially
associated
with
specialized
criminal
courts
and
underscored
by
spinak
and
quinn
while
taking
advantage
of
the
institutional
authority
of
the
courts
to
initiate
broader
transformative
criminal
law
reform
b
criminal
justice
a
separate
question
regarding
specialized
criminal
courts
is
whether
they
undermine
the
expressive
force
of
criminal
justice
conveying
blame
and
or
deterring
wrongdoing
are
arguably
the
most
important
features
of
the
criminal
law
n
plus
tying
moral
blame
to
criminal
sanctions
may
play
a
critical
role
in
realizing
the
criminal
law
s
deterrent
potential
n
furthermore
richard
c
boldt
has
argued
that
criminal
law
does
more
than
simply
express
an
intentionalist
perspective
a
perspective
that
affirms
human
agency
and
moral
responsibility
but
additionally
it
is
a
vital
societal
mechanism
by
which
that
perspective
is
created
and
maintained
and
the
causal
or
objective
perspective
obscured
n
for
this
reason
boldt
contends
it
is
a
mistake
to
medicalize
addiction
and
thereby
excuse
it
instead
decriminalization
is
preferable
to
excusing
categories
of
conduct
which
are
ill
suited
for
criminal
prosecution
in
part
because
appropriate
excusing
factors
would
undermine
the
fundamentally
intentionalist
perspective
of
the
criminal
law
n
from
this
vantage
point
specialized
criminal
courts
might
be
understood
to
weaken
the
moral
condemnatory
dimension
of
criminal
justice
and
hence
to
undercut
its
deterrent
force
insofar
as
moral
prohibition
is
necessary
to
make
deterrence
effective
in
beginning
to
address
these
concerns
at
first
blush
it
may
appear
that
retributivism
is
a
theory
of
punishment
irreconcilably
at
odds
with
the
express
mission
of
decarceration
the
crux
of
a
retributive
approach
is
to
punish
offenders
proportionally
to
their
moral
blameworthiness
based
on
the
crime
committed
leniency
and
harshness
both
violate
the
principle
of
proportionality
yet
upon
closer
examination
there
may
be
a
retributive
defense
of
a
decarceration
model
after
all
a
retributive
account
of
a
decarceration
model
would
proceed
on
the
following
premises
first
if
retributivist
criminal
law
administration
is
to
impart
moral
blame
and
assign
proportionate
punishment
it
ought
to
focus
on
those
forms
of
misconduct
for
which
blame
is
apt
not
on
conduct
for
which
victims
are
absent
or
where
moral
agency
is
seriously
in
question
courts
adopting
a
decarceration
approach
focus
in
large
part
though
not
entirely
on
what
professor
sanford
kadish
has
characterized
as
morally
neutral
criminal
offenses
or
on
offenders
whose
moral
blameworthiness
is
otherwise
mitigated
n
for
these
categories
of
offense
and
offender
the
retributive
concern
with
imparting
moral
blame
through
criminal
law
holds
less
sway
still
in
cases
involving
both
morally
neutral
as
well
as
more
morally
charged
offenses
courts
adopting
a
decarceration
approach
limit
defendants
liberty
in
significant
ways
which
are
surely
experienced
by
defendants
as
constraining
sanctioning
and
in
those
respects
punitive
for
example
a
drug
addict
mandated
by
the
court
to
undergo
treatment
or
a
person
with
mental
illness
mandated
to
comply
with
a
mental
health
regimen
both
have
their
liberty
undermined
in
the
throes
of
addiction
or
a
psychotic
manic
episode
most
persons
would
prefer
to
use
drugs
or
experience
their
mania
specialized
criminal
courts
punish
those
persons
by
limiting
their
liberty
and
mandating
by
force
of
law
a
socially
preferred
course
of
action
in
other
words
social
service
intervention
and
punishment
are
not
necessarily
diametrically
opposed
such
intervention
may
be
experienced
as
punitive
and
in
fact
such
intervention
can
actually
provide
the
ideological
basis
whereby
the
state
exercises
greater
control
over
the
individual
than
is
typical
of
a
normal
criminal
court
n
in
this
regard
from
a
retributive
standpoint
specialized
criminal
courts
may
enable
more
meaningful
punitiveness
than
conventional
criminal
courts
according
to
former
kansas
city
drug
court
prosecutor
claire
mccaskill
the
diversionary
programs
required
of
participants
in
her
jurisdiction
are
tougher
than
the
alternatives
n
in
contrast
conventional
jail
prison
and
probationary
sentencing
often
fail
on
a
retributive
theory
either
because
of
disproportionate
harshness
when
an
inmate
will
be
physically
harmed
and
subject
to
brutal
conditions
or
when
prison
jail
and
probation
function
as
part
of
the
anticipated
life
course
not
as
especially
stigmatizing
punishment
for
certain
demographics
of
criminally
convicted
persons
n
in
this
regard
diversionary
sentencing
may
provide
more
meaningful
proportionate
and
significantly
liberty
constraining
punishment
from
a
retributive
standpoint
than
conventional
sentencing
n
additionally
because
a
decarceration
model
maintains
no
commitment
to
a
purely
therapeutic
neo
rehabilitative
or
purely
deterrent
judicial
monitoring
approach
there
is
nothing
to
prevent
specialized
criminal
court
teams
from
incorporating
proportional
sentencing
constraints
in
devising
diversionary
sentences
a
decarceration
model
need
not
fundamentally
undermine
an
agency
focused
intentionalist
perspective
of
the
sort
boldt
addresses
but
merely
reorganizes
society
s
response
to
particular
defendants
and
offenses
preferring
mandatory
social
institutional
integration
to
jail
or
prison
sentencing
criminal
prohibitions
remain
intact
until
they
are
legislatively
altered
so
the
expressive
moral
condemnation
function
of
criminal
law
remains
in
that
regard
unchanged
the
sentence
assigned
in
response
merely
shifts
from
prison
jail
and
conventional
criminal
supervision
to
other
sectors
this
shift
occurs
on
a
decarceration
model
in
part
in
the
interests
of
a
larger
concern
for
justice
for
maintaining
the
legitimacy
of
a
legal
order
that
is
deeply
compromised
by
overcriminalization
and
overincarceration
even
on
a
kantian
retributive
theory
it
may
be
that
some
measure
of
lenience
is
warranted
to
preserve
the
legal
order
on
which
justice
depends
n
though
much
more
could
surely
be
said
for
now
that
concludes
the
retributive
defense
of
a
decarceration
model
from
the
perspective
of
deterrence
a
decarceration
approach
dissuades
for
the
same
reasons
that
it
may
be
experienced
as
punishment
from
a
retributive
standpoint
diversionary
sentences
still
substantially
constrain
defendants
liberty
a
potential
offender
aware
that
apprehension
may
lead
to
a
court
ordered
diversion
program
will
be
inclined
to
desist
from
being
apprehended
for
conduct
that
will
lead
to
a
diversionary
sentence
something
that
individual
would
prefer
to
avoid
critically
on
a
decarceration
model
referral
services
are
open
to
all
comers
not
just
those
referred
through
diversionary
courts
so
there
is
no
incentive
to
offend
in
order
to
obtain
services
should
those
services
be
desired
further
for
most
eligible
defendants
mentally
ill
persons
drug
addicts
veterans
suffering
severe
post
traumatic
stress
their
socially
disruptive
conduct
is
unlikely
to
be
carried
out
following
reflective
cost
benefit
analysis
so
the
deterrent
potential
of
any
criminal
law
administrative
arrangement
is
questionable
n
it
must
of
course
be
acknowledged
that
a
diversionary
sentence
will
not
deter
those
individuals
who
wish
both
to
commit
an
offense
subject
to
the
jurisdiction
of
a
specialized
criminal
court
and
who
wish
to
enter
diversionary
programming
but
as
noted
above
in
reference
to
retributive
concerns
this
same
problem
arises
with
respect
to
conventional
jail
prison
and
probationary
sentencing
for
many
criminal
defendants
criminal
law
involvement
has
become
an
anticipated
part
of
the
life
course
a
life
stage
through
which
certain
demographics
of
defendants
expect
to
pass
and
in
this
regard
a
diversionary
approach
may
not
be
appreciably
less
stigmatizing
and
less
deterrent
than
conventional
sentencing
one
reason
a
decarceration
model
is
preferable
to
a
more
jurisprudentially
specified
model
of
specialized
criminal
law
administration
such
as
therapeutic
jurisprudence
is
because
this
jurisprudentially
underspecified
form
permits
the
courts
to
engage
multiple
complex
meaning
imparting
functions
involved
in
criminal
law
administration
in
certain
criminal
cases
the
ideal
role
of
the
court
may
be
simultaneously
to
condemn
a
given
offense
and
the
possibly
reprehensible
motivations
behind
it
to
reaffirm
the
worth
of
the
victim
to
aim
to
craft
a
sanction
that
will
deter
the
offender
and
others
from
such
conduct
in
the
future
but
also
to
act
mercifully
this
is
a
complex
undertaking
to
be
sure
and
one
that
cannot
be
easily
captured
under
a
single
criminal
law
jurisprudential
theory
whether
a
therapeutic
jurisprudential
approach
or
an
instrumentally
deterrent
model
as
dan
m
kahan
and
martha
c
nussbaum
have
proposed
a
disposition
that
purports
to
answer
only
a
single
abstract
question
did
the
defendant
s
background
cause
his
crime
or
even
does
the
defendant
deserve
to
be
punished
will
never
be
rich
enough
to
convey
all
of
these
meanings
n
in
this
respect
courts
adopting
a
decarceration
approach
have
overdetermined
meanings
rendering
them
potentially
consistent
with
a
range
of
differing
ideological
and
legal
precommitments
retributivists
may
favor
diversionary
courts
because
they
enable
a
tough
and
intrusive
form
of
criminal
law
administration
that
is
proportional
to
wrongdoing
and
lenient
where
in
the
interests
of
justice
having
the
potential
to
both
deter
and
prevent
future
offending
and
others
may
be
drawn
to
diversionary
courts
for
their
rehabilitative
and
humanitarian
potential
regardless
of
one
s
criminal
law
theoretical
commitments
a
decarceration
model
promises
to
reduce
criminal
law
administrative
costs
increase
efficacy
and
reduce
reliance
on
incarceration
for
the
time
being
a
decarceration
approach
is
best
suited
to
misconduct
for
which
there
is
some
considerable
collective
interest
among
legal
actors
and
the
public
in
experimental
alternative
social
response
but
perhaps
over
time
a
growing
class
of
offenses
and
offenders
will
come
to
seem
suitable
candidates
for
decarceration
there
are
surely
some
crimes
of
violence
that
will
not
be
amenable
to
decarceration
processing
at
all
though
it
is
not
entirely
clear
what
those
offenses
are
in
the
abstract
the
conduct
of
the
person
who
murders
who
rapes
who
robs
by
violent
means
may
not
be
subject
to
redirection
through
court
or
other
intervention
and
the
only
politically
and
socially
viable
response
may
be
moral
condemnation
and
incapacitation
as
sociologist
jack
katz
explains
in
his
studies
in
seductions
of
crime
certain
violent
acts
may
emerge
from
a
dizziness
in
which
conformity
is
the
greatest
spiritual
challenge
and
deviance
promises
the
peace
of
transcendent
significance
n
but
for
others
who
have
killed
their
deviant
conduct
may
never
again
be
repeated
it
may
have
occurred
in
a
drug
induced
haze
that
following
recovery
would
no
longer
threaten
others
and
for
which
moral
culpability
is
lacking
the
experimental
unfinished
character
of
a
decarceration
model
allows
this
question
be
resolved
incrementally
over
time
n
c
reduced
procedural
protections
specialized
criminal
courts
frequently
adopt
a
collaborative
approach
that
entails
at
certain
stages
reduced
adversarialism
and
reduced
procedural
protections
an
approach
that
critics
charge
raises
numerous
due
process
concerns
n
criminal
defense
attorneys
object
to
these
relaxed
procedures
on
the
grounds
that
reduced
procedural
protections
lead
to
outcomes
that
are
bad
for
their
clients
and
that
more
generally
are
corrosive
of
the
legitimacy
and
integrity
of
criminal
law
n
this
line
of
objection
continues
that
when
defense
counsel
works
as
part
of
a
diversionary
sentencing
team
they
may
be
less
than
vigilant
in
seeking
to
have
illegally
obtained
evidence
excluded
and
less
willing
to
challenge
the
legal
or
factual
bases
of
the
government
s
charges
n
defendants
interactions
with
social
service
providers
outside
the
presence
of
counsel
also
may
entail
due
process
violations
as
any
incriminating
statements
may
affect
the
defendant
s
revocation
sentence
n
in
certain
drug
courts
for
instance
judges
may
rely
on
progress
reports
from
substance
abuse
programmers
in
determining
whether
to
apply
sanctions
to
court
participants
domestic
violence
courts
similarly
rely
on
reports
from
anger
management
programs
to
assess
compliance
n
this
information
is
obtained
in
a
treatment
context
and
is
not
subject
to
any
measures
that
would
ensure
procedural
fairness
or
regularity
n
unlike
on
a
therapeutic
jurisprudence
judicial
monitoring
or
order
maintenance
model
on
a
decarceration
approach
there
is
considerable
room
to
incorporate
robust
procedural
protections
thereby
responding
to
most
procedural
objections
leveled
generally
against
specialized
criminal
courts
even
if
there
remain
inevitably
some
procedural
rights
trade
offs
because
the
legal
process
itself
is
not
understood
to
have
a
therapeutic
or
other
nonconventional
orientation

decarceration
model
full
due
process
protections
should
and
have
been
applied
at
the
stage
of
revocation
n
to
accommodate
concerns
regarding
judicial
neutrality
courts
adopting
a
decarceration
model
could
readily
assign
two
separate
judges
one
to
handle
supervision
and
a
separate
judge
to
handle
revocation
n
the
due
process
problems
posed
by
labeling
defendants
in
judicial
monitoring
courts
sex
offenders
prior
to
adjudication
are
so
obvious
as
to
require
little
explanation
on
a
decarceration
model
preadjudication
judicial
monitoring
need
not
occur
an
additional
substantial
ground
for
procedural
objections
is
the
often
substantial
disparity
in
specialized
criminal
courts
between
the
relatively
light
sentence
a
defendant
would
have
received
in
the
conventional
court
and
the
disproportionately
harsh
jail
or
prison
sentence
a
defendant
will
receive
if
he
or
she
fails
in
the
diversionary
program
because
a
decarceration
model
s
primary
aim
is
to
reduce
reliance
on
incarceration
consistent
with
maintaining
public
safety
such
courts
do
not
seek
to
obtain
leverage
by
imposing
disproportionately
harsh
revocation
sentences
in
fact
empirical
analyses
suggest
that
the
severity
of
sanctions
in
drug
courts
does
not
appear
to
reduce
the
subsequent
number
of
crimes
committed
or
days
of
drug
use
n
beyond
these
more
obvious
modifications
on
a
decarceration
model
to
account
for
procedural
justice
concerns
diversionary
courts
may
operate
in
accord
with
any
of
several
different
procedural
configurations
courts
may
be
pretrial
pre
plea
post
plea
presentencing
or
post
conviction
sentencing
alternatives
for
example
some
drug
court

court

if
the
terms
of
the
program
are
violated
probation
is
revoked
and
the
court
will
sentence
the
defendant
anew
or
based
on
a
predetermined
revocation
sentence
n
in
contrast
in
other
specialized
criminal
courts
failure
to
comply
merely
leads
to
the
reinstatement
of
criminal
proceedings
not
to
a
previously
bargained
conviction
or
sentence
n
the
decision
to
take
a
plea
is
a
serious
one
and
making
an
informed
and
rational
choice
about
pleading
guilty
is
particularly
difficult
when
the
alternative
is
a
possibly
much
lengthier
prison
sentence
and
when
the
defendant
is
drug
addicted
or
suffering
from
mental
illness
n
one
way
to
attempt
to
circumvent
the
procedural
concerns
that
arise
under
such
circumstances
is
to
have
the
diversionary
alternative
process
occur
prior
to
a
plea
being
entered
on
this
approach
a
defendant
would
elect
whether
to
opt
in
to
the
specialized
criminal
court
and
upon
successful
completion
of
the
diversionary
program
any
charges
would
be
dropped
egregious
misconduct
while
in
the
program
would
result
in
referral
to
the
conventional
criminal
process
for
the
prior
criminal
conduct
but
evidence
from
the
diversionary
period
obtained
through
treatment
or
other
social
service
intervention
could
be
excluded
the
defendant
would
then
choose
whether
to
plead
guilty
at
the
outset
pursue
any
motions
practice
or
proceed
to
trial
the
due
process
concerns
on
this
approach
relate
principally
to
the
fact
that
the
diversionary
alternative
to
the
extent
it
is
intrusive
and
limiting
of
the
defendant
s
liberty
is
mandated
prior
to
a
finding
of
guilt
but
the
defendant
s
participation
is
optional
no
more
constrained
than
any
choice
made
in
light
of
the
background
criminal
law
regime
and
the
specialized
court
participant
may
at
any
point
opt
out
and
return
to
the
conventional
process
n
still
the
choice
of
the
participant
does
not
eliminate
concerns
about
coercion
because
any
choice
takes
place
against
the
coercive
pressures
of
the
criminal
law
regime
and
the
broader
social
and
political
setting
in
which
the
defendant
finds
himself
or
herself
and
if
specialized
criminal
courts
increase
pressures
to
arrest
or
for
arrestees
to
enter
diversion
programs
they
will
have
constrained
individuals
options
in
a
significant
sense
rather
than
having
expanded
them
but
the
coercion
at
work
in
determining
whether
to
enter
the
specialized
criminal
court
is
no
more
than
the
coercion
in
play
at
any
other
critical
phase
of
proceedings
in
which
a
defendant
decides
to
plead
guilty
or
go
to
trial
and
the
potential
benefits
to
the
participant
are
considerable
the
other
available
approach
is
to
employ
the
diversionary
court
as
a
post
conviction
sentencing
alternative
with
egregious
offending
while
in
the
program
punished
by
an
alternative
pre
agreed
upon
sentence
this
avoids
the
due
process
problems
associated
with
court
mandates
prior
to
a
finding
of
guilt
but
increases
the
risk
of
coercive
less
than
voluntary
pleas
as
far
as
the
post
conviction
configuration
is
concerned
due
process
and
coercion
concerns
may
be
mitigated
if
there
is
not
too
harsh
a
pre
agreed
upon
or
subsequently
determined
revocation
sentence
that
is
if
the
revocation
sentence
is
standardized
to
what
the
defendant
would
have
received
had
he
or
she
not
opted
into
the
specialized
court
the
procedural
concerns
could
be
further
mitigated
on
a
post
conviction
model
if
both
those
convicted
following
trial
and
those
who
pled
guilty
were
eligible
for
alternative
sentencing
this
latter
post
conviction
approach
would
attend
to
the
procedural
rights
of
defendants
and
would
likely
reduce
incarceration
and
associated
costs
expanding
the
ability
of
defendants
to
remain
out
of
prison
protects
their
interests
in
avoiding
carceral
sentencing
and
their
due
process
rights
so
long
as
defendants
are
still
able
to
challenge
any
illegally
obtained
evidence
at
the
outset
of
the
case
elect
to
go
to
trial
and
not
be
subject
to
a
disproportionately
harsh
sentence
upon
revocation
n
in
sum
the
trade
off
is
between
a
pretrial
pre
plea
model
that
potentially
avoids
criminal
proceedings
altogether
and
more
closely
renders
participation
a
choice
and
a
post
conviction
model
that
avoids
certain
due
process
problems
by
making
the
specialized
criminal
court
program
effectively
a
part
of
the
defendant
s
sentence
but
unless
the
post
conviction
approach
allows
defendants
to
enter
following
trial
it
applies
substantial
pressure
to
plead
guilty
to
retain
the
option
to
avoid
jail
or
prison
even
under
circumstances
where
the
defendant
may
contest
guilt
the
advantage
of
the
experimental
quality
of
a
decarceration
model
is
that
jurisdictions
may
test
the
various
procedural
configurations
and
determine
which
best
serves
the
range
of
interests
at
stake
and
raises
fewer
due
process
and
other
problems
not
merely
in
theory
but
in
terms
of
participants
experiences
on
the
ground
n
finally
it
is
also
critical
to
consider
whether
procedural
protections
are
the
panacea
their
proponents
assume
for
fairness
in
conventional
criminal
law
administration
n
because
there
is
such
great
pressure
on
the
conventional
courts
due
to
high
case
volumes
the
vast
majority
of
cases
are
handled
through
guilty
pleas
often
public
defenders
have
little
time
to
investigate
a
case
before
a
client
is
advised
to
plead
guilty
but
if
greater
numbers
of
cases
were
removed
from
the
conventional
criminal
courts
to
specialized
criminal
courts
and
other
sectors
fewer
cases
would
remain
in
conventional
courts
provided
that
specialized
courts
manage
to
avoid
a
net
widening
enforcement
effect
this
would
permit
more
robust
procedural
protections
and
investigations
in
the
conventional
criminal
courts
oddly
then
it
is
plausible
that
the
removal
of
cases
to
a
less
adversarial
specialized
criminal
context
may
enhance
procedural
justice
overall
improving
procedural
safeguards
in
conventional
courts
rather
than
the
outcome
feared
by
proceduralists
d
specialization
for
good
or
for
ill
a
further
peril
of
a
specialized
criminal
courts
law
reform
strategy
is
that
it
may
require
a
profusion
of
specialized
courts
to
address
the
myriad
problems
requiring
reform
convening
a
separate
court
for
each
separate
area
in
which
substantive
criminal
law
reform
is
desired
would
be
enormously
costly
n
additionally
reliance
on
criminal
court
specialization
might
well
threaten
to
undermine
rule
of
law
values
centered
on
a
model
of
judges
as
neutral
generalists
n
although
these
are
legitimate
objections
to
certain
forms
of
criminal
court
specialization
a
decarceration
model
is
less
likely
to
entail
these
troubling
features
of
specialization
for
two
primary
reasons
first
a
decarceration
model
is
an
interim
strategy
for
criminal
law
reform
focused
specifically
on
reducing
reliance
on
incarceration
by
setting
in
motion
broader
reform
processes
as
discussed
previously
in
section
ii
d
and
part
iii
diversionary
courts
need
not
aspire
to
become
a
permanent
criminal
law
administrative
fixture
thus
a
diversionary
decarceration
model
poses
a
less
significant
threat
of
proliferating
courts
endlessly
in
response
to
every
criminal
law
problem
requiring
reform
as
a
consequence
this
approach
stands
to
intrude
less
upon
the
predominant
norm
of
generalist
adjudication
second
courts
adopting
a
decarceration
approach
need
not
be
particularly
substantively
specialized
a
decarceration
model
could
incorporate
within
one
court
jurisdiction
over
a
range
of
different
matters
for
which
non
carceral
sentencing
is
preferred
this
too
stands
to
reduce
the
risk
of
endlessly
proliferating
specialized
criminal
courts
and
positions
specialized
criminal
court
judges
in
a
role
more
akin
to
the
prototypical
generalist
judge
n
e
legitimation
costs
finally
specialized
criminal
courts
threaten
to
impose
significant
legitimation
costs
first
specialized
criminal
courts
may
legitimate
increased
harshness
in
conventional
criminal
courts
once
more
sympathetic
criminal
defendants
have
been
removed
with
the
removal
of
presumably
more
vulnerable
or
less
blameworthy
individuals
from
conventional
criminal
courts
and
prisons
one
might
well
envision
an
increase
in
punitive
attitudes
toward
those
remaining
this
is
so
even
though
it
may
be
profoundly
unfair
to
allow
some
criminal
law
breakers
access
to
specialized
criminal
courts
because
we
perceive
them
to
be
more
worthy
of
our
understanding
when
others
are
really
no
more
blameworthy
n
a
related
risk
is
that
in
removing
more
purportedly
sympathetic
defendants
from
conventional
criminal
courts
racial
and
class
disproportion
will
increase
with
more
defendants
of
color
and
materially
poor
defendants
remaining
in
the
conventional
courts
n
indeed
that
is
precisely
what
occurred
under
deinstitutionalization
in
the
s
when
the
racialization
of
mental
hospitals
increased
n
and
preliminary
results
from
mental
health
courts
suggest
this
trend
is
a
problem
in
that
context
too
as
a
study
of
case
processing
in
seven
mental
health
courts
found
overrepresentation
at
the
point
of
referral
of
older
individuals
white
persons
and
women
as
compared
to
their
proportion
in
the
criminal
justice
system
generally
n
though
empirical
monitoring
enables
identification
of
the
point
at
which
racial
disparities
emerge
identification
of
the
locus
of
the
problem
does
not
by
any
stretch
guarantee
its
elimination
the
convergence
of
interest
between
wealthier
white
defendants
with
mental
health
or
addiction
problems
and
similarly
addicted
or
mentally
ill
poorer
defendants
of
color
an
interest
convergence
that
likely
contributed
in
large
measure
to
the
emergence
and
widespread
popularity
of
specialized
criminal
courts
will
be
able
to
sustain
a
legitimate
alternative
sentencing
regime
only
if
all
defendants
irrespective
of
socioeconomic
status
or
race
have
equal
access
to
favorable
diversionary
sentences
n
separately
there
is
the
problem
of
potentially
legitimating
the
management
of
particular
social
challenges
through
criminal
law
by
vesting
more
authority
in
specialized
criminal
courts
to
address
social
problems
n
these
are
all
genuine
and
profoundly
concerning
problems
associated
with
a
specialized
criminal
courts
law
reform
strategy
there
are
several
ways
in
which
a
decarceration
model
may
attempt
to
address
these
issues
at
the
outset
awareness
of
and
careful
attention
to
the
associated
risks
may
help
to
minimize
their
occurrence
and
impact
in
the
event
the
problems
identified
come
to
pass
for
example
ongoing
empirical
monitoring
may
track
any
racial
or
class
disproportion
as
it
arises
and
direct
attention
to
the
areas
where
the
problem
is
greatest
so
that
it
might
be
addressed
explicitly
focusing
institutional
actors
on
confronting
racial
disparities
in
referral
termination
or
wherever
else
they
are
occurring
ultimately
many
of
the
pathologies
in
u
s
criminal
law
administration
have
to
do
with
race
and
with
racialization
of
the
category
of
the
criminal
defendant
or
incarcerated
person
so
meaningful
criminal
law
reform
will
almost
certainly
require
grappling
intensively
with
the
racial
dimensions
of
criminal
law
enforcement
n
insofar
as
a
decarceration
model
seeks
to
unwind
harsh
punishment
and
incarceration
generally
this
approach
may
serve
more
broadly
to
call
into
question
exceedingly
punitive
criminal
law
frameworks
both
for
those
defendants
in
specialized
courts
and
those
in
conventional
courts
movement
of
judges
between
conventional
and
specialized
criminal
courts
may
also
serve
to
limit
stratification
of
the
two
systems
n
admittedly
however
these
cautionary
efforts
may
prove
inadequate
even
so
in
taking
stock
of
these
legitimation
costs
as
well
as
the
other
problems
considered
in
this
part
it
is
crucial
to
compare
the
problems
presented
on
a
decarceration
model
with
a
the
limits
of
the
other
competing
reformist
models
of
specialized
criminal
law
administration
considered
earlier
in
this
article
and
then
to
compare
each
of
these
to
b
the
status
quo
in
conventional
criminal
case
processing
in
the
united
states
that
is
the
limits
of
a
decarceration
model
or
other
specialized
criminal
law
reformist
model
should
be
considered
as
compared
not
just
to
the
objector
s
preferred
utopian
alternative
but
relative
to
the
status
quo
in
u
s
criminal
law
administration
n
procedural
protections
may
be
found
wanting
on
a
decarceration
model
but
are
these
protections
more
meaningfully
enforced
in
the
standard
criminal
courts
where
well
over
ninety
percent
of
criminal
cases
end
in
a
plea
following
proceedings
the
character
of
which
malcolm
feeley
powerfully
captured
in
his
book
the
process
is
the
punishment
n
is
the
liberty
infringing
character
of
surveillance
on
a
decarceration
model
more
onerous
than
in
prisons
and
jails
where
many
more
specialized
court
participants
might
well
be
were
the
courts
to
be
disbanded
retributivists
must
consider
too
the
relative
achievement
of
retributive
goals
in
the
specialized
criminal
court
setting
as
compared
to
the
standard
criminal
process
which
feeley
described
decades
ago
as
follows
and
which
remains
in
these
respects
unimproved
t
rials
are
rare
events
and
even
protracted
plea
bargaining
is
an
exception
jammed
every
morning
with
a
new
mass
of
arrestees
t
hese
courts
are
chaotic
and
confusing
officials
communicate
in
a
verbal
short
hand
wholly
unintelligible
to
the
accused
and
accuser
alike
and
they
seem
to
make
arbitrary
decisions
sending
one
person
to
jail
and
freeing
the
next
but
for
the
most
part
they
are
lenient
they
sentence
few
people
to
jail
and
impose
few
large
fines
judges
bored
by
their
jobs
become
callous
toward
defendants
who
are
so
different
from
themselves
prosecutors
dulled
by
their
repetitive
work
appear
to
be
vindictive
defense
attorneys
depressed
by
feelings
that
their
efforts
are
not
appreciated
can
easily
begin
to
treat
their
clients
carelessly
n
and
this
picture
is
not
unique
to
the
second
half
of
the
twentieth
century
when
feeley
wrote
his
study
of
the
new

earlier

a
similar
set
of
ills
which
persist
after
what

now
approaching
a
century
of
efforts
to
improve

criminal

administration
the
bad
physical
surroundings
the
confusion
the
want
of
decorum
the
undignified
offhand
disposition
of
cases
at
high
speed
the
frequent
suggestion
of
something
working
behind
the
scenes
create
in
the
minds
of
observers
a
general
suspicion
of
the
whole
process
of
law
enforcement
n
more
recently
in
his
study
of
the
chicago
criminal
courts
investigative
journalist
steve
bogira
sounded
strikingly
similar
notes
every
day
chicago
police
wagons
swing
onto
the
grounds
of
the
cook
county
criminal
courthouse
and
deposit
their
cargo
at

prisoners
being
unloaded

here

the
usual
reasons
they
tried
to
buy
heroin
from
an
undercover
cop

pocketed
a
fifth
of

at
a
grocery
and
failed
to
outrun
the

the

staff

reflexively
not
reflectively

workers
have
no
time
to
give
much
thought
to
any
but
the
most
extraordinary
case
or
to
examine
what
they
are
doing
j
ustice
miscarries
every
day
by
doing
precisely
what
we
ask
it
to
n
the
bottom
line
is
that
the
status
quo
to
which
a
decarceration
model
should
be
compared
absent
a
viable
alternative
reform
proposal
is
a
status
quo
that
is
deeply
inadequate
whether
one
is
concerned
about
procedural
justice
liberty
racial
disproportionality
or
retributive
punishment
because
these
challenges
are
not
unique
to
specialized
criminal
courts
but
rather
reflect
problems
associated
with
conventional
criminal
law
administration
it
is
no
answer
to
simply
jettison
specialized
criminal
courts
and
revert
to
conventional
criminal
law
frameworks

given
the
myriad
perils
associated
with
the
competing
models

the
question
invariably
comes
to

the
potential

of
a

model
worth
the
risks
identified
in

criminal
courts
in
the
preceding
pages
this

s
short
answer
is
yes
yes
that
is
if
the
courts
are
able
to
employ
the
three
strategies
elaborated
here
and
in
which
some
specialized
criminal

are
actively
engaged

social
understandings
of

punishment

its
alternatives

reshaping

agencies

change

wide
range
of
social
concerns
to
other
sectors
better
equipped
to
address
the
problems
at
hand
conclusion
in
this
moment
of
increased
openness
to
thoroughgoing
criminal
law
reform
after
decades
of
escalating
criminal
sentences
thousands
of
specialized
criminal
courts
have
emerged
across
the
country
and
around
the
globe
these
courts
have
become
the
location
of
a
contest
between
competing
criminal
law
models
certain
models
at
work
in
specialized
criminal
courts
are
configured
in
such
a
way
that
threatens
to
produce
a
series
of
unintended
and
undesirable
consequences
increased
and
unnecessary
criminal
supervision
diminished
procedural
safeguards
and
potentially
even
increased
incarceration
but
a
less
predominant
criminal
law
reformist
model
a
decarceration
model
may
provide
a
way
of
developing
different
approaches
to
certain
of
the
social
problems
currently
managed
through
criminal
law
the
greatest
promise
of
a
decarceration
model
if
it
succeeds
at
engendering
a
certain
degree
of
cognitive
reframing
institutional
reinvention
and
systemic
change
is
to
remove
particular
categories
of
offenses
and
offenders
from
conventional
criminal
courts
to
be
addressed
both
more
effectively
and

primary
candidates
for
such
removal
through
existing
specialized

courts
include
drug
offenders
mentally
ill
persons
and
individuals
suffering
the
post
traumatic
stress
of

removal
of
these
matters
to
other
sectors
would
reduce
volume
pressures
on
conventional
criminal
courts
so
that
they
might
more
meaningfully
and
fairly
address
the
relatively
few
cases
of
serious
violent
and
property
crime
for
which
alternative
processes
seem
inappropriate
or
would
be
exceedingly
unpopular
these
more
serious
criminal
matters
may
not
be
handled
best
in
the
standard
criminal
process
either
but
we
have
yet
to
identify
a
better
approach
in
due
course
if
specialized
criminal
courts
set
in
motion
some
measure
of
systemic
change
in
criminal
law
administration
they
may
both
focus
and
improve
responses
in
cases
of
serious
crime
and
simultaneously
improve
community
economic
development
accessible
public
health
services
employment
and
more
generally
human
well
being
it
is
also
possible
that
specialized
criminal

will
achieve
none
of
these
things
that
their
perils
rather
than
their
possibilities
will
be
their
legacy
but
given
the
grave
inadequacies
and
injustices
of
the
status

in

even

reported
account
of

drug

are
particularly
egregious
and

the
question
the

remains
that
is
whether
a
court
configured
on
a
non

anti
formalist
psychotherapeutic
model
with
largely
unconstrained
judicial
discretion
poses
the
inherent
risk
of
the
sorts
of
outcomes
attributed
to
the
glynn
county
georgia
drug
court
this
article
does
not
purport
to
identify
any
definite
outcomes
that
will
necessarily
follow
from
courts
adopting
a
therapeutic
jurisprudence
model
but
rather
aims
to
develop
a
critical
theoretical
framework
within
which
to
think
about
the

sociologist
robert

criminologist
john

found
that
the
majority
of
men
we
interviewed
desisted
from
crime
largely
because
they
were
able
to
capitalize
on
key
structural
and
situational
circumstances
they
often
selected
these
structural
and
situational
circumstances
for
example
they
decided
to
get
married
get
that
job
hang
out
with
those
friends
but
those
institutions
and
relations
in
turn
influenced
the
men
as
well
men
who
desisted
from
crime
were
embedded
in
structured
routines

bonded
to
others

were
virtually

very

it
is

now
in
the
years

come
it
will
be

even
more
differently

the
trajectory
of
change
is
likely
to
remain

did

they

to

citizen
call
was
not
subject

agency
direction
or

the
main
organizational
requirement
was
to
arrive
do
something
and

as
quickly
as
possible

and
percent
of
their
time
in
unstructured
random
patrolling
reactive
investigations
when
required
were
taken
over
by
detectives
who
in
theory
investigated
all
reported
crimes
but
in
practice
closed
most
cases
as
unsolvable
cases
that
were

police
leaders
rarely

at
all
unless
a
particularly
gruesome
crime
received
substantial
publicity
by
the
three
rs
were
changing
into
what
i
describe
in
this
essay
as
the
triple
t
of
targeting
testing
and
tracking
while
the
standard
model
is
far
from
gone
its
resources
are
increasingly
guided
by
statistical
evidence
in
the
emerging
triple
t
strategy
both
patrol
and
detective
managers
had
moved
toward
far
greater
proactive
management
of
police
resources
although
these
changes
are
far
more
evident
in
some
police
agencies
than
in
others
anglo
celtic
policing
is
increasingly
targeting
scarce
resources

the
best
test
of
evidence
based
policing
is
whether
it
has
improved
public
safety
and
police
legitimacy
there
is
certainly
a
correlation
over
time
between
the
rise
of
evidence
and
a
decline
in
serious
crime
in
both
the
united
states
and
the
united
kingdom
proof
that
serious
crime
dropped
because
of
evidence
based
policing
however
is
more
elusive
there
is
some
micro
level
analysis
of
the
new
york
city
crime
drop
that
offers
a
greater
basis
for
causal
inference
than
national
trends
zimring
but
it
is
impossible
to
rule
out
other
plausible
causes
that
also
match
the
timing
of
the
crime
drop
there
is
also
a
danger
that
a
sharper
focus
on
crime
can
undermine
police
legitimacy
especially
since
proactive
policing
is
structurally
less
legitimate
than
reactive
policing
with
a
personal
victim
s
endorsement
reiss
p
yet
there
is
no
evidence
that
the
rise
of
evidence
in
policing
has
caused
reductions
in
police
legitimacy
indeed
more
data
about
legitimacy
have
been
incorporated
into
police
management
as
part
of
evidence
based
tracking
than
ever
before
overall
the
vast
scale
of
the
rise
of
evidence
in
policing
leaves
it
without
a
fair
comparison
group
just
as
it
does
in
medicine
sagan
leaving
causation
unknowable
still
the
macro
trends
in
reduced
mortality
suggest
that
we
should
celebrate
the
rise
of
evidence
in
both
medicine
and
policing
the
changes
from
to
raise
the
further
question
of
what
anglo
celtic
policing
will
look
like
by
the
answers
cannot
be
predicted
just
by
extrapolating
the
trends
of
four
decades
or
even
ideally
by
a
causal
model
for
prediction
silver
but
by
explaining
why
policing
changed
as
it
did
from
to
a
forecast
using
the
same
causal
model
can
identify
a
range
of
possible
scenarios
for
policing
in
chief
among
these
will
be
the
possible
global
influence
of
the
creation
of
the
first
professional
body
ever
charged
by
a
national
government
with
recommending
police
practices
on
the
basis
of
continuous
review
of
new
research
evidence
on
what
works
the
united

s
college
of

http

this
body
has
tremendous
potential
to
follow
the
pathway
to
innovation
johnson
associates
with
such
major
advances
as
the
printing
press
which
was
inspired
by
the

a
lateral
thinking
style
of
adaptation
of
an
idea
used
in
one
setting
such
as

medicine
to
another
such
as
evidence
based
policing
the
rise
of
evidence
the
causal
model
this
essay
suggests
for
these
changes
is
a
dynamic
system
that
links
external
demands
on
police
to
cut
crime
cut
costs
or
build
legitimacy
to
research
evidence
on
how
to
meet
those
demands
supported
by
the
increasing
availability
of
innovative
technologies
while
external
factors
drive
the
availability
of
both
research
evidence
and
technology
how
policing
responds
depends
on
a
fourth
factor
the
governmentally
generated
human
capital
of
education
and
police
professionalism
the
role
of
government
policies
is
crucial
in
setting
salaries
and
recruitment
standards
that
shape
the
quality
of
police
skills
and
creativity
in
general
and
of
police
leaders
in
particular
those
human
resources
are
so
influential
that
the
entire
causal
model
can
reasonably
be
said
to
call
for
evidence
based
professionalism
inside
this
abstract
causal
model
are
many
human
beings
struggling
hard
for
change
influential
leaders
of
policing
research
and
efforts
to
combine
the
two
these
include

in
what
these
leaders
generally
shared
with
most
notably
nypd
commissioner
and
us
police
foundation
president
patrick
v
murphy
was
a
loosely
articulated
but
deeply
held
belief
that
greater
use
of
research
could
help
transform
policing
into
a
more
legitimate
and
respected
profession
a
profession
is
widely
defined
as
a
public
interest
occupation
that
restricts
entry
to
those
who
have
mastered
knowledge
and
skills
needed
to
provide
a
particular
set
of
complex
services
in
the
past
century
the
level
of
knowledge
deemed
necessary
for
a
profession
has
become
linked
to
requirements
for
university
based
education
it
is
only
a
century
for
example
since
the
radical
proposal
to
force
doctors
to
attend
university
was
presented
to
the
united
kingdom
s
haldane
commission
sherman
b
similarly
proposals
in
repeated
us
commission
reports
in
the
s
and
s
recommended
that
a
university
degree
be
a
requirement
for
appointment
as
a
police
officer
sherman
and
national
advisory
commission
on
higher
education
for
police
officers
that
idea
remains
controversial
and
widely
unacceptable
on
both
sides
of
the
atlantic
by
conventional
definition
then
policing
has
yet
to
become
a
profession
yet
by
the
same
definition
policing
has
made
great
strides
toward
professionalism
the
past
years
have
seen
a
huge
increase
in
the
educational
levels
of
police
leaders
almost
half
of
english
chief
constables
in
had
been
educated
at
the
cambridge
university
police
executive
program
and
three
decades
of
major
city
chiefs
in
the
united
states
attended
the
nondegree
harvard
police
executive
sessions
the
role
of
universities
in
disseminating
police
research
has
been
a
remarkably
successful
top
down
change
process
rising
levels
of
police
chief
education
have
also
fostered
more
support
for
research
first
led
by
external
scholars
and
now
increasingly
led
by
police
leaders
in
partnership
with
universities
the
production
of
new
research
evidence
has
helped
police
respond
to
external
demands
for
improvement
at
minimum
research
is
perceived
to
be
helpful
with
such
demands
that
is
especially
true
when
there
is
internal
or
external
controversy
about
which
police
methods
are
best
and
whether
new
technologies
are
cost
effective
even
a
radical
change
in
structures
of
police
accountability
can
enhance
the
value
of
police
research
evidence
the
devolution
of
control
over
chief
constables
in
england
and
wales
to
locally
elected
police
and
crime
commissioners
for
example
created
a
potential
for
disputes
between
elected
officials
and
professional
police
leaders
one
possible
solution
is
the
professional
college
of
policing
setting
independent
evidence
based
standards
of
police
practice
whether
this
institution
or
its
cognates
in
other
countries
can
create
a
global
demand
for
more
production
and
use
of
evidence
is
a
crucial
question
for
the
next
decade
targeting
testing
and
tracking
both
the
demand
for
and
uses
of
research
evidence
have
become
clustered
around
three
strategic
principles
police
should
conduct
and
apply
good
research
to
target
scarce
resources
on
predictable
concentrations
of
harm
from
crime
and
disorder
once
police
choose
their
high
priority
targets
they
should
review
or
conduct
tests
of
police
methods
to
help
choose
what
works
best
to
reduce
harm
once
police
agencies
use
research
to
target
their
tested
practices
they
should
generate
and
use
internal
evidence
to
track
the
daily
delivery
and
effects
of
those
practices
including
public
perceptions
of
police
legitimacy
the
growing
adoption
of
those
three
principles
has
given
shape
to
what
is
increasingly
called
evidence
based
policing
ebp
broadly
defined
as
the
use
of
best
research
evidence
on
what
works
as
a
guide
to
police
decisions
sherman
the
ebp
framework
was
meant
to
be
only
a
method
of
making
decisions
rather
than
a
substantive
strategy
for
police
operations
in
the
years
from
to
however
police
have
shaped
their
own
emergent
definition
of
ebp
as
a
substantive
strategy
for
managing
large
police
agencies
on
the
basis
of
these
three
principles
the
rise
of
the
triple
t
strategy
did
not
emerge
from
any
theoretical
plan
to
use
evidence
in
such
a
coherent
strategy
the
clustering
of
evidence
around
three
key
strategic
tasks
was
driven
as
much
by
innovative
police
leadership
as
by
police
scholarship
its
success
resulted
from
the
surprisingly
rational
convergence
of
police
reform
with
a
flood
of
new
research
in
criminology
this
essay
has
four
sections
section
i
discusses
the
key
social
trends
institutions
and
people
who
helped
shape
research
aiming
to
improve
policing
the
triple
t
strategy
emerged
from
the
users
of
that
evidence
section
ii
offers
major
examples
of
how
much
the
evidence
has
grown
since
and
how
widely
police
have
applied
that
knowledge
these
examples
address
all
three
triple
t
principles
including
instances
in
which
evidence
and
practice
have
sharply
diverged
they
are
selected
to
highlight
the
wide
range
of
what
has
already
been
accomplished
even
as
so
much
still
remains
to
be
done
section
iii
analyzes
conceptual
issues
and
confusion
that
hold
back
progress
in
targeting
testing
and
tracking
the
issues
are
arguably
little
different
from
those
arising
in
the
development
of
evidence
based
practices
in
professional
baseball
election
campaigns
or
marketing
they
reflect
the
current
struggle
between
system
i
and
system
ii
thinking
kahneman
in
a
wide
range
of
endeavors
all
of
which
face
the
same
challenge
policing
faces
to
get
much
better
at
what
they
do
in
the
next
decade
in
the
conclusion
i
suggest
things
institutions
can
do
to
institutionalize
research
evidence
in
ways
that
foster
more
fairness
and
effectiveness
in
democratic
policing
these
are
the
most
important
points
i
make
in
this
essay
the
evidence
base
for
police
decisions
has
grown
enormously
since
use
of
that
evidence
lags
behind
the
knowledge
but
use
has
also
grown
most
police
practices
despite
their
enormous
cost
are
still
untested
targeting
and
testing
require
highly
reliable
measures
of
crime
and
harm
crime
rates
and
counts
are
by
themselves
misleading
a
crime
harm
index
offers
far
better
evidence
to
guide
police
decisions
police
in
used
evidence
on
targeting
much
more
widely
than
evidence
from
testing
research
on
tracking
police
outputs
remains
largely
descriptive
and
incomplete
with
great
room
for
using
new
technologies
to
improve
the
quality
of
evidence
more
use
of
evidence
can
increase
police
legitimacy
both
internal
and
external
the
state
boards
of
police
officer
standards
and
training
in
the
united
states
and
the
college
of
policing
in
the
united
kingdom
will
be
key
institutions
in
making
policing
more
effective
along
with
the
practitioner
led
society
for
evidence
based
policing
i
the
rise
of
evidence
for
police
decision
making
the
rise
of
evidence
in
policing
is
mostly
an
anglo
american
story
with
events
on
each
side
of
the
atlantic
influencing
the
other
both
sides
began
with
parallel
social
trends
in
the
s
that
challenged
police
legitimacy
both
the
united
kingdom
and
the
united
states
faced
rising
crime
rates
and
increasing
racial
tensions
authoritative
commissions
in
both
set
out
ambitious
agendas
for
upgrading
the
police
as
one
think
tank
put
it
saunders
both
saw
policing
become
a
matter
of
national
politics
in
unprecedented
ways
the
different
responses
of
police
in
each
country
helped
build
a
special
intellectual
relationship
that
was
conceptually
far
deeper
than
the
military
collaboration
of
world
war
ii
one
continuing
theme
on
both
sides
of
the
atlantic
has
been
that
they
do
policing
better
on
the
other
side
a
setting
the
stage
by
the
early
s
anglo
american
policing
faced
a
kind
of
christmas
tree
of
ideas
for
police
reform
each
idea
an
ornament
unconnected
to
the
others
one
idea
was
that
police
needed
more
research
including
experiments
and
demonstration
projects
with
criminologists
and
other
social
scientists
becoming
part
of
the
police
agency
workforce
focusing
on
crime
prevention
president
s
commission
pp
there
was
no
consensus
about
the
questions
research
should
answer
there
was
no
particular
vision
of
a
new
policing
strategy
to
which
research
could
contribute
yet
belief
in
innovation
and
evaluation
as
a
strategy
in
itself
became
a
major
force
in
police
reform
reiss
that
belief
led
to
public
and
charitable
investments
in
new
institutions
for
police
research
the
growing
role
of
the
british
home
office
in
police
research
helped
inspire
the
creation
of
a
similar
function
in
the
us
department
of
justice
yet
neither
government
agency
s
efforts
had
much
impact
until
after
the
ford
foundation
in
funded
the
police
foundation
in
washington
to
foster
innovation
and
improvement
in
american
policing
the
bold
experiments
the
foundation
conducted
led
government
funders
to
test
policing
more
deeply
in
less
than
a
decade
the
police
foundation
s
and
government
supported
research
discredited
the
intellectual
basis
for
the
three
rs
strategy
of
random
patrol
rapid
response
and
reactive
investigations
what
replaced
that
strategy
was
not
a
coherent
new
theory
only
in
retrospect
can
we
use
the
triple
t
framework
of
targeting
testing
and
tracking
to
make
sense
of
what
emerged
the
multicentered
work
of
examining
current
practices
designing
innovations
and
evaluating
new
programs
produced
something
that
scholars
now
call
emergence
the
confluence
of
properties
arising
from
a
combination
of
elements
not
found
in
any
one
of
the
elements
johnson
the
essential
new
property
is
the
capacity
to
lead
police
organizations
with
dynamic
evidence
rather
than
static
doctrine
this
property
arose
initially
from
the
destruction
of
the
prevailing
three
rs
model
that
in
turn
opened
the
door
to
considering
the
implications
of
basic
research
provided
by
an
earlier
generation
of
thinkers
the
most
important
basic
research
had
documented
the
existence
of
police
discretion
to
choose
different
strategies
rather
than
being
handcuffed
by
the
three
rs
most
notably
reiss
s
conception
of
police
work
as
divided
between
proactive
and
reactive
discretion
stimulated
much
creative
thinking
at
the
same
time
banton
s
research
in
britain
and
wilson
s
research
in
the
united
states
showed
how
the
discretionary
choices
of
police
organizations
differ
on
the
basis
of
their
political
and
cultural
environments
despite
their
sharing
a
common
legal
system
these
insights
expanded
the
concept
of
police
discretion
from
the
level
of
case
by
case
to
agency
by
agency
decision
making
and
helped
to
set
the
stage
for
the
emergence
of
triple
t
but
that
new
evidence
based
strategy
took
almost
four
decades
to
emerge
from
the
accumulation
of
new
research
evidence
what
happened
was
a
process
of
prosumption
tapscott
and
williams
in
which
the
producers
of
elements
of
the
triple
t
strategy
were
simultaneously
its
consumers
b
testing
the
three
rs
strategy
was
intellectually
discredited
after
three
major
efforts
were
made
to
assess
the
effects
of
key
elements
these
studies
did
not
adequately
support
the
conclusions
attributed
to
them
they
did
not
show
that
random
patrol
had
no
effect
on
crime
that
rapid
police
response
had
no
deterrent
effect
or
that
detectives
made
no
contribution
to
detection
prosecution
and
general
deterrence
of
crime
regardless
of
what
the
research
evidence
really
did
show
those
conclusions
became
widely
accepted
by
police
leaders
and
police
scholars
then
and
now
random
patrol
the
police
foundation
s
kansas
city
preventive
patrol
experiment
kelling
et
al
launched
the
rise
of
evidence
based
policing
the
first
attempt
to
undertake
a
scientifically
controlled
test
of
the
effects
of
patrol
staffing
levels
it
proved
that
bold
experiments
were
possible
in
policing
the
experimental
design
of
withdrawing
patrols
from
five
patrol
beats
and
doubling
it
in
five
others
was
stunning
and
unprecedented
that
the
sky
did
not
fall
made
the
world
safe
for
further
bold
experiments
the
reported
conclusion
that
frequency
of
police
patrols
did
not
affect
crime
opened
many
minds
to
think
more
critically
about
police
strategy
the
experiment
s
leadership
by
a
police
chief
who
was
subsequently
appointed
fbi
director
also
suggested
that
research
even
with
negative
results
could
be
good
for
police
career
advancement
it
is
unfortunate
that
the
kansas
city
experiment
did
not
actually
support
its
conclusion
the
limitations
of
the
experiment
s
research
design
have
been
extensively
reviewed
elsewhere
sherman
b
sherman
and
weisburd
the
main
problem
is
that
the
actual
frequency
of
patrols
was
unmeasured
and
may
well
have
been
identical
in
all
beats
because
of
reactive
responses
to
calls
larson
moreover
there
were
large
differences
across
treatment
groups
in
certain
crime
rates
but
too
few
beats
to
call
the
differences
statistically
significant
but
the
most
important
critique
has
never
been
published
before
that
random
patrol
was
not
compared
to
any
other
pattern
of
patrol
so
there
was
no
evidence
showing
that
random
patrol
did
not
work
relative
to
other
patterns
of
patrol
such
as
concentration
on
crime
hot
spots
policing
still
needs
a
strong
randomized
trial
comparing
random
patrol
to
hot
spots
patrol
nonetheless
the
conclusion
that
random
patrol
did
not
work
was
widely
accepted
tens
of
thousands
of
police
officers
lost
their
jobs
in
the
aftermath
of
the
study
which
came
coincidentally
just
before
a
financial
crisis
in
many
us
cities
none
of
that
stopped
the
widespread
use
of
random
patrol
but
it
did
help
drive
a
research
agenda
seeking
alternative
police
strategies
rapid
response
the
theory
that
marginally
faster
response
times
would
catch
and
deter
more
criminals
was
effectively
falsified
by
a
national
institute
of
justice
funded
research
project
led
by
staff
of
the
kansas
city
police
department
the
study
reported
that
it
was
necessary
to
divide
crimes
into
victim
offender
involvement
crimes
e
g
robbery
assault
rape
and
after
the
crime
discovery
crimes
e
g
burglary
car
theft
it
then
focused
response
time
analysis
on
involvement
crimes
with
response
time
including
three
time
periods
crime
occurrence
to
calling
the
police
reporting
time
police
receipt
of
call
to
dispatch
dispatch
time
and
travel
time
of
police
from
receipt
of
dispatch
to
arrival
at
the
scene
using
systematic
observation
methods
and
interviews
of
victims
the
kansas
city
study
found
that
there
was
no
correlation
between
response
related
arrest
probability
and
reporting
time
once
the
reporting
time
exceeded
minutes
the
average
reporting
time
for
involvement
crimes
was
minutes
kansas
city
police
department
vol
pp
replications
of
the
reporting
time
segment
in
other
us
cities
found
similar
results
spelman
and
brown
what
the
research
did
not
show
is
that
a
capacity
for
rapid
response
had
no
effect
on
crime
the
kansas
city
study
was
not
an
experiment
comparing
police
agencies
or
areas
with
very
rapid
responses
to
similar
agencies
or
areas
with
slower
responses
or
even
no
response
much
remains
to
be
learned
about
the
effect
of
any
rapid
response
capacity
compared
to
none
the
latter
being
the
state
of
police
services
in
much
of
the
world
from
india
to
parts
of
rural
america
what
mattered
historically
was
the
growing
recognition
that
there
were
better
things
police
could
do
with
their
time
than
just
wait
for
calls
while
the
research
did
not
prove
that
point
it
helped
open
the
minds
of
police
leaders
and
scholars
about
what
those
other
things
might
be
reactive
investigations
the
view
that
detectives
solve
crimes
that
are
reported
to
them
was
strongly
rejected
by
another
national
institute
of
justice
nij
project
this
one
conducted
by
the
rand
corporation
greenwood
and
petersilia
this
report
examined
the
value
detectives
add
to
the
information
that
was
in
the
record
at
the
end
of
a
preliminary
investigation
by
the
first
responders
to
a
crime
usually
uniformed
patrol
officers
the
conclusion
was
that
detectives
rarely
uncovered
new
evidence
that
made
a
difference
in
solving
the
crime
contrary
to
a
century
of
detective
fiction
here
again
the
evidence
is
thin
in
relation
to
the
conclusion
an
experiment
comparing
cases
prosecuted
without
detective
work
to
cases
prosecuted
after
detective
work
would
be
a
strong
test
of
the
no
effect
hypothesis
but
what
mattered
was
that
yet
another
sacred
cow
was
wounded
for
many
police
leaders
this
completed
the
well
justified
execution
of
the
three
rs
strategy
which
legitimated
trying
alternatives
these
three
studies
created
a
strong
appetite
for
more
experiments
and
support
for
funding
them
from
influential
scholars
franklin
e
zimring
james
q
wilson
albert
j
reiss
jr
and
others
shaped
several
national
academy
of
science
reports
recommending
more
nij
funding
for
randomized
experiments
zimring
white
and
krislov
these
reports
led
to
nij
funding
streams
for
most
of
the
more
than
tests
of
police
practices
listed
online
by
lum
koper
and
telep
many
of
which
were
funded
in
by
james
k
stewart
the
only
nij
director
to
have
served
as
an
operational
police
officer
and
leader
c
targeting
important
as
these
tests
were
they
could
not
answer
the
more
fundamental
question
how
can
police
resources
be
allocated
more
effectively
once
the
idea
of
proactive
policing
became
widely
understood
it
sparked
a
revolutionary
insight
in
targeting
that
goldstein
called
problem
oriented
policing
pop
for
reactive
investigations
the
rand
report
also
led
to
a
revolutionary
question
can
detectives
target
which
cases
they
can
solve
by
predicting
the
likely
outcome
before
they
begin
working
on
each
case
problem
oriented
policing
after
decades
of
observing
police
operations
for
a
major
study
of
police
discretion
lafave
and
assisting
one
of
the
first
university
graduate
police
executives
in
history
o
w
wilson
as
police
superintendent
of
chicago
herman
goldstein
offered
a
revolutionary
new
targeting
strategy
for
policing
describing
a
case
by
case
response
to
events
as
a
myopic
failure
to
see
larger
patterns
goldstein
recommended
that
police
invest
more
time
in
treating
the
causes
of
those
patterns
rather
than
their
symptoms
pop
is
more
than
a
targeting
strategy
however
since
it
also
develops
ideas
for
the
content
of
police
actions
to
deal
with
targeted
problems
yet
the
tactical
content
of
pop
is
appropriately
broad
and
highly
dependent
on
good
diagnosis
and
good
research
on
what
action
would
work
best
the
major
breakthrough
of
the
strategy
is
the
injunction
to
first
look
for
patterns
proactively
crime
and
harm
concentrations
it
was
therefore
no
accident
that
reiss
the
person
who
first
used
the
term
proactive
in
a
policing
context
suggested
that
i
study
the
distribution
of
all
reactive
police
responses
to
reported
crimes
and
disorder
by
each
and
every
address
in
a
major
city
the
result
was
our
discovery
of
tiny
micro
level
crime
hot
spots
sherman
sherman
gartin
and
buerger
in
contrast
to
conventional
concepts
of
much
larger
high
crime
areas
the
city
of
minneapolis
provided
the
first
but
by
no
means
the
last
evidence
of
far
greater
concentrations
of
repeat
problems
at
individual
street
addresses
than
among
individual
offenders
only
percent
of
all
street
addresses
in
minneapolis
generated
over
half
of
all
police
rapid
responses
this
addition
to
the
existing
research
on
crime
concentrations
showed
how
police
scholars
could
identify
important
new
targets
for
proactive
policing
on
both
sides
of
the
atlantic
while
goldstein
s
examples
were
richly
qualitative
the
research
on
crime
and
harm
concentrations
was
intensely
quantitative
american
scholars
found
hot
spots
of
crime
british
scholars
found
patterns
of
repeat
victimization
farrell
in
both
cases
the
numbers
of
potential
patterns
were
unlimited
only
newly
available
computers
could
say
how
many
addresses
or
people
had
more
than
or
or
crimes
over
any
given
time
period
only
the
computer
could
rank
every
known
offender
victim
location
neighborhood
weapon
modus
operandi
or
crime
recruiter
by
the
number
of
repeat
events
in
a
year
reiss
what
these
studies
showed
were
highly
concentrated
distributions
of
crime
in
a
small
proportion
of
any
of
the
units
at
risk
from
people
to
places
to
times
and
situations
investigative
solvability
factors
news
reports
intermittently
reveal
that
only
a
small
proportion
of
crimes
lead
to
arrests
or
convictions
as
if
they
had
discovered
something
new
there
is
however
no
evidence
to
suggest
that
it
was
ever
otherwise
at
any
time
in
the
last
two
centuries
see
e
g
monkkonen
at
the
same
time
the
rand
report
on
detectives
was
under
way
scholars
at
stanford
university
asked
whether
they
could
target
solvable
crimes
for
priority
investment
allocating
resources
that
might
otherwise
be
wasted
on
pursuing
unsolvable
crimes
this
idea
of
triage
was
at
least
as
old
as
the
us
civil
war
when
doctors
worked
first
on
people
who
would
die
without
immediate
assistance
they
postponed
work
on
two
other
groups
hence
the
term
tri
age
those
who
would
die
even
with
treatment
and
those
who
would
live
without
immediate
treatment
the
strategy
was
intended
to
optimize
the
number
of
lives
for
policing
it
offered
a
way
to
make
policing
far
more
effective
as
greenberg
and
lang
suggested
the
likely
solvability
of
each
case
can
be
reliably
but
not
perfectly
identified
at
the
time
an
initial
investigation
is
completed
by
using
a
checklist
of
available
forensic
evidence
in
each
case
when
it
arrives
on
a
detective
s
desk
the
detective
can
decide
whether
to
close
the
case
or
start
working
on
it
the
checklist
that
stanford
developed
included
such
items
as
fingerprints
witnesses
footprints
names
of
likely
suspects
and
other
facts
a
test
of
one
such
solvability
model
on
over
burglary
cases
found
that
it
correctly
predicted
in
percent
of
the
cases
whether
the
case
would
be
solved
or
not
eck
suggesting
that
nonsolvable
cases
could
be
filed
immediately
with
little
difference
in
result
the
next
question
however
is
still
unanswered
as
with
the
untested
conclusions
about
response
time
and
random
patrols
how
would
a
checklist
of
solvability
factors
regime
compare
to
an
investigate
every
case
regime
in
terms
of
overall
detection
rates
or
even
to
a
discretionary
nonchecklist
decision
about
solvability
regime
d
tracking
no
matter
what
targets
are
selected
for
police
resources
no
matter
how
well
the
police
methods
are
tested
the
central
management
question
will
always
be
what
are
police
doing
to
accomplish
our
objectives
when
where
and
with
what
apparent
result
in
my
first
year
at
the
nypd
in
few
police
leaders
ever
discussed
that
question
by
the
question
was
asked
all
over
the
new
york
subways
by
then
transit
police
chief
william
bratton
and
by
he
was
grilling
nypd
commanders
on
the
question
in
front
of
people
at
police
headquarters
yet
long
before
new
york
reached
that
point
the
british
police
were
being
driven
hard
by
the
numbers
only
the
numbers
and
the
conversations
were
very
different
performance
management
uk
style
from
the
dawn
of
the
thatcher
government
uk
policing
was
dominated
by
two
themes
huge
pay
increases
and
an
explosion
of
statistical
management
key
performance
indicators
were
tabulated
annually
on
a
national
level
and
monthly
on
a
local
level
parkinson
eventually
police
agencies
were
not
only
assessed
on
whether
they
had
met
specific
goals
set
by
central
government
but
also
compared
to
all
other
police
agencies
in
a
kind
of
class
rank
or
football
league
table
one
police
agency
would
be
ranked
first
one
ranked
last
these
rankings
created
enormous
pressure
on
police
leadership
to
track
what
their
officers
were
doing
yet
the
pressure
was
not
matched
by
any
new
tools
either
hardware
or
managerial
for
monitoring
police
activity
only
the
numbers
of
police
car
dispatches
crime
reports
or
arrests
were
easily
measurable
it
was
no
surprise
that
these
numbers
were
sometimes
manipulated
including
a
flexible
definition
of
crime
types
and
other
crimes
taken
into
consideration
when
confessed
by
offenders
caught
red
handed
even
police
response
time
was
used
in
some
years
despite
its
discredited
status
in
the
united
states
by
these
interagency
competitions
were
mostly
rejected
in
uk
police
culture
yet
the
precedent
they
set
for
tracking
in
general
is
still
widely
accepted
what
police
now
understand
is
that
the
number
of
actions
tracked
should
be
relatively
small
and
each
one
should
have
a
direct
connection
to
something
that
is
well
researched
and
found
useful
what
us
police
learned
from
the
british
experience
is
that
timely
data
could
help
drive
a
police
agency
compstat
no
one
put
that
lesson
to
better
use
than
william
bratton
who
served
as
the
chief
executive
of
the
boston
new
york
and
los
angeles
police
departments
with
his
colleague
jack
maple
he
developed
a
more
focused
process
of
tracking
police
activity
using
area
commanders
as
the
conduit
for
strategic
initiatives
bratton
and
maple
developed
the
compstat
computerized
statistics
meetings
as
a
means
of
pushing
for
better
policing
and
less
crime
local
commanders
were
arrested
from
time
to
time
and
charged
with
manipulating
crime
statistics
but
for
the
most
part
the
system
has
been
seen
as
operating
with
integrity
by
the
nypd
system
was
years
old
and
was
still
in
operation
despite
turnover
in
mayors
and
police
commissioners
there
is
enormous
potential
to
expand
it
to
better
indicators
and
performance
auditing
for
evidence
in
late
the
metropolitan
police
at
new
scotland
yard
launched
a
top
to
bottom
effort
to
push
evidence
into
every
aspect
of
police
operations
training
and
promotions
stanko
this
decision
included
a
plan
to
appoint
a
commissioner
s
professor
of
policing
in
a
major
university
a
position
that
would
entail
percent
time
doing
research
for
a
employee
police
agency
this
research
could
include
comprehensive
reviews
of
police
practices
against
what
the
research
evidence
especially
testing
says
about
those
practices
it
would
also
likely
entail
new
randomized
controlled
trials
to
be
conducted
in
london
this
plan
for
evidence
based
policing
was
premised
on
the
recognition
of
a
vast
body
of
research
that
had
not
yet
been
fully
applied
to
police
operations
this
decision
of
police
commissioner
sir
bernard
hogan
howe
provides
perhaps
the
clearest
indication
of
the
anglo
american
rise
of
evidence
for
police
decisions
e
explaining
the
rise
how
policing
learned
so
much
and
put
so
much
of
it
to
work
cannot
be
easily
explained
by
any
current
theory
of
knowledge
even
the
history
of
medicine
offers
thin
explanations
of
why
doctors
do
research
and
why
if
ever
they
decide
to
use
it
millenson
or
not
as
in
their
continued
failure
to
wash
their
hands
after
touching
each
patient
pittet
and
boyce
what
follows
is
my
insider
s
hunch
about
a
theory
of
police
knowledge
this
hunch
is
by
no
means
a
general
theory
of
developing
and
using
professional
knowledge
my
explanation
is
deeply
if
not
widely
grounded
glaser
and
straus
in
my
continuous
participant
observation
study
of
anglo
celtic
policing
since
the
theory
has
a
major
premise
that
democratic
policing
is
an
extremely
open
system
far
more
than
any
publicly
held
stockholder
corporation
and
probably
more
than
any
other
government
agency
policing
is
always
vulnerable
to
the
demands
of
any
vocal
constituency
no
matter
how
small
the
group
of
demanders
or
how
justified
their
complaints
police
leaders
must
listen
to
them
and
give
due
consideration
to
them
in
providing
better
or
different
police
practices
this
pattern
of
organizational
behavior
has
been
observed
in
general
since
at
least
thompson
pp
wilson
p
described
a
subset
of
this
pattern
in
his
discussion
of
critical
events
in
policing
such
as
scandals
riots
police
killings
of
citizens
and
police
strikes
the
key
question
for
evidence
is
what
happens
next
how
critical
events
may
shape
evidence
and
how
evidence
may
then
shape
policy
figure
presents
a
causal
model
in
which
external
demands
for
different
policing
are
the
major
driving
force
the
theory
claims
that
these
demands
are
transformed
by
the
human
capital
of
the
police
institution
at
both
its
core
police
leaders
and
its
periphery
police
scholars
and
research
funders
in
turn
human
capital
is
shaped
by
the
broader
government
policies
that
are
also
a
target
of
public
demands
the
presence
or
absence
of
talented
police
leaders
and
scholars
often
reflects
a
or
year
lag
in
recruitment
conditions
and
is
highly
dependent
on
national
policies
affecting
police
salaries
research
funding
and
other
aspects
of
the
capacity
to
generate
and
use
research
evidence
the
people
in
a
position
to
influence
policy
if
they
are
skilled
enough
can
then
identify
critical
research
questions
and
complete
research
projects
which
are
then
communicated
to
police
practitioners
police
managers
and
officers
will
then
decide
immediately
somewhat
later
or
many
years
later
to
apply
the
conclusions
of
the
research
evidence
in
their
police
practices
sometimes
this
happens
without
their
even
knowing
that
the
practice
was
shaped
by
research
evidence
see
e
g
police
executive
research
forum
these
practices
and
the
ongoing
critical
events
associated
with
them
continue
to
shape
external
demands
on
police
this
happens
only
in
part
on
the
basis
of
police
success
or
failure
in
meeting
those
demands
many
other
things
shape
those
demands
of
course
and
may
be
far
more
important
than
what
police
actually
do
these
other
factors
include
economic
ups
and
downs
emigration
and
immigration
ethnic
and
racial
conflict
baby
booms
and
busts
and
possibly
even
a
lag
time
from
policies
on
leaded
gasoline
nevin
thus
external
demands
on
police
are
largely
exogenous
to
the
model
even
though
police
can
try
to
shape
them
to
some
degree
this
makes
the
external
demands
fairly
insensitive
to
how
well
police
are
performing
in
any
objective
sense
yet
the
model
leaves
room
for
improvements
in
police
practice
at
least
to
mitigate
criticism
and
possibly
even
to
increase
legitimacy
of
the
police
and
trust
and
confidence
in
them
fig
a
theoretical
model
of
the
rise
of
evidence
based
policing
the
role
of
technology
is
also
exogenous
to
the
model
and
may
be
even
more
important
than
citizen
demands
manning
both
police
and
societies
adopt
new
technologies
rapidly
when
their
advantages
are
obvious
and
their
cost
declines
many
technologies
such
as
the
automobile
and
the
computer
are
sold
initially
at
high
cost
and
then
become
much
cheaper
by
the
time
most
us
households
owned
an
auto
for
example
most
police
patrols
were
also
performed
in
cars
the
adoption
of
personal
computers
also
lagged
but
was
much
faster
the
desktop
computer
that
analyzed
police
mainframe
data
to
identify
hot
spots
of
crime
sherman
was
unavailable
in
the
minneapolis
police
department
in
the
s
but
later
faster
cheaper
laptop
models
were
widely
available
in
policing
by
the
s
the
rise
of
dna
testing
still
hinges
on
reducing
the
cost
of
speedy
results
roman
et
al
the
spread
and
impact
of
body
worn
video
may
also
hinge
on
reliability
and
the
cost
of
data
storage
the
model
does
not
suggest
that
there
is
a
direct
pathway
between
demands
for
specific
improvements
in
policing
such
as
more
legitimate
rape
investigations
and
research
on
how
this
demand
can
be
met
to
the
contrary
demands
for
immediate
solutions
send
governments
and
police
in
a
frantic
search
for
research
that
has
already
been
done
if
none
exists
that
merely
provides
evidence
that
policing
lacks
an
evidence
base
for
example
the
death
of
a
bystander
hit
by
a
constable
in
a
london
protest
was
associated
with
a
controversial
police
tactic
called
kettling
or
restraining
people
for
hours
in
a
cordoned
off
area
the
uk
government
launched
a
rapid
evidence
assessment
on
kettling
but
found
that
little
research
had
been
done
rather
than
investing
in
such
research
over
a
longer
time
frame
the
government
chose
to
report
the
knowledge
gap
and
then
ignore
it
the
direct
pathway
from
specific
demands
for
police
innovations
usually
travels
to
police
leaders
through
theory
and
precedent
from
other
jurisdictions
but
not
through
new
research
the
way
research
can
affect
policy
is
to
anticipate
the
chronically
recurring
issues
and
have
research
evidence
ready
for
the
next
critical
event
as
a
member
of
parliament
for
cambridge
once
said
research
findings
are
money
in
the
bank
howarth
they
do
not
have
to
be
used
immediately
and
can
go
unused
for
years
until
there
is
a
demand
for
them
that
is
why
the
line
from
research
goes
directly
to
police
practices
since
research
can
be
kept
in
readiness
to
shape
the
decisions
on
police
practices
when
critical
events
press
police
leaders
to
meet
external
demands
to
change
them
this
theory
explains
the
past
but
need
not
predict
the
future
a
more
rational
model
of
using
evidence
to
improve
policing
would
be
proactively
led
by
the
police
profession
not
reactively
driven
by
the
political
environment
that
model
might
even
reduce
the
number
of
critical
events
that
threaten
police
legitimacy
it
is
one
that
as
applied
to
health
care
has
helped
to
keep
down
medical
costs
in
the
united
kingdom
to
less
than
half
the
percentage
of
gross
domestic
product
as
in
the
united
states
where
there
is
no
system
to
target
resources
on
the
basis
of
professional
research
evidence
sherman
b
it
is
also
the
plan
for
what
the
college
of
policing
might
do
as
a
champion
and
arbiter
of
evidence
based
practice
ii
what
we
know
and
what
police
do
the
clearest
test
of
my
claims
about
evidence
is
whether
police
decisions
are
more
consistent
with
the
evidence
now
than
in
as
of
the
record
on
that
test
was
mixed
but
encouraging
there
are
many
areas
of
triple
t
in
which
the
evidence
is
useful
and
police
are
using
it
there
are
others
in
which
the
evidence
is
useful
but
is
not
used
the
adoption
of
evidence
based
decision
making
has
been
stronger
for
targeting
and
tracking
than
for
testing
but
all
three
areas
have
seen
a
substantial
impact
of
research
on
practice
this
section
supports
those
conclusions
with
a
series
of
short
summaries
of
good
evidence
on
many
aspects
of
policing
followed
by
even
shorter
summaries
of
whether
that
evidence
is
used
there
are
many
other
strategies
that
can
use
ebp
besides
triple
t
evidence
can
be
useful
for
example
in
the
recruitment
and
promotion
of
more
women
police
leaders
in
developing
better
ways
to
train
police
or
in
finding
lighter
weight
body
armor
with
greater
protection
this
essay
focuses
on
triple
t
because
it
can
shape
the
core
of
policing
and
holds
the
greatest
potential
for
the
direct
reduction
of
harm
in
society
the
most
accessible
evidence
of
the
large
quantity
of
the
testing
police
have
done
can
be
found
by

evidence

the
likely
solution
to
that
problem
is
for

and
other

to
broaden
their

the

is
much
harder
to
come
by
and
is
badly
in
need
of
more

this
section
draws
heavily
on
qualitative
evidence
gathered
in
over
weeks
of
discussions
at
cambridge
university
with
police
executives
from
around
the
world
in
primarily
reporting
on
the

that
evidence
may
be
the
least
reliable
of

is
a
consistent
source
applied
equally
to
all
the

a
range
of
evidence
about
ways

agencies
can
set
priorities
for
investing
their

with
the
greatest
return
on

includes
studies
of
how

use
their
time
and
of
how
they
could
focus
their
time
on

of

events
it
includes
tests
of
targeting
strategies
as
well
as

about

be
distinguished
from

the

that

greatly
limit
their

of

putting
them
at

were
given
one
of
two
responses
that

come
as
soon
as
they
can
standard

at
the
time
or
that
no

is
necessary
since
the
matter
can
be
handled
by

or
other
methods
citizens
were
equally
satisfied
with
both
responses
the
benefit
was
that

performed

some

the

be
great

any

that

about

invest
in
correcting

there

police
legitimacy
is
defined
as
a

perception
of

right

be

the

suit
the
fact
that
the
strongest
evidence
was
generated
not
by
an
academic
but
by
a
police
officer
writing
a
master
s
thesis
as
a
self
funded
student
at
cambridge
is
a
good
indication
of
the
rise
of

the
evidence
crime
victims
suffer
great
trauma
from

and

attempts
foa
they
also
suffer
lesser
but
high
levels
of
trauma
from
noninjury
crimes
such
as
burglary
and
robbery
especially
women
angel
while
they
are
rarely
diagnosed
with
post
traumatic
stress
disorder
they
suffer
elevated
levels
of
post
traumatic
stress
symptoms
what
police
do
anglo
celtic
police
have
become
far
more
sensitive
to
rape
related
trauma
since
and
have
developed
elaborate
protocols
for
rape
investigations
and
related
medical
care
police
do
not
however
generally
target
the
victims
of
lesser
trauma
largely
because
there
has
been
little
external
pressure
to
do
so
yet
well
tested
methods
exist
that
police
could
use
to
massively
reduce
the
symptoms
of
posttraumatic
stress
repeat
victims
the
evidence
high
proportions
of
residential
and
personal
crimes
are
committed
against
repeat

pease
what
police
do
police
programs
on
repeat
victimization
tend
to
target
all
victims
rather
than
to
identify
repeat
victims
other
than
the
minneapolis
recap
program
in
the
s
buerger
few
police
agencies
have
even
developed
lists
of
repeat

this
may
be
a
missed
opportunity
for
reducing
both
crime
and
harm
near
miss
victims
the
evidence
one
of
the
most
predictable
risks
of
a
residential
burglary
is
in
the
zone
of
a

on
either

johnson
and

what
police
do
for
a
decade
after
these
findings
were
published
almost
no
police
agencies
identified
these
near
miss
areas
for
prevention
programs
then
a
few
uk
police
agencies
began
doing
so
in
the
word
of
mouth
interest
in
this
approach
came
from
presentations
by
university
of
london
academics
to
practitioner
audiences
at
cambridge
and
cardiff
conferences
of
the
society
of
evidence
based
policing
and
was
still
spreading
in
solvability
factors
the
evidence
there
is
good
evidence
summarized
above
that
police
investigations
can
be
targeted
on
the
cases
most
likely
to
be
solved
and
that
investigations
are
wasted
on
cases
in
which
a
detection
is
predicted
to
be
highly
unlikely
what
police
do
this
is
another
major
failure
of
getting
research
into
practice
at
least
by
it
is
hard
to
find
a
police
agency
that
employs
a
statistical
model
of
solvability
factors
to
allocate
the
very
scarce
resource
of
investigators
time
many
police
agencies
still
say
they
investigate
all
crimes
others
admit
that
they
will
close
cases
that
are
not
solved
after
a
certain
period
but
they
do
not
use
a
statistical
algorithm
to
decide
which
ones
to
abandon
at
the
outset
many
confuse
this
research
with
closing
cases
on
the
basis
of
seriousness
rather
than
solvability
such
as
when
the
value
of
property
stolen
is
too
low
it
remains
a
prime
opportunity
for
policing
to
save
money
and
do
more
to
help
crime
victims
b
testing
police
practices
the
following
subsections
discuss
a
selection
of
major
police
practices
that
have
been
tested
with
at
least
a
comparison
group
many
have
been
tested
with
randomized
controlled
trials
and
some
have
been
tested
repeatedly
with
up
to
or
more
randomized
trials
it
is
the
most
robust
area
of
evidence
supporting
the
triple
t
strategy
but
also
the
area
of
biggest
gaps
between
evidence
and
practice
random
marked
car
patrol
the
evidence
there
is
little
direct
evidence
that
random
patrol
of
areas
that
have
little
crime
can
cause
any
less
crime
than
having
no
patrol
the
major
exception
is
police
strikes
which
consistently
cause
crime
to
skyrocket

my

to
which
specific

about

was
portrayed
in
statistical

my
own
attempt
to
introduce
something
similar
for
the
mayor
of
indianapolis
in
had
failed
to
mobilize
the

kind
of
intensity
largely
because
the
new

version
engaged
almost
people
in

listening
very
closely

to

great

with

something
few

sherman
no
other
system
of

on

has
been
so
influential
or
comprehensive
what
police
do
in
some
years
after
new
york
s
compstat
had
become
highly
publicized
the
police
foundation
conducted
a
national
survey
of
us
police
agencies
in

over
residents
weisburd
et

the
survey
found
that
over
half
of
those

with
an
percent
response
rate
either
had
adopted
a
compstat
like
program
or
were
planning
to
do
so
in
the
early
twenty
first
century
compstat
like
meetings
were
held
regularly
in
many
uk
police
agencies
few
such
meetings
however
track
the
key
question
under
discussion
where
are
the
police
doing
what
and
for
how
much
of
their
time
on
duty
that
is
a
question
that
two
major
advances
in
technology
will
soon
make
it
easier
to
answer
gps
tracking
of
officer
locations
the
evidence
police
agencies
have
been
able
to
track
the
locations
of
police
cars
since
at
least
the
s
but
have
rarely
done
so
police
unions
once
resisted
the
idea
especially
in
the
s
when
some
us
officers
regularly
slept
in
their
cars
on
the
midnight
shift
the
rise
of
gps
devices
in
police
radios
and
smart
phones
now
makes
it
possible
to
track
the
whereabouts
of
each
officer
every
few
minutes
or
seconds
police
officers
also
seem
more
willing
to
allow
this
if
only
as
a
safety
device
that
could
enable
a
rapid
response
of
other
police
to
help
them
an
experiment
in
providing
police
supervisors
with
data
on
how
much
time
each
patrol
officer
spent
at
directed
patrols
in

has
been
completed

weisburd
other
experiments
testing
the
use
of
tracking
evidence
for
effects
on
police
performance
are
needed
to
determine
whether
tracking
at
this
level
of
detail
is
cost
effective
or
not
what
police
do
from
the
limited
evidence
available
it
appears
that
as
of
no
major
police
agency
has
made
statistical
use
of
gps
data
about
locations
of
police
outputs
as
a
standard
part
of
tracking
or
compstat
for
reasons
discussed
in
the
first
section
of
this
essay
however
it
seems
likely
that
such
tracking
will
be
widespread
by
body
worn
video
the
evidence
inexpensive
body
worn
video
bwv
cameras
with
long
running
batteries
came
on
the
market
around
as
a
student
in
the
cambridge
police
executive
program
police
chief
tony
farrar
of
rialto
california
decided
to
test
the
hypothesis
that
police
officers
wearing
bwv
would
generate
fewer
complaints
from
encounters
with
citizens
one
theory
is
that
officers
would
be
more
polite
and
compliant
with
rules
knowing
that
every
word
and
action
was
on
digital
record
the
other
theory
states
exactly
the
same
for
citizens
encountering
police
in
a
randomized
controlled
trial
of
police
shifts
in
which
all
patrol
officers
either
did
or
did
not
wear
the
cameras
farrar
found
initial
evidence
of
fewer
complaints
on
shifts
when
officers
wore
their
bwv
devices
given
spillover
diffusion
effects
to
shifts
when
officers
did
not
wear
cameras
it
was
no
surprise
that
total
complaints
against
police
dropped
sharply
related
hypotheses
can
be
tested
in
this
design
for
the
rates
at
which
arrestees
plead
guilty
as
charged
or
the
rates
at
which
either
citizens
or
police
are
injured
in
their
encounters
note
that
this
evidence
is
a
prime
example
of
testing
a
means
of
tracking
police
performance
as
distinct
from
testing
the
effects
of
performance
itself
it
asks
whether
tracking
has
benefits
regardless
of
what
police
do
and
whether
tracking
improves
police
quality
what
police
do
bwv
is
at
a
very
early
stage
of
development
in
policing
one
uk
agency
tried
to
incorporate
it
into
stop
and
question
procedures
but
citizens
who
were
stopped
refused
to
answer
questions
while
police
had
their
cameras
on
a
large
australian
police
agency
has
had
problems
with
equipment
failures
what
no
agency
appears
to
have
tried
is
the
use
of
bwv
to
replace
typing
with
video
recorded
crime
reports
victim
and
investigative
interviews
and
other
work
such
use
of
videos
could
keep
police
out
of
stations
typing
up
text
for
many
hours
when
they
could
be
on
patrol
taking
video
statements
as
well
as
increasing
patrol
visibility
in
the
united
kingdom
s
ongoing
effort
to
cut
red
tape
and
reduce
reports
no
solution
could
be
easier
or
more
elegant
than
downloading
police
video
and
audio
as
a
digital
logbook
if
text
reports
need
to
be
created
for
any
reason
including
prosecution
then
civilian
video
specialists
can
do
that
rather
than
police
trained
to
patrol
prevent
and
investigate
d
summary
knowledge
and
its
use
the
examples
offered
above
support
a
key
conclusion
there
has
been
a
massive
growth
of
policing
knowledge
over
the
levels
in
equally
important
is
a
second
conclusion
there
has
been
less
progress
in
using
knowledge
than
in
generating
it
but
the
crude
and
perhaps
inaccurate
measures
of
evidence
in
practice
fail
to
suggest
what
may
be
the
most
important
point
that
police
interest
in
using
evidence
grew
most
rapidly
in
the
last
decade
before
even
though
the
s
was
the
most

this
section
highlights
the
major
conceptual
issues
that
must
be
addressed
for
policing
to
use
evidence
in
a
fully
professional
way
these
issues
all
relate
to
the
way
in
which
the
concept
of
evidence
is
defined
the
greatest
threat
to
police
professionalism
is
that
the
word
evidence
will
be
hijacked
to
mean
what
it
is
intended
to
replace
intuition
anecdote
and
opinion
just
because
a
word
is
fashionable
does
not
mean
that
people
who
use
it
will
understand
it
let
alone
accept
it
and
agree
with
its
message
even
with
the
best
of
intentions
the
word
evidence
is
often
applied
incorrectly
by
people
who
lack
adequate
training
in
how
evidence
should
be
used
this
risk
requires
that
police
leaders
and
scholars
pay
close
attention
to
the
integrity
of
the
concept
and
relentlessly
challenge
any
claims
that
the
evidence
shows
when
no
such
evidence
exists
this
threat
has
major
implications
for
how
police
training
and
promotion
processes
teach
and
communicate
about
evidence
based
practices
simple
lists
of
best
practices
may
have
great
value
in
some
contexts
but
for
people
sitting
at
conference
tables
deciding
on
what
best
practices
they
should
adopt
simplicity
is
not
good
enough
policing
is
a
complex
enterprise
and
so
is
drawing
conclusions
from
evidence
people
analyzing
evidence
need
to
be
qualified
to
do
so
one
way
or
another
at
minimum
they
should
understand
the
concepts
presented
in
this
section
it
is
reassuring
that
these
same
conceptual
issues
bedevil
other
complex
enterprises
as
well
there
is
nothing
wrong
with
police
thinking
about
evidence
that
is
not
also
wrong
with
the
thinking
of
highly
seasoned
politicians
issenberg
baseball
managers
lewis
and
nuclear
power
plant
engineers
silver
chap
as
kahneman
demonstrates
it
is
very
hard
for
humans
to
discipline
their
thinking
away
from
intuitive
snap
judgments
system
i
to
accept
more
systematic
analyses
that
follow
strict
rules
of
evidence
system
ii
fortunately
he
concludes
that
it
is
at
least
possible
for
humans
to
achieve
that
discipline
but
only
if
we
work
pretty
hard
at
it
this
section
considers
four
questions
most
important
is
the
question
of
what
good
evidence
is
and
what
it
means
to
make
policing
evidence
based
the
other
three
questions
cover
related
issues
in
targeting
testing
and
tracking
the
targeting
subsection
introduces
the
concept
of
a
crime
harm
index
as
the
best
way
to
measure
what
matters
in
valuing
police
effectiveness
the
testing
subsection
shows
how
testing
is
increasingly
done
by
pracademics
not
just
academics
the
tracking
subsection
discusses
how
to
use
evidence
for
ensuring
better
implementation
of
evidence
based
policies
a
what
is
good
evidence
what
is
good
evidence
this
question
must
be
addressed
almost
daily
if
policing
is
to
raise
its
level
of
professionalism
even
among
those
strongly
committed
to
using
good
evidence
it
is
easy
to
lose
the
core
principles
of
testing
at
an
early
meeting
of
the
society
of
evidence
based
policing
for
example
a
presentation
led
a
session
chair
to
endorse
an
innovation
in
taking
witness
statements
that
had
just
been
described
by
two
presenters
one
speaker
described
laboratory
tests
of
the
new
procedure
while
the
other
speaker
described
its
use
in
just
three
cases
in
the
field
no
controlled
field
test
had
been
conducted
nor
any
test
measuring
the
key
outcome
of
conviction
rates
yet
on
the
basis
of
the
strong
results
of
the
lab
experiments
the
session
chair
enthusiastically
described
the
research
as
really
strong
evidence
and
suggested
that
it
was
unethical
for
police
at
the
conference
not
to
adopt
the
innovation
i
felt
compelled
to
challenge
that
claim
by
pointing
out
the
major
difference
between
laboratory
and
field
tests
i
noted
that
evidence
based
medicine
limits
its
definition
of
evidence
to
field
tests
only
viewing
lab
tests
as
a
necessary
precursor
to
testing
treatments
on
real
people
in
this
police
context
this
means
that
the
proper
channel
for
the
enthusiasm
we
all
felt
for
the
innovation
would
be
to
conduct
a
randomized
field
experiment
which
had
not
yet
been
done
the
session
chair
readily
accepted
this
amendment
to
his
initial
conclusion
yet
few
advocates
of
new
ideas
would
be
so
open
minded
as
the
session
chair
who
is
widely
seen
as
one
of
the
most
promising
police
leaders
in
britain
it
is
people
like
him
who
will
make
a
key
difference
in
how
well
evidence
is
understood
used
and
defined
in
science
as
in
law
evidence
is
an
objective
finding
that
can
be
confirmed
by
repeated
observations
of
independent
observers
and
that
can
help
to
support
a
conclusion
most
people
as
philosopher
david
hume
observed
find
great
difficulty
in
accepting
that
their
own
subjective
impressions
hunches
prejudices
theories
or
opinions
are
not
objective
evidence
as
the
late
senator
daniel
p
moynihan
observed
the
plural
of
anecdote
is
not
data
the
rules
of
science
and
statistics
require
many
complex
procedures
and
conceptual
tests
in
order
to
establish
that
evidence
is
reliable
including
probability
sampling
causal
inference
selection
bias
statistical
power
confidence
intervals
and
many
other
challenges
to
deciding
what
is
a
fact
let
alone
whether
the
known
facts
can
support
a
conclusion
the
us
supreme
court
in
daubert
v
merrell
dow
u
s
codified
these
principles
into
federal
court
procedures
for
admitting
scientific
evidence
of
all
kinds
at
a
more
advanced
level
of
understanding
the
challenge
is
grasping
the
full
breadth
of
decision
making
processes
for
which
good
evidence
is
essential
including
but
not
limited
to
targeting
testing
or
tracking
to
some
critics
evidence
is
only
about
testing
or
even
just
about
randomized
controlled
trials
to
baseball
fans
familiar
with
the
moneyball
story
of
the
oakland
athletics
team
lewis
it
is
all
about
targeting
hiring
the
most
cost
effective
baseball
players
by
replacing
experienced
baseball
scouts
with
computer
geeks
to
some
observers
of
president
obama
s
victory
lab
issenberg
better
evidence
means
replacing
intuitive
political
gurus
with
computerized
geeks
for
tracking
the
delivery
of
more
favorable
voters
to
the
polls
these
partial
understandings
of
evidence
based
practice
converge
on
a
single
straw
man
caricature
that
quantitative
thinking
beats
and
should
replace
qualitative
judgment
nothing
could
be
further
from
the
truth
as
the
doctors
who
helped
develop
evidence
based
medicine
argued
the
best
evidence
is
a
blend
of
individual
clinical
experience
with
the
best
quantitative
and
qualitative
external
evidence
research
findings
and
experience
about
similar
cases
or
problems
sackett
et
al
as
baseball
statistician
nate
silver
p
observed
two
baseball
players
could
have
identical
statistics
but
one
could
spend
his
evenings
volunteering
at
a
homeless
shelter
while
the
other
is
snorting
cocaine
in
nightclubs
he
writes
that
there
is
probably
no
way
to
quantify
this
distinction
but
you
d
sure
as
hell
want
to
take
it
into
account
similarly
if
a
police
commander
knows
that
a
robbery
hot
spot
has
developed
in
a
racially
tense
minority
area
targeting
and
that
the
average
effect
of
doubling
police
patrols
in
robbery
hot
spots
is
to
cut
robbery
percent
testing
that
is
not
enough
evidence
for
a
good
decision
the
commander
would
also
think
of
many
other
qualitative
factors
such
as
the
recent
or
long
history
of
police
community
relations
in
that
area
the
extent
to
which
stop
and
frisk
would
be
used
the
likely
weather
or
school
vacations
the
availability
of
minority
group
officers
to
work
in
the
area
and
the
track
record
or
personality
of
a
sergeant
who
would
directly
supervise
any
effort
to
double
patrols
the
commander
might
also
wish
to
consult
with
neighborhood
leaders
on
how
best
to
bring
in
more
patrols
perhaps
with
a
handout
flyer
for
police
to
give
everyone
they
encounter
on
the
streets
a
practice
for
which
there
is
experimental
evidence
from
australia
mazerolle
et
al
evidence
based
practice
does
not
and
cannot
replace
judgment
based
on
experience
it
can
only
inform
such
judgment
and
usually
improve
it
attempts
to
portray
ebp
as
trying
to
replace
rather
than
supplement
experience
sparrow
are
merely
noise
in
relation
to
the
signal
not
even
baseball
teams
as
silver
pp
points
out
replaced
qualitative
scouts
with
quantitative
geeks
after
the
events
depicted
in
moneyball
lewis
instead
baseball
teams
increased
their
investments
in
both
integrating
qualitative
and
quantitative
information
supported
by
a
profession
led
science
see
weisburd
and
neyroud
the
body
of
knowledge
supporting
ebp
embraces
and
incorporates
police
experience
and
craft
skills
it
does
not
replace
traditional
thinking
about
legality
legitimacy
and
common
sense
nor
does
it
replace
the
wisdom
and
experience
of
police
professionals
what
it
adds
to
these
assets
is
the
crucial
step
of
an
objectivity
check
about
questions
that
have
often
been
answered
on
the
basis
of
subjective
opinions
sherman
is
there
any
systematic
scientifically
generated
evidence
that
bears
on
the
decisions
we
are
about
to
make
moreover
is
the
evidence
the
right
kind
of
evidence
for
the
decision
while
the
meaning
of
the
phrase
what
works
in
policing
may
seem
obvious
it
is
not
whether
a
prediction
model
works
simply
means
whether
its
predictions
are
accurate
no
randomized
controlled
experiment
is
needed
whether
gps
works
to
track
police
locations
accurately
is
simply
a
matter
of
auditing
by
physical
tests
there
is
no
cause
and
effect
relationship
just
measurement
reliability
whether
arrest
for
domestic
violence
works
however
is
a
matter
of
testing
for
cause
and
effect
this
means
that
in
a
controlled
experiment
cases
in
which
police
made
arrests
would
have
to
have
had
less
repeat
offending
than
in
cases
in
which
police
did
not
make
arrests
that
is
why
the
maryland
scale
of
scientific
methods
levels
sherman
et
al
is
relevant
to
testing
police
actions
in
triple
t
but
not
to
assessing
the
accuracy
of
predictions
for
police
targeting
decisions
the
maryland
scale
is
also
irrelevant
for
audits
measures
and
descriptions
intended
for
tracking
police
performance
the
best
evidence
for
answering
any
question
of
what
works
thus
depends
on
which
t
table
summarizes
the
different
standards
for
good
evidence
of
what
works
for
the
three
different
ts
the
left
hand
column
shows
three
different
levels
of
strength
of
evidence
combining
several
key
dimensions
replications

collection
for
measurement
reliability
consistency
of
findings

only
in
the
case

the
capacity
of
the
research
design
to
rule
out
other
causes
besides
the
police
practice
being
tested
these
standards
are
certainly
subject
to
debate
but
perhaps
the
bare
minimum
rock
bottom
standard
for
ebp
is
this
a
comparison
group
is
essential
to
every
test
to
be
included
as

that
a
police
decision
causes
a
certain
result
that
was
the
standard
used
for
reporting
on
evidence
to
the
us
congress
sherman
and
the
global
police
profession
should
arguably
have
standards
that
are
at
least
as
high
or
higher
these
distinctions
illustrate
the
need
for
police
professionals
to
raise
their
game
in
mastering
the
scientific
rules
of
evidence
what
follows
is
an
overview
of
some
of
the
key
issues
and
of
my
ideas
for
addressing
them
further

of
the

be
useful
for
anyone
who
proposes
to
use

especially
produce
evidence
for

b
issues
in
targeting
resources
the
targeting
of
scarce
resources
can
be
compared
to
an
investment
portfolio
like
police
agencies
investors
have
a
variety
of
objectives
such
as
growth
income
and
security
like
police
investors
make
a
variety
of
investments
to
accomplish
different
objectives
like
police
investors
face
an
endless
array
of
choices
about
how
to
invest
scarce
resources
but
investors
have
one
great
advantage
over
police
that
makes
the
investors
job
much
easier
a
common
currency
police
can
have
a
common
currency
as
well
but
only
if
they
create
it
this
subsection
starts
by
describing
a
way
in
which
police
can
guide
targeting
decisions
with
a
common
currency
of
return
on
investment
it
then
shows
how
different
methods
of
predicting
returns
of
investment
in
that
currency
will
produce
much
higher
or
lower
rates
of
error
in
making
targeting
decisions
including
the
new
decision
tool
called
predictive

as
well
as
the
neglected

factors
table
good

scales
for

a
crime
harm
index
the
biggest
obstacle
to
reducing
crime
may
be
the
misleading
way
in
which
it
is
counted
as
a
raw
summation
of
all
crimes
regardless
of
any
differences
in
public
views
of
the
seriousness
of
harm
across
crime
categories
rossi
et
al
from
washington

london
to
delhi
governments
earnestly

whether
there
were
more
crimes
this
year
than
last
this
count
of
the
crime
total
treats
every
crime
as
equal
all
crimes
are
not
created
equal
some
crimes
cause
horrible
injuries
and
deaths
others
cause
scant
meaningful
harm
to
anyone
such
as
possessing
a
inch

marijuana
crime
counts
are
dominated
by
such
high
volume
but
minor
crimes
as
shoplifting
from
large
chain

in
england
and
wales
only
percent
of
reported
crimes
in
the
months
to
october
included
injury
or
a
sex
offense
yet
public
officials
are
pleased
to
report
success
when
total
crime
drops
and
displeased
when
total
crime
counts
rise
even
if
murders
rapes
and
serious
woundings
stay
constant
if
ebp
accepts
this
fungibility
fallacy
that
all
crimes
are
equal
its
value
will
be
greatly
restricted
police
professionals
are
acutely
sensitive
to
the
idea
that
the
weight
of
harm
from
crime
matters
more
than
a
raw
count
of
incidents
sherman
a
they
know
that
a
car
theft
is
less
harmful
than
a
rape
that
a
fraud
is
less
harmful
than
a
stabbing
what
they
lack
is
a
way
to
account
for
these
differences
in
combination
across
all
crimes
this
would
allow
police
to
know
whether
total
harm
from
crime
in
one
city
is
higher
this
year
than
last
higher
in
this
part
of
town
than
that
or
with
this
offender
s
record
compared
to
that
one
s
the
best
way
to
compile
meaningful
evidence
about
reported
crime
is
to
give
each
type
of
crime
a
weight
that
represents
how
harmful
each
type
of
crime
is
combining
crime
in
this
way
would
create
what
statisticians
call
an
index
yielding
a
single
bottom
line
the
weight
can
be
based
on
a
variety
of
metrics
the
simplest
metric
would
be
taken
from
any
sentencing
guideline
recommendations
of
the
number
of
days
in
prison
for
a
first
offender
convicted
of
that
offense
this
would
give
an
approximation
of
the
pure
weight
of
harm
of
the
offense
itself
in
contrast
to
the
actual
sentence
length
an
offender
may
receive
the
latter
being
influenced
by
the
number
of
prior
convictions
of
the
offender
summing
the
total
weight
for
each
type
of
any
indicator
such
as
crime
types
then
adding
the
subtotal
weights
together
is
the
basis
for
a
commonly
used
method
of
constructing
an
index
of
multiple
indicators
a
consumer
price
index
cpi
for
example
takes
the
cost
of
consumer
goods
in
different
categories
food
housing
transportation
and
then
assigns
a
weight
to
those
costs
based
on
the
average
household
s
budget
proportions
for
each
category
if
housing
costs
rise
percent
but
housing
is
only
percent
of
the
family
s
budget
then
the
housing
increase
of
percent
becomes
a
percent
increase
in
the
total
cpi
similarly
a
crime
harm
index
chi
is
a
tool
for
creating
just
such
a
bottom
line
for
the
harm
caused
by
crime
sherman
a
weighting
crimes
on
the
basis
of
sentencing
guidelines
can
be
justified
on
good
democratic
grounds
as
reflecting
the
will
of
the
people
almost
every
sentencing
guideline
process
in
the
united
states
and
united
kingdom
has
reflected
awareness
of
opinion
polls
debates
and
scrutiny
by
elected
officials
and
news
media
the
scrutiny
may
not
have
been
perfect
yet
it
remains
far
closer
to
the
will
of
the
people
than
any
theoretical
or
even
empirical
system
of
weighting
that
academics
might
develop
most
important
it
is
readily
available
to
be
applied
to
any
set
of
crimes
whether
for
an
individual
a
community
or
a
nation
any
police
agency
or
government
can
construct
its
own
index
with
the
following
seven
steps
counting
up
the
number
of
crimes
of
each
type
in
an
area
or
for
one
offender
multiplying
the
count
for
each
type
by
the
median

as
an
example
of
how
a

works
consider
a
community
or
an
offender
with
crimes
in
the
record
assume
that
the
recommended
sentence
for
a
shoplifting
crime
is
day
in
prison
and
that
the
recommended
sentence
for
a
first
manslaughter
is
years
in

or
days
if
all
crimes
are
shoplifting
cases
the

if

cases
then
the

would
tell

more
about

is
higher
or

depending
on
the
exact
nature
of
the
crimes
to
translate
a

into

plan
police
leaders
can
simply
use
a

or
more

perhaps
the
greatest
value
of
a

would
be
in
using
it
to
forecast
how
much
harm
an
individual
offender
suspect
or
defendant
is
likely
to
cause
in
the
next
years
such
forecasts
can
help
guide
the
massive
use
of

divert

from

into

constituting
some
percent
of

judge
the
legitimacy
of

could
be
enhanced
by
using
these
forecasts
to
reduce
the
risk
of
releasing
a
very
dangerous
offender
who
may
for
example
soon
murder
someone
such
forecasting
can
provide
missing

for

of

the

of

of

clearer
to
those
who
must
make
them
a
standard

such
as
a

the

of

can
make

easier
to

in

bad

no

what
currency
police
use
to

the

they

to
make
good

is
a
reliable

of

they
may
prefer
to
have
a

but
predictions
are
far
less
reliable
than

the
difference
between
a
forecast
and
a
prediction
is
crucial
as
the
scientists
who
study
earthquakes
know
to
their
cost
silver

that
in

about

kyoto

is
a

of
an

over

silver

that
the
official
position
of
the
us
geological

is
that
earthquakes
can
be
forecasted
but
they
cannot
be
predicted
much
the
same
can
be
said
about
evidence

police
targeting
it
employs
forecasting
not
precise
predictions
about
when

where

are
likely
to
occur
in
the
first
published
analysis
of

across
every

the

the
form
of

this

can
be

the

in

the

applies
could
be

these

have
high
levels
of

low

of

they
cannot
tell

a

both

the

between
quantitative

also

three
basic
ways

subjective

a

most
common
method
is
the
subjective
intuitive

approach

situations
kahneman
the
second
method
is
a
checklist
approach
that
moves
past
experience
from
qualitative
to
quantitative
analysis
it
translates
prior
experience
into
a
more
systematic
algorithm

word
statisticians
prefer
for
a
formula
or
equation
based
on
a
few
consistent
criteria

weighted
questions
to
make
decisions
about

in

samples
of
previous
cases

an
example
of
the

the
third
method
requires
the
use
of
a
supercomputer
performing
massive
calculations
about
each
individual
case
in
relation
to
tens
of
thousands
of
similar
but

especially
useful
in

rare
events
such
as

the

clinical
versus
statistical
predictions
since
at
least
the
advent
of
freudian
theory
professionals
such
as
psychiatrists
have
been
paid
well
to
make
predictions
about
human
behavior
these
predictions
have
been
based
on
detailed
analysis
of
an
individual
s
personality
and
previous
behavior
the
method
has
been
highly
respected
it
is
still
used
widely
to
decide
whether
violent
people
are
insane
or
criminally
responsible
for
their
conduct
many
police
agencies
also
use
it
to
screen
police
recruits
for
mental
health
since
the
advent
of
mechanical
calculators
a
far
less
expensive
approach
to
prediction
has
been
used
by
institutions
dealing
with
large
volumes
of
decisions
from
insurance
companies
to
university
admissions
offices
decisions
have
been
made
on
the
basis
of
classifying
people
by
their
numbers
how
many
accidents
how
high
a
test
score
what
average
grades
how
many
speeding
violations
and
so
on
these
characteristics
can
be
recorded
at
much
lower
expense
than
the
cost
of
having
a
professional
personality
assessment
while
making
exactly
the
same
kind
of
predictions
until
meehl
s
comparison
of
these
inexpensive
statistical
methods
to
the
expensive
clinical
methods
no
one
had
ever
shown
which
method
is
more
accurate
since
then
no
research
has
ever
contradicted
his
central
conclusion
what
meehl
found
was
that
statistically
validated
predictions
were
always
either
more
accurate
than
clinical
prediction
or
at
worst
just
as
good
at
a
much
lower

about

organized
according
to
a
rule
such
rules
are
called
algorithms
the
statistical
predictions
based
on
algorithms
in
meehl
s
comparison
were
very
simple
by
modern
standards

they
usually
did
better

statistical

much
better

there
is
no

case
in
which

this

it

the

about

be
a

comparing
the

of
a

of

using

solvability

to
target
cases
for

to
those
of

using
unstructured
discretion
to
target
cases
by
randomly
assigning
all
incoming
cases
to
one
or
the
other
of
the
two
teams
the
experiment
would
yield
a
valid
estimate
of
using
one
system
or
the
other
even
better
such
an
experiment
could
use
a
chi
to
weight
the
value
of
the

this
would
create
an
incentive
for
the
investigators
to
use
harm
weightings
in
combination
with
solvability
factors
to
decide
which
cases
to
investigate
the
investigative
results
could
then
be
compared

a
clear
understanding

between

many
police

say
they
have
evidence
that
a

works
because
they
have
tried
it

in

cases
there
is
no
good

the

tried
a
very
interesting
idea
in
bournemouth
in
the
early
twenty
first
century
when
all
pubs
still
closed
at
p
m
sharp
what
happened
between
and
midnight
each
evening
was
reportedly
a
big
spike
in
the
hourly
number
of

many
fights
happened
while
people
were
waiting
in
line
at
fish
and
chips
shops
hungry
for
their
first
food
after
drinking
beer
for
or
hours
a
creative
police
leader
reasoned
that
this
pattern
or
problem
as
goldstein
defined
it
was
caused
by
low
blood
sugar
making
people
more
irritable
the
dorset
police
then
tried
handing
out
free
chocolates
to
people
waiting
in

for
their
takeaway
food
media
reports
at
the
time
quoted

saying
the
idea
worked
this
brilliant
idea
appears
however
never
to
have
been
tested
at
the
standard
required
by

policing
i
found
no
report
of
any
counts
of
fights
between

midnight
either
before
or
after
the

policy
the
first
standard
of
a
scientific
test
is
that
there
be
consistently

chocolate
as
a
public
health
doctor
might
ask
what
was

it

if
not
were
there
fewer
fights
where
there
was
more
chocolate
over
a
long
enough

period
to
constitute
a
statistically
powerful
test
by
what
percentage
did
the
average
number
of
fights
in
bournemouth
between
and

go
down
even
if
all
those
questions
of
measurement
were
answered
however
there
would
still
be
no
assurance
that
the
chocolates
had
worked
unless
the
second
standard
of
a
test
were
to
be
met
a
fair
comparison
to
a

group
that
did
not
receive
the
free

a
control
group
could
be
selected
from
the
central
entertainment
area
of
a
similar
city
nearby
which
would
constitute
a
level
test
on
the
maryland
scale
of
scientific

sherman
et
al
the
minimum
level
recommended
for

on
which
to
base

even
better
would
have
been
the
identification
of

in
dorset
s
entertainment
areas
in
multiple
cities
and
towns
with
of
them
selected
at
random
for
the
free
chocolate
treatment
the
distinction
between
trying
and
testing
has
become
increasingly
clear
to
police
leaders
if
not
the
rank
and
file
in
the
united
states
and
united
kingdom
over
the
past
four
decades
yet
the
absolute
comprehension
level
remains
low
it
is
hard
to
teach
these
concepts
to
senior
police
leaders
in
a
short
conversation
even
though
they
now
feel
obliged
to
discuss
them
as
if
they
understand
them
perfectly
the
concept
of
testing
has
not
until
recently
been
a
part
of
police
training
for
leaders
or
street
officers
but
since
the
cambridge
university
institute
of
criminology
has
been
teaching
these
ideas
to
a
large
proportion
of
all
the
leaders
who
became
chief
constables
the
success
of
that
teaching
has
been
far
from
perfect
but
it
is
no
accident
that
the
uk
police
leadership
spends
far
more
time
talking
about
the
evidence
for
policies
than
us
police
leaders
do
what
may
work
better
than
training
is
to
have
a
much
greater
volume
of
experiments
going
on
in
police
agencies
than
ever
before
since
this
has
been
happening
in
the
united
kingdom
if
not
in
the
united
states
the
downside
of
this
development
may
be
less
rigor
and
care
in
the
conduct
of
experiments
for
reasons
discussed
below
these
problems
may
be
outweighed
however
by
the
increased
awareness
they
promote
of
the
difference
between
trying
and
testing
between
evidence
free
and
evidence
based
policing
what
works
testing
practices
using
tests
there
are
two
ways
for
police
to
find
out
whether
a
specific
police
practice
is
effective
one
is
to
have
someone
look
for
relevant
evidence
in
the
growing
police
research
repositories
see
the
appendix
the
other
is
for
police
to
conduct
tests
in
their
own
agencies
in
an
ideal
world
there
would
be
so
many
tests
of
police
services
as
there
are
of
medical
services
that
ebp
would
operate
primarily
by
looking
up
tests
rather
than
doing
them
the
ebp
matrix
lum
koper
and
telep
and
other
tools
already
make
it
easy
to
do
this
other
tools
for
easy
lookups
are
under
development
some
of
them
designed
for
access
via
smart
phones
the
college
of
policing
may
even
develop
the
ideas
of
computerized
medicine
for
instant
access
to
relevant
evidence
hafner
in
the
foreseeable
future
however
many
expensive
police
services
will
remain
untested
the
costs
of
conducting
tests
are
minimal
in
comparison
to
the
costs
of
delivering
untested
services
and
every
time
a
police
agency
contributes
a
high
quality
cost
effectiveness
test
to
the
global
police
literature
the
entire
world
will
gain
unlike
such
agencies
as
the
uk
national
health
service
police
are
not
yet
required
to
have
randomized
trials
justify
large
portions
of
the
police
budget
but
it
would
be
major
progress
if
at
least
or
percent
of
a
police
operating
budget
could
be
based
on
good
evidence
the
most
relevant
question
for
any
police
leader
is
which
of
our
services
is
so
expensive
and
of
such
doubtful
value
that
it
is
worthwhile
to
do
our
own
local
randomized
controlled
trial
a
generalizability
of
evidence
there
is
also
a
scientific
question
of
how
reliably
research
in
one
police
agency
or
more
will
predict
effectiveness
in
any
other
agency
the
present
state
of
science
cannot
say
whether
one
or
even
strong
tests
are
enough
to
generalize
to
all
democracies
or
even
across
the
country
where
the
tests
were
done
this
problem
is
confounded
by
the
wide
range
of
results
reported
in
such
systematic
reviews
as
the
meta
analysis
of
the
effects
of
hot
spot
policing
braga
papachristos
and
hureau
while
the
average
effect
is
beneficial
the
range
of
effects
is
very
great
whether
another
agency
implementing
some
form
of
hot
spot
policing
will
achieve
a
large
or
small
effect
remains
highly
uncertain
from
the
available
research
the
external
validity
of
results
is
also
challenged
by
the
wide
variety
of
practices
tested
even
under
a
common
rubric
like
hot
spots
policing
the
range
of
specific
police
methods
of
policing
included
in
that
review
is
almost
as
great
as
the
range
of
effect
sizes
braga
papachristos
and
hureau
while
the
review
is
nonetheless
a
major
contribution
to
the
literature
the
wide
range
of
research
designs
unavoidably
strains
the
scientific
definition
of
replication
on
which
the
statistical
procedures
are
premised
for
example
while
the
hot
spot
review
found
randomized
trials
of
hot
spot
policing
and
more
have
been
finished
since
only
one
of
them
tested
a
substantial
increase
in
marked
car
patrols
in
street
corner
hot
spots
other
designs
are
of
interest
but
for
a
police
leader
considering
a
percent
increase
in
hot
spot
patrols
at
street
corners
any
other
design
is
a
different
research
question
for
the
foreseeable
future
the
best
evidence
on
outcomes
police
agencies
can
get
will
come
from
conducting
their
own
experiments
most
readers
may
wonder
whether
that
idea
is
feasible
or
is
a
fantasy
the
answer
depends
entirely
on
who
does
the
experiments
who
designs
them
leads
them
and
analyzes
them
those
tasks
have
been
the
traditional
domain
of
police
scholars
with
police
practitioners
as
their
partners
yet
a
rapidly
growing
appetite
for
good
evidence
will
soon
swamp
the
available
numbers
of
experimental
criminologists
unless
they
reinvent
their
partnerships
with
policing
b
who
shall
test
the
police
themselves
from
until
police
testing
was
largely
orchestrated
by
academics
in
universities
who
had
found
police
chiefs
to
partner
with
them
the
experiments
typically
involved
large
grants
from
foundations
or
national
governments
research
agencies
us
national
institute
of
justice
uk
home
office
australian
research
council
these
grants
usually
provided
for
well
trained
and
closely
supervised
doctoral
students
to
work
with
police
in
the
delivery
and
measurement
of
the
experimental
variables
ensuring
independent
quality
control
and
monitoring
of
the
data
collection
senior
academics
would
then
analyze
the
data
and
write
the
report
since
the
number
of
academics
interested
in
doing
all
this
work
was
limited
the
maximum
number
of
experiments
was
limited
by
human
resources
as
much
as
by
the
tiny
overall
funding
stream
for
such
experiments
since
around
both
funding
and
leadership
barriers
have
started
to
fall
funding
has
been
increasingly
provided
by
police
agencies
subsidized
by
universities
teaching
police
executives
the
leadership
of
police
experiments
has
been
moving
from
professors
to
pracademics
as
police
practitioner
academics
increasingly
describe
themselves
e
g
mitchell
while
professional
research
scientists
still
play
a
strong
role
in
designing
and
analyzing
police
experiments
more
of
the
massive
labor
of
organizing
people
to
deliver
good
experiments
is
being
shouldered
by
experienced
police
e
g
telep
mitchell
and
weisburd
many
pracademics
are
launched
on
a
path
to
earn
a
doctoral
degree
some
in
midcareer
and
some
retired
after
years
in
policing
whatever
their
background
they
are
rapidly
increasing
the
numbers
of
people
who
can
produce
good
evidence
on
policing
this
change
is
especially
visible
in
the
united
kingdom
where
cambridge
graduates
form
a
critical
mass
to
pioneer
the
new
model
for
testing
police
practices
this
model
has
made
possible
a
far
greater
volume
of
experimentation
because
police
officers
from
sergeant
to
police
chief
have
designed
and
delivered
their
own
experiments
this
benefit
must
be
weighed
against
important
issues
of
quality
control
in
the
integrity
of
the
random
assignment
the
measures
of
outcomes
and
other
important
issues
even
innovative
solutions
like
an
online
randomizer
ariel
vila
and
sherman
may
pose
surprising
errors
unless
the
experiment
is
closely
monitored
by
a

and

d
issues
in
tracking
police
outputs
and
outcomes
three
key
issues
shape
the
growth
of
tracking
police
outputs
and
outcomes
one
is
how
police
leaders
measure
what
police
officers
do
a
second
is
how
they
compare
measures
of
performance
across
officers
and
units
the
third
is
how
they
use
tracking
data
to
deliver
better
policing
by
evidence
based
management
measuring
what
police
do
for
all
the
progress
that
compstat
has
brought
policing
it
is
striking
how
little
measurement
it
has
used
of
what
police
do
in
for
example
the
philadelphia
police
department
s
compstat
never
reviewed
data
on
where
police
patrolled
where
they
made
arrests
where
they
conducted
stop
and
frisks
or
even
how
many
police
were
scheduled
to
work
by
time
or
day
in
relation
to
the
hourly
frequency
of
crime
in
any
police
district
in
social
science
terms
compstat
was
a
discussion
of
dependent
variables
without
any
review
of
independent
variables
they
discussed
crime
patterns
endlessly
each
week
with
rarely
any
evidence
on
policing
since
then
technologies
such
as
gps
have
made
such
measurement
even
easier
all
that
is
required
is
a
commitment
to
tracking
policing
along
with
crime
and
an
investment
in
information
technology
to
produce
the
data
and
graphics
mapping
police
presence
in
relation
to
crime
harm
for
example
would
produce
an
algorithm
that
could
identify
outliers
wherever
a
patrol
district
deployed
its
patrols
or
arrests
in
too
great
a
departure
from
the
occurrence
of
crime
a
list
of
such
exceptions
can
be
generated
for
police
managers
if
they
fail
to
correct
the
discrepancies
the
lists
can
be
reviewed
in
aggregate
at
compstat
meetings
comparing
police
performance
one
reason
police
activity
is
undermeasured
may
be
the
risk
of
making
inappropriate
comparisons
with
disciplinary
implications
the
number
of
arrests
per
officer
for
example
is
likely
to
be
much
higher
in
certain
areas
than
in
others
if
only
because
there
is
more
crime
per
square
foot
in
some
areas
yet
there
are
many
ways
to
adjust
for
these
differences
in
order
to
create
fair
comparisons
across
officers
and
units
the
critical
tool
for
fair
comparisons
is
a
risk
model
for
each
policing
area
such
a
model
can
be
computed
on
the
basis
of
any
large
sample
such
as
the
hundreds
of
local
policing
areas
in
england
and
wales
the
models
can
address
both
police
outputs
and
outcomes
using
social
economic
and
demographic
data
the
models
can
forecast
how
much
work
police
will
be
asked
to
do
reactively
by
citizens
and
how
much
work
they
may
choose
to
initiate
proactively
in
relation
to
social
conditions
the
models
can
estimate
how
many
calls
will
be
dispatched
how
many
arrests
may
be
made
and
even
how
much
force
police
will
use
with
how
much
injury
to
citizens
and
police
once
a
risk
model
is
found
to
be
reliable
in
forecasting
outputs
or
outcomes
it
can
detect
major
changes
in
delivery
of
those
measures
over
what
was
predicted
if
police
produce
more
proactive
work
than
predicted
or
less
the
model
can
say
so
this
could
be
done
in
a
way
that
could
confirm
or
disprove
the
success
of
an
area
commander
in
delivering
specific
changes
in
police
patrols
arrests
problems
solved
or
any
objective
for
police
outputs
the
greatest
benefit
of
a
fair
comparisons
model
would
be
to
link
changes
in
outputs
to
changes
in
crime
harm
chi
within
a
range
of
error
these
models
can
forecast
the
likely
chi
or
chi
per
capita
in
each
area
for
each
year
if
a
change
in
outputs
appears
linked
to
changes
in
chi
outcomes
then
police
leaders
can
begin
to
develop
skill
in
relating
these
two
tools
at
a
strategic
level
in
contrast
if
there
is
no
change
in
outputs
but
the
chi
gets
worse
that
can
be
taken
as
evidence
of
sudden
changes
in
social
conditions
rather
than
as
a
failure
of
policing
if
police
outputs
worsen
and
the
chi
rises
that
can
be
taken
as
evidence
that
police
failures
actually
caused
an
increase
in
harm
this
kind
of
macro
level
strategic
management
is
already
the
substance
of
discussion
in
many
compstat
meetings
what
it
lacks
is
any
kind
of
evidence
base
there
are
a
few
published
studies
for
example
of
the
effect
of
the
ratio
of
arrests
to
crime
output
on
crime
rates
outcome
themselves
tittle
and
rowe
brown
chamlin
but
they
would
quickly
be
replaced
by
current
studies
within
large
police
agencies
better
evidence
could
lead
to
better
strategic
decisions
with
less
crime
harm
as
a
result
delivering
policing
with
evidence
based
management
the
greatest
value
of
measuring
police
performance
comes
from
leaders
taking
immediate
corrective
action
all
too
often
police
leaders
are
flying
blind
about
whether
policies
or
operations
are
being
implemented
tracking
evidence
provides
independent
audits
on
a
timely
basis
about
whether
the
plans
are
being
delivered
if
they
are
not
then
commanders
can
be
transferred
and
tighter
control
can
be
imposed
if
they
are
then
rewards
can
be
given
and
medals
can
be
pinned
the
use
of
tracking
to
focus
on
implementation
can
have
major
consequences
for
example
there
is
much
controversy
about
whether
stop
and
questioning
in
minority
areas
reduces
crime
by
using
tracking
evidence
for
deciding
whether
stop
and
question
has
been
reducing
robberies
in
minority
group
areas
a
police
leader
can
ask
to
have
stop
and
question
encounters
plotted
against
robberies
if
the
answer
is
that
very
few
stops
have
actually
been
done
the
leader
can
take
stronger
action
to
ensure
that
the
policy
is
carried
out
if
the
policy
has
been
delivered
the
leader
can
ask
what
level
of
crime
reduction
is
needed
to
be
cost
effective
at
the
same
time
tracking
may
raise
the
question
of
police
legitimacy
are
complaints
up
since
stops
have
increased
are
public
surveys
needed
should
people
who
have
been
stopped
be
interviewed
to
assess
their
reactions
should
training
be
refreshed
on
how
to
speak
to
suspects
tracking
can
often
raise
questions
that
would
otherwise
never
be
asked
asking
them
could
in
turn
substantially
improve
service
delivery
tracking
methods
can
even
be
subjected
to
testing
for
outcomes
in
a
dallas
experiment
for
example
weisburd
groff
and
yang
randomly
assigned
gps
information
to
some
middle
managers
and
not
others
showing
how
much
time
officers
were
spending
in
their
assigned
hot
spots
the
experiment
suggested
that
the
assignment
of
that
information
led
to
less
crime
in
the
high
crime
hot
spots
other
experiments
with
tracking
systems
could
profitably
use
similar
designs
across
police
districts
across
patrol
beats
or
even
in
large
police
agencies
such
as
india
s
or
chile
s
with
hundreds
of
police
stations
across
police
districts
themselves
e
connecting
the
three
ts
thinking
of
triple
t
as
a
triangle
may
allow
police
leaders
to
think
about
evidence
in
a
more
integrated
way
agencies
can
use
the
triangle
to
design
checklists
of
all
the
numbers
that
must
be
examined
simultaneously
in
ebp
like
the
pilots
who
look
at
all
the
dials
on
the
dashboard
of
a
b
cockpit
police
leaders
must
be
aware
of
multiple
sources
of
threat
to
smooth
performance
when
all
three
ts
are
able
to
be
seen
at
once
the
combined
triple
t
can
become
a
dynamic
process
targets
can
be
adjusted
as
crime
goes
down
on
some
targets
and
rises
on
others
tested
treatments
can
change
as
the
types
of
targets
shift
and
tracking
may
look
at
different
delivery
indicators
as
both
targets
and
practices
shift
fig
no
police
agency
stands
still
for
a
day
let
alone
for
a
year
plan
triple
t
is
a
plan
for
a
plan
for
a

the

process
of
triple
t
connecting
the
ts
may
be
the
best
response
to
a
major
challenge
to
ebp
quantitatively
derived
conclusions
are
often
hard
to
sell
when
the
conclusion
directly
challenges
conventional
thinking
acceptance
of
evidence
requires
nothing
less
than
a
culture
change
this
phenomenon
has
been
observed
repeatedly
in
medicine
giluk
and
rynes
weller
baseball
lewis
and
politics
issenberg
yet
these
cases
also
offer
much
hope
that
experience
and
evidence
can
work
together
silver
chap
that
is
what
can
happen
to
make
culture
change
more
likely
to
succeed
the
open
window
may
be
a
need
to
cut
budgets
and
to
do
more
with
less
by
connecting
policy
decisions
on
tested
services
with
policy
decisions
on
what
to
target
police
leaders
can
develop
a
clear
dialogue
about
hard
choices
operational
police
may
accuse
them
of
robbing
peter
to
pay
paul
as
if
all
priorities
are
of
equal
importance
but
the
use
of
evidence
to
make
those
decisions
can
disprove
that
claim
by
combining
the
seriousness
of
the
harm
being
targeted
with
the
effectiveness
of
the
police
practice
being
considered
for
a
target
police
leaders
can
compare
two
different
choices
for
their
likely
cost
benefit
ratios
if
spending
can
yield
a
percent
reduction
in
the
harm
of
a
robbery
pattern
but
only
a
percent
reduction
in
the
harm
of
a
burglary
pattern
the
better
choice
may
seem
obvious
it
is
not
the
key
evidence
in
such
a
choice
would
be
the
absolute
levels
of
harm
associated
with
the
burglary
pattern
and
the
robbery
pattern
creating
or
using
such
a
metric
is
not
routinely
done
in
ebp
yet
but
it
could
be
the
key
to
pulling
triple
t
into
a
viable
operating
system
that
key
is
the
idea
of
a
crime
harm
index
which
may
ultimately
be
the
key
to
sustaining
ebp
iv
future
prospects
for
evidence
in
policing
the
best
way
to
predict
your
future
is
to
create
it
attributed
to
abraham
lincoln
by
more
people
than
ever
before
were
trying
to
create
the
future
of
evidence
based
policing
the
society
of
evidence
based
policing
had
over
members
the
new
professional
college
of
policing
had
a
mandate
from
the
uk
government
to
develop
and
share
evidence
on
what
works
in
policing
the
george
mason
university
center
for
evidence
based
crime
policy
joined
with
the
scottish
institute
of
police
research
to
communicate
ebp
to
policy
makers
in
washington
newly
elected
police
and
crime
commissioners
in
england
and
wales
organized
an
all
day
seminar
at
cambridge
university
to
gain
an
introduction
to
the
evidence
on
policing
over
percent
of
senior
leaders
at
scotland
yard
said
they
had
at
least
heard
of
ebp
stanko
yet
the
same
study
at
scotland
yard
found
that
percent
of
its
leaders
said
they
would
not
change
a
policy
if
the
evidence
showed
it
did
not
work
stanko
many
if
not
most
operational
police
officers
remained
skeptical
that
research
could
help
improve
policing
laws
in
the
majority
of
us
states
as
of
still
required
police
to
make
arrests
when
evidence
shows
that
they
would
only
increase
crime
rather
than
prevent
it
sherman
a
evidence
based
policing
in
still
had
a
long
way
to
go
as
kahneman
and
others
have
documented
our
intuitive
preference
for
fast
thinking
with
an
emotional
system
i
will
always
cause
resistance
to
conclusions
based
on
more
comprehensive
slow
thinking
by
our
system
ii
reasoning
which
system
will
win
depends
on
a
larger
cultural
struggle
for
the
branding
of
policing
as
a
complex
profession
for
those
who
take
lincoln
s
advice
seriously
it
may
be
useful
to
suggest
ways
to
create
a
stronger
future
for
using
evidence
in
policing
the
suggestions
are
speculations
informed
by
a
deep
engagement
in
the
context
the
kind
of
experience
that
is
essential
for
making
the
best
use
of
evidence
the
suggestions
aim
at
institutional
decisions
as
the
outcomes
but
they
are
also
aimed
at
the
individuals
whose
actions
can
make
institutions
change
their
policies
the
key
institutions
are
the
college
of
policing
in
the
united
kingdom
the
state
police
officer
standards
and
training
boards
in
the
united
states
the
australian
institute
for
police
management
and
the
australia
new
zealand
policing
advisory
agency
these
are
all
professionally
driven
institutions
with
governmental
funding
capable
of
making
substantial
changes
in
the
incentives
and
organizational
culture
for
better
use
of
research
evidence
until
recently
they
were
largely
unconnected
to
the
academic
community
but
the
invention
of
a
new
professional
body
in
the
cradle
of
anglo
celtic
policing
is
committed
to
forging
that
connection
with
a
working
agenda
for
police
university
relationships
it
is
not
impossible
that
professional
bodies
in
other
countries
may
follow
suit
unless
otherwise
indicated
each
suggestion
below
is
aimed
at
the
institutions
named
above
a
graduate
level
education
in
evidence
based
policing
should
be
required
for
all
chief
police
executives
starting
at
the
top
is
a
path
of
least
resistance
from
police
labor
organizations
and
an
ideal
first
step
toward
a
total
evidence
strategy
of
the
kind
scotland
yard
has
adopted
police
commissioner
sir
bernard
hogan
howe
who
approved
that
plan
not
only
has
a
master
of
business
administration
and
a
law
degree
but
also
completed
the
graduate
level
cambridge
police
executive
programme
that
teaches
evidence
in
policing
a
graduate
level
knowledge
of
evidence
based
policing
should
be
required
for
all
police
managers
at
ranks
equivalent
to
chief
inspectors
in
uk
policing
and
captains
in
the
new
york
or
los
angeles
police
an
early
second
step
toward
a
culture
of
evidence
in
policing
would
be
to
focus
ambitious
officers
on
the
first
major
step
to
police
command
knowing
that
research
evidence
is
constantly
growing
could
foster
a
habit
of
keeping
up
a
habit
that
may
continue
even
after
completing
a
degree
or
taking
an
exam
or
doing
whatever
is
established
as
the
requirement
for
promotion
to
that
level
most
important
may
be
the
substantial
impact
this
requirement
would
have
on
the
demand
for
graduate
education
promotion
to
first
line
supervision
e
g
sergeant
should
be
based
in
equal
parts
on
knowledge
of
the
law
and
of
the
evidence
on
what
works
in
policing
perhaps
some
time
after
the
first
two
suggestions
are
adopted
a
cultural
familiarity
with
ebp
will
ease
a
transition
to
changing
the
content
of
promotional
examinations
once
knowledge
of
evidence
becomes
essential
for
any
promotion
at
all
in
policing
it
will
greatly
broaden
the
incentive
to
study
evidence
and
use
it
in
police
operational
decisions
research
could
even
be
cited
in
arrest
reports
and
court
testimony
thereby
promoting
a
stronger
public
image
of
the
complex
knowledge
police
must
master
completion
of
probation
at
the
end
of
police
recruit
training
should
be
based
on
an
examination
that
includes
equal
parts
on
knowledge
of
the
law
and
of
the
evidence
on
what
works
in
policing
once
ebp
becomes
an
expected
part
of
promotional
examinations
it
will
be
less
difficult
to
add
it
to
the
final
requirement
for
permanent
police
officer
status
if
that
concept
itself
survives
it
will
also
enhance
the
use
of
evidence
in
police
operations
since
officers
at
all
rank
levels
would
then
be
tested
on
their
knowledge
it
would
also
mean
that
research
evidence
would
have
to
be
taught
in
police
recruit
schools
police
professionals
at
all
ranks
should
be
able
to
achieve
international
certification
of
advanced
knowledge
by
an
exam
based
fellowship
of
the
college
of
policing
to
be
designated
an
fcp
the
practice
of
advanced
testing
of
highly
skilled
practitioners
is
well
established
in
medicine
and
other
professions
us
doctors
have
an
equivalent
process
of
becoming
board
certified
since
the
sixteenth
century
british
professional
colleges
have
been
administering
such
examinations
and
certifying
knowledge
for
people
from
all
over
the
world
online
educational
preparation
will
make
such
examinations
even
easier
to
pass
providing
free
access
to
knowledge
worldwide
universities
should
create
faculties
of
policing
that
would
eventually
operate
like
medical
schools
the
growth
of
demand
for
police
evidence
requires
far
greater
commitment
by
universities
to
this
kind
of
public
service
the
rise
of
pracademics
makes
it
even
more
important
since
the
technical
support
they
need
to
do
experiments
at
a
high
standard
will
grow
rapidly
academic
positions
in
faculties
of
policing
should
include
clinical
lectureships
and
professorships
modeled
on
those
in
medical
schools
in
which
academics
split
their
time
equally
between
working
on
police
operational
matters
and
teaching
research
activity
in
the
university
by
investing
in
partial
funding
of
clinical
professorships
police
agencies
or
the
institutions
named
above
could
speed
up
the
process
of
creating
more
police
faculties
promotion
to
senior
police
posts
as
with
senior
medical
positions
should
require
demonstrated
achievements
in
research
and
teaching
within
the
profession
this
suggestion
builds
on
the
recommendations
of
the
uk
home
secretary
may
it
could
be
achieved
with
evidence
of
publications
in
peer
reviewed
journals
or
teaching
in
university
faculties
or
police
training
institutions
the
college
of
policing
uk
should
create
a
global
example
of
a
process
for
approving
and
recommending
evidence
based
police
practices
engaging
police
leaders
at
all
ranks
with
researchers
victims
and
others
affected
by
police
policies
in
deciding
what
works
when
and
for
whom
the
transparency
of
evidence
is
a
hallmark
of
science
just
as
openness
to
public
demands
is
a
hallmark
of
policing
the
model
of
the
process
used
by
the
united
kingdom
s
national
institute
for
health
and
clinical
evidence
is
one
that
can
be
widely
adopted
sherman
every
nation
should
develop
its
own
inventory
of
evidence
based
practices
based
on
its
own
domestic
police
research
international
research
approved
practices
of
the
college
of
policing
and
a
list
of
similar
institutions
in
other
nations
once
a
process
is
adopted
to
review
evidence
for
policy
decisions
the
dearth
of
such
evidence
in
most
countries
will
become
clear
there
is
no
point
in
american
police
research
providing
the
only
evidence
for
policing
in
new
zealand
india
or
hong
kong
each
and
every
country
may
have
its
own
social
and
cultural
context
that
affects
the
transportability
of
evidence
of
what
works
the
only
way
to
be
certain
of
how
police
practices
work
in
each
country
is
to
test
those
practices
in
that
country
since
the
twenty
first
century
began
the
pace
at
which
police
use
evidence
has
grown
geometrically
that
pace
could
still
slow
reverse
or
be
crippled
by
a
hijacking
of
the
meaning
of
evidence
in
police
practice
but
if
even
half
the
suggestions
offered
here
are
adopted
evidence
based
policing
will
continue
to
grow
that
trend
may
ultimately
provide
many
tangible
benefits
to
police
officers
making
their
work
more
legitimate
and
meaningful
a
majority
of
neither
police
nor
the
public
may
ever
accept
or
even
understand
the
benefits
of
evidence
but
popularity
is
not
the
right
test
for
the
success
of
ebp
the
sole
test
is
whether
it
benefits
the
public
all
the
evidence
suggests
that
it
will
appendix
the
resources
for
locating
external
tests
of
police
services
are
growing
rapidly
in
the
past
decade
the
campbell
collaboration
hosted
by
the
norwegian
government
has
completed
over
systematic
reviews
of
multiple
tests
of
practices
relevant
to
crime
and
policing
a
systematic
review
in
this
context
is
a
comprehensive
inventory
of
all
possible
tests
of
a
specific
practice
which
then
examines
the
pattern
of
results
to
conclude
whether
the
program
is
effective
where
it
has
already
been
tested
the
results
in
other
countries
do
not
necessarily
predict
results
in
all
countries

in

the

sgt

said
instead
of
driving
around
like
drone
bees
predictive
policing
programs
like
this
one
used
for
now
only
for
property
crimes
are
a
harbinger
of
how
for
better
or
worse
police
officers
across
the
country
are
relying
on
the
data
analytics
business
seattle
is
at
the
center
of
this
experiment
the
city
s
license
plate
readers
record
the
movement
of
vehicles
information
that
is
then
stored
in
a
vast
database
to
be
tapped
later
in
criminal
investigations
its
red
light
cameras
record
traffic
violations
and
issue
tickets
though
unlike
many
other
municipalities
seattle
requires
a
police
officer
to
vet
each
citation
the
police
department
uses
twitter
that
rushing
stream
of
data
as
its
crime
blotter
letting
residents
report
possible
crimes
in
their
neighborhoods
and
starting
in
july
the
seattle
police
will
use
a
similar
software
program
to
predict
where
gun
violence
is
likely
to
occur
the
department
even
procured
an
unmanned
drone
equipped
with
a
video
camera
to
take
aerial
shots
but
the
plan
was
halted
after
residents
raised
concerns
about
privacy
where
technology
has
caught
up
is
to
allow
police
to
ask
questions
about
what
s
happening
in
their
jurisdictions
and
to
be
able
to
understand
temporal
patterns
spatial
patterns
said
joel
m
caplan
assistant
professor
of
criminal
justice
at
rutgers
university
in
new
jersey
who
has
developed
a
crime
forecasting
program
with
his
colleagues
and
is
testing
it
at
a
half
dozen
police
agencies
critics
say
that
surveillance
technologies
carry
risks
to
civil
liberties
and
that
predictive
policing
in
particular
can
additionally
perpetuate
a
self
fulfilling
cycle
of
bias
that
is
to
say
an
area
with
historically
high
rates
of
crime
gets
greater
police
attention
which
results
in
more
arrests
which
in
turn
the
algorithm
uses
to
deem
that
neighborhood
an
area
where
crime
is
more
likely
to
occur
it
comes
with
inherent
biases
and
prejudices
that
can
be
worse
than
the
help
it
offers
said
jason
m
schultz
who
studies
the
privacy
implications
of
new
technologies
at
the
school
of
law
at
the
university
of
california
berkeley
it
kind
of
reinforces
its
own
data
by
redirecting
resources
to
those
areas
because
predictive
policing
is
still
in
its
infancy
there
is
little
independent
evidence
to
suggest
whether
data
mining
in
law
enforcement
is
really
effective
but
for
companies
that
make
the
analytics
tools
it
is
already
a
large
and
fast
growing
market
for
instance
i
b
m
which
has
spent
billions
of
dollars
in
the
last
year
acquiring
analytics
start
ups
offers
a
software
package
of
its
own
for
predictive
policing
its
social
media
analytics
tool
can
be
used
by
police
agencies
to
vet
facebook
and
twitter
chatter
and
its
coplink
software
allows
one
investigating
police
agency
to
mine
another
s
crime
data
to
track
down
a
wanted
person
police
officials
in
mesa
ariz
said
they
used
this
technology
to
find
a
man
suspected
of
murder
who
was
picked
up
for
jaywalking
hundreds
of
miles
away
microsoft
teamed
up
with
the
new
york
police
department
to
develop
one
of
the
most
ambitious
crime
analytics
tools
in
the
world
known
as
the
domain
awareness
system
it
can
analyze
video
from
the
more
than
police
surveillance
cameras
across
the
city
and
comb
through
a
variety
of
other
databases
from
license
plate
readers
to
sensors
that
can
pick
up
heightened
radiation
levels
to
arrest
records
in
announcing
the
program
last
august
the
police
said
it
could
for
instance
find
a
car
associated
with
a
possible
crime
or
lawbreaker
and
analyze
where
that
car
had
been
seen
over
the
last
several
weeks
law
enforcement
agencies
especially
gang
units
mine
social
networks
like
facebook
and
twitter
to
gather
intelligence
on
criminal
networks
the
department
of
homeland
security
uses
an
analytics
tool
that
combs
through
twitter
for
key
words
that
might
signal
trouble
the
list
includes
pipe
bomb
plume
and
listeria
seattle
s
predictive
policing
program
grew
out
of
an
earlier
experiment
in
data
analytics
it
began
with
a
software
program
that
culled
calls
from
the
previous
week
identified
crime
hot
spots
and
assigned
officers
to
patrol
each
one
for
at
least
minutes
every
hour
not
all
calls
turn
out
to
be
about
criminal
activity
though
and
the
department
cut
back
on
the
practice
of
these
so
called
directed
patrols
earlier
this
year
seattle
bought
a
new
software
package
known
as
predpol
short
for
predictive
policing
and
developed
by
academics
at
the
university
of
california
los
angeles
it
initially
deployed
the
software
in
two
precincts
and
in
may
announced
its
expansion
citywide
acting
lt
bryan
grenon
said
it
was
too
early
to
know
whether
it
was
working
in
any
case
property
crimes
have
plummeted
in
seattle
in
the
last
year
by
as
much
as
percent
predpol
according
to
p
jeffrey
brantingham
a
u
c
l
a
anthropologist
who
helped
develop
it
does
not
rely
just
on
the
previous
day
or
previous
week
s
incidents
it
looks
at
both
short
term
and
long
term
patterns
in
property
crimes
he
said
and
uses
a
proprietary
algorithm
to
weigh
their
relative
importance
and
forecast
risk
in
the
next
few
hours
it
has
been
used
by
other
police
agencies
including
those
in
los
angeles
and
santa
cruz
it
has
not
been
independently
tested
sometimes
his
algorithm
has
a
pretty
good
idea
of
where
someone
might
cause
trouble
but
not
necessarily
what
kind
in
late
may

in

tiny
patch
of
downtown
that
is

liquor
stores

enough
there
was
a
robbery
right
there
though
not
one
that
a
computer

could
have

violent
crime
in
the
city
of
los

fell
for
the
th
year
in
a
row
to
its
lowest
level
in
decades
even
as
property
crime
reversed
its
downward
trend
and
posted
a
slight
uptick
the
mayor
and
police
chief
announced
monday
our
data
shows
that
in
los
angeles
had
the
fewest
violent
crimes
per
capita
than
any
big
city
in
the
united
states
of
america
mayor
antonio
villaraigosa
said
during
a
news
conference
last
year
there
was
a
citywide
reduction
in
robbery
aggravated
assault
burglary
and
auto
theft
and
for
the
third
year
in
a
row
we
saw
fewer
than
homicides
he
added
police
chief
charlie
beck
said
the
violent
crimes
recorded
in
represented
an
percent
slide
from
the
year
before
statistics
showed
significant
decreases
in
robbery
and
aggravated
assault
offset
increases
in
rape
and
homicide
this
is
the
lowest
violent
crime
level
in
the
city
of
los
angeles
since
william
parker
was
chief
of
the
lapd
in
the
s
and
s
beck
said
he
added
a
percent
drop
in
gang
related
crimes
overall
helped
drive
the
numbers
down
noting
the
gang
related
homicides
last
year
were
the
fewest
in
decades
the
city
however
saw
property
crimes
increase
for
the
first
time
in
years
though
by
only
percent
for
a
total
of
thefts
burglaries
and
carjackings
beck
blamed
the
uptick
on
a
percent
increase
in
cellphone
thefts
in
particular
and
he
urged
the
public
to
take
precautions
to
prevent
their
various
electronic
gadgets
from
being
stolen
lock
it
hide
it
and
you
ll
keep
it
he
advised
put
the
responsibility
on
yourself
for
keeping
your
property
safe
if
you
do
that
then
i
can
continue
to
reduce
crime
in
the
city
of
los
angeles
beck
also
attributed
some
of
the
increase
in
property
crime
to
realignment
which
took
effect
in
october
that
law
backed
by
gov
jerry
brown
included
a
provision
that
placed
certain
ex
cons
on
probation
instead
of
parole
when
realignment
was
originally
announced
i
predicted
property
crime
would
increase
in
los
angeles
by
a
couple
of
percentage
points
because
of
it
and
i
believe
that
has
occurred
he
said
calling
for
the
law
to
be
tweaked
so
that
police
can
monitor
ex
cons
more
closely
taken
together
the
overall
drop
in
violent
crimes
and
property
crimes
in
was
percent
the
smallest
percentage
decline
in
the
last
five
years
in
during
the
recession
overall
crimes
receded
percent
in
the
drop
was
percent
beck
however
bristled
at
the
observation
that
last
year
s
percent
drop
in
the
overall
crime
rate
did
not
seem
up
to
par
you
re
minimizing
something
that
is
a
remarkable
achievement
he
said
why
don
t
you
ask
the
other
cities
that
had
an
increase
why
don
t
you
ask
new
york
chicago
the
county
of
los
angeles
if
they
would
like
to
have
percent
villaraigosa
whose
term
ends
in
june
said
he
hopes
the
incoming
mayor
whoever
it
may
be
will
make
the
continued
hiring
of
police
officers
a
priority
he
said
the
lapd
recently
hit
a
milestone
when
its
ranks
swelled
to
but
added
los
angeles
remains
the
most
underpoliced
big
city
in
the
country
he
refused
to
back
a
proposed
ballot
measure
to
boost
the
sales
tax
if
the
lapd
is
not
allowed
to
continue
growing
there
is
no
way
i
would
support
a
sales
tax
if
we
don
t
continue
police
hiring
villaraigosa
said
these
numbers
the
declining
crime
rates
don
t
lie
he
added
these
numbers
are
a
reflection
of
growing
our
police
department
of
our
commitment
to
community
policing
beck
vowed
the
lapd
would
continue
to
lower
crime
rates
by
remaining
data
driven
in
its
crime
suppression
strategies
and
by
working
closely
with
the
mayor
s
gang
reduction
and
youth
development
office
he
also
vowed
to
expand
predictive
policing
which
uses
logarithms
to
predict
where
crime
will
occur
and
to
control
the
response
of
officers
as
well
as
more
officers
long
term
to
the
toughest
parts
of
the
city
so
they
can
form
deep
partnerships
with
the
communities
there
he
also
intends
to
continue
operation
ceasefire
which
calls
for
talking
to
gang
members
so
they
know
the
consequences
of
continued
violent
crimes
and
operation
laser
which
closely
tracks
people
who
have
committed
violent
crimes
in
the
past
and
are
likely
to
do
so

santa

police
wednesday
arrested
a
man
on
beach
street
during
a
predictive
check
the
day
was
billed
as
international
predictive

day
of
action
with
police
in
kent
england
and
los

sharing
locations
with
residents
to
try

police
apprehended
a

old
man
on
suspicion
of
being
drunk
in
public
and
carrying
a
concealed
knife
both
misdemeanors
police
said
it
was
a
small
illustration
of
the
idea
at
work
our
goal
today
is
not
to
arrest
a
lot
of
people
it
s
to
prevent
the
crime
from
happening
said
santa
cruz
police
chief
kevin
vogel
i
m
exceptionally
proud
that
we
were
the
first
ones
to
do
this
launched
in
the
program
essentially
uses
historical
data
of
the
time
and
location
of
burglaries
and
thefts
and
uses
an
algorithm
to
predict
future
crime
when
officers
are
not
responding
to
other
calls
they
are
asked
to
patrol
in
those
areas
wednesday
some
residents
gathered
at
places
such
as
lower
ocean
street
and
lincoln
and
chestnut
streets
which
were
predicted
to
have
a
higher
likelihood
of
burglary
vehicle
burglary
or
vehicle
theft
it
s
almost
like
neighborhood
watch
in
the
next
century
said
santa
cruz
deputy
police
chief
steve
clark
clark
said
police
have
not
tracked
the
number
of
arrests
that
have
come
from
the
extra
checks
as
police
often
call
them
yet
he
said
that
once
or
twice
a
week
an
officer
on
a
predictive
policing
check
has
either
talked
to
a
suspicious
person
received
information
on
another
case
or
made
an
arrest
the
arrests
have
not
been
associated
with
major
crimes
such
as
murders
or
robberies
but
they
have
helped
to
solve
burglaries
and
put
police
in
places
they
might
not
think
to
patrol
it
s
been
a
tool
that
officers
have
added
to
their
natural
intuition
clark
said
predictive
examples
one
night
in
for
instance
officers
were
on
an
extra
check
near
windham
street
when
they
talked
to
a
man
who
had
more
than
four
gps
units
on
him
no
one
s
that
lost
clark
said
through
more
investigation
we
wrapped
up
several
auto
burglary
cases
off
that
last
year
near
north
branciforte
and
goss
avenues
police
stopped
a
bicyclist
and
recognized
him
as
a
drug
user
he
wore
a
ncaa
basketball
ring
and
didn
t
look
like
a
basketball
player
police
later
linked
it
to
a
burglary
and
returned
it
clark
s
favorite
example
is
that
of
a
santa
cruz
beat
cop
who
was
eating
his
lunch
in
his
patrol
car
in
a
downtown
parking
lot
because
it
was
on
that
shift
s
predictive
list
he
spotted
two
women
trying
to
break
into
cars
and
arrested
them
for
neighborhood
leaders
like
deborah
elston
the
list
of
predictive
policing
addresses
distributed
to
neighbors
on
wednesday
were
not
a
big
surprise
they
included
five
areas
in
the
lower
ocean
street
neighborhood
as
well
as
the
block
of
beach
street
and
near
seabright
avenue
and
murray
street
elston
was
pleased
that
the
list
was
shared
with
neighbors
and
she
encouraged
residents
to
be
aware
of
suspicious
people
and
problems
like
graffiti
which
can
lead
to
more
crime
when
you
make
the
call
to
report
suspicious
activity
you
never
know
what
you
re
preventing
elston
said
although
many
factors
go
in
to
crime
trends
overall
reported
crime
dropped
more
than
percent
in
june
and
july
compared
with
june
and
july
according
to
police
for
instance
there
were
reported
burglaries
in
the
city
in
july
down
from
in
july
elston
said
she
understood
it
might
be
difficult
to
quantify
the
success
of
predictive
policing
because
crime
could
have
been
prevented
by
the
presence
of
an
officer
or
neighbor
the
person
trying
door
handles
on
cars
to
steal
things
might
have
gone
elsewhere
for
instance
yet
she
said
that
twice
in
the
first
few
months
of
the
predictive
program
she
had
her
cellphone
out
to
call
for
a
suspicious
person
when
an
officer
on
an
extra
check
arrived
one
time
was
on
the
san
lorenzo
river

when
an
officer
rolled
up
to
her
she

nick

the
morning
watch
at
the
los

police
department
s
foothill
division
begins
at
am
when
the
shift
s
officers
gather
for
roll
call
and
a
briefing
the
dozen
or
so
officers
are
briefed
on
incidents
from
the
previous
shift
and
on
any
offenders
or
vehicles
they
might
be
looking
for
then
each
team
is
a
handed
a
simple
a
map
warm
from
an
office
printer
they
don
t
look
like
much
but
the
maps
are
the
result
of
more
than
half
a
decade
s
work
by
anthropologists
and
mathematicians
from
two
leading
american
universities
marked
on
the
maps
are
a
series
of
red
boxes
outlining
metre
long
squares
superimposed
over
the

they
will
patrol
the
boxes
indicate
with
spooky
accuracy
where
the
division
s
most
common
crimes
are
most
likely
to
be
committed
during
the
hour
shift
the
predictive
policing
project
or
pred
pol
as
it
has
become
known
has
been
so
successful
in
cutting
crime
rates
since
it
was
tested
in
foothill
in
that
it
has
spread
to
seven
other
la
police
divisions
with
more
to
come
twenty
or
so
police
departments
across
the
us
have
signed
on
as
have
departments
in
britain
it
is
understood
at
least
one
australian
force
is
in
talks
to
sign
up
a
driving
force
behind
pred
pol
is
dr
jeff
brantingham
an
anthropologist
at
the
university
of
california
los
angeles
ucla
the
standard
measure
of
accuracy
for
crime
prediction
is
he
says
multiplications
of
random
existing
techniques
are
usually
effective
about
three
times
random
pred
pol
is
twice
as
effective
accurate
to
six
times
random
and
it
is
likely
to
improve
brantingham
says
the
key
insight
that
informed
early
work
on
pred
pol
was
to
tackle
crime
prediction
via
mathematics
rather
than
the
social
sciences
usually
crime
analysts
look
at
crime
patterns
with
social
and
geographical
factors
they
would
look
at
a
particular
area
s
crime
history
demographic
make
up
the
location
of
transport
and
late
opening
bars
pred
pol
strips
all
that
away
it
simply
feeds
three
different
factors
crime
type
time
and
location
through
the
dizzyingly
sophisticated
equations
and
algorithms
the
team
has
created
the
problem
with
considering
how
many
open
bars
there
are
is
that
it
misses
the
point
brantingham
says
the
key
information
is
the
number
of
assaults
or
robberies
and
you
already
know
that
the
team
began
in
by
considering
crime
through
a
spatial
rather
than
social
lens
if
you
consider
a
potential
criminal
and
a
potential
target
to
be
atoms
floating
in
a
body
of
fluid
what
factors
would
cause
them
to
meet
and
how
and
when
and
what
other
factors
might
interrupt
that
meeting
working
with
brantingham
ucla
s
applied
mathematics
department
began
investigating
models
that
described
events
such
as
chemical
reactions
and
the
way
substances
diffuse
in
fluid
even
fish
migration
predictions
were
discussed
soon
the
los
angeles
police
had
become
involved
brantingham
had
asked
for
access
to
crime
data
and
had
feared
he
might
be
met
with
suspicion
instead
the
department
threw
itself
into
the
project
at
the
time
the
police
suffered
from
an
awkward
problem
crime
was
falling
across
the
city
and
had
been
for
a
few
years
the
city
that
had
registered
murders
in
a
single
year
two
decades
ago
lost
just
of
its
citizens
to
violence
in
when
it
became
the
safest
big
city
in
the
us
this
was
good
news
for
citizens
but
it
meant
innovation
was
needed
to
keep
up
the
momentum
then
police
chief
william
bratton
supplied
the
ucla
team
with
data
and
funding
and
assigned
one
of
his
captains
sean
malinowski
to
work
with
them
whenever
anyone
starts
talking
about
data
i
tend
to
get
the
mission
says
malinowski
who
has
a
phd
in
public
policy
the
next
breakthrough
came
when
brantingham
s
collaborator
dr
george
mohler
now
an
assistant
professor
of
mathematics
and
computer
science
at
santa
clara
university
discovered
that
equations
used
in
mapping
the
aftershocks
of
earthquakes
could
be
manipulated
to
map
crime
mohler
s
discovery
had
the
dramatic
effect
of
allowing
the
team
to
quickly
apply
their
theory
and
create
a
working
model
of
pred
pol
before
each
hour
shift
or
watch
begins
in
foothill
a
senior
officer
logs
in
to
pred
pol
and
calls
up
the
maps
for
the
coming
hours
on
a
desktop
computer
recent
and
historical
crime
data
are
run
through
pred
pol
which
prints
out
that
shift
s
crime
boxes
neatly
on
a
google
map
so
far
the
system
predicts
and
maps
only
car
theft
burglary
from
a
car
and
burglary
because
these
constitute
more
than
per
cent
of
crime
the
team
is
working
to
expand
into
gun
crime
and
homicide
in
the
long
run
it
is
feasible
that
the
technology
could
allow
police
to
enter
the
time
and
location
suspects
are
seen
on
the
street
and
instantly
be
fed
background
material
such
as
likely
gang
membership
while
the
science
is
high
tech
andrea
bertozzi
ucla
s
head
of
applied
maths
and
the
lead
mathematician
on
pred
pol
says
the
folded
piece
of
paper
handed
to
officers
is
good
technology
for
its
purpose
when
police
on
patrol
have
time
to
spare
they
are
directed
to
spend
time
in
their
allocated
boxes
the
beauty
is
the
simplicity
they
are
not
distracted
by
interacting
with
new
technology
or
equipment
police
report
that
once
in
their
boxes
they
find
themselves
hyper
alert
malinowski
says
they
take
note
of
who
is
around
they
talk
to
shopkeepers
and
home
owners
they
check
on
suspicious
activity
their
goal
in
the
boxes
is
not
so
much
to
catch
crooks
though
that
has
happened
but
to
suppress
crime
in
a
six
month
test
in
foothill
when
the
division
used
pred
pol
strictly
that
is
pred
pol
alone
was
used
for
crime
prediction
rather
than
in
concert
with
the
department
s
analysts
crime
rates
dropped
by
per
cent
overall
and
per
cent
for
car
theft
in
a
later
six
month
period
when
other
intelligence
types
were
used
crime
rates
rose
he
says
the
results
are
so
dramatic
that
the
force
s
chief
charlie
beck
is
backing
further
research
not
only
to
refine
the
technology
but
to
push
it
into
new
crime
areas
in
effect
malinowski
says
beck
has
so
much
confidence
in
the
model
he
is
allowing
the
researchers
to
use
parts
of
the
city
as
a
laboratory
to
study
crime
prediction

alhambra
the
alhambra
police
department
is
the
first
law
enforcement
agency
in
southern
california
to
fully
implement
predictive
policing
a
cloud
based
software
that
forecasts
areas
where
crimes
are
likely
to
be
committed
some
divisions
in
the
los
angeles
police
department
also
use
predpol
which
was
developed
by
a
team
of
mathematicians
and
social
scientists
at
ucla
santa
clara
university
and
uc
irvine
but
alhambra
has
pioneered
city
wide
implementation
it
s
not
about
predicting
who
is
going
to
commit
a
crime
it
s
about
where
it
creates
an
opportunity
for
police
officers
to
get
in
front
of
those
crimes
and
deter
them
said
co
founder
jeffrey
brantingham
a
ucla
anthropology
professor
this
is
a
way
of
using
the
data
that
the
police
department
already
have
about
where
and
when
crimes
are
occurring
to
essentially
forecast
when
and
where
future
crimes
are
expected
to
occur
predpol
crunches
about
five
years
of
law
breaking
data
to
map
probable
crime
spots
this
policing
algorithm
has
become
a
practical
tool
only
in
the
last
two
years
although
it
has
been
in
development
for
the
last
seven
years
brantingham
said
places
such
as
seattle
and
santa
cruz
already
use
it
and
data
show
that
law
enforcement
officers
perform
six
times
better
when
they
use
predpol
brantingham
said
but
he
emphasized
the
software
is
a
tool
that
is
ineffective
without
skillful
officers
and
the
preemptive
program
does
not
ask
agencies
to
allocate
all
of
their
officers
in
one
neighborhood
while
abandoning
another
because
alhambra
implemented
the
program
about
five
months
ago
police
chief
mark
yokoyama
said
it
s
a
little
too
early
to
see
its
impact
however
when
he
compared
numbers
from
yokoyama
noted
that
residential
theft
has
decreased
by
percent
car
burglaries
by
percent
and
grand
theft
auto
by
percent
since
the
program
started
the
only
difference
between
this
year
and
last
year
is
utilizing
predpol
in
our
policing
strategies
yokoyama
said
at
a
m
and
p
m
daily
his
agency
prints
a
map
that
compares
the
most
up
to
date
crime
statistics
with
historic
figures
to
tell
police
what
by
square
feet
area
they
should
pay
attention
to
predpol
has
made
finding
criminals
easier
yokohama
said
but
he
doubts
the
higher
efficiency
will
lead
to
layoffs
within
his
department
we
still
rely
upon
our
police
officers
intuition
knowledge
and
personal
data
yokoyama
said
predpol
might
tell
us
here
s
an
area
to
focus
on
today
that
may
be
different
from
what
a
police
officer
knows
based
on
hot
spot
data
within
the
last
days
some
alhambra
residents
expressed
reservations
about
the
new
program
kelsea
perez
said
this
new
software
is
a
double
edged
sword
that
can
lead
to
discrimination
it
can
allow
for
the
homeless
who
live
in
this
area
to
be
pushed
away
perez
said
law
enforcement
s
goal
is
prevention
so
they
re
going
to
do
whatever
they
can
grinnell
almy
a
computer
programmer
who
works
in
alhambra
said
he
sees
the
possibility
of
targeting
ethnic
minorities
even
in
a
city
where
about
percent
of
residents
are
asian
whenever
you
use
technology
you
need
to
be
careful
to
guard
against
racial
profiling
he
said
anything
can
be
used
wrongly
you
have
to
be
aware
and
take
it
into
account
brantingham
said
predpol
doesn
t
profile
individuals
since
it
collects
data
only
on
where
and
when
a
type
of
crime
has
happened
it
doesn
t
target
offenders
races
or
the
poor
he
said
yokohama
said
preliminary
results
are
very
promising
and
he
doesn
t
see
any
negatives
in
using
predpol
using
the
software
as
a
guide
police
presence
has
been
increased
in
certain
areas
he
said
it
has
made
our

section
local
length
words
until
its
most
recent
outbreak
of
shootings
and
three
homicides
in
days
salinas
was
on
track
for
the
lowest
level
of
gun
violence
since
shootings
peaked
in
police
say
they
are
frustrated
because
they
are
finally
armed
with
impressive
new
technology
for
predicting
where
and
when
violence
is
likely
to
occur
but
they
have
hardly
been
able
to
use
it
the
city
has
for
months
been
testing
a
predictive
policing
system
called
predpol
to
see
if
it
is
effective
in
forecasting
where
and
when
violent
crime
is
likely
to
occur
after
six
months
use
the
data
show
that
predpol
accurately
predicted
violent
crime
at
levels
percent
higher
than
the
previously
used
method
that
maps
high
crime
hot
spots
predpol
was
used
successfully
in
santa
cruz
county
to
predict
where
property
crimes
such
as
burglaries
are
likely
to
occur
but
until
salinas
agreed
to
try
it
the
system
hadn
t
been
used
to
predict
violent
crime
said
salinas
police
chief
kelly
mcmillin
after
salinas
detroit
adopted
the
system
to
try
to
predict
and
prevent
gun
violence
what
we
re
looking
for
is
a
net
reduction
in
violence
mcmillin
said
until
july
s
sudden
surge
a
summer
phenomenon
not
unusual
in
salinas
the
city
seemed
headed
in
that
direction
shootings
with
victims
until
july
totalled
putting
the
year
on
pace
for
an
annual
total
of
a
percent
drop
from
in
for
years
annual
shooting
counts
have
consistently
hovered
above
except
in
when
the
total
was
for
the
year
a
total
police
attribute
to
aggressive
use
the
year
before
of
the
ceasefire
intervention
strategy
and
police
roundups
such
as
operation
knockout
that
targeted
high
level
criminals
the
city
s
predictive
policing
tool
was
created
by
mathematicians
and
social
scientists
at
university
of
california
los
angeles
santa
clara
university
and
uc
irvine
who
worked
with
crime
analysts
and
officers
at
the
santa
cruz
and
los

police
departments
when
salinas
police
used
the
technology
between
august
and
february
violent
crime
was
accurately
predicted
percent
more
often
than
with
the
old
hot
spot
method
which
relies
only
on
mapping
past
crimes
robberies
were
correctly
predicted
percent
more
often
predpol
s
developers
say
the
technology
does
not
target
or
profile
specific
people
nor
does
it
simply
map
previous
crimes
it
does
study
patterns
demographics
and
other
data
to
produce
constantly
updated
place
based
prediction
boxes
that
salinas
police
review
before
starting
every
shift
but
for
the
system
to
be
effective
as
a
crime
prevention
tool
researchers
say
patrol
officers
should
spend
more
than
two
hours
of
every
hour
shift
in
the
areas
marked

analyzing

another

unveiled
last

by

was
situation

where
they

the

and

radio

with
the

he
said
echoing
his
ongoing
pleas
for

to

another
data
setback
came
last
year
when
the

lost

it
had
just

police
were
working
with

pulls

for

some

here

in

for

in

cities
troubled
by

violence
murder
victims
and
their

were
much

also

mcmillin

indicate
with

accuracy
where
the

most
common

are
most
likely
to
be
committed
during

the
predictive

project
or
pred
pol
as
it
has
become
known
has
been
so
successful
in
cutting
crime
rates
since
it
was
tested
in
foothill
in
that
it
has
spread
to
seven
other
la
police
divisions
with
more
to
come
another
or
so
police
departments
across
the
us
have
signed
on
as
have
departments
in
britain
it
is
understood
at
least
one
australian
force
is
in
talks
to
sign
up
though
its
creators
decline
to
discuss
potential
customers
one
of
the
driving
forces
behind
pred
pol
is
dr
jeff
brantingham
an
anthropologist
at
the
university
of
california
los
angeles
ucla
who
struggled
bravely
to
find
simple
enough
language
to
describe
the
science
behind
the
technology
crime
prediction
is
not
a
new
field
all
street
cops
know
the
crime
hot
spots
on
their
beat
and
larger
police
forces
have
been
employing
crime
analysts
and
software
to
assist
them
for
years
it
has
been
successful
too
the
standard
measure
of
accuracy
for
crime
prediction
is
multiplications
of
random
current
techniques
are
usually
effective
about
three
times
random
pred
pol
is
twice
as
effective
accurate
to
six
times
random
and
it
is
likely
to
improve
brantingham
a
former
archaeologist
who
never
lost
the
interest
in
crime
ingrained
in
him
by
his
criminologist
parents
says
the
key
insight
that
informed
early
work
on
pred
pol
was
to
tackle
crime
prediction
via
mathematics
rather
than
the
social
sciences
usually
crime
analysts
look
at
crime
patterns
combined
with
social
and
geographical
factors
they
would
look
at
a
particular
area
s
crime
history
demographic
make
up
the
location
of
transport
and
late
opening
bars
that
might
attract
potential
crooks
mostly
young
men
and
victims
pred
pol
strips
all
that
away
it
simply
feeds
three
different
factors
crime
type
time
and
location
through
the
dizzyingly
sophisticated
equations
and
algorithms
the
team
has
created
the
problem
with
considering
things
such
as
how
many
open
bars
there
are
is
that
it
misses
the
point
brantingham
says
the
key
information
is
the
number
of
assaults
or
robberies
and
you
already
know
that
the
team
began
in
by
considering
crime
through
a
spatial
rather
than
social
lens
if
you
consider
a
potential
criminal
and
a
potential
target
to
be
for
example
two
atoms
floating
in
a
body
of
fluid
what
factors
would
cause
them
to
meet
and
how
and
when
and
later
what
other
factors
might
interrupt
that
meeting
working
with
brantingham
ucla
s
applied
mathematics
department
began
investigating
models
that
described
events
such
as
chemical
reactions
and
the
way
substances
diffuse
in
fluid
even
fish
migration
predictions
came
up
in
the
discussion
soon
the
lapd
had
become
involved
brantingham
had
appealed
to
the
department
for
access
to
crime
data
and
had
feared
he
might
be
met
with
old
guard
suspicion
instead
the
department
threw
itself
into
the
project
at
the
time
the
lapd
suffered
from
an
awkward
problem
crime
was
falling
relentlessly
across
the
city
and
had
been
for
a
few
years
the
city
that
had
registered
murders
in
a
single
year
two
decades
ago
lost
just
of
its
citizens
to
violence
in
when
it
became
the
safest
big
city
in
the
us
this
was
good
news
for
citizens
but
since
the
only
real
measure
of
a
police
force
s
success
is
lower
year
on
year
crime
rates
it
meant
innovation
was
needed
to
keep
up
the
momentum
as
one
officer
puts
it
all
the
low
hanging
fruit
had
gone
the
then
lapd
chief
william
bratton
not
only
supplied
the
ucla
team
with
any
data
they
asked
for
but
also
assigned
one
of
his
captains
sean
malinowski
to
work
with
them
he
even
kicked
in
extra
funding
whenever
anyone
starts
talking
about
data
i
tend
to
get
the
mission
malinowski
says
this
is
probably
because
the
year
old
cop
has
a
phd
in
public
policy
data
and
statistics
don
t
scare
him
and
he
can
speak
basic
academic
the
next
breakthrough
came
when
brantingham
s
collaborator
dr
george
mohler
now
an
assistant
professor
of
mathematics
and
computer
science
at
santa
clara
university
discovered
that
equations
used
in
mapping
the
aftershocks
of
earthquakes
could
be
manipulated
to
map
crime
mohler
s
discovery
had
the
dramatic
effect
of
allowing
the
team
to
quickly
apply
their
theory
and
create
a
working
model
of
pred
pol
with
hindsight
brantingham
says
the
link
between
seismology
and
crime
makes
sense
research
already
showed
how
criminal
events
caused
their
own
aftershocks
such
as
when
burglars
returned
to
homes
or
streets
where
they
had
already
had
success
before
each
hour
shift
or
watch
begins
in
foothill
a
senior
officer
logs
in
to
pred
pol
with
a
password
and
calls
up
the
maps
for
the
coming
hours
on
a
desktop
computer
software
runs
up
to
date
and
historical
crime
data
through
pred
pol
s
algorithms
and
spits
out
that
shift
s
crime
boxes
which
are
all
printed
neatly
on
a
google
map
the
operator
can
also
pull
up
historical
crime
records
going
back
hours
or
days
weeks
or
months
so
far
the
system
in
use
predicts
and
maps
only
car
theft
burglary
from
a
car
and
burglary
because
these
constitute
more
than
per
cent
of
crime
the
team
is
working
to
expand
into
gun
crime
and
homicide
in
the
long
run
it
is
feasible
that
the
technology
could
allow
police
to
enter
say
the
time
and
location
suspects
are
seen
on
the
street
and
instantly
be
fed
background
material
such
as
what
their
gang
affiliation
is
likely
to
be
and
how
that
gang
fits
into
the
broader
criminal
ecology
of
the
area
the
technology
is
already
so
sophisticated
that
police
on
patrol
could
be
given
their
own
logins
and
pull
up
even
more
detailed
maps
via
smartphones
or
tablets
the
boxes
could
be
ranked
for
risk
and
police
could
even
watch
them
move
slowly
across
the
map
during
the
watch
as
police
attention
focused
on
particular
boxes
they
could
change
colour
as
the
risk
of
crime
abated
with
police
presence
so
far
the
developers
believe
that
could
lead
to
information
overload
police
are
basically
hunters
brantingham
says
should
the
boxes
be
ranked
they
would
focus
on
the
top
tiers
besides
says
andrea
bertozzi
ucla
s
head
of
applied
maths
and
the
lead
mathematician
on
pred
pol
the
folded
piece
of
paper
is
good
technology
for
its
purpose
when
police
on
patrol
have
time
to
spare
they
are
directed
to
spend
time
in
their
allocated
boxes
the
beauty
is
the
simplicity
they
are
not
distracted
by
interacting
with
new
technology
or
equipment
police
report
that
once
in
their
boxes
they
find
themselves
hyper
alert
malinowski
says
they
take
note
of
who
is
around
they
talk
to
shopkeepers
and
home
owners
they
check
on
suspicious
activity
their
goal
in
the
boxes
is
not
so
much
to
catch
crooks
though
that
has
happened
but
to
suppress
crime
malinowski
dismisses
early
criticism
that
the
program
might
simply
diffuse
crime
saying
new
research
showed
that
the
type
of
crooks
they
were
after
such
as
car
thieves
were
opportunistic
and
often
give
up
in
the
face
of
risk
we
are
not
talking
about
committed
criminals
like
a
serial
rapist
he
says
as
brantingham
puts
it
it
is
not
too
hard
to
convince
them
back
home
to
their
xboxes
the
american
criminal
law
review
has
raised
the
concern
that
the
program
could
warp
crime
statistics
either
by
increasing
the
arrest
rate
in
the
boxes
through
extra
policing
or
falsely
reducing
it
through
diffusion
civil
rights
groups
are
taking
the
former
concern
seriously
because
designating
an
area
a
crime
hot
spot
can
be
used
as
a
factor
in
formulating
reasonable
suspicion
for
stopping
a
suspect
malinowski
says
so
far
there
is
no
evidence
of
an
increase
of
civil
rights
complaints
and
the
statistics
clearly
show
crime
is
decreasing
in
a
six
month
test
in
foothill
when
the
division
used
pred
pol
strictly
that
is
pred
pol
alone
was
used
for
crime
prediction
rather
than
in
concert
with
the
department
s
analysts
crime
rates
dropped
by
per
cent
overall
and
per
cent
for
car
theft
in
a
later
six
month
period
when
other
intelligence
types
were
used
crime
rates
rose
he
says
the
results
are
so
dramatic
that
the
force
s
chief
charlie
beck
is
backing
further
research
not
only
to
refine
the
technology
but
to
push
it
into
new
crime
areas
in
effect
malinowski
says
beck
has
so
much
confidence
in
the
model
he
is
allowing
the
researchers
to
use
parts
of
the
city
as
a
laboratory
to
study
crime
prediction
and
his
confidence
is
mirrored
around
the
country
and
the
world
as
other
police
forces
adopt
the
technology
because
the
system
uses
such
basic
data
the
technology
is
easily
transferable
and
blind
to
cultural
difference
brantingham
says
once
the
team
has
access
to
a
police
department
s
computer
system
they
can
be
online
within
a
couple
of
weeks
he
says
the
research
has
clearly
made
a
splash
at
ucla
which
is
enjoying
not
only
new
sources
of
research
funding

also

and

factors
they

opening
bars
that
might
attract
potential
crooks
mostly
young

and

pred
pol
strips
all
that
away
it
simply
feeds
three
factors
crime
type
time
and
location
through
the
dizzyingly
sophisticated
equations
and
algorithms
the
team
has
created
the
problem
with
considering
things
like
how
many
open
bars
there
are
is
that
it
misses
the
point
brantingham
says
the
key
information
is
the
number
of
assaults
or
robberies
and
you
already
know
that
the
team
began
in
by
considering
crime
through
a
spatial
rather
than
social
lens
if
you
consider
a
potential
criminal
and
a
potential
target
to
be
for
example
two
atoms
floating
in
a
body
of
fluid
what
factors
would
cause
them
to
meet
and
how
and
when
and
later
what
other
factors
might
interrupt
that
meeting
working
with
brantingham
ucla
s
applied
mathematics
department
began
investigating
models
that
described
events
such
as
chemical
reactions
and
the
way
substances
diffuse
in
fluid
even
fish
migration
predictions
came
up
in
discussion
by
now
the
lapd
had
become
involved
brantingham
had
appealed
to
the
department
for
access
to
crime
data
and
had
feared
he
might
be
met
with
old
guard
suspicion
instead
the
department
threw
itself
into
the
project
at
the
time
the
lapd
suffered
from
an
awkward
problem
crime
was
falling
relentlessly
across
the
city
and
had
been
for
a
few
years
the
city
that
had
registered
murders
in
a
single
year
two
decades
ago
lost
just
of
its
citizens
to
violence
last
year
when
it
became
the
safest
big
city
in
the
us
this
was
good
news
for
citizens
but
since
the
only
real
measure
of
a
police
force
s
success
is
lower
year
on
year
crime
rates
it
meant
innovation
was
needed
to
keep
up
the
momentum
as
one
officer
puts
it
all
the
low
hanging
fruit
had
gone
the
then
lapd
chief
william
bratton
not
only
supplied
the
ucla
team
with
any
data
they
asked
for
he
assigned
one
of
his
captains
sean
malinowski
to
work
with
them
he
even
kicked
in
extra
funding
whenever
anyone
starts
talking
about
data
i
tend
to
get
the
mission
malinowski
says
this
is
probably
because
the
year
old
cop
has
a
phd
in
public
policy
data
and
statistics
don
t
scare
him
and
he
can
speak
basic
academic
the
next
breakthrough
came
when
brantingham
s
collaborator
george
mohler
now
an
assistant
professor
of
mathematics
and
computer
science
at
santa
clara
university
discovered
that
equations
used
in
mapping
the
aftershocks
of
earthquakes
could
be
manipulated
to
map
crime
mohler
s
discovery
had
the
dramatic
effect
of
allowing
the
team
to
quickly
begin
applying
their
theory
and
creating
a
working
model
of
pred
pol
with
hindsight
brantingham
says
the
link
between
seismology
and
crime
makes
sense
research
already
showed
how
criminal
events
caused
their
own
aftershocks
such
as
when
burglars
returned
to
homes
or
streets
where
they
had
already
enjoyed
success
before
each
hour
shift
or
watch
begins
in
foothill
a
senior
officer
logs
into
pred
pol
and
calls
up
the
maps
for
the
coming
hours
on
a
desktop
computer
software
instantly
runs
up
to
date
and
historical
crime
data
through
pred
pol
s
algorithms
and
spits
out
that
shift
s
crime
boxes
all
printed
neatly
on
a
google
map
clicking
on
a
toolbar
the
operator
can
also
pull
up
historical
crime
records
going
back
hours
or
days
weeks
or
months
so
far
the
system
in
use
predicts
and
maps
only
car
theft
burglary
from
cars
and
burglary
because
these
constitute
more
than
per
cent
of
all
crime
the
team
is
working
to
expand
into
gun
crime
and
homicide
in
the
near
future
in
the
long
run
it
is
feasible
the
technology
could
allow
police
to
enter
say
the
time
and
location
a
suspect
is
seen
on
the
street
then
instantly
be
fed
background
material
such
as
what
their
gang
affiliation
is
likely
to
be
and
how
that
gang
fits
into
the
broader
criminal
ecology
of
the
area
the
technology
is
already
so
sophisticated
that
police
on
patrol
could
be
given
their
own
logins
to
pull
up
even
more
detailed
maps
using
smartphones
or
tablets
the
boxes
could
be
ranked
for
risk
and
police
could
even
watch
them
move
slowly
across
the
map
through
the
shift
as
police
attention
focuses
on
particular
boxes
they
could
change
colour
as
the
risk
of
crime
abates
with
police
presence
the
developers
believe
that
could
lead
to
information
overload
police
are
basically
hunters
brantingham
says
should
the
boxes
be
ranked
they
would
focus
on
the
top
tiers
besides
says
the
lead
ucla
mathematician
on
the
project
andrea
bertozzi
the
folded
piece
of
paper
is
actually
good
technology
for
its
purpose
when
police
on
patrol
have
time
to
spare
they
are
directed
to
spend
time
in
their
allocated
boxes
the
beauty
is
the
simplicity
they
are
not
distracted
by
interacting
with
new
technology
or
equipment
police
report
that
once
in
their
boxes
they
find
themselves
hyper
alert
malinowski
says
they
take
note
of
who
is
around
they
talk
to
shopkeepers
and
home
owners
they
check
on
suspicious
activity
their
goal
in
the
boxes
is
not
so
much
to
catch
crooks
though
that
has
happened
but
to
suppress
crime
malinowski
dismisses
early
criticism
that
the
program
might
simply
diffuse
crime
saying
new
research
showed
the
type
of
crooks
they
were
after
such
as
car
thieves
were
opportunistic
and
would
often
give
up
in
the
face
of
risk
we
are
not
talking
about
committed
criminals
like
a
serial
rapist
he
says
as
brantingham
puts
it
it
is
not
too
hard
to
convince
them
back
home
to
their
xboxes
the
american
criminal
law
review
has
raised
concerns
the
program
could
warp
crime
statistics
either
by
increasing
the
arrest
rate
in
the
boxes
through
extra
policing
or
falsely
reducing
it
through
diffusion
civil
rights
groups
are
taking
the
former
concern
seriously
because
designating
an
area
a
crime
hot
spot
can
be
used
as
a
factor
in
formulating
reasonable
suspicion
for
stopping
a
suspect
malinowski
says
there
is
no
evidence
of
an
increase
in
civil
rights
complaints
and
the
statistics
clearly
show
crime
is
decreasing
in
a
six
month
test
in
foothill
when
the
division
used
pred
pol
strictly
that
is
pred
pol
alone
was
used
for
crime
prediction
rather
than
in
concert
with
the
department
s
analysts
crime
rates
dropped
by
per
cent
overall
and
per
cent
for
car
theft
in
a
later
six
month
period
when
other
intelligence
types
were
used
crime
rates
began
to
climb
malinowski
says
the
results
are
so
dramatic
the
lapd
s
current
chief
charlie
beck
is
backing
further
research
not
only
to
refine
the
technology
but
to
push
it
into
new
crime
areas
in
effect
says
malinowski
beck
has
so
much
confidence
in
the
model
he
is
allowing
the
researchers
to
use
parts
of
the
city
as
a
laboratory
to
study
crime
prediction
and
his
confidence
is
mirrored
around
the
country
and
the
world
as
other
police
forces
adopt
the
technology
because
the
system
uses
such
basic
data
the
technology
is
easily
transferable
and
is
blind
to
cultural
difference
brantingham
says
once
the
team
has
access
to
a
police
department
s
computer
system
they
can
be
online
within
a
couple
of
weeks
he
says
the
research
has
clearly
made
a
splash
at
ucla
which
is
enjoying
new
sources
of
research
funding
and
the
flow
of
pred

subscription
fees
last

until

however
as

the

erickson

candidates
are
vying
to
recapture
san
jose
s
oft
boasted
safest
big
city
award
bestowed
by
independent
groups
until
the
politics
are
tricky
however
as
voters
want
both
crime
and
taxes
to
stay
low
to
balance
its
budget
the
city
imposed
a
percent
pay
cut
for
police
officers
and
voters
approved
city
employee
pension
cutbacks
last
year
but
san
jose
has
lost
or
laid
off
hundreds
of
officers
and
its
active
duty
force
has
dropped
to
about
officers
erickson
said
the
dwindling
police
force
has
likely
contributed
to
the
recent
sharp
drop
in
arrests
the
city
council
last
week
approved
a
percent
pay
restoration
for
police
officers
while
the
police
officers
association
union
is
fighting
the
pension
changes
in
court
every
mayoral
candidate
will
fall
over
themselves
to
tell
voters
how
they
will
restore
staffing
in
the
police
department
said
one
mayoral
candidate
councilman
sam
liccardo
the
truth
is
that
none
of
us
will
it
s
going
to
take
a
lot
of
time
no
matter
who
is
in

the
question
is
what
are
we
going
to
do
in
the

santa

dave

the
union
backed
mayoral
candidate
wants
the
city
to
spend
more
on
its
employees
to
beef
up
the
police
force
and
increase
morale
termed
out

five
city

allies
running

pete
constant
rose
herrera
liccardo
madison
nguyen
and
pierluigi

have
backed
the
more
moderate
approach
officials
have
taken
in
recent
years
saying
controlling
employee
cost
is
vital
to
keeping
services
including
police
intact
we
can
talk
all
we
want
about
rebuilding
the
police
department
but
the
reality
is
if
we
don
t
have
the
financial
resources
to
do
so
we
re
not
going
to
do
any
meaningful
reform
said
nguyen
a
strong
backer
of
pension
reform
but
while
voters
have
preached
fiscal
restraint
in
the
past
now
they
are
increasingly
aware
of
the
police
problems
too
a
new
city
sponsored
scientific
survey
of
san
jose
residents
cited
in
the
report
found
that
percent
of
respondents
had
a
member
of
their
household
who
was
a
victim
of
a
crime
last
year
up
from
percent
each
of
the
prior
two
years
favorability
ratings
for
the
police
department
also
fell
from
percent
two
years
ago
to
percent
now
while
fewer
people
said
they
felt
safe
around
town
and
in
their
own
neighborhoods
among
the
candidates
ideas
constant
wants
to
spend
a
bigger
portion
of

on

liccardo
favors
implementing
predictive

software
nguyen
is
seeking
to
re
establish
the
burglary
unit
and
herrera
wants
more
administrative

to
free
up

when

at

part
of
the
answer
may
lie
with

much
like
seismologists
use
one

to
predict

a
team
of
researchers
at
the
university

is
using

police
figure
out
when

where
the

happen
it

not
that
earthquakes
cause

says
andrea
bertozzi
a
professor
in
the
university
s
department
of

it
s
that
earthquakes
trigger

to
best
use
their
thinly
stretched

in

are

in
edmonton
police

might
seem

for

it

most

where
of
crimes
instead
the
department
relies
on
a
variety
of
sources
data
mining
crime
mapping
and
officer
gathered
intelligence
to
figure
out
which
neighbourhoods
officers
should
patrol
although
we
do
have
these
tools
it
s
pulling
them
all
together
and
combining
that
with
the
human
elements
of
our
crime
analysts
our
division
commanders
and
our
patrol
members
that
really
helps
us
make
those
decisions
about
where
to
deploy
on
a
daily
basis
and
where
to
deploy
for
specific
initiatives
says
joanne
graham
director
of
business
intelligence
for
the
edmonton
police
service
the
math
works
because
humans
are
creatures
of
habit
even
the
ones
trying
to
evade
police
people
are
going
to
work
visiting
relatives
they
re
going
to
places
they
routinely
visit
and
then
a
crime
of
opportunity
happens
bertozzi
says
in
the
same
way
a
criminal
might
break
into
a
house
then
return
to
the
same
neighbourhood
because
they
ve
become
familiar
with
the
surroundings
it
could
be
the
thief
knows
homes
on
one
side
of
a
street
are
vulnerable
because
of
a
broken
street
light
or
perhaps
he
has
passed
a
tip
to
a
criminal
accomplice
it
s
about
being
comfortable
in
your
environment
identifying
targets
and
using
the
knowledge
you
have
ber
tozzi
says
of
course
there
are
major
differences
between
aftershocks
and
so
called
after
crimes
which
is
why
the
algorithm
is
so
useful
while
you
may
have
a
big
earthquake
you
re
not
necessarily
expecting
the
aftershock
to
have
the
same
magnitude
bertozzi
explains
with
crime
data
that
s
not
the
case
we
re
looking
at
crimes
that
could
be
related
to
an
initial
crime
but
could
be
equally
bad
to
the
initial
crime
or
even
worse
poring
over
the
crime
data
reveals
patterns
bertozzi
says
which
puts
that
information
somewhere
between
completely
random
and
percent
predictable
the
research
uses
mathematics
to
try
to
bridge
that
gap
between
random
and
predictable
in
the
santa
cruz
po
ice
department
which
hadn
t
been
following
a
predictive
policing
model
tested
software
developed
by
the
ucla
researchers
officers
were
given
a
list
of
locations
and
times
and
were
told
to
patrol
those
areas
whenever
they
weren
t
responding
to
calls
in
one
month
the
department
saw
crime
drop
by
per
cent
in
edmonton
police
began
seriously
working
toward
a
policing
model
based
on
intelligence
and
smart
resource
deployment
the
department
adopted
a
geographic
deployment
model
that
saw
patrol
squads
assigned
to
specific
districts
to
foster
a
sense
of
ownership
at
the
same
time
the
department
began
using
ibm
analytic
software
that
crunches
crime
data
helping
identify
trends
it
lets
us
take
a
close
look
at
what
s
happening
when
is
it
happening
where
is
it
happening
and
who
is
involved
graham
says
the
department
has
set
a
target
for
per
cent
of
patrol
officers
time
to
be
spent
doing
proactive
work
she
says
division
commanders
use
data
reports
crime
mapping
tools
and
intelligence
gathered
from
beat
cops
to
pinpoint
where
officers
should
work
proactive
patrols
by
setting
aside
that
per
cent
time
we
re
saying
to
patrol
officers
it
s
important
for
you
to
obviously
respond
to
calls
both
emergency
and
non
emergency
calls
but
we
have
an
expectation
that
you
re
going
to
undertake
activities
to
both
prevent
and
suppress
crime
graham
says
since
the
crime
rate
in
edmonton
has
dropped
with
robberies
break
and
enters
and
car
thefts
on
a
steady
downward
trend
according
to
statistics
canada
graham
doesn
t
attribute
that
strictly
to
mathematical
and
analytic
tools
but
it
did
allow
us
to
be
smarter
about
how
we
did
our
policing
while
bertozzi
recognizes
the
crime
prevention
software
isn
t
a
substitute
for
traditional
police
work
she
does
see
it
as
one
tool
in
their
arsenal
of
tools
to
deter
and
solve
crime
that
s
where
we
think
the
win
is
here
one
could
potentially
use

more
efficiently

the

the
number
has
consistently

s
and
since

the
city
s
violent
crime
rate
has
trended

than

what
makes

stand
out
is
how
unique
it
seems
among
a
list
of

cities
it
lacks
the

these

criminologists
and
the
fbi
caution
the

are
not
an
accurate
picture
of

the

measure
offenses
reported
to

and
do
not
take
into
account
the
validity
of
the

or
crimes
that

never
brought

while
the

are
a

police
say
they
saw

and
thefts
in

crimes
are
also
on
a
downward

of
what
they
were
in
with
the

being
the
lowest
in

police

say
there
are
several
factors
that
make
the
city
an
outlier
tourism
swells
the
city

particularly
on

summer
weekends
ucsc
brings
thousands
of

for
the
first

and
it
has
a
relatively
high
number
of
liquor
licenses
an
ongoing
topic
of
debate
i
am
convinced
that
you
cannot
benchmark
santa
cruz
to
any
other
city
santa
cruz
deputy
police
chief
steve
clark
said
you
can
t
we
re
an
anomaly
but
many
communities
must
deal
with
impacts
of
the
state
s
billion
tourism
industry
and
many
are
no
strangers
to
colleges
with
state
run
four
year
and
graduate
schools
across
california
community
colleges
and
scores
of
private
institutions
the
offenses
driving
both
rates
upward
are
thefts
and
assaults
and
countywide
they
seem
unique
to
santa

watsonville
rates
rank
rd
for
violent
crimes
and
rd
for
property
crimes
among
cities
with
a
population
of
and
greater
and
if
the
unincorporated
area
of
the

were
a
city
it
would
rank
in
the
bottom
half
statewide
for
both
categories
rates
for
the
smaller

and

are
both

said
santa
cruz
city
councilman
david
terrazas
who
chairs
the
council
s
public
safety
committee
i
m
confident
this
city
council
is
taking
on
this
issue
and
the
community
is
no
longer
tolerant
of
crime
that
it
may
have
tolerated
in
the
past
the
debate
is
not
completely
new
it
dates
to
at
least
the
s
when
a
city
consultant
famously
penned
a
report
on
undesirable
transient
elements
or
utes
a
term
later
co
opted
by
protesters
to
city
policies
i
think
it
s
been
for
lack
of
a
better
word
sort
of
a
roller
coaster
issue
said
longtime
city
councilman
don
lane
in
my
time
in
this
community
there
have
been
periods
of
great
concern
about
crime
and
at
other
times
it
s
less
of
a
concern
this
is
not
a
new
phenomenon
but
tackling
crime
in
santa
cruz
is
a
complex
task
the
very
things
that
give
the
city
its
cultural
identity
not
just
its
famed
tolerance
but
its
vibrant
nightlife
and
global
draw
as
a
tourist
destination
also
contribute
to
the
problem
we
actually
do
a
lot
of
work
to
encourage
people
to
come
here
to
have
fun
that
s
one
of
our
main
industries
lane
said
but
when
people
are
on
vacation
they
do
drink
and
they
sometimes
use
drugs
let
s
not
mince
words
about
this
this
is
a
town
to
come
and
play
but
there
s
a
cost
to
that
drugs
also
often
are
named
as
a
culprit
particularly
methamphetamine
and
heroin
a
court
system
seen
as
lenient
is
also
a
frequent
target
as
is
the
county
s
suite
of
social
service
offerings
manifestation
of
neglect
there
are
ongoing
debates
about
what
role
the
police
play
in
preventing
crime
some
s
era
studies
concluded
that
standard
approaches
more
officers
preventive
patrols
and
faster
response
times
were
basically
ineffective
spurring
experimentation
in
how
best
to
reduce
crime
santa
cruz
s
predictive
policing
model
is
one
example
but
the
crime
reduction
factor
that
comes
up
is
the
role
santa
cruzans
themselves
must
play
part
of
that
is
what
have
we
taught
our
community
and
what
have
we
tolerated
clark
said
saying
the
city
is
reaping
what
he
called
the
manifestation
of
neglect
santa
cruz
is
a
compassionate
place
and
it
s
great
i
love
that
he
said
but
compassion
without
accountability
is
nothing
more
than
enabling
and
we
are
seeing
that
play
out
before
our
very
eyes
that
echoes
comments
by
former
defense
secretary
leon
panetta
at
the
funeral
for
baker
and
butler
speaking
of
their
accused
killer
and
the
numerous
red
flags
that
arose
before
he
made
his
way
to
santa
cruz
panetta
said
too
many
people
looked
the
other
way
we
live
in
a
society
now
where
everybody
hangs
by
their
iphone
or
their
computer
and
there
s
a
lot
of
turning
inward
and
not
enough
attention
to
the
people
around
you
panetta
said
in
a
later
interview
with
the
sentinel
experts
say
shaking
that
passiveness
is
key
to
preventing
crime
from
telling
errant
teens
to
knock
it
off
to
calling
out
criminal
behavior
uc
irvine
criminologist
charis
kubrin
said
informal
social
controls
are
effective
deterrents
a
community
that
s
vibrant
with
residents
out
and
about
that
has
a
lot
of
things
going
on
is
much
less
likely
to
have
crime
because
these
people
serve
as
the
eyes
and
ears
of
the
community
kubrin
said
minding
your
own
business
is
not

for

easily
beats

bernardino
which
have
similar
ratios
of
police
to
residents
nor
is
the
department
understaffed
when
measured
against
the
population
though
police
argue
that
measure
is
skewed
due
to
the
high
number
of
tourists
there
is
one
sworn
officer
for
every
residents
nd
in
the
state
furthermore
what
resources
the
department
has
are
on
the
street
the
ratio
of
civilian
staff
to
sworn
officers
is
third
lowest
in
california
many
homeless
santa
cruz
also
has
a
high
number
of
transients
and
the
killers
of
both
collins
and
officers
baker
and
butler
were
recent
transplants
to
santa
cruz
the
transient
issue
is
years
old
but
the
debate
over
it
do
social
services
attract
the
homeless
are
the
homeless
responsible
for
much
of
the
crime
rages
on
a
staunch
supporter
of
homeless
services
lane
says
there
s
no
question
that
some
transients
but
not
all
contribute
to
the
problem
there
are
people
who
are
kind
of
making
their
way
through
existence
by
petty
crime
lane
said
but
i
think
it
s
important
to
recognize
that
s
a
distinct
subpopulation
he
disputes
the
belief
closely
held
by
some
that
homeless
services
bring
homeless
people
to
the
area
i
don
t
think
people
are
choosing
to
come
great
distances
because
the
free
dinner
in
santa
cruz
is
better
than
the
dinner
in
salinas
lane
said
and
kubrin
said
you
cannot
draw
a
correlation
between
social
services
and
crime
in
fact
she
said
they
are
key
to
rehabilitation
and
should
help
reduce
crime
what
you
will
not
find
is
that
it
s
causing
crime
kubrin
said
i
cannot
think
of
a
study
that
would
show
that
a
city
its
police
in
a
city
with
an
anti
establishment
streak
the
santa
cruz
police
department
and
residents
have
sometimes
had
an
uneasy
relationship
the
department
has
cultivated
officers
who
match
the
community
and
continues
to
do
so
and
is
in
the
midst
of
an
exhaustive
search
for
new
recruits
this
is
a
very
political
community
maybe
a
politicized
community
is
a
better
word
lane
said
the
police
department
has
always
been
cognizant
of
dealing
with
what
the
community
attitudes
are
and
it
s
always
kind
of
wrestling
with
that
after
the
deaths
of
baker
and
butler
supervisor
zach
friend
a
former
crime
analyst
with
the
santa
cruz
police
department
called
for
a
rebirth
in
the
relationship
between
the
city
and
its
police
friend
said
he
sees
the
ongoing
public
safety
conversation
as
growing
pains
with
the
city
having
shifted
on
its
axis
in
the
s
from
a
conservative
growth
happy
area
known
for
fishing
to
a
politically
charged
liberal
bastion
this
to
me
is
part
of
the
discussion
and
growth
of
a
community
that
really
isn
t
that
old
friend
said
the
responsibility
for
preventing
crimes
falls
on
many
shoulders
he
said
by
the
time
a
law
enforcement
officer
knows
your
child
s
name
a
lot
of
elements
of
society
have
failed
that
child
the
police
are
really
the
parent
of
last
resort
speaking
of
his
former
police
colleagues
friend
added
they
feel
like
they
re
asked
to
accomplish
an
impossible
task
often
with
very
limited
resources
and
in
some
sections
of
the
community
with
little
support
but
it
isn
t
their
job
to
vocalize
that
marijuana
issue
in
santa
cruz
voters
passed
measure
k
which
not
only
made
marijuana
a
lesser
law
enforcement
priority
but
limited
the
police
department
s
ability
to
work
with
the
drug
enforcement
agency
on
pot
cases
at
the
time
voter
outrage
at
the
dea
over
its
participation
in
the
infamous
raid
on
the
wo
men
s
alliance
for
medical
marijuana
was
still
high
but
measure
k
s
practical
impact
was
to
limit
police
cooperation
with
the
dea
on
all
drug
investigations
including
going
after
top
level
suppliers
clark
said
the
fact
that
santa
cruz
has
such
a
large
drug
problem
and
gives
away
twice
as
many
needles
than
all
of
santa
clara
county
transcends
anything
the
police
department
or
city
council
can
control
clark
said
cutting
off
the
supply
might
help
change
the
city
s
drug
friendly
reputation
but
cutting
off
demand
and
getting
more
people
into
treatment
would
make
that
easier
and
could
lead
to
declines
in
drug
related
property
crimes
addiction
is
a
disease
that
needs
treatment
and
that
can
really
be
seen
when
we
see
a
transformation
in
people
and
get
them
back
to
a
place
where
they
are
stable
and
back
with
families
and
working
said
carolyn
coleman
executive
director
of
santa
cruz
community
counseling
center
and
an
appointee
to
mayor
hilary
bryant
s
new
task
force
on
public
safety
we
think
all
these
services
are
geared
toward
public
safety
what
s
next
the
city
council
is
taking
up
the
crime
issue
this
week
and
adding
to
the
fabric
of
community
concerns
is
a
state
prisoner
shift
that
some
feared
would
mean
more
crooks
roaming
the
streets
oakland
which
has
by
far
the
highest
violent
crime
rate
in
the
state
recently
hired
former
new
york
city
top
cop
bill
bratton
the
godfather
of
zero
tolerance
style
policing
as
a
consultant
but
the
hammer
of
the
criminal
justice
system
is
not
the
only
way
to
fix
a
crime
problem
kubrin
said
there
s
no
evidence
yet
that
the
prison
realignment
has
led
to
an
uptick
in
crime
and
locking
people
up
isn
t
the
answer
she
added
overreliance
on
incarceration
is
very
problematic
in
california
kubrin
said
you
cannot
incarcerate
your
way
out
of
a
crime
problem
there
are
diminishing
returns
after
awhile
ultimately
clark
said
crime
isn
t
about
numbers
at
all
but
a
sense
of
place
with
so
many
factors
at
play
it
comes
down
to
whether
people
feel
secure
in
the
place
where
they
live
how
good
do
you
feel
about
where
you
live
and
what
you
do
not
just
santa
cruz
but
there
are
a
lot
of
communities
at
a
crossroads
about
this
clark
said
my
whole
time
that
i
ve
been
here
santa
cruz
has
always
found
a
way
to
figure
it
out
and
move
forward

top

in

are

starting
with
the

of

and
the

of
the

carl
povilaitis
a

glendale
police
veteran
was
promoted
wednesday
from
captain
to
deputy

and
theresa
goldman
moved
up
from
her
position
as
the
dispatch
center
administrator
to
become
the
department
s
commander
of
the
administrative
services
division
these
are
very
important
positions
in
our
leadership
chain
of
command
and
it
s
important
that
we
selected
the
right
individuals
to
fulfill
these
roles
police
chief
ron
de
pompa
said
povilaitis
who
is
a
longtime
glendale
resident
started
his
career
in
law
enforcement
with
the
glendale
police
department
where
he
has
spearheaded
major
projects
including
the
development
of
command
areas
predictive
policing
and
real
time
crime
analysis
as
the
new
deputy
chief
povilaitis
will
continue
to
oversee
his
current
duties
in
the
investigation
division
as
well
as
manage
all
day
to
day
operations
of
the
department
this
is
a
can
do
organization
he
said
everybody
in
this
organization
works
so
hard
it
s
not
what
can
t
we
do
or
why
can
t
we
do
it
it
s
how
can
we
get
it
done
his
new
role
will
let
de
pompa
focus
more
on
administrative
duties
working
with
the
legal
team
as
well
as
actively
interacting
with
the
community
according
to
police
sgt
tom
lorenz
this
is
a
very
special
position
at
least
in
my
eyes
because
he
will
truly
be
my
right
hand
man
de
pompa
said
but
truth
be
known
carl
has
kind
of
been
my
right
hand
man
throughout
my
tenure
as
chief
stepping
in
to
oversee
organizational
duties
goldman
a
non
sworn
police
employee
will
use
her
experience
to
supervise
fleet
services
as
well
as
communications
the
jail
records
budget
and
evidence
rooms
she
will
also
represent
the
city
on
the
governance
board
for
the
interagency
communications
interoperability
system
which
delivers
interoperable
radio
communication
to
the
los
angeles
region
i
look
forward
to
the
challenges
goldman
said
i
am
learning
a
great
deal
about
the
different
bureaus
here
i
like
what
i
see
i
like
the
work
that
is
being
done
and
i
look
forward
to
bringing
it
to
the
next
level
the
idea
of
allowing
a
non
sworn
employee
to
oversee
a
great
amount
of
the
department
s
operations
wasn
t
immediately
welcomed
by
some
city
officials
especially
after
they
learned
the
staffer
would
have
command
over
certain
police
functions
the
position
which
is
supposed
to
save
the
city
annually
is
on
the
same
tier
as
a
captain
which
means
goldman
will
be
allowed
to
act
as
police
chief
in
the
absence
of
de
pompa
during
an
emergency
however
she
would
act
as
a
policy
marker
just
as
the
police
chief
would
and
she
would
not
be
in
command
at
any
scene
during
an
emergency
lorenz
said
adding
that
tactical
commanders
would
cover
those
responsibilities
goldman
said
she
is
confident
in
making
decisions
and
consulting
others
when
it
s
needed
as
well
as
deferring
to
sworn
officials
i
know
what
they
do
but
i
don
t
do
what
they
do
she
said
still
goldman
has
logged
more
than
years
in
law
enforcement
starting
at
the
burbank
police
department
and
then
with
beverly
hills
police
where
she
developed
knowledge
of
handling
dispatch
duties
and
technology
projects
officials
said
her
move
to
the
command
tier
may
open
the
way
for
other
professional
staffers
to
move
up
in
the
department
the
latest
promotions
are
part
of
de
pompa
s
extensive
changes
including
the
creation
of
two
pools
of
generalist
detectives
this
year
in
the
police

de
pompa
announced
his
retirement
in

and
city

opened

mayor

said
at

thursday
this
technology
is

multiplier
predpol
was
developed
by
a

and
is
used
by

cities
its

first
northeastern
city

use
it
has
been
working

it
for

police
chief
william
m
heim
said
officers
discovered
a
car
theft
and
a
burglary
in
progress
while
patrolling
areas
where
crime
was
predicted
to
occur
those
may
or
may
not
be
attributable
to
predpol
he
said
but
the
city
has
a
two
year
contract
and
should
know
by
then
how
well
it
works
the
city
paid
from
a
federal
grant
for
the
setup
and
two
years
of
use
we
had
a
pretty
robust
crime
mapping
capability
to
establish
the
hot
spots
and
let
police
officers
know
where
to
take
proactive
measures
heim
said
it
worked
really
well
and
we
thought
we
were
on
the
cutting
edge
then
came
high
tech
predictive
policing
with
a
growing
number
of
providers
in
the
industry
such
as
predpol
so
how
does
it
work
algorithms
those
essentially
are
hugely
complex
math
formulas
that
combine
data
of
past
crimes
with
known
patterns
of
criminal
behavior
to
predict
where
the
next
one
will
occur
the
city
fed
years
of
crime
data
into
the
predpol
system
and
now
updates
it
twice
a
day
in
return
it
gets
a
map
sprinkled
with
by
foot
squares
showing
where
and
when
the
next
crime
might
occur
police
move
into
that
area
patrolling
talking
with
people
perhaps
not
full
time
but
to
establish
a
greater
presence
you
can
t
count
a
crime
that
didn
t
occur
as
a
measure
of
the
system
s
success
but
heim
said
he
ll
be
happy
if
there
s
a
percent
drop
in
burglaries
in
areas
that
predpol
pinpointed
and
police
took
proactive
measures
there
s
no

work

he
was

results
so
far
and
is
confident
it
will
work
across
the
county
he
said
instead
of
just
doing
a
random
patrol
the
data
tells
us
to
go
to
a
zone
which
is
known
to
have
recent
levels
of

it
means
more
of
a

that
have
some
of
the
highest
levels
of
criminality
mr
learmonth
said
the
officers
have
enjoyed
it
because
it
takes
them
back
to
the
policing
style
some
joined
to
do
officers
are
out
visible
doing
foot
patrols
engaging
with
the
community
talking
with
the
residents
and
they
are
dealing
with
the
crimes
they
see
as
an
added
bonus
the
public
want
to
see
visible
policing
on
the
streets
this
allows
us
to
do
that
the
idea
is
backed
by
the
county
s
police
commissioner
ann
barnes
who
gave
the
green
light
to
the
innovative
project
when
she
was
chairman
of
the
police
authority
last
year
she
accepted
that
if
crime
levels
are
to
continue
to
fall
in
kent
more
targeted
policing
would
need
to
happen
as
cuts
to
the
force
by
the
coalition
government
continue
she
said
when
you
have
nearly
officers
fewer
on
the
streets
you
have
to
put
your
officers
where
they
will
be
best
used
and
the
most
effective
it
s
just
ordinary
policing
but
this
targeted
system
will
give
a
better
chance
of
our
officers
stopping
crimes
taking
place
before
they
happen

predicting
the
future
is
standard
practice
for
weather
forecasters
economists
think
tanks
and
business
now
the
police
are
finding
their
own
way
of
mapping
crime
before
it
even
happens
reminiscent
of
tom
cruise
film
minority
report
the
software
predpol
which
stands
for
predictive
policing
has
been
brought
to
north
kent
from
california
for
its
first
uk
trials
in
santa
cruz
and
los
angeles
where
the
software
was
first
tested
in
crime
dropped
by
per
cent
and
per
cent
respectively
in
the
first
six
months
it
began
as
an
academic
project
seven
years
ago
involving
mathematicians
social
scientists
and
an
anthropology
professor
whose
goal
was
to
understand
how
crime
hotspots
occur
they
found
that
by
using
a
mathematical
algorithm
similar
to
one
for
predicting
earthquake
aftershocks
they
could
create
predict
where
crimes
would
happen
speaking
to
the
reporter
from
santa
cruz
jeff
brantingham
anthropology
professor
at
the
university
of
california
explains
when
there
is
an
earthquake
you
see
a
lot
about
how
it
produces
aftershocks
in
general
they
occur
near
in
time
and
place
to
a
main
shock
crime
is
very
much
the
same
when
a
burglar
breaks
into
a
house
it
makes
the
chance
of
crime
occurring
close
by
much
more
likely
the
predpol
software
maps
years
of
past
crime
data
and
is
updated
daily
with
the
location
time
and
type
of
crime
committed
from
this
it
creates
prediction
boxes
of
precise
sq
ft
zones
which
are
listed
in
priority
order
as
to
where
crimes
are
most
likely
to
occur
which
is
then
delivered
to
the
smart
phones
tablets
and
pcs
of
police
officers
brantingham
explains
the
technology
is
more
sophisticated
than
just
highlighting
an
area
around
a
recent
crime
if
you
were
to
look
at
the
last
seven
days
of
crime
you
could
see
a
pattern
but
you
can
t
put
seven
years
of
offences
on
one
map
predpol
has
the
advantage
of
analysing
everything
that
has
happened
in
those
years
and
can
select
the
crimes
likely
to
produce
new
offences
he
says
one
problem
raised
is
the
ambiguity
over
whether
police
could
stop
and
search
someone
in
a
location
flagged
up
by
predpol
but
brantingham
stresses
this
isn
t
minority
report
that
s
about
producing
who
this
is
about
where
and
when
last
week
ch
insp
philip
painter
of
kent
police
gravesham
division
introduced
the
technology
to
councillors
at
a
crime
disorder
meeting
they
were
sceptical
one
worried
that
it
would
leave
rural
areas
without
police
cover
another
was
concerned
it
would
mean
job
cuts
however
ch
insp
insisted
rural
areas
do
still
have
crime
hot
spots
and
would
be
patrolled
and
that
the
technology
would
not
lead
to
any
cuts
kent
police
were
impressed
by
the
drop
in
offences
in
california
and
invested
into
a
trial
across
north
kent
which
will
if
successful
go
county
wide
ch
insp
painter
remembers
patrolling
gravesend
s
dickens
estate
years
ago
and
using
pin
maps
to
understand
crime
dynamics
he
is
optimistic
predpol
is
easy
to
use
and
easy
to
brief
it
is
unrealistic
putting
an

on

said
no
there
was
nothing
special
about
the
term
it
just
combined
two
common
words
today
big
data
seems
everywhere
ushering
in
what
advocates
consider
some
of
the
biggest
changes
since
euclid
want
to
get
elected
to
public
office
put
a
bunch
of
computer
geeks
in
a
room
and
have
them
comb
through
databases
to
glean
who
might
vote
for
you
then
target
them
with
micro
tailored
messages
as
president
obama
famously
did
in
want
to
solve
poverty
in
africa
analyze
text
messages
and
social
media
networks
to
detect
early
signs
of
joblessness
epidemics
and
other
problems
as
the
united
nations
is
trying
to
do
eager
to

the
right
mate
use
algorithms
to
analyze
an
infinite
number
of
personality
traits
to
determine
who
s
the
best
match
for
you
as
many
online
dating
sites
now
do
what
exactly
is
big
data
what
makes
it
new
different
what
s
the
downside
such
questions
have
evoked
intense
interest
especially
since
june
on
that
day
former
national
security
agency
analyst
edward
snowden
revealed
that
like
ms
mandelbaum
or
rothman
the
nsa
had
also
asked
a
question
can
we
find
terrorists
using
big
data
like
the
phone
records
of
hundreds
of
millions
of
ordinary
americans
could
we
get
those
records
from
say
verizon
mr
snowden
s
disclosures
revealed
that
prism
the
program
the
nsa
devised
secretly
monitors
calls
web
searches
and
e
mails
in
the
united
states
and
other
countries
the
dark
side
of
big
data
involves
much
more
than
snowden
s
disclosure
or
what
the
us
does
and
what
made
big
data
possible
did
not
happen
overnight
the
term
has
been
around
for
at
least
years
though
it
s
only
recently
become
popular
it
will
be
quite
transformational
says
thomas
davenport
an
information
technology
expert
at
babson
college
in
wellesley
mass
who
co
wrote
the
widely
used
book
competing
on
analytics
the
new
science
of
winning
what
exactly
will
it
transform
to
find
out
let
s
go
back
to
the
beginning
big
data
starts
with
a
lot
of
data
google
executive
chairman
eric
schmidt
has
said
that
we
now
uncover
as
much
data
in
hours
zettabytes
that
s
bytes
as
humans
gathered
from
the
dawn
of
civilization
to
the
year
you
read
that
right
the
head
of
a
company
receiving
billion
search
requests
a
day
believes
people
now
gather
in
a
few
days
more
data
than
humans
have
done
throughout
almost
all
of
history
mr
schmidt
s
claim
has
doubters
but
similar
assertions
crop
up
from
people
not
prone
to
exaggeration
such
as
massachusetts
institute
of
technology
researcher
andrew
mcafee
and
mit
professor
erik
brynjolfsson
authors
of
the
new
book
race
against
the
machine
more
data
crosses
the
internet
every
second
they
write
than
were
stored
in
the
entire
internet
years
ago
a
key
driver
of
the
growth
of
data
is
the
way
we
ve
digitized
many
of
our
everyday
activities
such
as
shopping
increasingly
done
online
or
downloading
music
another
factor
our
dependence
on
electronic
devices
all
of
which
leave
digital
footprints
every
time
we
send
an
e
mail
search
online
post
a
message
text
or
tweet
virtually
every
institution
in
society
from
government
to
the
local
utility
is
churning
out
its
own
torrent
of
electronic

our
billing

our
electricity

the
huge
array
of
sensors
that
now
exist
measuring
everything
from
traffic
flow
to
the
spoilage
of
fruit
during
shipment
and
the
world
is
awash
in
information
that
we
had
no
way
to
uncover
before
all
aggregated
and
analyzed
by
increasingly
powerful
computers
most
of
this
data
doesn
t
affect
us
amassing
information
alone
doesn
t
mean
it
s
valuable
yet
the
new
ability
to
mine
the
right
information
discover
patterns
and
relationships
already
affects
our
everyday
lives
anyone
for
instance
who
has
a
navigation
screen
on
a
car
dashboard
uses
data
streaming
from
satellites
miles
above
earth
to
pinpoint
his
or
her
exact
location
people
living
in
los

and
dozens
of
other
cities
now
participate
knowingly
or
not
in
the
growing
phenomenon
of
predictive
policing
authorities

of

to

either
the

or
the

of

wal

discovery
gleaned
by

but
what
excites
and
concerns
people
about
big

is
more
far
reaching
than
that
one
way
of
seeing
the
bigger
picture
taking
a
closer
look
at
some
of

of
the

redolent
of
history
and
what
you
might
expect
from
what
we
call
america
s
library
with
its
million
books
on
miles
of
shelving
they
open
a
door
we
pass
behind
people
staring
at
huge
computer
screens
and
enter
a
room
that
doesn
t
look
as
if
it
belongs
in
a
library
at
all
it
s
the
size
of
a
gym
with
fluorescent
lights
overhead
and
tall
metal
boxes
rising
from
the
floor
the
tweets
come
here
mandelbaum
says
it
s
been
three
years
since
twitter
approached
the
library
with
a
question
what
the
online
networking
service
started
in
had
become
a
new
way
of
communicating
would
there
twitter
asked
be
historical
value
in
archiving
tweets
we
saw
the
value
right
away
says
robert
dizard
deputy
director
of
the
library
our
mission
is
preserve
the
record
of
america
certainly
the
record
of
what
millions
of
americans
say
think
and
feel
each
day
would
be
a
treasure
trove
for
historians
but
was
the
technology
feasible
and
important
for
a
federal
agency
cost
effective
to
handle
the
three
v
s
that
form
the
fingerprint
of
a
big
data
project
volume
velocity
and
variety
the
library
said
yes
but
the
task
is
daunting
volume
it
will
archive
billion
tweets
in
alone
about
each
from
the
world
s
million
plus
tweeters
velocity
that
means
absorbing
more
than
million
tweets
an
hour
hours
a
day
seven
days
a
week
each
stored
in
a
way
that
can
last
variety
there
are
tweets
from
a
woman
who
may
run
for
president
in
and
from
lady
gaga
and
they
re
different
in
other
ways
sure
a
tweet
is
characters
says
jim
gallagher
the
library
s
director
of
strategic
initiatives
but
there
are
fields
we
need
to
record
who
wrote
it
where
when
because
many
tweets
seem
banal
the
project
has
inspired
ridicule
when
the
library
posted
its
announcement
of
the
project
one
reader
wrote
in
the
comments
box
i
m
guessing
a
good
chunk
came
from
the
kardashians
but
isn
t
banality
the
point
historians
want
to
know
not
just
what
happened
in
the
past
but
how
people
lived
it
is
why
they
rejoice
in
finding
a
semiliterate
diary
kept
by
a
confederate
soldier
or
pottery
fragments
in
a
colonial
town
it
s
as
if
a
historian
today
writing
about
lincoln
could
listen
in
on
what
millions
of
americans
were
saying
on
the
day
he
was
shot
youkel
and
mandelbaum
might
seem
like
an
odd
couple
to
carry
out
a
big
data
project
one
is
a
career
library
of
congress
researcher
with
an
undergraduate
degree
in
history
the
other
a
geologist
who
worked
for
years
with
oil
companies
but
they
demonstrate
something
babson
s
mr
davenport
has
written
about
the
emerging
field
of
analytics
hybrid
specialization
for
organizations
to
use
the
new
technology
well
traditional
skills
like
computer
science
aren
t
enough
davenport
points
out
that
just
as
big
data
combines
many
innovations
finding
meaning
in
the
world
s
welter
of
statistics
means
combining
many
different
disciplines
mandelbaum
and
youkel
pool
their
knowledge
to
figure
out
how
to
archive
the
tweets
how
researchers
can
find
what
they
want
and
how
to
train
librarians
to
guide
them
even
before
opening
tweets
to
the
public
the
library
has
gotten
more
than
requests
from
doctoral
candidates
professors
and
journalists
this
is
a
pioneering
project
mr
dizard
says
it
s
helping
us
begin
to
handle
large
digital
data
for
america
s
library
at
this
moment
that
means
housing
a
gutenberg
bible
and
lady
gaga
tweets
what
will
it
mean
in
years
i
ask
dizard
he
laughs
and
demurs
i
wouldn
t
look
that
far
ahead
arnold

lund
s
power
line
project
has
my
attention
for
power
companies
one
of
the
largest
expenses
is
managing
foliage
he
says
we
lay
out
the
entire
geography
of
a
state
and
the
overlay
of
the
power
grid
we
use
satellite
data
to
look
at
tree
growth
and
cut
back
where
there
s
most
growth
then
we
predict
where
the
most
likely
problem
is
we
have
different
variabilities
to
see
the
probability
of
outage
in
that
one
compressed
paragraph
i
see
three
big
changes
mr
cukier
and
mr
mayer
sh
nberger
say
big
data
brings
to
research
it
s
what
we
might
call
the
three
nots
size
not
sample
for
more
than
a
century
they
point
out
statisticians
have
relied
on
small
samples
of
data
from
which
to
generalize
they
had
to
they
lacked
the
ability
to
collect
more
the
new
technology
means
we
can
collect
a
lot
of
data
rather
than
settle
for
samples
messy
not
meticulous
traditionally
researchers
have
insisted
on
clean
curated
data
when
there
was
not
that
much
data
around
researchers
had
to
be
as
exact
as
possible
now
that
s
no
longer
necessary
accept
messiness
they
write
arguing
that
the
benefits
of
more
data
outweigh
our
obsession
with
precision
correlation
not
cause
while
knowing
the
causes
behind
things
is
desirable
we
don
t
always
need
to
understand
how
the
world
works
to
get
things
done
they
note
lund
s
lab
exemplifies
all
three
first
his
entire
geography
and
variables
involve
massive
sets
of
data
information
streaming
in
from
sensors
satellites
and
other
sources
about
everything
from
forest
density
to
prevailing
wind
direction
to
grid
loads
second
he
looks
for
probability
not
obsessive
precision
correlation
lund
values
cause
but
the
reason
behind
say
tree
growth
interests
him
less
than
spotting
correlations
that
might
spur
action
ah
that
tree
he
exclaims
as
if
he
is
an
engineer
in
the
field
better
get
the
trucks
out
ahead
of
the
storm
cukier
and
mayer
sch
nberger
cite
the
united
parcel
service
to
bolster
their
argument
about
correlation
ups
equips
its
trucks
with
sensors
that
identify
vibrations
and
other
things
associated
with
breakdowns
the
data
do
not
tell
ups
why
the
part
is
in
trouble
they
reveal
enough
for
the
company
to
know
what
to
do
lund
s
boss
ge
chief
executive
officer
jeff
immelt
also
talks
about
sensor
data
the
company
is
now
investing
billion
in
software
and
analytics
which
includes
putting
sensors
on
its
jet
engines
to
help
enhance
fuel
efficiency
mr
immelt
has
said
that
just
a
percent
change
in
fuel
burn
can
be
worth
hundreds
of
millions
of
dollars
to
an
airline
you
save
an

immelt
said
at
a
conference
this
spring
you
re
his
friend
for
life
while
lund
has
talked
glowingly
about
how
much
data
his
projects
can
collect
he
wants
to
make
sure
i
know
data
isn
t
everything
as
a
scientist
he
says
i
know
the
biggest
challenge
is
finding
the
right
questions
how
do
you
find
the
questions
important
to
business
society
and
culture
rothman
has
questions
too
we
work
in
emergency
rooms
he
says
about
himself
and
dr
dugas
we
re
the
boots
on
the
ground
rothman
s
work
has
involved
emergency
medicine
and
the
nexus
between
public
health
and
epidemics
including
influenza
which
kills
as
many
as
people
a
year
around
the
world
and
about
in
the
us
the
two
researchers
wanted
to
find
out
if
the
google
national
study
held
lessons
for
baltimore
and
their
emergency
room
er
they
studied
google
queries
for
the
baltimore
area
queries
about
flu
symptoms
or
chest
congestion
or
where
to
buy
a
thermometer
if
they
could
spot
spikes
that
might
help
solve
one
crucial
problem
crowding
dugas
says
huge
issue
when
epidemics
start
people
rush
to
hospitals
waiting
rooms
fill
up
the
sheer
volume
of
people
means
decreased
care
errors
mortality
she
says
if
google
trends
showed
a
spike
just
as
epidemics
started
ers
could
staff
up
and
reserve
more
space
for
the
surge
of
patients
the
link
between
google
spikes
and
hospital
visits
in
baltimore
turned
out
to
be
strong
especially
for
children
as
soon
as
the
first
news
reports
surfaced
about
the
h
n
virus
pediatric
er
visits
at
hopkins
increased
at
the
peak
by
as
much
as
percent
but
when
the
two
researchers
looked
closer
they
found
something
unexpected
no
flu
it
turned
out
that
news
reports
about
h
n
elsewhere
fueled
a
rush
to
ers
in
baltimore
what
one
researcher
called
fear
week
if
you
just
looked
at
correlation
for
flu
you
d
say
it
was
a
false
trend
says
dugas
even
so
she
and
rothman
found
the
data
important
for
ers
no
matter
why
people
are
coming
in
the
door
they
need
to
staff
up
the
baltimore
study
also
showed
the
importance
of
finding
out
what
was
behind
all
those
medically
related
google
searches
in
other
words
not
just
correlation
but
cause
like
ge
s
lund
rothman
emphasizes
the
value
of
the
questions
you
re
asking
evidence
that
big
data
promises
enormous
benefits
is
more
than
anecdotal
mit
s
mr
brynjolfsson
did
a
study
in
examining
companies
he
found
those
whose
decisions
were

driven
had
become
to

more
productive
in
ways
only
the
use
of

could
explain
on

consider
just
this

in

she
and
others
worry
not
exclusively
about
three
questions
does
the
new
technology
erode
privacy
promote
inequality
and
turn
government
into
big
brother
she
points
to
public
health
data
as
one
potential
source
of
abuse
her
concern
echoes
that
of
critics
who
fear
that
supposedly
anonymous
patient
records
are
not
anonymous
at
all
as
far
back
as
the
s
a

gave

health

about

this
would

ms
sweeney
now
a

at

gleefully
sent
to
his
office
today
there
are
far
more
powerful
ways
to
identify
people
from
records
supposed
to
keep
things
private
and
there
are
concerns
other
than
our
health
records
dr

this
aggravate

is
the

to

its

in

that
arose
from

in

encompass
issues
of

the
obama
administration
argues
that
monitoring
personal

keeps
the
country
safe
asserting
that
prism
has
helped
foil
separate
terrorist
plots
against

us
some

dispute
that
number
though
and
in
recent
weeks
momentum
has
been
building
in
washington
to
rein
in
the

not
only
has
support
increased
on
the

to
adopt

of

program
polls
show
a
hardening
of
public
opinion
about
snooping
too
meanwhile
there
is
no
doubt
about
the
fury
in
other
countries
when
the
news
broke
especially
in
germany
where
critics
have
compared
american
monitoring

arrested
dozens

the

announced
that

something
facebook

nossel
sees
a

now
talking
about

she
argues
that
the

now
so
great
it
tips
the
scale
no
technology
on
the
side
of
human

advocates
can
confront
it
that
s
new
and
chilling
what
have
we
learned
there
s
a
notable
sesame
street
episode
from
years
back
in
which
cookie
monster
wanders
into
a
library
and
drives
the
librarian
crazy
by
asking
over
and
over
for
a
cookie
this
is
a
library
the
librarian
finally
screams
forgetting
to
whisper
we
have
books
just
books
that
s
certainly
been
our
image
of
what
libraries
do
you
can
still
find
books
here
mandelbaum
reminds
me
standing
in
a
room
full
of
processors
but
figures
over
the
past
decade
seem
to
show
that
books
those
rectangular
things
with
pages
we
turn
are
slowly
on
the
way
out
in
the
digital
age
that
s
less
significant
than
it
might
seem
though
after
all
we
value
books
because
of
the
knowledge
they
hold
we
ve
changed
the
way
we
convey
knowledge
many
times
big
data
is
another
source
of
knowledge
will
it
become
a
more
integral
part
of
tomorrow
s
libraries
it
is
perhaps
fitting
that
one
of
the
sesame
street
characters
most
in
tune
with
the
future
is
the
count
he
counts
everything
his
role
is
to
teach
kids
the
importance
of
counting
big
data
allows
us
to
count
everything
and
analyze
what
we
find
but
are
numbers
enough

after
all
both
tools
they
let
people
see
lots
of
things
that
have
always
been
around
of

the
microscope
also
prompted
us
to
ask
questions
we
could
never
ask
before
big
data
does
that
too
still
while
big
data
can
predict
a

it
can

by

we

richmond
police

chris

on
wednesday
sent
out
an
email
to
community
and
civic
leaders
detailing
the
challenges
and
strategies
investigators
face
in
solving
cases
the
email
stresses
the
importance
of
witnesses
participation
which
was
reportedly
key
in
the
recent
capture
of
a
man
charged
tuesday
with
fatally
shooting
his
neighbor
in
in
the
iron
triangle
neighborhood
the
richmond
police
department
offers
a
reward
for
information
leading
to
an
arrest
and
conviction
in
unsolved
homicide
cases
regardless
of
how
long
ago
they
occurred
here
is
a
magnus
email
dear
city
council
and
other
richmond
community
members
we
have
recently
seen
an
increase
in
gun
violence
in
richmond
much
of
it
associated
with
gang
activity
some
of
it
simply
a
result
of
personal
beefs
between
individuals
unfortunately
gun
violence
frequently
occurs
in
clusters
in
many
cases
because
incidents
of
retaliation
follow
the
initial
shooting
and
are
very
difficult
to
prevent
i
am
often
asked
how
the
police
department
investigates
these
gun
violence
cases
especially
homicides
and
why
they
are
difficult
to
prevent
and
solve
here
are
some
of
the
strategies
and
tools
we
use
as
well
as
some
of
the
challenges
we
face
community
engagement
as
an
ongoing
effort
well
before
a
homicide
or
other
gun
crime
even
takes
place
our
patrol
and
school
resource
officers
sros
are
out
in
the
community
doing
their
best
to
build
relationships
establish
trust
make
contact
with
neighborhood
residents
and
develop
information
about
dangerous
individuals
who
pose
a
threat
to
others
this
is
key
to
both
preventing
and
solving
crimes
obviously
the
community
quickly
hears
about
serious
crimes
after
they
occur
through
the
media
neighborhood
blogs
and
word
of
mouth
what
most
residents
don
t
know
are
the
many
crimes
that
are
prevented
because
beat
officers
and
sros
develop
information
or
engage
in
proactive
field
work
which
allows
them
to
intervene
ahead
of
the
crime
these
officers
will
make
a
key
arrest
confiscate
a
gun
our
officers
take
an
average
of
a
gun
off
the
street
each
day
or
conduct
compliance
checks
to
assure
probationers
and
parolees
are
following
the
rules
that
allow
them
to
be
back
in
the
community
our
personnel
work
closely
with
many
community
organizations
that
provide
services
or
have
a
mission
to
prevent
violence
they
also
engage
the
faith
community
school
personnel
and
everyday
residents
to
prevent
and
solve
gun
crimes
whenever
possible
partnerships
with
other
law
enforcement
entities
rpd
personnel
work
with
many
other
police
corrections
and
prosecution
entities
to
address
violent
crime
in
richmond
this
includes
local
jurisdictions
close
to
us
like
san
pablo
pd
el
cerrito
pd
the
contra
costa
county
sheriff
s
department
ccso
bart
pd
and
others
it
also
includes
the
contra
costa
county
probation
department
especially
important
based
on
the
recent
realignment
of
california
s
corrections
system
that
shifts
responsibility
for
many
offenders
away
from
the
state
and
to
the
counties
instead
as
well
the
cdcr
state
corrections
parole
section
rpd
also
has
a
close
relationship
with
personnel
from
several
federal
agencies
including
the
fbi
atf
alcohol
tobacco
and
firearms
the
dea
and
customs
although
we
have
no
involvement
with
ice
the
immigration
section
of
customs
lastly
we
work
closely
with
county
state
and
federal
prosecution
agencies
including
the
contra
costa
district
attorney
the
state
department
of
justice
doj
and
the
u
s
attorney
s
office
most
of
our
violent
crime
cases
including
homicides
are
prosecuted
or
evaluated
for
prosecution
under
state
law
by
the
da
s
office
certain
gun
crimes
are
referred
to
the
u
s
attorney
s
office
for
prosecution
under
federal
law
when
more
serious
sentencing
options
are
appropriate
based
on
a
pattern
of
ongoing
violent
crimes
committed
by
the
offender
although
the
media
often
refer
to
many
crimes
in
our
immediate
area
as
having
been
committed
in
richmond
a
great
deal
of
our
retaliatory
gang
violence
involves
young
men
who
live
or
hang
out
in
unincorporated
north
richmond
which
is
not
part
of
the
city
because
of
this
a
significant
number
of
gun
crimes
associated
with
our
larger
community
are
the
responsibility
of
the
contra
costa
county
sheriff
s
department
this
means
it
s
essential
that
rpd
work
closely
with
the
sheriff
s
department
when
a
shooting
occurs
it
s
not
uncommon
for
the
perpetrators
to
flee
from
richmond
into
north
richmond
or
vice
versa
this
complicates
our
ability
to
make
arrests
and
close
cases
but
despite
this
reality
our
officers
and
detectives
communicate
on
an
ongoing
basis
with
ccso
deputies
and
investigators
we
also
work
regularly
with
investigators
from
the
da
s
office
the
city
of
richmond
contracts
with
the
da
s
office
to
have
two
assistant
das
in
our
headquarters
who
focus
exclusively
on
richmond
gun
crimes
and
other
criminal
cases
they
work
with
our
patrol
officers
and
detectives
to
give
special
attention
to
repeat
violent
offenders
they
review
cases
provide
immediate
feedback
answer
questions
and
provide
training
for
our
personnel
that
make
our
officers
more
effective
in
dealing
with
violent
crime
the
da
convenes
regular
meetings
to
discuss
richmond
homicides
and
crime
trends
these
meetings
involve
not
only
rpd
personnel
but
lead
investigators
from
other
local
state
and
federal
jurisdictions
in
addition
as
a
result
of
a
new
protocol
put
in
place
in
august
of
the
das
assigned
to
richmond
respond
to
most
homicide
scenes
to
provide
assistance
as
needed
this
can
help
with
prosecution
efforts
later
crime
scene
investigations
and
evidence
processing
our
department
has
officers
specifically
trained
as
crime
scene
investigators
csis
these
personnel
are
available
and
respond
to
the
scene
of
all
homicides
and
many
other
violent
crimes
csis
have
many
important
responsibilities
they
document
the
physical
nature
and
characteristics
of
crime
scenes
which
is
painstaking
and
can
be
quite
time
consuming
this
typically
involves
taking
photographs
collecting
ballistic
evidence
bullet
casings
unexpended
rounds
etc
gathering
other
evidence
clothing
items
left
behind
by
the
offender
taking
latent
prints
when
appropriate
and
working
closely
with
the
other
investigators
at
the
scene
processing
crime
scenes
and
evidence
is
very
little
like
what
s
portrayed
on
television
evidence
handling
at
a
crime
scene
is
complex
for
example
people
sometimes
wonder
why
the
body
of
the
deceased
isn
t
moved
or
taken
away
from
the
scene
of
a
homicide
more
quickly
they
may
perceive
this
as
disrespect
or
lack
of
caring
by
the
officers
what
they
don
t
realize
is
that
a
detailed
inspection
of
the
deceased
at
the
scene
including
the
position
of
the
body
bullet
entry
and
exit
wounds
condition
of
the
deceased
s
clothing
and
many
other
factors
can
be
key
to
solving
a
case
later
on
it
is
a
lengthy
process
in
addition
it
usually
takes
time
for
the
county
coroner
to
respond
to
homicide
scenes
to
do
their
job
the
department
s
csis
pay
close
attention
to
ballistic
evidence
at
the
scene
there
may
be
numerous
bullet
casings
and
even
unexpended
rounds
spread
around
a
wide
area
that
need
to
be
collected
in
some
cases
a
gun
may
be
located
occasionally
one
that
belonged
to
the
victim
rpd
pays
the
ccso
crime
lab
to
process
many
of
these
items
and
to
enter
check
firearms
evidence
in
ibis
the
federal
integrated
ballistics
identification
system
the
ibis
system
records
the
distinctive
pattern
left
on
bullet
evidence
which
can
then
later
be
matched
to
the
exact
gun
that
fired
it
in
much
the
same
way
as
fingerprints
can
be
matched
to
the
person
who
left
them
behind
due
to
the
volume
of
cases
handled
by
the
ccso
crime
lab
ibis
comparisons
can
take
as
much
as
six
months
to
complete
to
expedite
our
comparisons
we
have
contracted
with
a
forensic
expert
to
prioritize
richmond
cases
for
a
quicker
turnaround
we
hear
a
lot
about
dna
evidence
through
the
media
on
television
dna
processing
of
evidence
occurs
in
minutes
and
is
usually
matched
right
away
to
a
known
criminal
facilitating
an
immediate
arrest
in
reality
many
dna
cases
take
months
to
be
processed
there
is
not
necessarily
a
match
to
anyone
since
the
dna
database
is
limited
to
persons
who
have
dna
samples
taken
from
them
at
the
time
of
a
previous
arrest
or
who
are
in
the
database
for
other
reasons
dna
analysis
is
extremely
expensive
for
the
submitting
agency
crime
labs
are
overwhelmed
with
evidence
from
richmond
and
other
cities
in
the
county
one
of
the
frustrations
for
our
investigators
is
the
time
it
takes
to
get
lab
results
physical
evidence
can
be
one
of
the
strongest
parts
of
a
criminal
case
yet
it
is
not
uncommon
for
months
to
pass
before
analysis
results
related
to
key
pieces
of
evidence
comes
back
to
investigators
this
can
delay
the
ability
to
link
a
suspect
to
a
crime
assuming
a
suspect
has
been
identified
witnesses
one
of
the
first
things
police
officers
try
to
do
when
they
respond
to
the
scene
of
a
homicide
or
serious
shooting
is
to
identify
and
speak
to
witnesses
unfortunately
this
is
one
of
the
most
difficult
parts
of
the
investigation
in
many
many
cases
particularly
those
involving
gang
related
violence
witnesses
are
unwilling
to
come
forward
or
talk
with
the
police
even
when
they
have
seen
or
know
something
about
the
crime
this
is
often
because
of
the
brutality
and
brazenness
of
shootings
which
frequently
occur
in
places
open
to
public
view
it
is
also
common
in
cases
where
gang
dynamics
are
at
play
for
rivals
to
know
one
another
while
neighborhood
residents
may
be
totally
unfamiliar
with
who
these
actors
are
offenders
generally
subscribe
to
a
strict
street
code
that
discourage
cooperation
with
legitimate
entities
such
as
police
and
government
there
are
many
reasons
witnesses
and
even
surviving
victims
in
many
cases
choose
not
to
work
with
the
police
some
of
these
reasons
include
fear
of
retaliation
perception
that
there
is
no
point
of
getting
involved
since
the
system
doesn
t
work
anyway
distrust
of
the
police
and
other
authorities
friendship
or
family
ties
to
the
perpetrators
cultural
or
language
barriers
bad
personal
or
family
experience
s
with
the
criminal
justice
system
current
arrest
warrants
or
other
charges
pending
against
them
they
are
on
parole
or
probation
they
are
not
confident
what
they
saw
or
heard
or
they
will
handle
it
themselves
perpetuating
the
cycle
of
violence
we
are
sometimes
asked
why
do
you
have
so
many
officers
at
a
serious
crime
scene
in
addition
to
securing
the
crime
scene
perimeter
which
can
be
challenging
depending
on
the
size
of
the
scene
the
main
reason
for
the
large
number
of
officers
and
detectives
is
to
make
every
possible
effort
to
identify
and
speak
to
witnesses
homicides
and
other
shootings
are
very
complicated
investigations
that
involve
piecing
together
many
facts
from
different
sources
that
we
address
with
a
team
approach
in
order
to
increase
our
accuracy
and
efficiency
time
is
of
the
essence
in
these
cases
if
witnesses
are
not
contacted
as
soon
as
possible
it
may
be
impossible
to
identify
or
locate
them
later
on
you
may
have
heard
of
or
watched
the
tv
show
the
first
which
portrays
how
critical
it
is
to
gather
evidence
and
identify
witnesses
during
the
first
hours
following
the
crime
when
it
comes
to
engaging
with
witnesses
however
the
process
would
better
be
called
the
first
minutes
the
more
time
that
passes
following
a
homicide
or
serious
shooting
the
more
difficult
it
is
to
identify
and
locate
witnesses
when
investigators
fail
to
locate
helpful
witnesses
initially
they
make
every
effort
to
continue
this
process
in
the
weeks
and
months
that
follow
the
crime
sometimes
important
leads
come
from
informants
also
known
as
confidential
informants
or
cis
sometimes
information
comes
from
neighbors
or
other
eyewitnesses
close
to
the
scene
of
the
crime
who
may
need
persuasion
or
reassurance
over
time
to
get
involved
sometimes
information
comes
from
a
family
member
or
associate
of
the
suspect
s
who
develop
a
motivation
to
work
with
the
police
there
are
cases
however
where
no
one
comes
forward
and
no
one
can
be
identified
to
interview
this
is
a
problem
because
eyewitnesses
are
equally
as
valuable
as
physical
evidence
in
shooting
cases
a
major
problem
we
face
in
dealing
with
witnesses
is
that
they
are
not
always
reliable
sometimes
a
witness
has
such
a
lengthy
criminal
record
and
or
such
questionable
motivation
there
is
little
chance
a
prosecutor
can
put
them
on
the
stand
to
testify
for
fear
they
might
actually
jeopardize
the
case
another
problem
can
be
locating
witnesses
later
on
for
preliminary
exams
or
trial
for
example
because
individuals
may
leave
the
area
become
uncooperative
or
generally
make
themselves
as
scarce
as
possible
to
avoid
testifying
on
tv
and
in
the
movies
witnesses
not
associated
with
the
suspect
or
victim
almost
always
seem
to
pick
the
suspect
s
out
of
a
photo
or
police
lineup
in
reality
witnesses
may
only
catch
a
fleeting
glance
of
a
suspect
it
may
be
dark
clothing
worn
by
the
suspect
s
may
make
it
difficult
to
see
them
and
things
often
happen
incredibly
fast
during
the
commission
of
a
crime
eyewitness
testimony
is
not
always
reliable
so
investigators
and
prosecutors
have
to
be
very
careful
about
how
this
evidence
is
developed
and
used
on
a
positive
note
because
of
the
relationships
many
of
our
officers
have
developed
with
the
community
it
is
not
uncommon
for
beat
officers
and
sros
to
be
told
about
the
word
on
the
street
going
around
about
a
particular
shooting
this
information
may
not
be
enough
to
make
a
solid
case
against
a
suspect
but
it
can
provide
us
with
a
starting
point
for
further
investigation
who
decides
about
charging
a
suspect
if
a
suspect
is
actually
identified
and
there
is
probable
cause
for
an
arrest
a
state
or
federal
prosecutor
must
still
make
a
decision
about
whether
there
is
enough
evidence
to
obtain
a
signed
warrant
from
a
judge
and
ultimately
to
try
the
case
in
court
many
people
believe
the
police
make
charging
decisions
that
involve
suspects
but
this
is
not
how
the
system
works
charges
against
suspects
have
to
be
made
by
prosecutors
and
prosecutors
base
their
charging
decisions
on
multiple
factors
it
is
not
uncommon
for
a
district
attorney
or
federal
prosecutor
to
send
a
case
back
to
detectives
requesting
more
information
or
follow
up
before
they
will
move
forward
with
prosecution
in
some
instances
it
is
simply
not
possible
for
detectives
to
obtain
additional
information
so
a
case
may
be
stalled
for
months
or
even
years
this
is
often
extremely
disappointing
to
family
members
or
friends
of
the
victim
who
may
believe
a
case
is
going
nowhere
because
the
police
and
or
prosecutors
simply
don
t
care
this
is
simply
not
true
nothing
makes
officers
and
detectives
more
frustrated
than
knowing
who
committed
a
crime
yet
not
having
sufficient
evidence
to
get
a
suspect
charged
and
tried
in
court
this
is
not
an
uncommon
occurrence
in
richmond
homicide
cases
prosecutors
are
legally
and
morally
obligated
to
not
file
charges
against
a
suspect
unless
they
believe
they
can
convince
a
jury
of
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt
of
the
suspect
s
guilt
people
often
ask
why
charges
aren
t
filed
in
an
effort
to
make
a
suspect
go
to
trial
even
if
the
prosecutor
knows
the
trial
will
end
in
an
acquittal
the
reason
for
this
is
that
such
conduct
could
be
construed
as
malicious
prosecution
resources
almost
every
police
agency
believes
it
needs
more
resources
to
solve
and
of
course
prevent
homicides
and
other
serious
gun
crimes
the
plain
truth
however
is
that
the
need
for
additional
resources
especially
personnel
is
much
greater
in
richmond
than
many
other
communities
simply
because
of
the
amount
of
gang
violence
and
the
overall
challenges
of
crime
in
the
city
when
i
ask
members
of
the
public
how
many
sworn
police
officers
we
have
in
richmond
i
get
answers
like
or
we
actually
have
sworn
personnel
which
includes
everyone
from
the
newest
recruit
who
may
still
need
to
go
through
a
basic
police
academy
or
be
partnered
up
with
a
training
officer
for
on
the
job
training
all
the
way
up
to
me
the
chief
about
of
our
personnel
are
patrol
officers
about
another
are
supervisors
patrol
sergeants
and
lieutenants
and
about
between
of
these
personnel
are
on
duty
at
any
given
time
patrolling
the
entire
city
the
remainder
of
our
sworn
staff
are
detectives
officers
assigned
to
special
details
like
the
regulatory
unit
or
recruiting
and
training
as
well
as
administrative
personnel
in
addition
most
people
do
not
realize
that
we
always
have
personnel
on
leave
days
vacation
going
through
mandatory
training
recovering
from
injuries
or
on
long
term
disability
and
otherwise
away
from
the
job
for
a
myriad
of
reasons
there
are
approximately
a
dozen
investigators
available
to
handle
homicides
although
about
half
of
them
are
primarily
assigned
to
work
robberies
homicides
tend
to
come
in
groups
so
the
reality
is
that
these
personnel
can
be
spread
very
thin
homicide
investigators
may
be
called
out
day
or
night
days
a
week
and
then
work
long
long
hours
to
follow
up
on
a
murder
or
serious
shooting
in
that
key
period
following
the
crime
s
thanks
to
the
support
of
the
city
council
and
the
city
manager
rpd
has
been
fortunate
that
our
overall
staffing
levels
have
increased
over
the
past
years
despite
these
increases
however
we
are
still
staffed
below
what
a
city
with
our
level
of
crime
ideally
needs
our
department
utilizes
a
variety
of
technologies
to
assist
us
with
the
investigation
of
violent
crime
including
crime
lab
services
which
come
with
a
hefty
price
tag
through
the
sheriff
s
department
closed
circuit
tv
also
expensive
and
complicated
to
operate
maintain
and
monitor
shotspotter
which
triangulates
gunfire
to
provide
the
location
and
type
of
gun
being
fired
but
it
can
t
help
with
the
fact
that
shooters
generally
don
t
stick
around
for
the
police
and
license
plate
readers
lprs
residents
often
assume
these
technologies
are
available
and
functioning
throughout
the
entire
city
but
because
of
cost
they
are
mostly
limited
to
neighborhoods
with
higher
levels
of
violent
crime
this
is
frustrating
to
many
members
of
the
public
and
police
officers
alike
who
wish
there
was
a
camera
or
a
gunshot
sensor
available
and
operating
in
every
area
where
crimes
occur
the
department
also
relies
on
our
crime
analysis
resources
including
our
ability
to
track
field
contacts
provide
timely
crime
data
to
our
personnel
and
conduct
meaningful
analysis
of
crime
trends
we
have
one
crime
analyst
who
works
behind
the
scenes
with
our
officers
and
detectives
to
track
serious
crimes
including
gang
activity
this
has
to
be
done
carefully
and
accurately
to
protect
people
s
rights
and
to
be
most
effective
thanks
to
recent
action
by
the
city
council
the
department
is
contracting
for
a
service
known
as
predictive
policing
which
is
being
successfully
used
in
other
cities
such
as
los
angeles
and
new
york
city
to
utilize
complex
algorithms
in
predicting
where
future
crimes
are
likely
to
occur
so
greater
resources
can
be
placed
in
these
locations
it
sounds
like
science
fiction
but
this
process
has
a
track
record
of
proven
positive
results
ceasefire
the
richmond
police
department
is
part
of
the
ceasefire
lifelines
to
healing
working
group
and
overall
effort
the
ceasefire
program
cannot
prevent
all
homicides
but
it
is
recognized
as
a
best
practice
around
the
country
to
reduce
shootings
the
ceasefire
program
involves
police
detectives
and
other
key
individuals
identifying
persons
involved
in
or
at
high
risk
for
committing
gun
violence
these
individuals
are
then
called
in
to
participate
in
a
discussion
about
the
law
enforcement
consequences
greater
police
attention
enhanced
prosecution
efforts
etc
for
continuing
to
commit
shootings
they
also
hear
an
important
message
from
the
community
which
is
that
people
care
about
them
and
that
a
support
system
exists
to
help
them
turn
their
lives
around
this
effort
involves
community
groups
service
providers
the
faith
community
formerly
incarcerated
individuals
and
many
others
there
are
no
instant
or
magical
outcomes
associated
with
the
ceasefire
program
but
real
prevention
and
long
term
successes
are
hard
to
measure
and
difficult
to
achieve
this
program
requires
the
persistent
dedication
and
commitment
of
many
people
and
groups
it
also
requires
sufficient
funding
and
resources
to
provide
effective
interventions
to
provide
sustainable
interventions
shooters
who
want
to
make
major
life
changes
often
need
life
skills
training
employment
mental
health
and
substance
abuse
services
anger
management
and
conflict
resolution
skills
education
and
other
assistance
few
of
these
services
are
available
to
the
degree
they
are
needed
in
our
community
despite
the
best
efforts
of
many
groups
and
people
no
giving
up
here
s
one
especially
important
thing
i
d
like
people
to
know
about
our
homicide
investigations
we
don
t
give
up
homicide
cases
are
never
closed
even
when
evidence
is
very
limited
and
no
witnesses
have
come
forward
even
when
we
have
exhausted
all
leads
unsolved
homicide
cases
remain
open
in
case
information
or
evidence
is
developed
later
sometimes
years
later
that
helps
us
solve
a
case
and
charge
a
suspect
a
good
example
of
this
is
a
homicide
case
that
our
investigators
just
made
an
arrest
on
we
know
how
important
this
kind
of
closure
is
to
victims
families
and
friends
it
s
also
important
to
our
personnel
who
have
often
spent
several
thousand
hours
investigating
a
case
our
personnel
are
invested
in
these
cases
another
important
thing
to
keep
in
mind
the
department
offers
a
standing
reward
for
information
leading
to
the
arrest
and
conviction
of
the
person
or
persons
who
committed
any
homicide
even
a
homicide
many
years
ago
lesser
rewards
may
be
available
for
critical
information
that
helps
us
with
other
serious
shooting
cases
i
hope
this
information
has
helped
explain
the
ongoing
work
and
challenges
faced
by
the
police
and
others
in
addressing
the
problem
of
gun
violence
in
our
community
this
work
is
difficult
and
there
are
many
obstacles
to
achieving
success
we
are
fortunate
to
have
considerable
support
and
an
ongoing
commitment
for
this
work
from
our
city
council
and
other
regional
elected
leaders
we
also
have
a
caring
group
of
residents
who
are
highly
invested
in
this
effort
that
said
nothing
is
easy
and
our
needs
remain
considerable
i
appreciate
your
time
in
learning
more
about
these
issues
and
your
willingness
to
partner
with
us
as
we
move

richmond
police
chief
chris
magnus
on
wednesday
sent
out
an
email
to
community
and
civic
leaders
detailing
the
challenges
and
strategies
investigators
face
in
solving
cases
the
email
stresses
the
importance
of
witnesses
participation
which
was
reportedly
key
in
the
recent
capture
of
a
man
charged
tuesday
with
fatally
shooting
his
neighbor
in
in
the
iron
triangle
neighborhood
the
richmond
police
department
offers
a
reward
for
information
leading
to
an
arrest
and
conviction
in
unsolved
homicide
cases
regardless
of
how
long
ago
they
occurred
here
is
a
magnus
email
dear
city
council
and
other
richmond
community
members
we
have
recently
seen
an
increase
in
gun
violence
in
richmond
much
of
it
associated
with
gang
activity
some
of
it
simply
a
result
of
personal
beefs
between
individuals
unfortunately
gun
violence
frequently
occurs
in
clusters
in
many
cases
because
incidents
of
retaliation
follow
the
initial
shooting
and
are
very
difficult
to
prevent
i
am
often
asked
how
the
police
department
investigates
these
gun
violence
cases
especially
homicides
and
why
they
are
difficult
to
prevent
and
solve
here
are
some
of
the
strategies
and
tools
we
use
as
well
as
some
of
the
challenges
we
face
community
engagement
as
an
ongoing
effort
well
before
a
homicide
or
other
gun
crime
even
takes
place
our
patrol
and
school
resource
officers
sros
are
out
in
the
community
doing
their
best
to
build
relationships
establish
trust
make
contact
with
neighborhood
residents
and
develop
information
about
dangerous
individuals
who
pose
a
threat
to
others
this
is
key
to
both
preventing
and
solving
crimes
obviously
the
community
quickly
hears
about
serious
crimes
after
they
occur
through
the
media
neighborhood
blogs
and
word
of
mouth
what
most
residents
don
t
know
are
the
many
crimes
that
are
prevented
because
beat
officers
and
sros
develop
information
or
engage
in
proactive
field
work
which
allows
them
to
intervene
ahead
of
the
crime
these
officers
will
make
a
key
arrest
confiscate
a
gun
our
officers
take
an
average
of
a
gun
off
the
street
each
day
or
conduct
compliance
checks
to
assure
probationers
and
parolees
are
following
the
rules
that
allow
them
to
be
back
in
the
community
our
personnel
work
closely
with
many
community
organizations
that
provide
services
or
have
a
mission
to
prevent
violence
they
also
engage
the
faith
community
school
personnel
and
everyday
residents
to
prevent
and
solve
gun
crimes
whenever
possible
partnerships
with
other
law
enforcement
entities
rpd
personnel
work
with
many
other
police
corrections
and
prosecution
entities
to
address
violent
crime
in
richmond
this
includes
local
jurisdictions
close
to
us
like
san
pablo
pd
el
cerrito
pd
the
contra
costa
county
sheriff
s
department
ccso
bart
pd
and
others
it
also
includes
the
contra
costa
county
probation
department
especially
important
based
on
the
recent
realignment
of
california
s
corrections
system
that
shifts
responsibility
for
many
offenders
away
from
the
state
and
to
the
counties
instead
as
well
the
cdcr
state
corrections
parole
section
rpd
also
has
a
close
relationship
with
personnel
from
several
federal
agencies
including
the
fbi
atf
alcohol
tobacco
and
firearms
the
dea
and
customs
although
we
have
no
involvement
with
ice
the
immigration
section
of
customs
lastly
we
work
closely
with
county
state
and
federal
prosecution
agencies
including
the
contra
costa
district
attorney
the
state
department
of
justice
doj
and
the
u
s
attorney
s
office
most
of
our
violent
crime
cases
including
homicides
are
prosecuted
or
evaluated
for
prosecution
under
state
law
by
the
da
s
office
certain
gun
crimes
are
referred
to
the
u
s
attorney
s
office
for
prosecution
under
federal
law
when
more
serious
sentencing
options
are
appropriate
based
on
a
pattern
of
ongoing
violent
crimes
committed
by
the
offender
although
the
media
often
refer
to
many
crimes
in
our
immediate
area
as
having
been
committed
in
richmond
a
great
deal
of
our
retaliatory
gang
violence
involves
young
men
who
live
or
hang
out
in
unincorporated
north
richmond
which
is
not
part
of
the
city
because
of
this
a
significant
number
of
gun
crimes
associated
with
our
larger
community
are
the
responsibility
of
the
contra
costa
county
sheriff
s
department
this
means
it
s
essential
that
rpd
work
closely
with
the
sheriff
s
department
when
a
shooting
occurs
it
s
not
uncommon
for
the
perpetrators
to
flee
from
richmond
into
north
richmond
or
vice
versa
this
complicates
our
ability
to
make
arrests
and
close
cases
but
despite
this
reality
our
officers
and
detectives
communicate
on
an
ongoing
basis
with
ccso
deputies
and
investigators
we
also
work
regularly
with
investigators
from
the
da
s
office
the
city
of
richmond
contracts
with
the
da
s
office
to
have
two
assistant
das
in
our
headquarters
who
focus
exclusively
on
richmond
gun
crimes
and
other
criminal
cases
they
work
with
our
patrol
officers
and
detectives
to
give
special
attention
to
repeat
violent
offenders
they
review
cases
provide
immediate
feedback
answer
questions
and
provide
training
for
our
personnel
that
make
our
officers
more
effective
in
dealing
with
violent
crime
the
da
convenes
regular
meetings
to
discuss
richmond
homicides
and
crime
trends
these
meetings
involve
not
only
rpd
personnel
but
lead
investigators
from
other
local
state
and
federal
jurisdictions
in
addition
as
a
result
of
a
new
protocol
put
in
place
in
august
of
the
das
assigned
to
richmond
respond
to
most
homicide
scenes
to
provide
assistance
as
needed
this
can
help
with
prosecution
efforts
later
crime
scene
investigations
and
evidence
processing
our
department
has
officers
specifically
trained
as
crime
scene
investigators
csis
these
personnel
are
available
and
respond
to
the
scene
of
all
homicides
and
many
other
violent
crimes
csis
have
many
important
responsibilities
they
document
the
physical
nature
and
characteristics
of
crime
scenes
which
is
painstaking
and
can
be
quite
time
consuming
this
typically
involves
taking
photographs
collecting
ballistic
evidence
bullet
casings
unexpended
rounds
etc
gathering
other
evidence
clothing
items
left
behind
by
the
offender
taking
latent
prints
when
appropriate
and
working
closely
with
the
other
investigators
at
the
scene
processing
crime
scenes
and
evidence
is
very
little
like
what
s
portrayed
on
television
evidence
handling
at
a
crime
scene
is
complex
for
example
people
sometimes
wonder
why
the
body
of
the
deceased
isn
t
moved
or
taken
away
from
the
scene
of
a
homicide
more
quickly
they
may
perceive
this
as
disrespect
or
lack
of
caring
by
the
officers
what
they
don
t
realize
is
that
a
detailed
inspection
of
the
deceased
at
the
scene
including
the
position
of
the
body
bullet
entry
and
exit
wounds
condition
of
the
deceased
s
clothing
and
many
other
factors
can
be
key
to
solving
a
case
later
on
it
is
a
lengthy
process
in
addition
it
usually
takes
time
for
the
county
coroner
to
respond
to
homicide
scenes
to
do
their
job
the
department
s
csis
pay
close
attention
to
ballistic
evidence
at
the
scene
there
may
be
numerous
bullet
casings
and
even
unexpended
rounds
spread
around
a
wide
area
that
need
to
be
collected
in
some
cases
a
gun
may
be
located
occasionally
one
that
belonged
to
the
victim
rpd
pays
the
ccso
crime
lab
to
process
many
of
these
items
and
to
enter
check
firearms
evidence
in
ibis
the
federal
integrated
ballistics
identification
system
the
ibis
system
records
the
distinctive
pattern
left
on
bullet
evidence
which
can
then
later
be
matched
to
the
exact
gun
that
fired
it
in
much
the
same
way
as
fingerprints
can
be
matched
to
the
person
who
left
them
behind
due
to
the
volume
of
cases
handled
by
the
ccso
crime
lab
ibis
comparisons
can
take
as
much
as
six
months
to
complete
to
expedite
our
comparisons
we
have
contracted
with
a
forensic
expert
to
prioritize
richmond
cases
for
a
quicker
turnaround
we
hear
a
lot
about
dna
evidence
through
the
media
on
television
dna
processing
of
evidence
occurs
in
minutes
and
is
usually
matched
right
away
to
a
known
criminal
facilitating
an
immediate
arrest
in
reality
many
dna
cases
take
months
to
be
processed
there
is
not
necessarily
a
match
to
anyone
since
the
dna
database
is
limited
to
persons
who
have
dna
samples
taken
from
them
at
the
time
of
a
previous
arrest
or
who
are
in
the
database
for
other
reasons
dna
analysis
is
extremely
expensive
for
the
submitting
agency
crime
labs
are
overwhelmed
with
evidence
from
richmond
and
other
cities
in
the
county
one
of
the
frustrations
for
our
investigators
is
the
time
it
takes
to
get
lab
results
physical
evidence
can
be
one
of
the
strongest
parts
of
a
criminal
case
yet
it
is
not
uncommon
for
months
to
pass
before
analysis
results
related
to
key
pieces
of
evidence
comes
back
to
investigators
this
can
delay
the
ability
to
link
a
suspect
to
a
crime
assuming
a
suspect
has
been
identified
witnesses
one
of
the
first
things
police
officers
try
to
do
when
they
respond
to
the
scene
of
a
homicide
or
serious
shooting
is
to
identify
and
speak
to
witnesses
unfortunately
this
is
one
of
the
most
difficult
parts
of
the
investigation
in
many
many
cases
particularly
those
involving
gang
related
violence
witnesses
are
unwilling
to
come
forward
or
talk
with
the
police
even
when
they
have
seen
or
know
something
about
the
crime
this
is
often
because
of
the
brutality
and
brazenness
of
shootings
which
frequently
occur
in
places
open
to
public
view
it
is
also
common
in
cases
where
gang
dynamics
are
at
play
for
rivals
to
know
one
another
while
neighborhood
residents
may
be
totally
unfamiliar
with
who
these
actors
are
offenders
generally
subscribe
to
a
strict
street
code
that
discourage
cooperation
with
legitimate
entities
such
as
police
and
government
there
are
many
reasons
witnesses
and
even
surviving
victims
in
many
cases
choose
not
to
work
with
the
police
some
of
these
reasons
include
fear
of
retaliation
perception
that
there
is
no
point
of
getting
involved
since
the
system
doesn
t
work
anyway
distrust
of
the
police
and
other
authorities
friendship
or
family
ties
to
the
perpetrators
cultural
or
language
barriers
bad
personal
or
family
experience
s
with
the
criminal
justice
system
current
arrest
warrants
or
other
charges
pending
against
them
they
are
on
parole
or
probation
they
are
not
confident
what
they
saw
or
heard
or
they
will
handle
it
themselves
perpetuating
the
cycle
of
violence
we
are
sometimes
asked
why
do
you
have
so
many
officers
at
a
serious
crime
scene
in
addition
to
securing
the
crime
scene
perimeter
which
can
be
challenging
depending
on
the
size
of
the
scene
the
main
reason
for
the
large
number
of
officers
and
detectives
is
to
make
every
possible
effort
to
identify
and
speak
to
witnesses
homicides
and
other
shootings
are
very
complicated
investigations
that
involve
piecing
together
many
facts
from
different
sources
that
we
address
with
a
team
approach
in
order
to
increase
our
accuracy
and
efficiency
time
is
of
the
essence
in
these
cases
if
witnesses
are
not
contacted
as
soon
as
possible
it
may
be
impossible
to
identify
or
locate
them
later
on
you
may
have
heard
of
or
watched
the
tv
show
the
first
which
portrays
how
critical
it
is
to
gather
evidence
and
identify
witnesses
during
the
first
hours
following
the
crime
when
it
comes
to
engaging
with
witnesses
however
the
process
would
better
be
called
the
first
minutes
the
more
time
that
passes
following
a
homicide
or
serious
shooting
the
more
difficult
it
is
to
identify
and
locate
witnesses
when
investigators
fail
to
locate
helpful
witnesses
initially
they
make
every
effort
to
continue
this
process
in
the
weeks
and
months
that
follow
the
crime
sometimes
important
leads
come
from
informants
also
known
as
confidential
informants
or
cis
sometimes
information
comes
from
neighbors
or
other
eyewitnesses
close
to
the
scene
of
the
crime
who
may
need
persuasion
or
reassurance
over
time
to
get
involved
sometimes
information
comes
from
a
family
member
or
associate
of
the
suspect
s
who
develop
a
motivation
to
work
with
the
police
there
are
cases
however
where
no
one
comes
forward
and
no
one
can
be
identified
to
interview
this
is
a
problem
because
eyewitnesses
are
equally
as
valuable
as
physical
evidence
in
shooting
cases
a
major
problem
we
face
in
dealing
with
witnesses
is
that
they
are
not
always
reliable
sometimes
a
witness
has
such
a
lengthy
criminal
record
and
or
such
questionable
motivation
there
is
little
chance
a
prosecutor
can
put
them
on
the
stand
to
testify
for
fear
they
might
actually
jeopardize
the
case
another
problem
can
be
locating
witnesses
later
on
for
preliminary
exams
or
trial
for
example
because
individuals
may
leave
the
area
become
uncooperative
or
generally
make
themselves
as
scarce
as
possible
to
avoid
testifying
on
tv
and
in
the
movies
witnesses
not
associated
with
the
suspect
or
victim
almost
always
seem
to
pick
the
suspect
s
out
of
a
photo
or
police
lineup
in
reality
witnesses
may
only
catch
a
fleeting
glance
of
a
suspect
it
may
be
dark
clothing
worn
by
the
suspect
s
may
make
it
difficult
to
see
them
and
things
often
happen
incredibly
fast
during
the
commission
of
a
crime
eyewitness
testimony
is
not
always
reliable
so
investigators
and
prosecutors
have
to
be
very
careful
about
how
this
evidence
is
developed
and
used
on
a
positive
note
because
of
the
relationships
many
of
our
officers
have
developed
with
the
community
it
is
not
uncommon
for
beat
officers
and
sros
to
be
told
about
the
word
on
the
street
going
around
about
a
particular
shooting
this
information
may
not
be
enough
to
make
a
solid
case
against
a
suspect
but
it
can
provide
us
with
a
starting
point
for
further
investigation
who
decides
about
charging
a
suspect
if
a
suspect
is
actually
identified
and
there
is
probable
cause
for
an
arrest
a
state
or
federal
prosecutor
must
still
make
a
decision
about
whether
there
is
enough
evidence
to
obtain
a
signed
warrant
from
a
judge
and
ultimately
to
try
the
case
in
court
many
people
believe
the
police
make
charging
decisions
that
involve
suspects
but
this
is
not
how
the
system
works
charges
against
suspects
have
to
be
made
by
prosecutors
and
prosecutors
base
their
charging
decisions
on
multiple
factors
it
is
not
uncommon
for
a
district
attorney
or
federal
prosecutor
to
send
a
case
back
to
detectives
requesting
more
information
or
follow
up
before
they
will
move
forward
with
prosecution
in
some
instances
it
is
simply
not
possible
for
detectives
to
obtain
additional
information
so
a
case
may
be
stalled
for
months
or
even
years
this
is
often
extremely
disappointing
to
family
members
or
friends
of
the
victim
who
may
believe
a
case
is
going
nowhere
because
the
police
and
or
prosecutors
simply
don
t
care
this
is
simply
not
true
nothing
makes
officers
and
detectives
more
frustrated
than
knowing
who
committed
a
crime
yet
not
having
sufficient
evidence
to
get
a
suspect
charged
and
tried
in
court
this
is
not
an
uncommon
occurrence
in
richmond
homicide
cases
prosecutors
are
legally
and
morally
obligated
to
not
file
charges
against
a
suspect
unless
they
believe
they
can
convince
a
jury
of
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt
of
the
suspect
s
guilt
people
often
ask
why
charges
aren
t
filed
in
an
effort
to
make
a
suspect
go
to
trial
even
if
the
prosecutor
knows
the
trial
will
end
in
an
acquittal
the
reason
for
this
is
that
such
conduct
could
be
construed
as
malicious
prosecution
resources
almost
every
police
agency
believes
it
needs
more
resources
to
solve
and
of
course
prevent
homicides
and
other
serious
gun
crimes
the
plain
truth
however
is
that
the
need
for
additional
resources
especially
personnel
is
much
greater
in
richmond
than
many
other
communities
simply
because
of
the
amount
of
gang
violence
and
the
overall
challenges
of
crime
in
the
city
when
i
ask
members
of
the
public
how
many
sworn
police
officers
we
have
in
richmond
i
get
answers
like
or
we
actually
have
sworn
personnel
which
includes
everyone
from
the
newest
recruit
who
may
still
need
to
go
through
a
basic
police
academy
or
be
partnered
up
with
a
training
officer
for
on
the
job
training
all
the
way
up
to
me
the
chief
about
of
our
personnel
are
patrol
officers
about
another
are
supervisors
patrol
sergeants
and
lieutenants
and
about
between
of
these
personnel
are
on
duty
at
any
given
time
patrolling
the
entire
city
the
remainder
of
our
sworn
staff
are
detectives
officers
assigned
to
special
details
like
the
regulatory
unit
or
recruiting
and
training
as
well
as
administrative
personnel
in
addition
most
people
do
not
realize
that
we
always
have
personnel
on
leave
days
vacation
going
through
mandatory
training
recovering
from
injuries
or
on
long
term
disability
and
otherwise
away
from
the
job
for
a
myriad
of
reasons
there
are
approximately
a
dozen
investigators
available
to
handle
homicides
although
about
half
of
them
are
primarily
assigned
to
work
robberies
homicides
tend
to
come
in
groups
so
the
reality
is
that
these
personnel
can
be
spread
very
thin
homicide
investigators
may
be
called
out
day
or
night
days
a
week
and
then
work
long
long
hours
to
follow
up
on
a
murder
or
serious
shooting
in
that
key
period
following
the
crime
s
thanks
to
the
support
of
the
city
council
and
the
city
manager
rpd
has
been
fortunate
that
our
overall
staffing
levels
have
increased
over
the
past
years
despite
these
increases
however
we
are
still
staffed
below
what
a
city
with
our
level
of
crime
ideally
needs
our
department
utilizes
a
variety
of
technologies
to
assist
us
with
the
investigation
of
violent
crime
including
crime
lab
services
which
come
with
a
hefty
price
tag
through
the
sheriff
s
department
closed
circuit
tv
also
expensive
and
complicated
to
operate
maintain
and
monitor
shotspotter
which
triangulates
gunfire
to
provide
the
location
and
type
of
gun
being
fired
but
it
can
t
help
with
the
fact
that
shooters
generally
don
t
stick
around
for
the
police
and
license
plate
readers
lprs
residents
often
assume
these
technologies
are
available
and
functioning
throughout
the
entire
city
but
because
of
cost
they
are
mostly
limited
to
neighborhoods
with
higher
levels
of
violent
crime
this
is
frustrating
to
many
members
of
the
public
and
police
officers
alike
who
wish
there
was
a
camera
or
a
gunshot
sensor
available
and
operating
in
every
area
where
crimes
occur
the
department
also
relies
on
our
crime
analysis
resources
including
our
ability
to
track
field
contacts
provide
timely
crime
data
to
our
personnel
and
conduct
meaningful
analysis
of
crime
trends
we
have
one
crime
analyst
who
works
behind
the
scenes
with
our
officers
and
detectives
to
track
serious
crimes
including
gang
activity
this
has
to
be
done
carefully
and
accurately
to
protect
people
s
rights
and
to
be
most
effective
thanks
to
recent
action
by
the
city
council
the
department
is
contracting
for
a
service
known
as
predictive
policing
which
is
being
successfully
used
in
other
cities
such
as
los
angeles
and
new
york
city
to
utilize
complex
algorithms
in
predicting
where
future
crimes
are
likely
to
occur
so
greater
resources
can
be
placed
in
these
locations
it
sounds
like
science
fiction
but
this
process
has
a
track
record
of
proven
positive
results
ceasefire
the
richmond
police
department
is
part
of
the
ceasefire
lifelines
to
healing
working
group
and
overall
effort
the
ceasefire
program
cannot
prevent
all
homicides
but
it
is
recognized
as
a
best
practice
around
the
country
to
reduce
shootings
the
ceasefire
program
involves
police
detectives
and
other
key
individuals
identifying
persons
involved
in
or
at
high
risk
for
committing
gun
violence
these
individuals
are
then
called
in
to
participate
in
a
discussion
about
the
law
enforcement
consequences
greater
police
attention
enhanced
prosecution
efforts
etc
for
continuing
to
commit
shootings
they
also
hear
an
important
message
from
the
community
which
is
that
people
care
about
them
and
that
a
support
system
exists
to
help
them
turn
their
lives
around
this
effort
involves
community
groups
service
providers
the
faith
community
formerly
incarcerated
individuals
and
many
others
there
are
no
instant
or
magical
outcomes
associated
with
the
ceasefire
program
but
real
prevention
and
long
term
successes
are
hard
to
measure
and
difficult
to
achieve
this
program
requires
the
persistent
dedication
and
commitment
of
many
people
and
groups
it
also
requires
sufficient
funding
and
resources
to
provide
effective
interventions
to
provide
sustainable
interventions
shooters
who
want
to
make
major
life
changes
often
need
life
skills
training
employment
mental
health
and
substance
abuse
services
anger
management
and
conflict
resolution
skills
education
and
other
assistance
few
of
these
services
are
available
to
the
degree
they
are
needed
in
our
community
despite
the
best
efforts
of
many
groups
and
people
no
giving
up
here
s
one
especially
important
thing
i
d
like
people
to
know
about
our
homicide
investigations
we
don
t
give
up
homicide
cases
are
never
closed
even
when
evidence
is
very
limited
and
no
witnesses
have
come
forward
even
when
we
have
exhausted
all
leads
unsolved
homicide
cases
remain
open
in
case
information
or
evidence
is
developed
later
sometimes
years
later
that
helps
us
solve
a
case
and
charge
a
suspect
a
good
example
of
this
is
a
homicide
case
that
our
investigators
just
made
an
arrest
on
we
know
how
important
this
kind
of
closure
is
to
victims
families
and
friends
it
s
also
important
to
our
personnel
who
have
often
spent
several
thousand
hours
investigating
a
case
our
personnel
are
invested
in
these
cases
another
important
thing
to
keep
in
mind
the
department
offers
a
standing
reward
for
information
leading
to
the
arrest
and
conviction
of
the
person
or
persons
who
committed
any
homicide
even
a
homicide
many
years
ago
lesser
rewards
may
be
available
for
critical
information
that
helps
us
with
other
serious
shooting
cases
i
hope
this
information
has
helped
explain
the
ongoing
work
and
challenges
faced
by
the
police
and
others
in
addressing
the
problem
of
gun
violence
in
our
community
this
work
is
difficult
and
there
are
many
obstacles
to
achieving
success
we
are
fortunate
to
have
considerable
support
and
an
ongoing
commitment
for
this
work
from
our
city
council
and
other
regional
elected
leaders
we
also
have
a
caring
group
of
residents
who
are
highly
invested
in
this
effort
that
said
nothing
is
easy
and
our
needs
remain
considerable
i
appreciate
your
time
in
learning
more
about
these
issues
and
your
willingness
to
partner
with
us
as
we
move

introduction
the
age
of
big
data
has
come
to
policing
in
chicago
police
officers
are
paying
particular
attention
to
members
of
a
heat
list
those
identified
by
a
risk
analysis
as
most
likely
to
be
involved
in
future
violence
n
in
charlotte
north
carolina
the
police
have
compiled
foreclosure
data
to
generate
a
map
of
high
risk
areas
that
are
likely
to
be
hit
by
crime
n
in
new
york
city
the
n
y
p
d
has
partnered
with
microsoft
to
employ
a
domain
awareness
system
that
collects
and
links
information
from
sources
like
cctvs
license
plate
readers
radiation
sensors
and
informational
databases
n
in
santa
cruz
california
the
police
have
reported
a
dramatic
reduction
in
burglaries
after
relying
upon
computer
algorithms
that
predict
where
new
burglaries
are
likely
to
occur
n
the
department
of
homeland
security
has
applied
computer
analytics
to
twitter
feeds
to
find
words
like
pipe
bomb
plume
and
listeria
n
big
data
has
begun
to
transform
government
in
fields
as
diverse
as
public
health
transportation
management
and
scientific
research
n
the
analysis
of
what
were
once
unimaginable
quantities
of
digitized
data
is
likely
to
introduce
dramatic
changes
to
a
profession
which
as
late
as
involved
little
more
than
an
able
bodied
man
who
was
given
a
hickory
club
a
whistle
and
a
key
to
a
call
box
n
real
time
access
to
and
analysis
of
vast
quantities
of
information
found
in
criminal
records
police
databases
and
surveillance
data
may
alter
policing
n
in
the
same
way
that
big
data
has
revolutionized
areas
as
diverse
as
presidential
elections
n
internet
commerce
n
and
language
translation
n
some
have
even
heralded
big
data
s
potential
to
change
our
assumptions
about
social
relationships
government
scientific
study
and
even
knowledge
itself
n
in
the
private
sector
retailers
have
harnessed
big
data
to
produce
some
seemingly
trivial
but
surprising
changes
to
their
practices
n
a
much
discussed
example
stems
from
target
s
extensive
use
of
data
analytics
to
identify
certain
purchases
such
as
supplements
commonly
taken
during
pregnancy
to
know
whether
a
customer
is
pregnant
without
the
woman
disclosing
the
pregnancy
herself
n
for
a
retailer
pregnancy
is
a
prime
opportunity
to
target
a
consumer
when
shopping
habits
change
and
expand
an
irate
father
allegedly
complained
to
target
that
his
daughter
was
unfairly
targeted
as
a
pregnant
woman
with
coupons
only
to
discover
to
his
chagrin
that
target
was
better
informed
than
he
was
n
similarly
walmart
through
its
computerized
retail
tracking
has
discovered
that
strawberry
pop
tarts
and
beer
sell
as
briskly
as
flashlights
when
hurricanes
are
forecast
these
products
were
quickly
shipped
to
florida
walmart
stores
in
the
path
of
hurricane
frances
in
n
yet
unlike
the
data
crunching
performed
by
target
walmart
or
amazon
the
introduction
of
big
data
to
police
work
raises
new
and
significant
challenges
to
the
regulatory
framework
that
governs
conventional
policing
from
one
perspective
the
fourth
amendment
has
proven
remarkably
flexible
over
time
constitutional
law
has
governed
ordinary
policing
whether
the
crimes
involved
bootlegging
n
numbers
running
n
marijuana
farming
n
or
cell
phones
n
as
the
sophistication
of
criminals
has
increased
so
too
have
the
tools
of
the
police
in
the
twentieth
century
perhaps
no
two
tools
have
been
as
revolutionary
to
modern
policing
as
the
two
way
radio
and
the
patrol
car
n
in
this
century
big
data
in
a
variety
of
forms
may
bring
the
next
dramatic
change
to
police
investigations
one
researcher
has
concluded
that
it
will
soon
be
technologically
possible
and
affordable
for
government
to
record
everything
anyone
says
or
does
n
how
well
will
the
fourth
amendment
s
rules
pertaining
to
unreasonable
searches
and
seizures
adapt
to
the
uses
of
big
data
scholars
have
widely
discussed
the
shortcomings
of
applying
fourth
amendment
doctrines
once
adequate
for
a
world
of
electronic
beepers
physical
wiretaps
and
binocular
surveillance
to
rapidly
changing
technologies
n
but
big
data
may
magnify
these
concerns
considerably
this
article
identifies
three
uses
of
big
data
that
hint
at
the
future
of
policing
and
the
questions
these
tools
raise
about
conventional
fourth
amendment
analysis
two
of
these
examples
predictive
policing
and
mass
surveillance
systems
have
already
been
adopted
by
a
small
number
of
police
departments
around
the
country
a
third
example
the
potential
use
of
dna
databank
samples
presents
an
untapped
source
of
big
data
analysis
whether
any
of
these
three
examples
of
big
data
policing
attract
more
widespread
adoption
by
the
police
is
yet
unknown
but
it
likely
that
the
prospect
of
being
able
to
analyze
large
amounts
of
information
quickly
and
cheaply
will
prove
to
be
attractive
while
seemingly
quite
distinct
these
three
uses
of
big
data
suggest
the
need
to
draw
new
fourth
amendment
lines
now
that
the
government
has
the
capability
and
desire
to
collect
and
manipulate
large
amounts
of
digitized
information
i
the
rise
of
big
data
what
is
big
data
while
not
everyone
agrees
on
a
single
definition
of
big
data
most
agree
that
the
term
refers
to
the
application
of
artificial
intelligence
to
the
vast
amount
of
digitized
data
now
available
n
from
this
basic
definition
a
few
observations
emerge
about
what
is
distinct
and
significant
about
big
data
n
first
big
data
alerts
us
to
the
sheer
amount
of
information
that
is
being
produced
rapidly
every
year
in
digital
form
n
the
turn
towards
digitized
information
has
been
rapid
and
dramatic
as
recently
as
the
year
only
a
quarter
of
the
world
s
stored
information
was
digital
the
majority
of
it
was
on

tapes
and
other
similar
non
digital
media

the
opposite
is
true

digital
information
continues
to
grow
at
a
rapid
pace
according
to
ibm
ninety
percent
of

been
generated
in
the
past
two
years

the
executive
chairman
of

has
claimed
that
we
now
create
as
much
information
in
two
days
as
we
did
from
the
beginning
of
human
civilization
to
n
some
have
suggested
that
we
may
run
out
of
ways
to
quantify
numerically
the
amount
of
data
generated

every
piece
of

is
capable
of

second
because
the

also
refers
to
the
artificial

applied
to
these
huge

sets
the
big
data
phenomenon
also
suggests
a
change
in
the
way
we
understand
our
world
if
conventional
scientific
research
begins
with
a
hypothesis
or
question
that
then
shapes
the
collection
of
the
relevant

the
big

phenomenon
turns
such

upside
down

everything
that
is
possible
to
study
another
way
of
stating
that
we
are
approaching
n
all
n
the
existence
of
these
massive
data
sets
permits
sifting
and
resifting
of
the
information
therein
for
multiple
purposes
n
thus
the
library
of
congress
s
continuous
collection
of
tweets
has
interested
researchers
with
questions
as
diverse
as
the
role
of
public
responses
to
smoking
ads
changes
in
investor
sentiments
and
real
time
hurricane
analysis
n
such
massive
quantities
of
information
also
suggest
that
the
very
kinds
of
questions
posed
by
researchers
will
be
different
in
the
big
data
context
with
so
much
data
available
viktor
mayer
schonberger
and
kenneth
cukier
argue
that
two
conventions
of
traditional
research
a
working
hypothesis
and
the
search
for
causality
are
no
longer
necessary
given
the
insights
that
can
be
derived
from
correlations
found
in
big
data
n
the
existence
of
huge
amounts
of
data
permits
research
into
correlations
that
don
t
require
an
underlying
hypothesis
for
instance
google
s
mathematical
models
have
identified
the
forty
five
search
terms
e
g
medicine
for
cough
and
fever
most
strongly
identified
with
historical
flu
data
n
the
resulting
google
flu
trends
has
proven
to
be
remarkably
accurate
in
matching
the
historical
surveillance
data
collected
by
the
centers
for
disease
control
n
thus
we
can
predict
new
outbreaks
of
the
flu
simply
by
identifying
correlations
between
google
search
terms
and
the
spread
of
seasonal
flu
n
these
predictions
are
useful
in
their
predictive
value
even
though
they
provide
no
causal
explanation
much
in
the
same
way
that
amazon
s
algorithms
can
predict
that
you
might
like
a
product
based
on
its
analysis
without
caring
why
n
a
key
contribution
of
big
data
is
the
ability
to
find
useful
correlations
within
data
sets
not
capable
of
analysis
by
ordinary
human
assessment
ii
use
of
big
data
in
policing
across
the
country
some
police
departments
have
taken
notice
that
they
stand
to
benefit
from
big
data
while
the
use
of
big
data
in
the
private
sector
has
raised
concerns
about
consumer
privacy
its
use
by
the
police
raises
even
bigger
questions
about
the
limits
of
using
data
to
justify
surveillance
investigation
and
detention
by
the
police
this
section
discusses
three
of
the
most
important
developments
in
use
of
big
data
by
the
police
crime
prediction
mass
surveillance
and
dna
databanks
a
crime
prediction
predictive
policing
perhaps
the
most
visible
use
of
big
data
by
police
departments
thus
far
has
been
predictive
policing
the
application
of
computer
modeling
to
historical
crime
data
to
predict
future
criminal
activity
n
while
the
police
have
long
tried
to
find
patterns
of
criminal
activity
on
which
to
focus
their
resources
n
predictive
policing
permits
the
police
to
harness
thousands
of
data
points
to
forecast
where
crime
is
likely
to
happen
the
most
basic
models
rely
on
past
crimes
but
data
sources
can
include
factors
as
variable
as
payday
schedules
seasonal
variation
liquor
store
locations
and
potential
escape
routes
n
what
is
new
about
predictive
policing
is
not
the
use
of
quantitative
data
n
in
the
s
the
n
y
p
d
ushered
in
an
era
of
intelligence
based
policing
n
under
commissioner
bill
bratton
the
n
y
p
d
introduced
the
now
famous
compstat
system
n
weekly
meetings
at
the
n
y
p
d
headquarters
at
which
a
revolving
group
of
commanding
officers
around
the
city
gave
accountings
of
themselves
for
the
recent
crime
data
collected
in
their
precinct
n
by
evaluating
performance
by
the
rise
or
fall
of
crime
data
within
their
precincts
compstat
meetings
forced
accountability
upon
commanding
officers
such
data
driven
policing
spread
to
other
departments
around
the
united
states
when
crime
rates
began
to
fall
dramatically
within
new
york
city
n
a
result
the
police
attributed
to
its
reliance
upon
compstat
along
with
the
adoption
of
broken
windows
policing
n
and
aggressive
stop
and
frisk
tactics
n
compstat
and
similar
programs
inspired
by
it
rely
on
the
collection
of
crime
statistics
to
inform
police
decision
making
n
the
innovation
of
predictive
policing
is
the
application
of
artificial
intelligence
to
such
large
data
sets
compstat
relied
heavily
on
the
collection
and
display
of
past
crime
data
predictive
policing
applies
computer
analysis
to
similar
information
the
identification
of
future
geographic
places
likely
to
be
targeted
by
criminals
has
attracted
the
most
attention
these
predictive
models
all
rely
on
well
established
observations
about
the
spatial
distribution
of
criminal
behavior
crime
is
not
found
randomly
across
a
city
but
rather
tends
to
fall
within
limited
and
often
very
small
areas
n
crime
tends
to
be
lumpy
for
instance
researchers
found
that
over
a
fourteen
year
period
about
fifty
percent
of
the
crime
in
seattle
was
limited
to
percent
of
the
city
s
street
segments
n
based
upon
this
connection
between
crime
and
place
computer
models
adopt
different
approaches
towards
the
prediction
of
crime
for
instance
the
santa
cruz
police
department
uses
software
that
assumes
that
crime
patterns
follow
a
pattern
similar
to
earthquake
aftershocks
n
the
software
applies
a
computer
algorithm
to
a
database
representing
five
years
worth
of
crime
data
including
crime
time
location
and
type
to
assess
the
likelihood
of
future
crime
occurring
in
the
geographic
areas
within
the
city
narrowed
to
squares
measured
by
feet
figure
a
n
prior
to
each
shift
santa
cruz
police
officers
receive
information
identifying
such
squares
with
the
highest
probability
of
crime
and
are
encouraged
though
not
required
to
provide
greater
attention
to
these
areas
n
after
its
experimental
introduction
in
the
santa
cruz
police
department
reported
a
significant
drop
in
burglaries
when
compared
to
a
period
prior
to
the
adoption
of
predictive
policing
n
similar
experiments
relying
upon
this
software
are
being
conducted
by
the
police
in
los
angeles
and
seattle
n
see
figure
a
in
original
figure
a
predictive
policing
map
n
other
approaches
may
consider
additional
factors
other
than
the
timing
and
location
of
past
crimes
risk
terrain
theory
for
example
looks
at
the
social
physical
and
behavioral
factors
that
make
it
more
likely
certain
areas
will
be
targeted
by
crime
n
the
resulting
risk
terrain
map
which
gives
each
factor
its
own
mapping
layer
is
a
composite
map
that
assigns
a
risk
assessment
for
all
of
the
factors
associated
with
criminal
activity
n
for
example
police
in
morris
county
new
jersey
use
five
factors
for
their
risk
terrain
modeling
past
burglaries
the
residential
location
of
individuals
recently
arrested
for
property
crimes
the
proximity
to
major
highways
the
geographic
concentration
of
young
men
and
the
location
of
apartment
complexes
and
hotels
n
morris
county
police
attribute
significant
drops
in
violent
and
property
crime
to
a
reliance
on
risk
terrain
modeling
n
a
second
type
of
predictive
technology
focuses
on
the
application
of
algorithms
to
social
media
in
order
to
identify
likely
criminality
based
on
the
role
an
individual
plays
within
a
social
network
n
this
social
network
analysis
n
begins
with
the
assumption
that
social
networks
undergird
many
crimes
an
illegal
drug
dealing
network
may
loosely
follow
the
hierarchical
structure
of
a
legitimate
business
with
suppliers
distributors
buyers
and
financiers
n
indeed
this
type
of
analysis
has
its
roots
in
the
military
study
of
insurgent
groups
abroad
n
the
algorithms
used
in
social
network
software
can
help
police
visualize
the
density
of
connections
an
individual
has
within
a
social
network
these
connections
might
take
the
form
of
exchanges
communications
family
ties
participation
in
crimes
or
affiliations
with
an
organization
n
see
figure
b
in
original

b
hypothetical
social
network
analysis
n
when
used
by
a
police
department
social
network
analysis
might
be
used
to
identify
a
central
node
a
person
with
a
high
degree
of
connectivity
within
the
network
figure
b
n
while
traditional
police
work
might
easily
identify
leaders
within
a
criminal
organization
social
network
analysis
can
identify
those
with
influence
or
those
who
transmit
information
within
the
group
quickly
and
yet
whose
roles
are
not
otherwise
apparent
n
the
software
can
even
reveal
deliberately
concealed
affiliations
even
if
an
individual
suspected
of
being
part
of
a
criminal
organization
does
not
admit
his
affiliation
social
network
software
can
calculate
the
probability
of
his
membership
n
how
does
such
software
help
police
investigations
the
identification
of
a
highly
networked
individual
could
permit
the
police
to
infiltrate
an
organization
in
the
most
efficient
way
or
to
identify
a
hidden
source
of
influence
within
an
organization
for
further
investigation
n
also
by
revealing
hidden
relationships
among
groups
police
can
disrupt
subterfuges
by
rival
criminal
organizations
in
a
gang
war
one
group
likely
to
retaliate
may
not
do
so
directly
for
fear
of
being
targeted
by
the
police
and
instead
may
enlist
an
ally
gang
n
social
network
analysis
can
help
understand
which
alliances
might
require
heightened
surveillance

predictive

data
to

computer

thousands
of

from
multiple
sources

computer
enhanced
mass

grows
out
of
other
policing
techniques
n
while
surveillance
has
long
been
an
essential
tool
of
the
police
what
has
changed
is
its
supporting
technology
sophisticated
yet
inexpensive
the
surveillance
equipment
used
by
the
police
today
produces
enormous
amounts
of
information
often
too
much
for
the
police
to
use
in
an
efficient
way
without
the
help
of
technology
the

has
responded
to
this
big
data
problem
by
creating
a
software
program

the

this
system
gives
the

real
time
access
to
information
that
can
reveal
connections
between
persons
items
and
places
in
ways
that
may
not
be
obvious
to

analysts
the
das
employs

analytic
software
designed
to
detect
threats

claims
that

located
and
where
it
has
been
in

the
das
can
also
check

compare
them

big

perhaps
less

no

important
a
big
data
matter
is
the
collection
of

which
as
of
june
contained
dna
profiles
for
million

million
arrestees

the

used
this
information
to
amass
the
largest
dna

n
police
agencies
around

on
codis
the
shorthand
for
the
system
that
links

to

the
millions

now
accessible
by

police
present
another
potential
use
of
big
data
the
rapid
growth
of
american
dna
databases
can
be
attributed
to
the
ever
expanding
categories
of
those
deemed
eligible
for
compulsory
dna
collection
while
the
first
state
dna
databases
collected
samples
only
from
violent
felons
or
felony
sex
offenders
today
every
state
collects
dna
from
all
convicted
felons

a
majority

the
first
all

state
n
nearly
every
person
convicted
of
a
crime
in

regardless
of
its
gravity
will
be
required
to
submit
a
dna
sample
for
inclusion
in
the
state
s
dna
database
n
the
reliance
of
states
upon
arrestee
dna
collection
appears
to
be
following
a
similar
path
in
louisiana
became
the
first
state
to
authorize
the
collection
of
dna
from
some
categories
of
arrestees
n
today
twenty
eight
more
states
and
the
federal
government
have
followed
louisiana
s
lead
in
requiring
some
categories
of
arrestees
to
provide
dna
samples
n
the
supreme
court
s
decision
in

v
king
n
upholding
compulsory
arrestee
dna
collection

will
likely
mean
that
the
practice
will
expand
to
many
other
states
n
how
do
dna
databases
raise
big
data
questions
first
the
emerging
and
controversial
use
of
familial
matches
is
in
fact
a
big
data
issue
based
on
the
assumption
that
close
relatives
share
more
genetic
information
than
unrelated
individuals
familial
searches
are
searches
of
dna
databases
that
look
for
profiles
that
only
partially
match
the
thirteen
str
markers
n
on
a
dna
profile
n
such
a
search
might
take
place
for
instance
if
a
codis
search
yields
no
identical
match
n
familial
searches
take
advantage
of
the
big
data
set
that
is
codis
the
capability
to
search
millions
of
individual
dna
profiles
n
additional
testing
on
dna
samples
may
be
necessary
to
confirm
potential
matches
n
similar
to
other
uses
of
big
data
a
familial
search
repurposes
genetic
data
collected
for
another
reason
identical
matches
n
critics
of
familial
searches
have
focused
on
issues
of
privacy
and
equity
including
the
concern
that
familial
searches
will
draw
disproportionate
attention
to
racial
and
ethnic
minorities
who
may
be
unfairly
targeted
for
genetic
surveillance
n
yet
if
we
think
of
familial
searches
as
big
data
problems
we
might
also
make
some
useful
connections
to
other
areas
in
which
data
is
being
amassed
in
large
quantities
for
one
purpose
and
later
used
for
another
for
instance
policies
on
familial
searches
might
follow
principles
of
informational
privacy
used
in
other
database
contexts
including
limited
later
analysis
to
the
specific
original
purpose
for
which
the
information
was
collected

this
potential
for
repurposing
is
not
limited
to
familial
searches

codis
either
a

have
focused
only
on
the

profile
to
deny
that
their
collection
and
storage

the
government
raises
serious
privacy
concerns
n
what
is
often
ignored
however
is
that

david

argue
that
the

existence

invites
re
purposing
at
a

practical
and
legal
barriers
bar
this
possibility

federal
law
imposes
conditions

these

raise
new
questions
about
how
best
to
regulate
the
use
of

by
the

in

they
arise
from
three
characteristics
of

the
use
of
artificial
intelligence
the
scale
of
data
storage
and
the
repurposing
of
collected
data
this
section
considers
some
of
the
difficult
questions
that
judges
and
lawmakers
will
face
a
human
judgment
and
police
suspicion
while
popular
accounts
misleadingly
suggest
that
predictive
policing
involves
police
decision
making
controlled
by
computers
n
even
partial
reliance
on
artificial
intelligence
does
raise
important
fourth
amendment
questions
police
are
using
predictive
policing
software
to
direct
them
to
places
where
they
believe
there
is
a
high
likelihood
of
criminal
activity
having
been
directed
there
by
computer
analysis
the
police
must
then
determine
whether
any
persons
located
there
warrant
further
investigation
what
role
should
artificial
intelligence
and
human
judgment
play
in
fourth
amendment
individualized
suspicion
at
a
minimum
ordinary
investigative
detentions
by
the
police
require
reasonable
suspicion
n
based
on
a
totality
of
the
circumstances
n
the
supreme
court
s
decisions
have
permitted
the
police
to
formulate
reasonable
suspicion
based
not
only
on
their
own
personal
observations
but
also
on
other
information
including
fellow
officers
n
tips
even
anonymous
ones
n
and
sometimes
even
on
determinations
that
particular
geographic
locations
may
be
labeled
as
high
crime
areas
n
in
particular
tips
relied
upon
by
the
police
must
be
sufficiently
particularized
to
an
individual
in
some
part
predictive
of
future
activity
and
corroborated
by
the
observation
of
the
police
themselves
n
the
question
here
is
whether
predictive
software
based
on
historical
crime
data
is
similar
to
other
uses
of
third
party
information
that
have
already
been
held
to
support
a
reasonable
suspicion
determination
n
imagine
that
such
software
directs
the
police
to
a
city
block
to
look
for
property
crime
and
they
observe
activity
that
by
itself
may
not
appear
obviously
suspicious
such
as
carrying
a
duffel
bag
or
peering
in
windows
n
a
probabilistic
determination
is
not
exactly
like
an
informant
s
tip
particularly
since
predictive
software
provides
assessments
about
geographic
areas
and
not
persons
n
nevertheless
a
court
might
analogize
computerized
predictions
to
informant
based
predictions
about
specific
places
such
as
drug
houses
and
hourly
motels
to
add
to
the
reasonable
suspicion
assessment
n
while
likely
not
sufficient
on
its
own
to
provide
justification
for
a
stop
because
of
its
lack
of
specificity
with
regard
to
persons
such
predictions
could
form
the
basis
of
police
observation
and
corroboration
n
so
long
as
predictive
software
is
not
the
sole
justification
used
by
police
courts
are
likely
to
accept
its
place
within
the
reasonable
suspicion
analysis
if
for
instance
courts
were
to
borrow
assessments
of
credibility
and
veracity
from
the
informant
context
n
predictive
software
may
provide
more
justification
than
an
anonymous
informant
the
assumptions
and
inputs
of
such
software
after
all
are
capable
of
verification
n
indeed
to
the
extent
that
the
supreme
court
has
emphasized
that
the
reasonable
suspicion
determination
is
to
be
objective
n
reliance
on
a
computer
analysis
of
crime
data
is
arguably
more
objective
than
an
inference
made
by
an
officer
or
a
tip
provided
by
a
third
party
software
with
a
demonstrated
history
of
successfully
predicting
high
crime
areas
based
on
verifiable
crime
data
is
likely
to
be
a
highly
persuasive
factor
in
the
reasonable
suspicion
formulation
indeed
predictive
software
may
remove
some
of
the
problems
raised
by
the
types
of
information
used
informants
particularly
anonymous
ones
can
have
questionable
motivations
in
aiding
the
police
n
in
addition
most
courts
are
highly
deferential
to
generalized
police
judgments
of
what
constitutes
a
high
crime
area
n
software
that
eliminates
undesirable
biases
and
requires
quantitative
precision
can
introduce
more
fairness
into
the
police
decision
making
process
n
some
caveats
remain
however
first
no
predictive
policing
program
is
entirely
objective
the
basic
building
blocks
of
a
predictive
software
program
necessarily
involve
human
discretion
n
the
assumptions
underlying
any
method
of
crime
prediction
rely
upon
the
decision
to
choose
one
model
of
risk
prediction
over
another
the
data
used
to
build
the
models
will
depend
on
discretionary
judgments
about
the
types
of
crimes
used
for
prediction
and
the
type
of
information
used
to
predict
those
crimes
should
a
police
department
focus
on
burglaries
and
if
so
how
are
burglaries
to
be
measured
for
example
reliance
on
arrest
rates
is
surely
problematic
n
because
arrests
themselves
are
discretionary
decisions
that
if
used
as
the
basis
to
justify
more
attention
may
simply
reinforce
unjustified
police
stereotypes
that
certain
neighborhoods
need
heavier
police
attention
n
second
prediction
models
might
nudge
police
judgments
in
favor
of
investigative
detention
in
borderline
cases
because
the
police
rely
too
heavily
on
probabilistic
information
n
if
for
example
a
predictive
model
directs
the
police
to
look
at
a
particular
block
for
burglaries
then
it
may
encourage
the
police
to
see
suspicious
behavior
when
there
may
be
none
n
the
danger
here
is
that
an
overreliance
on
the
objectivity
of
prediction
which
is
in
fact
an
informed
probabilistic
guess
will
be
determinative
rather
than
a
supplement
to
independent
assessments
by
the
police
b
privacy
and
surveillance
big
data
what
we
do
in
public
can
be
seen
by
anyone
and
therefore
we
generally
cannot
claim
those
activities
are
private
that
intuition
is
embodied
in
the
katz
reasonable
expectation
of
privacy
test
to
determine
whether
the
fourth
amendment
applies
to
police
activity
at
all
n
but
does
assuming
the
risk
of
police
surveillance
mean
something
different
when
the
police
have
mass
surveillance
capabilities
computer
enhanced
mass
surveillance
systems
would
seem
to
be
the
latest
example
of
the
increasing
sophistication
of
police
technologies
to
monitor
public
activity
decades
of
police
reliance
upon
cctv
cameras
electronic
beepers
listening
devices
surveillance
aircraft
and
other
similar
sense
enhancements
have
prompted
concerns
that
these
measures
have
significantly
eroded
any
social
sense
of
privacy
individuals
have
in
public
n
indeed
the
supreme
court
has
emphasized
in
a
number
of
cases
that
our
public
activities
movements
and
even
our
literal
physical
characteristics
visible
to
the
public
lack
fourth
amendment
protection
n
moreover
a
line
of
supreme
court
cases
suggests
that
any
scientific
enhancement
of
the
senses
used
by
the
police
to
watch
activity
falls
outside
of
the
fourth
amendment
s
protections
if
the
activity
takes
place
in
public
n
thus
the
supreme
court
concluded
in
united
states
v
knotts
that
police
use
of
an
electronic
beeper
to
follow
a
suspect
surreptitiously
did
not
constitute
a
fourth
amendment
search
n
the
premise
underlying
such
a
conclusion
is
that
if
the
police
could
themselves
pursue
a
suspect
over
the
same
public
roads
then
so
too
could
an
electronic
beeper
concealed
within
a
container
given
to
the
unwitting
suspect
n
the
surveillance
capacities
of
the
police
today
however
far
exceed
even
what
armies
of
police
officers
could
accomplish
without
access
to
big
data
n
that
difference
should
alter
the
absence
of
fourth
amendment
protections
indeed
several
justices
have
recently
indicated
concerns
about
the
big
data
surveillance
capacities
of
the
police
n
for
example
in
united
states
v
jones
n
regarding
the
twenty
eight
day
gps
tracking
of
a
single
suspect
n
five
justices
expressed
concerns
that
long
term
police
surveillance
even
of
a
person
s
public
movements
might
constitute
a
fourth
amendment
search
n
the
premise
here
sometimes
referred
to
as
the
mosaic
theory
is
that
the
danger
to
fourth
amendment
privacy
lies
in
the
aggregation
of
discrete
bits
of
data
even
if
each
piece
standing
alone
would
not
be
subjected
to
constitutional
protections
n
indeed
the
majority
in
knotts
acknowledged
that
dragnet
type
law
enforcement
practices
such
as
twenty
four
hour
surveillance
of
any
citizen
of
this
country
might
raise
a
fourth
amendment
problem
while
the
use
of
a
beeper
did
not
n
not
only
is
the
quantity
of
information
collected
in
the
big
data
context
far
greater
the
very
nature
of
surveillance
itself
is
different
if
conventional
surveillance
involves
the
intentional
tracking
of
one
or
a
few
suspects
by
actual
police
officers
what
happens
when
a
person
emerges
as
a
surveillance
target
as
a
result
of
a
computer
analysis
in
the
traditional
surveillance
context
the
police
have
not
been
constrained
by
the
fourth
amendment
so
long
as
their
investigations
neither
interfered
with
an
individual
s
movements
nor
ranged
beyond
public
spaces
n
as
the
supreme
court
has
observed
there
is
no
constitutional
right
to
be
free
from
police
investigation
n
but
this
surveillance
discretion
may
mean
something
different
in
the
big
data
context
the
intentional
surveillance
of
targeted
individuals
is
not
equivalent
to
the
perpetual
indiscriminate
data
collection
n
of
entire
populations
while
both
approaches
involve
watching
by
the
government
a
program
like
the
n
y
p
d
s
total
domain
awareness
system
differs
from
traditional
surveillance
enough
to
warrant
a
different
approach
n
the
very
quality
of
public
life
may
be
different
when
government
watches
everyone
surreptitiously
and
stores
all
of
the
resulting
information
n
practical
barriers
have
long
served
to
protect
individual
privacy
by
forcing
the
police
to
selectively
apply
their
resources
and
interests
n
but
those
barriers
have
now
largely
eroded
n
the
ability
of
government
to
record
store
and
analyze
nearly
everything
we
do
is
now
becoming
technologically
possible
and
affordable
n
by
it
will
cost
just
two
cents
to
store
all
of
the
audio
data
generated
by
the
average
person
in
one
year
storing
a
year
s
worth
of
a
person
s
movements
generated
by
their
cellphone
will
cost
next
to
nothing
n
these
expanded
capabilities
raise
the
possibility
of
a
surveillance
time
machine
the
capacity
of
the
government
to
identify
a
person
of
interest
and
then
search
retrospectively
through
all
of
the
data
that
has
been
stored
and
collected
about
that
person
n
while
some
people
have
already
changed
their
personal
habits
to
avoid
this
mass
surveillance
many
likely
have
not
n
the
longstanding
doctrines
declaring
that
we
lack
any
fourth
amendment
protections
in
the
public
sphere
should
not
hold
its
traditional
force
once
the
police
deploy
the
tools
of
big
data
n
knowing
exposure
suggests
a
degree
of
control
over
one
s
information
that
is
lacking
when
the
government
is
capable
of
recording
and
storing
every
small
detail
in
perpetuity
n
thus
the
traditional
assumptions
about
fourth
amendment
protections
in
public
spaces
absent
statutory
protections
from
congress
call
out
for
reexamination
and
doctrinal
adaptation
c
repurposing
information
google
s
reuse
of
search
terms
to
identify
flu
outbreaks
represents
an
upending
of
a
core
research
convention
formulate
a
hypothesis
first
and
then
collect
the
appropriate
data
n
with
big
data
we
can
collect
nearly
all
the
data
first
and
apply
the
questions
later
n
indeed
the
data
can
be
analyzed
in
multiple
ways
at
multiple
times
n
it
is
this
repurposing
or
resifting
of
data
that
has
led
to
some
of
big
data
s
unexpected
insights
like
google
s
flu
analysis
when
it
is
the
police
who
sift
through
the
data
however
the
fourth
amendment
is
ill
suited
to
this
particular
relationship
of
data
collection
and
analysis
the
fourth
amendment
is
primarily
interested
in
the
legitimacy
of
how
information
is
acquired
n
if
the
acquisition
is
permissible
how
the
police
use
that
information
thereafter
is
generally
not
subject
to
an
additional
fourth
amendment
challenge
n
this
suggests
that
once
legitimately
within
the
government
s
possession
information
can
be
repurposed
and
reanalyzed
without
any
additional
fourth
amendment
justification
n
in
the
case
of
genetic
information
courts
have
been
generally
dismissive
of
claims
that
individuals
have
any
fourth
amendment
claims
to
dna
samples
once
lawfully
acquired
by
the
police
but
used
for
investigative
purposes
unrelated
to
the
original
justification
for
the
sample
s
collection
n
is
a
secondary
analysis
of
an
individual
s
dna
sample
to
find
a
familial
match
sufficiently
similar
to
an
analysis
to
find
whether
that
same
individual
is
responsible
for
another
crime
are
there
other
sorts
of
information
to
be
derived
from
dna
samples
that
ought
to
require
distinct
fourth
amendment
justifications
repurposing
a
dna
sample
to
look
for
information
regarding
someone
other
than
the
source
of
the
sample
raises
sufficient
privacy
concerns
that
some
further
government
justifications
may
be
necessary
n
such
a
search
does
more
than
identify
again
the
source
of
the
dna
sample
in
a
subsequent
police
investigation
n
the
government
s
ability
to
reanalyze
information
of
any
sort
in
the
age
of
big
data
calls
out
for
a
new
approach
what
courts
could
do
is
shift
the
focus
of
the
fourth
amendment
from
data
collection
to
a
more
rigorous
scrutiny
of
its
intended
uses
by
the
government
n
indeed
harold
krent
proposed
nearly
twenty
years
ago
that
the
repurposing
of
information
by
the
government
obtained
at
an
earlier
time
could
be
deemed
unreasonable
for
fourth
amendment
purposes
n
professor
krent
suggested
for
instance
that
courts
might
consider
whether
the
seizure
of
a
person
s
information
would
have
been
reasonable
had
the
government
articulated
the
later
use
initially
n
the
closer
the
government
s
secondary
purpose
is
to
its
original
purpose
at
the
time
of
acquisition
the
more
likely
it
should
be
that
the
government
could
use
the
data
without
further
justification
the
case
for
fourth
amendment
protections
regarding
repurposed
information
is
stronger
still
should
the
government
one
day
be
interested
in
gleaning
information
from
dna
samples
other
than
matching
profiles
to
crime
scene
samples
here
the
supreme
court
has
hinted
at
a
willingness
to
reassess
the
balance
of
privacy
and
government
utility
at
some
future
date
in
maryland
v
king
n
in
which
the
court
upheld
the
compulsory
collection
of
dna
from
arrestees
n
justice
kennedy
suggested
that
if
in
the
future
police
analyze
dna
samples
to
determine
other
information
that
case
would
present
additional
privacy
concerns
not
present
here
n
the
resolution
by
the
court
regarding
such
a
dispute
may
well
turn
however
on
the
purposes
claimed
by
the
government
to
mine
that
information
in
king
the
court
was
willing
to
permit
defendant
s
cheek
swab
and
the
subsequently
generated
dna
profile
without
individualized
suspicion
because
the
police
were
permitted
to
find
out
king
s
identity
a
term
broad
enough
to
encompass
any
other
crimes
king
had
committed
n
for
now
however
the
court
has
left
open
the
possibility
that
it
may
give
greater
scrutiny
to
some
sorts
of
repurposing
that
plus
the
existing
statutory
protections
on
access
and
disclosure
may
allay
the
concerns
of
many
n
yet
it
would
be
overly
optimistic
to
ignore
two
developments
in
the
other
direction
the
trend
of
fourth
amendment
law
away
from
protection
in
these
secondary
searches
and
the
court
s
recent
expansion
of
what
the
government
may
do
for
purposes
of
identification
when
it
comes
to
genetic
information
n
d
beyond
the
fourth
amendment
apart
from
the
fourth
amendment
challenges
raised
by
big
data
policing
an
uncritical
embrace
of
these
new
technologies
raises
other
concerns
beyond
regulating
the
police
whether
practical
or
abstract
these
concerns
will
be
easily
swept
aside
by
departments
eager
to
be
part
of
the
next
technological
wave
in
policing
first
many
of
these
new
technologies
have
been
developed
by
private
companies
whose
motivations
and
concerns
may
not
always
be
consonant
with
those
of
a
public
police
department
for
instance
ibm
has
spent
billions
acquiring

analytics
companies
in
order
to
develop
and
market
predictive
tools
to
the
police
n
although
predpol
was
initially
developed
by
academics
it
is
now
a
for
profit
company
n
similarly
microsoft
and
the
n
y
p
d
will
profit
from
every
new
police
department
that
adopts
a
total
domain
awareness
system
n
future
interest
in
the
further
analysis
of

samples
will
also
benefit
some
private
laboratories
second
the
introduction
of
new
big
data
technologies
requires
attention
not
only
to
appropriate
regulation
but
also
to
questions
about
how
well
these
privately
developed
tools
actually
help
to
reduce
crime
new
technologies
possess
understandable
appeal
for
departments
seeking
innovative
crime
fighting
strategies
new
strategies
lend
themselves
toward
positive
media
attention
in
a
way
that
a
poorly
attended
community
meeting
in
a
church
basement
does
not
n
yet
for
profit
purveyors
of
big
data
products
may
not
provide
the
best
objective
assessment
of
their
products
the
desirability
of
these
new
technologies
should
not
steer
attention
away
from
questions
about
how
well
they
reduce
crime
and
conserve
limited
public
resources
compared
to
traditional
methods
a
final
concern
is
much
more
fundamental
the
reliance
on
big
data
by
the
police
also
poses
the
risk
that
the
very
definition
of
policing
may
be
changing
the
promise
of
big
data
is
a
vision
of
policing
that
is
driven
and
assessed
by
quantitative
measurements
indeed
those
police
chiefs
that
have
already
embraced
big
data
tout
the
potential
to
rely
on
numbers
when
budgets
for
police
departments
are
shrinking
n
the
problem
however
is
that
a
technocratic
solution
to
crime
is
not
the
only
objective
of
democratic
policing
n
reducing
crime
is
not
the
only
job
of
the
police
policing
as
an
institution
has
never
been
amenable
to
a
single
objective
n
and
indeed
over
time
its
aims
have
shifted
n
what
is
clear
however
is
that
democratic
policing
aims
at
more
than
mere
crime
control
and
at
its
core
relies
on
skills
that
do
not
always
lend
themselves
to
statistical
analysis
no
amount
of
data
driven
policing
is
likely
to
assuage
communities
soured
by
long
histories
of
tension
with
the
police
nor
will
demonstrations
of
little
red
boxes
on
a
smartphone
necessarily
justify
to
a
community
the
need
for
a
heavy
handed
police
presence
conclusion
the
use
of
big
data
is
likely
to
become
an
ordinary
aspect
of
policing
the
application
of
artificial
intelligence
to
crime
data
promises
immediate
and
tangible
benefits
we
can
gain
some
real
insights
about
how
to
direct
police
resources
efficiently
and
effectively
in
ways
that
intuition
tradition
and
limited
information
have
been
unavailing
at
the
same
time
the
reliance
upon
artificial
intelligence
and
the
collection
of
vast
amounts
of
information
poses
some
special
challenges
in
the
policing
context
courts
and
legislatures

see

n
because
such
programs
only
make
predictions
about

is
likely
to
happen
it
would
seem
more
difficult
to
justify
probable
cause
in
the
predictive

analysis

certainly
many
stops
can
ripen
into
full
blown
arrests

more
information
about

suspect
is

known

that
a
common
theme
in

analysis

is
corroboration

while
the
court
in

adopted
a

for

reaffirmed
that
these

commonsense
practical
question

reasonable
suspicion
is
a
less
demanding
standard
than
probable

only
in
the
sense
that
reasonable
suspicion
can
be
established
with
information
that
is
different
in
quantity
or
content
than
that
required
to
establish
probable
cause
but
also
in
the
sense
that
reasonable

can
arise

that
is

introduction
over
the
last
decade
police
departments
have
begun
to
employ
predictive
crime
software
pcs
as
a
tool
designed
to
reduce
crime
by
forecasting
the
likely
locations
of
future
crimes
and
enabling
efficient
resource
allocation
this
software
uses
complex
algorithms
and
regression
models
to
identify
hotspots
or
large
regions
of
increased
criminal
activity
a
number
of
software
companies
such
as
ibm
predpol
and
aseva
develop
this
software
specifically
for
police
departments
this
paper
begins
by
giving
a
brief
history
of
how
data
has
influenced
police
action
in
recent
decades
and
how
police
have
come
to
use
modern
predictive
policing
it
then
proceeds
to
discuss
the
relevant
constitutional
issues
surrounding
stops
and
reasonable
suspicion
n
by
characterizing
areas
of
criminal
activity
this
software
directly
raises
the
issue
of
high
crime
areas
hca
within
the
context
of
fourth
amendment
analysis
n
the
fourth
amendment
provides
the
right
of
the
people
to
be
secure
in
their
persons
houses
papers
and
effects
against
unreasonable
searches
and
seizures
n
in
in
terry
v
ohio
n
the
supreme
court
held
that
an
officer
is
permitted
to
briefly
detain
an
individual
without
violating
his
fourth
amendment
rights
when
he
observes
unusual
conduct
which
leads
him
reasonably
to
conclude
in
light
of
his
experience
that
criminal
activity
may
be
afoot
n
stops
conducted
on
this
basis
have
become
known
as
terry
stops
in
illinois
v
wardlow
n
the
court
relaxed
the
standards
for
determining
reasonable
suspicion
within
hcas
n
this
holding
permits
an
officer
to
find
sufficient
reasonable
suspicion
to
conduct
a
stop
when
a
suspect
flees
upon
sight
of
that
officer
n
more
generally
wardlow
suggests
that
officers
might
reasonably
view
otherwise
innocent
behavior
as
suspicious
when
within
a
hca
n
this
comment
then
discusses
how
predictive
crime
software
impacts
fourth
amendment
analysis
and
the
rights
of
individuals
within
and
around
hotspots
it
also
considers
whether
police
departments
have
established
mechanisms
to
protect
these
rights
from
potential
abuses
to
address
these
issues
this
paper
examines
the
new
york
city
police
department
s
history
of
conducting
stops
and
the
recent
southern
district
of
new
york
case
floyd
v
city
of
new
york
n
findings
suggest
that
the
implementation
of
data
driven
policing
is
particularly
susceptible
to
political
influences
and
policy
driven
decision
making
thus
undermining
pcs
s
purported
objectivity
this
diminished
objectivity
creates
the
risk
for
widespread
erosion
of
individuals
fourth
amendment
protections
finally
this
comment
recommends
that
municipalities
remove
pcs
analysts
from
the
police
command
structure
and
place
them
in
an
independent
agency
structured
to
protect
objective
data
driven
crime
forecasting
and
hotspot
identification
i
background
a
predictive
crime
software
historically
police
departments
have
used
the
standard
policing
model
to
prevent
crime
through
randomized
patrols
designed
to
create
a
perception
of
police
omnipresence
to
deter
crime
in
public
places
n
it
emphasizes
the
importance
of
follow
up
investigations
by
detectives
to
increase
the
solvability
of
the
crimes
n
and
encourages
general
reactive
arrest
policies
to
deter
and
punish
specific
offenders
as
well
as
deter
the
general
public
from
committing
crimes
n
however
because
crimes
tend
to
cluster
geographically
smaller
areas
of
cities
tend
to
contain
a
vastly
disproportionate
amount
of
criminal
activity
n
the
standard
police
model
thus
led
to
inefficient
resource
allocation
n
a
study
found
that
three
percent
of
all
addresses
in
minneapolis
accounted
for
fifty
percent
of
police
service
calls
n
behavior
analysis
has
shown
that
crime
tends
to
cluster
because
retaliations
commonly
occur
through
inter
gang
violence
and
because
burglars
often
return
to
the
same
or
neighboring
house
in
the
days
and
weeks
after
a
crime
n
jeff
brantingham
anthropologist
and
predpol
developer
explained
this
concept
criminals
are
predictable
creatures
if
there
is
an
opportunity
a
streetlight
out
on
a
certain
corner
say
a
criminal
will
exploit
that
opportunity
as
long
as
it
exists
n
although
police
departments
have
historically
lacked
advanced
statistical
analysis
to
determine
the
probable
location
of
future
crime
general
data
collection
allowed
for
rudimentary
analysis
that
has
enabled
police
departments
to
rationally
adjust
resource
allocation

since
the

occurs

instant

the
limited
geographic

despite
the
attempts
of
these
district
and
circuit
courts
to
establish
a
quantifiable
framework
for
delineating
hcas
the
wardlow
court
specifically
stated
that
courts
do
not
have
available
empirical
studies
dealing
with
inferences
drawn
from
suspicious
behavior
and
we
cannot
reasonably
demand
scientific
certainty
from
judges
or
law
enforcement
officers
where
none
exists
n
wardlow
held
that
courts
should
defer
to
an
officer
s
determination
as
to
reasonable
suspicion
based
on
his
or
her
commonsense
judgments
and
inferences
about
human
behavior
n
as
described
above
crime
analysts
necessarily
exercise
a
high
degree
of
discretion
when
deciding
how
to
geographically
represent
regions
of
increased
criminal
activity
n
the
analyst
is
capable
of
tailoring
these
regions
to
tightly
conform
to
crime
incidents
or
link
distant
incidents
to
characterize
larger
regions
n
in
wardlow
by
some
mechanism
independent
of
the
arresting
officer
the
chicago
police
department
identified
certain
areas
within
the
city
s
eleventh
district
d
as
hcas
n
the
officers
stopped
wardlow
while
on
their
way
to
an
area
within
d
known
for
high
narcotics
traffic
n
admittedly
the
officers
had
not
yet
reached
the
area
of
known
criminal
activity
n
however
the
court
permitted
the
officer
to
rely
on
the
nature
of
that
area
to
color
the
character
of
wardlow
s
location
based
upon
the
officer
s
experience
in
investigating
areas
in
which
narcotics
were
sold
it
was
common
for
there
to
be
weapons
in
the
near
vicinity
n
therefore
once
a
crime
analyst
identifies
a
hotspot
or
a
hca
and
transmits
that
information
to
the
street
level
officer
courts
should
defer
to
his
subjective
rationalizations
and
conclusions
drawn
from
his
experience
n
the
supreme
court
has
permitted
officers
to
consider
information
from
sources
such
as
informants
in
their
reasonable
suspicion
analysis
wardlow
cited
adams
v
williams
n
where
a
police
officer
relied
on
an
informant
s
tip
in
conducting
a
terry
like
stop
n
in
illinois
v
gates
aguilar
v
texas
n
and
spinelli
v
united
states
n
the
supreme
court
dealt
with
police
informants
ability
to
provide
qualitatively
sufficient
information
for
a
neutral
detached
magistrate
to
find
probable
cause
until
gates
courts
applied
a
two
prong
test
outlined
in
aguilar
and
spinelli
to
determine
whether
an
informant
s
tip
provides
sufficient
predictive
value
to
establish
probable
cause
and
whether
an
informant
s
tips
can
just
like
hcas
give
suspicious
color
to
the
otherwise
innocent
behavior
contained
in
a
suspect
s
police
report
n
the
pre
gates
test
required
revealing
the
informant
s
basis
of
knowledge
and
providing
sufficient
facts
to
establish
either
the
informant
s
veracity
or
the
reliability
of
the
informant
s
report
n
thus
in
accordance
with
this
test
warrant
applications
necessarily
contain
additional
corroborating
information
to
allow
the
magistrate
to
independently
judge
the
validity
of
the
informant
s
allegation
an
affiant
officer
swearing
upon
its
reliability
would
fail
to
provide
sufficient
ground
for
a
magistrate
to
find
the
allegations
reliable
n
even
if
partially
corroborated
the
magistrate
must
find
the
tip
independently
trustworthy
when
standing
alone
from
the
other
allegations
contained
in
the
application
n
the
informant
must
also
provide
a
sufficient
statement
of
the
underlying
circumstances
from
which
the
informer
derived
his
allegations
and
be
able
to
explain
why
his
statements
are
reliable
n
thus
even
if
an
informant
s
tip
corroborates
other
information
contained
in
the
warrant
application
it
would
fail
to
ripen
into
a
judgment
that
a
crime
was
probably
being
committed
and
provide
a
basis
for
probable
cause
n
however
the
spinelli
majority
held
that
when
incapable
of
explaining
how
the
information
was
gathered
it
is
especially
important
that
the
tip
describe
the
accused
s
criminal
activity
in
sufficient
detail
that
the
magistrate
may
know
that
he
is
relying
on
something
more
substantial
than
a
casual
rumor
circulating
in
the
underworld
or
an
accusation
based
merely
on
an
individual
s
general
reputation
n
justice
white
criticized
the
majority
s
conclusion
that
draper
v
united
states
n
provided
the
proper
benchmark
of
detail
sufficient
for
probable
cause
n
in
draper
the
informant
reported
that
draper
would
arrive
in
denver
on
a
train
from
chicago
on
one
of
two
days
supplied
a
fairly
detailed
physical
description
predicted
that
he
would
be
wearing
a
light
colored
raincoat
brown
slacks
and
black
shoes
would
be
walking
real
fast
and
that
he
would
be
carrying
a
quantity
of
heroin
n
while
the
descriptive
facts
reinforced
the
honesty
of
the
informant
and
were
verified
by
the
officers
at
the
train
station
they
could
have
been
obtained
from
others
and
the
presence
of
narcotics
may
have
been
merely
inferred
from
circumstances
which
a
magistrate
would
find
unacceptable
n
thus
justice
white
rejected
the
majority
s
suggestion
that
when
an
informant
is
right
about
some
things
he
is
more
probably
right
about
other
facts
usually
the
critical
unverified
facts
n
despite
justice
white
s
concerns
the
gates
court
adopted
a
totality
of
circumstances
test
that
dispatched
with
spinelli
s
veracity
prong
n
under
gates
informants
need
not
provide
the
basis
for
their
information
when
they
have
proven
highly
reliable
in
the
past
or
when
corroboration
through
other
sources
of
information
reduced
the
chances
of
a
reckless
or
prevaricating
tale
of
a
highly
detailed
anonymous
tip
n
the
majority
explained
that
probable
cause
does
not
demand
the
certainty
we
associate
with
formal
trials
because
a
court
may
find
a
fair
probability
of
the
information
s
validity
sufficient
through
investigative
corroboration
n
adams
is
particularly
relevant
to
pcs
because
it
deals
with
the
degree
of
information
that
an
officer
might
receive
that
is
insufficient
to
provide
probable
cause
yet
sufficient
to
find
reasonable
suspicion
n
this
case
occurred
pre
gates
and
was
thus
subjected
to
the
higher
aguilar
spinelli
standard
as
a
result
it
would
survive
the
gates
standard
in
adams
a
known
informant
informed
an
officer
that
an
individual
seated
in
a
nearby
vehicle
was
carrying
narcotics
and
had
a
gun
at
his
waist
n
the
officer
then
approached
the
vehicle
tapped
on
the
car
window
and
asked
the
occupant
to
open
the
door
n
when
the
occupant
rolled
down
the
window
the
officer
reached
into
the
car
and
removed
a
fully
loaded
revolver
from
his
waistband
n
while
the
gun
was
not
initially
visible
to
the
officer
outside
the
car
it
was
in
the
precise
location
indicated
by
the
informant
n
the
plaintiff
challenged
the
legitimacy
of
the
search
and
seizure
of
his
weapon
under
terry
for
lacking
a
reliable
informant
or
some
corroboration
of
the
tip
n
the
court
explained
that
an
officer
is
not
prohibited
from
investigating
possible
criminal
behavior
in
the
absence
of
probable
cause
and
that
the
fourth
amendment
does
not
require
a
policeman
who
lacks
the
precise
level
of
information
necessary
for
probable
cause
to
arrest
to
simply
shrug
his
shoulders
and
allow
a
crime
to
occur
or
a
criminal
to
escape
n
thus
even
if
an
informant
s
unverified
tip
may
have
been
insufficient
for
a
narcotics
arrest
or
search
warrant
the
information
may
carry
enough
indicia
of
reliability
to
justify
the
officer
s
forcible
stop
n
the
fact
that
the
officer
knew
the
informant
provided
a
sufficient
indicia
of
reliability
but
informants
tips
like
all
other
clues
and
evidence
vary
greatly
in
their
value
and
reliability
n
as
a
result
some
tips
might
require
further
investigation
whereas
others
such
as
when
a
victim
is
on
the
street
seeking
immediate
police
aid
and
provides
a
description
may
warrant
a
more
immediate
police
response
n
officers
may
reasonably
integrate
pcs
analysis
into
their
reasonable
suspicion
calculus
as
a
type
of
known
informant
in
the
same
way
the
informant
in
adams
provided
a
basis
for
the
officer
to
reasonably
heighten
his
suspicion
of
criminal
activity
n

have
sought

bases

to
rely

wardlow
upheld
the
officer
s
practice
of
combining
his
experience
with
information
that
defined
another
area
as
a
hca
to
characterize
the
area
in
which
he
stopped
the
suspect
even
if
we
assume
that
the
primary
hca
had
some
empirical
basis
the
officer
had
combined
this
information
with
his
personal
experience
to
expand
that
region
to
characterize
the
location
of
wardlow
s
arrest
as
one
in
which
suspects
may
possess
weapons
n
under

adams
information

not
provide
grounds
for

the

plays
an

the

on

the
subjective

if

these

expand
the

centers
on

argues
this
approach
would

particularized
crime
pattern
in
a

observations

this
is
done
by
applying
an
empirical
approach
to
high
crime
areas

to
introduce
objective
verifiable
data
about
the
level
of

particular

to
particularized

circumscribed

this
data
be
known
to

making
the
arrest

to
establish
the
nexus
between
the
relevance
of
the
high
crime
area
and
the
reasonable
suspicions
of
the
officer
the
trial
court
must
then
make
factual
findings
about
whether
the
area
was
objectively
a
high
crime
area

the
trial
court
must
then
analyze
whether
this
fact
affected
the

suspicion
analysis

not

considered
n
ferguson
s
proposal
is
untenable
under

something
more

the
experience

must
meet
stringent
criteria
i
think
integrity
is
key
she
said
it
should
be
somebody
who
s
experienced
in
law
enforcement
and
who
has
the
confidence
of
law
enforcement
personnel
he
should
be
a
good
manager
politically
savvy
and
with
a
great
deal
of
courage
to
take
on
the
different
issues
that
confront
the
county
from
homeland
security
to
modern
approaches
toward
law
enforcement
even
inmate
rehabilitation
and
penal
reform
she
added
if
a
candidate
were
to
win
the
majority
of
votes
on
june
the
county
board
of
supervisors
could
remove
interim
sheriff
john
scott
and
appoint
the
sheriff
elect
to
lead
the
department
immediately
if
no
candidate
exceeds
percent
the
top
two
would
face
a
runoff
election
on
nov
and
the
winner
would
be
sworn
in
dec
if
voters
choose
poorly
the
consequences
can
be
costly
literally
county
taxpayers
paid
about
million
last
year
in
settlements
and
jury
verdicts
for
illegal
behavior
on
the
part
of
the
sheriff
s
department
american
civil

legal

peter

said
i
believe
most
taxpayers
would
rather
spend
that
on
new
parks
a
better
health
care
system
et
cetera
than
jury
verdicts
and
settlements
for
sheriff
s
department
malfeasance
he
added
if
voters
make
a
mistake
they
may
have
to
live
with
it
for
a
long
long
time
there
are
no
term
limits
on
a
sheriff
even
though
incumbents
are
up
for
re
election
every
four
years
they
have
virtually
insurmountable
advantages
over
challengers
to
be
viable
candidates
would

county
from
the

to
the
san

san

the

it

mcdonnell
said
i
have
no

within

that
could
cloud
that
and
i
ve
been
involved
in
the
transformation
of
two
police
departments
that
had
issues
i
sat
on
the
citizens
commission
on
jail
violence
and
got
an
education
on
what
was
wrong
and
what
needed
to
be
done
in

throughout

he
added
gardena

was
once

falling

the

important
for

the
job
training
the

however
blamed
tanaka
for
some
of
the
abuses
at
the

citing
evidence
that
he
urged
deputies
to
be
aggressive
and
function
right
on

of

work
in

trusted
the

saying
the

apples
were

also

responding

olmsted

they

malfeasance
he
added
if

they
may
have

there
are
no

they

the

the

changing

at

the

training
the

however
blamed
tanaka
for
some
of

at

citing
evidence
that
he
urged

to
be
aggressive
and
function
right
on

rogers
believes

trusted
the

people
saying
the

is
bad
apples
were
given

much

they

public

simply

he
said
it
also
means
responding

quickly
ensuring

what
happened
to
this

olmsted
said
the

set
the
tone
and
they
created
a
culture
where
rogue
deputies
and
the

staff
violated
the

and
their

retired

supposedly
because
he
challenged

he
ended
up
winning
a
nearly

gomez
vowed
to
correct
the
failings
of
the
previous

and
urged

to
reject

who
had
been
in

i
cannot
sit
back
and
let
them
destroy
the

any
more
than
they
already
have
he

los

senior
detective
supervisor
lou
vince
is
a
former
marine
who
also
volunteered
in
the
lasd
as
a
reserve
deputy
sheriff
for
four
years
and
holds
a
master
s

in

he
plans
to
enhance
crime
fighting
by
using
computer
statistics
and
predictive

and
to
install
additional
cameras
even
in
patrol
cars
to
increase

i
don
t
believe
the
sheriff
s
department
has
been
beset
by
corruption
or
scandal
i
believe
it
s
been
best
by
poor
management
poor
leadership
he
said
choose
wisely
levenson
the
criminal
law
professor
said
the
new
sheriff
must
meet
stringent
criteria
i
think
integrity
is
key
she
said
it
should
be
somebody
who
s
experienced
in
law
enforcement
and
who
has
the
confidence
of
law
enforcement
personnel
he
should
be
a
good
manager
politically
savvy
and
with
a
great
deal
of
courage
to
take
on
the
different
issues
that
confront
the
county
from
homeland
security
to
modern
approaches
toward
law
enforcement
even
inmate
rehabilitation
and
penal
reform
she
added
if
a
candidate
were
to
win
the
majority
of
votes
on
june
the
county
board
of
supervisors
could
remove
interim
sheriff
john
scott
and
appoint
the
sheriff
elect
to
lead
the
department
immediately
if
no
candidate
exceeds
percent
the
top
two
would
face
a
runoff
election
on
nov
and
the
winner
would
be
sworn
in
dec
if
voters
choose
poorly
the
consequences
can
be
costly
literally
county
taxpayers
paid
about
million
last
year
in
settlements
and
jury
verdicts
for
illegal
behavior
on
the
part
of
the
sheriff
s
department
american
civil
liberties
union
legal
director
peter
eliasberg
said
i
believe
most
taxpayers
would
rather
spend
that
on
new
parks
a
better
health
care
system
et
cetera
than
jury
verdicts
and
settlements
for
sheriff
s
department
malfeasance
he
added
if
voters
make
a
mistake
they
may
have
to
live
with
it
for
a
long
long
time
there
are
no
term
limits
on
a
sheriff
even
though
incumbents
are
up
for
re
election
every
four
years
they
have
virtually
insurmountable
advantages
over
challengers
to
be
viable
candidates
would
need
to
wage
an
expensive
campaign

county
from
the
los

basin
to
the
san
fernando
san
gabriel
santa
clarita

the
sheriff

was
created
in

miriam

stressed
a

is
vital
to

until
there
s
new

and
an
ongoing
independent
civilian
eye
similar
to
the

that
never
moves
the
spotlight
away
from

we
re
going
to
see
some
of

negative

repeat
themselves
she

james

spent
the

at

the

however
blamed
tanaka
for
some
of

be
aggressive
and

the

shaped

tarnished
by

reforms
are

but
miriam
krinsky
executive
director
of
the
blue

citizen
s
commission
on

violence
stressed
a
new
sheriff
is
vital
to
restoring
the
confidence
of
the
community
unless
and
until
there
s
new
leadership
and
an
ongoing
independent
civilian
eye
similar
to
the
ccjv
that
never
moves
the
spotlight
away
from
the
department
we
re
going
to
see
some
of
these
negative
cycles
repeat
themselves
she
warned
the
reforms
are
a
work
in
progress
agreed
supervisor
zev
yaroslavsky
it
ll
be
up
to
the
next
sheriff
to
implement
the
changes
the
candidates
james
mcdonnell
is
the
only
department
outsider
in
the
race
having
spent
the
bulk
of
his
career
at
the
los
angeles
police
department
where
he
was
second
in
command
to
former
chief
william
bratton
now
chief
of
the
long
beach
police
department
mcdonnell
has
what
is
arguably
the
most
impressive
list
of
endorsements
including
those
of
state
attorney
general
kamala
harris
county
district
attorney
jackie
lacey
and
supervisors
don
knabe
and
yaroslavsky
i
d
bring
in
a
fresh
perspective
as
an
outsider
mcdonnell
said
i
have
no
relationships
within
the
organization
that
could
cloud
that
and
i
ve
been
involved
in
the
transformation
of
two
police
departments
that
had
issues
i
sat
on
the
citizens
commission
on
jail
violence
and
got
an
education
on
what
was
wrong
and
what
needed
to
be
done
in
the
jails
and
throughout
the
lasd
he
added
gardena
mayor
paul
tanaka
was
once
baca
s
second
in
command
until
they
had
a
bitter
falling
out
the
former
undersheriff
is
also
a
certified
public
accountant
and
served
as
the
department
s
budget
manager
as
a
year
veteran
of
the
department
i
m
the
only
candidate
who
has
the
institutional
knowledge
that
is
critical
for
restoring
trust
and
credibility
to
the
organization
he
said
the
position
of
sheriff
is
too
big
and
too
important
for
on
the
job
training
the
commission
however
blamed
tanaka
for
some
of
the
abuses
at
the
jails
citing
evidence
that
he
urged
deputies
to
be
aggressive
and
function
right
on
the
edge
of
the
line
or
work
in
the
gray
area
somewhere
between
what
is
legal
and
not
two

todd
rogers
is
currently
in
charge
of
budget
and
personnel
while
assistant
sheriff
james
hellmold
directs
the
patrol
and
detective
divisions
rogers
believes
baca
trusted
the
wrong
people
saying
the
problem
is
bad
apples
were
given
too
much
authority
they
were
not
qualified
and
they
seriously
abused
that
authority
he
added
that
is
unacceptable
and
i
will
bring
reforms
hellmold
advocates
fulfilling
the
department
s
core
functions
while
embracing
new
technologies
public
safety
simply
means
continuing
the
lowest
crime
levels
in
more
than
years
he
said
it
also
means
responding
to
calls
for
service
quickly
ensuring
emergency
preparedness
and
school
safety
and
modernizing
the
sheriff
s
department
to
deal
with
the
rising
cybercrime
and
identity
theft
retired
sheriff
s
commander
robert
olmsted
touts
himself
as
the
whistleblower
who
alerted
the
fbi
about
the
misconduct
at
the
jails
it
s
shameful
what
happened
to
this
great
department
olmsted
said
the
leaders
set
the
tone
and
they
created
a
culture
where
rogue
deputies
and
the
command
staff
violated
the
law
and
their
sacred
oath
retired
sheriff
s
lieutenant
patrick
gomez
ran
against
baca
in
and
he
once
sued
the
department
for
denying
him
promotions
and
harassing
his
family
supposedly
because
he
challenged
baca
he
ended
up
winning
a
nearly
million
payout
gomez
vowed
to
correct
the
failings
of
the
previous
leadership
and
urged
voters
to
reject
candidates
who
had
been
in
baca
s
inner
circle
i
cannot
sit
back
and
let
them
destroy
the
department
any
more
than
they
already
have
he
said
los
angeles
police
department
senior
detective
supervisor
lou
vince
is
a
former
marine
who
also
volunteered
in
the
lasd
as
a
reserve
deputy
sheriff
for
four
years
and
holds
a
master
s
degree
in
criminology
he
plans
to
enhance
crime
fighting
by
using
computer
statistics
and
predictive
policing
and
to
install
additional
cameras
even
in
patrol
cars
to
increase
transparency
i
don
t
believe
the
sheriff
s
department
has
been
beset
by
corruption
or
scandal
i
believe
it
s
been
best
by
poor
management
poor
leadership
he
said
choose
wisely
levenson
the
criminal
law
professor
said
the
new
sheriff
must
meet
stringent
criteria
i
think
integrity
is
key
she
said
it
should
be
somebody
who
s
experienced
in
law
enforcement
and
who
has
the
confidence
of
law
enforcement
personnel
he
should
be
a
good
manager
politically
savvy
and
with
a
great
deal
of
courage
to
take
on
the
different
issues
that
confront
the
county
from
homeland
security
to
modern
approaches
toward
law
enforcement
even
inmate
rehabilitation
and
penal
reform
she
added
if
a
candidate
were
to
win
the
majority
of
votes
on
june
the
county
board
of
supervisors
could
remove
interim
sheriff
john
scott
and
appoint
the
sheriff
elect
to
lead
the
department
immediately
if
no
candidate
exceeds
percent
the
top
two
would
face
a
runoff
election
on
nov
and
the
winner
would
be
sworn
in
dec
if
voters
choose
poorly
the
consequences
can
be
costly
literally
county
taxpayers
paid
about
million
last
year
in
settlements
and
jury
verdicts
for
illegal
behavior
on
the
part
of
the
sheriff
s
department
american
civil
liberties
union
legal
director
peter
eliasberg
said
i
believe
most
taxpayers
would
rather
spend
that
on
new
parks
a
better
healthcare
system
et
cetera
than
jury
verdicts
and
settlements
for
sheriff
s
department
malfeasance
he
added
if
voters
make
a
mistake
they
may
have
to
live
with
it
for
a
long
long
time
there
are
no
term
limits
on
a
sheriff
even
though
incumbents
are
up
for
re
election
every
four
years
they
have
virtually
insurmountable
advantages
over
challengers
to
be
viable
candidates
would
need
to
wage
an
expensive
campaign
throughout
the
square

county
from
the
los

basin
to
the
san
fernando
san
gabriel
santa
clarita
and
antelope
valleys
and
even
catalina
island
the
sheriff
s
department
was
created
in
back
when
los
angeles
was
the
wild
west
and
deputies
rode
in
posses
and
yet
baca
is
only
its
th
sheriff
he
and
his
predecessor
sherman
block
each
served
years
neither
was
unseated
by
a

baca
retired
and

died
in

only
days
before
the
election
in
which
baca
challenged
him
before
them
peter
pitchess
and
eugene
biscailuz
were
in
office
and
years
respectively
voters
need
to
get
this
right

after

allegedly
maltreated
her

i
don
t
believe

by

he

levenson
the
criminal

said
the

must
meet
stringent
criteria
i
think
integrity
is
key
she
said
it
should
be
somebody
who
s
experienced
in
law
enforcement
and
who
has
the
confidence
of
law
enforcement
personnel
he
should
be
a
good
manager
politically
savvy
and
with
a
great
deal
of
courage
to
take
on
the
different
issues
that
confront
the
county
from
homeland
security
to
modern
approaches
toward
law
enforcement
even
inmate
rehabilitation
and
penal
reform
she
added
if
a
candidate
were
to
win
the
majority
of
votes
on
june
the
county
board
of
supervisors
could
remove
interim
sheriff
john
scott
and
appoint
the
sheriff
elect
to
lead
the
department
immediately
if
no
candidate
exceeds
percent
the
top
two
would
face
a
runoff
election
on
nov
and
the
winner
would
be
sworn
in
dec
if
voters
choose
poorly
the
consequences
can
be
costly
literally
county
taxpayers
paid
about
million
last
year
in
settlements
and
jury
verdicts
for
illegal
behavior
on
the
part
of
the
sheriff
s
department
american
civil

union
legal
director
peter
eliasberg
said
i
believe
most
taxpayers
would
rather
spend
that
on
new
parks
a
better
healthcare
system
et
cetera
than
jury
verdicts
and
settlements
for
sheriff
s
department
malfeasance
he
added
if
voters
make
a
mistake
they
may
have
to
live
with
it
for
a
long
long
time
there
are
no
term
limits
on
a
sheriff
even
though
incumbents
are
up
for
re
election
every
four
years
they
have
virtually
insurmountable
advantages
over
challengers
to
be
viable
candidates
would
need
to
wage
an
expensive
campaign
throughout

county
from
the
los

basin
to
the
san
fernando
san
gabriel
santa
clarita
and

valleys
and
even

the
sheriff
s

was
created
in
back
when
los

was
the

and
deputies
rode
in

peter

miriam

stressed
a

is
vital
to
restoring

there
s
new
leadership
and
an
ongoing
independent
civilian
eye
similar
to

that
never
moves

away
from

we
re
going

see
some
of
these
negative
cycles
repeat
themselves
she
warned
the

are
a
work
in

agreed
supervisor
zev
yaroslavsky
it
ll
be
up
to
the
next

to
implement
the
changes
the
candidates
james
mcdonnell
is
the
only
department
outsider
in
the
race
having
spent
the
bulk
of
his
career
at
the
los

police
department
where
he
was
second
in
command
to
former
chief
william
bratton
now
chief
of
the

police

mcdonnell
has
what

attorney
jackie

and

i
d
bring

as
an

mcdonnell
said
i
have
no
relationships
within
the
organization
that
could
cloud
that
and
i
ve
been
involved
in
the
transformation
of
two
police
departments
that
had
issues
i
sat
on
the
citizens
commission
on
jail
violence
and
got
an
education
on
what
was
wrong
and
what
needed
to
be
done
in
the
jails
and
throughout
the
lasd
he
added
gardena
mayor
paul
tanaka
was
once
baca
s
second
in

until
they
had
a
bitter
falling
out
the
former

and
served
as
the

s
budget
manager
as
a

veteran

i
m
the
only
candidate
who
has
the

knowledge
that
is
critical
for
restoring

credibility
to
the
organization
he
said
the
position
of
sheriff
is
too
big
and
too
important
for
on
the
job
training
the
commission
however
blamed
tanaka
for
some
of
the
abuses
at
the
jails
citing
evidence
that
he
urged
deputies
to
be
aggressive
and
function
right
on
the
edge
of
the
line
or
work
in
the
gray
area
somewhere
between

currently
in

and

while

directs

rogers
believes
baca
trusted
the
wrong
people
saying
the
problem
is
bad
apples
were
given
too
much
authority
they
were
not
qualified
and
they
seriously
abused

he
added
that
is
unacceptable
and
i
will
bring

hellmold
advocates
fulfilling
the
department
s
core
functions
while
embracing

public
safety
simply
means
continuing
the
lowest
crime
levels
in
more
than
years
he
said
it
also
means
responding
to
calls
for
service
quickly
ensuring
emergency
preparedness
and
school
safety
and
modernizing
the
sheriff

to
deal
with

touts
himself
as
the

who
alerted
the

about
the
misconduct
at
the

it
s
shameful
what
happened
to
this
great
department
olmsted
said
the
leaders
set
the
tone
and
they
created
a
culture
where
rogue
deputies
and
the
command
staff
violated
the
law
and
their
sacred
oath
retired
sheriff
s
lieutenant
patrick
gomez
ran
against
baca
in

he
once
sued
the

for
denying
him
promotions
and
harassing
his
family
supposedly
because
he
challenged
baca
he
ended
up
winning
a
nearly
million
payout
gomez
vowed
to
correct
the
failings
of
the
previous
leadership
and
urged
voters
to
reject
candidates
who
had
been
in
baca
s
inner
circle
i
cannot
sit
back
and
let
them
destroy
the

any
more
than
they
already
have
he

lou

also
volunteered
in

as

deputy

he
plans

fighting
by
using
computer

and
to
install

even
in

to
increase

i
don
t
believe
the
sheriff
s

has
been
beset
by
corruption
or
scandal
i
believe
it
s
been
best
by
poor

poor

he

said
the

she
said
it
should
be
somebody
who
s

who
has
the

he
should
be
a

with
a

take
on

different
issues
that
confront
the
county
from

to
modern

toward

even

she
added
if
a

were
to
win
the

the

could
remove

the

if

poorly
the

literally

a
better

et

than
jury

for

malfeasance
he
added
if

they
may
have

there
are
no

got
an

training
the

however
blamed
tanaka
for
some
of

at

citing
evidence

be

and

rogers
believes

trusted
the

saying
the

is
bad
apples
were
given
too
much

they
were
not

and
they

that
is

and
i

hellmold

fulfilling
the

s

while
embracing

public
safety
simply
means
continuing
the
lowest

in
more
than
years
he
said
it
also
means
responding
to
calls
for

quickly
ensuring
emergency

and
school
safety
and
modernizing

touts
himself
as
the
whistleblower
who
alerted
the
fbi
about
the
misconduct
at
the

it
s
shameful
what
happened
to
this
great
department
olmsted
said
the
leaders
set
the
tone
and
they
created
a
culture
where
rogue
deputies
and
the
command
staff
violated
the
law
and
their
sacred
oath
retired

patrick
gomez
ran
against
baca
in

he
once
sued
the
department
for
denying
him
promotions
and
harassing
his
family
supposedly
because
he
challenged
baca
he
ended
up
winning
a
nearly
million
payout
gomez
vowed
to
correct
the
failings
of
the
previous
leadership
and
urged
voters
to
reject
candidates
who
had
been
in
baca
s
inner

i
cannot
sit
back
and
let
them
destroy
the

any
more
than
they
already
have
he

senior

supervisor
lou

is
a
former

who
also
volunteered
in
the
lasd
as
a
reserve
deputy
sheriff
for
four
years
and
holds
a

he
plans
to

fighting
by
using
computer
statistics
and
predictive

and
to
install
additional

even
in

to
increase

i
don
t
believe
the
sheriff
s

has
been
beset
by
corruption
or
scandal
i
believe
it
s
been
best
by
poor

poor

he
said
choose
wisely
levenson
the
criminal
law
professor
said
the
new

must
meet
stringent
criteria
i
think
integrity
is
key
she
said
it
should
be
somebody
who
s
experienced
in
law
enforcement
and
who
has
the
confidence
of
law
enforcement
personnel
he
should
be
a
good
manager
politically
savvy
and
with
a
great
deal
of
courage
to
take
on
the
different
issues
that
confront
the
county
from
homeland
security
to
modern
approaches
toward

even

she
added
if
a

were
to
win
the

of

on

the
county
board
of

could
remove
interim
sheriff
john
scott
and
appoint
the

elect
to

immediately
if
no

the
top
two
would
face

election
on

and
the

would
be

in

if

choose
poorly
the
consequences
can
be
costly
literally
county
taxpayers

a
better
healthcare
system
et

than
jury

and

for

s
department
malfeasance
he
added
if
voters
make
a
mistake
they
may
have
to
live
with
it
for
a
long
long
time
there
are
no
term
limits
on
a
sheriff
even
though
incumbents
are
up
for
re

every
four
years
they
have
virtually
insurmountable
advantages
over
challengers
to
be

county
from

to
the

the

was
created
in

when
los

was

and
deputies
rode

billy

used
what
was
then
considered
massive
amounts
of
statistical

to
predict

baseball
players
beane
built
a
winning
ballelub
by
collecting
promising
players
identified
by
his
statistical
models
who
had
been
passed
over
by
other
teams
these
players
then
went
on
to
overachieve
at
a
startling
rate
beane
succeeded
by
replacing
the
traditional
method
of
evaluating
baseball
talent
being
used
by
most
major
league
clubs
with
something
new
in
the
traditional
method
older
experienced
baseball
men
scouted
players
watching
the
players
perform
and
using
their
accumulated
wisdom
and
judgment
to
identify
those
players
who
they
believed
would
succeed
into
the
future
these
scouts
were
indeed
the
qualitative
experts
of
baseball
at
the
time
but
beane
saw
the
value
in
analyzing
past
performance
data
in
a
more
sophisticated
and
rigorous
way
to
dramatically
improve
the
building
of
a
baseball
team
by
more
accurately
predicting
the
future
performance
of
players
than
scouts
ever

the
sentencing
reform
movement
of
the
s
and
s
replaced
the
rehabilitative
model
of
sentencing
that
had
been
in
place
from
the
earliest
days
of
the
republic
with
a
new
sentencing
framework
based
on
truth
in
sentencing
and
the
idea
that
a
criminal
sentence
should
largely
be
based
on
the
crime
committed
the
foundation
of
the
new
system
was
the
belief
that
reducing
reoffending
was
not
a
task
worth
pursuing
that
nothing
worked
to
change
offending
behavior
and
that
excessive
discretion
in
charging
sentencing
and
parole
decisions
had
led
to
unwarranted
disparities
and
discriminatory
impacts
on
the
poor
and
people
of
color
it
was
thought
that
certainty
in
sentencing
certainty
in
the
imposition
of
a
particular
sentence
for
a
particular
crime
and
certainty
in
the
time
to
be
served
for
a
sentence
imposed
would
simultaneously
improve
public
safety
by
deterring
new
criminality
and
also
increase
fairness
in
sentencing
by
reducing
unwarranted
sentencing
disparities
this
new
determinate
system
of
sentencing
did
not
depend
largely
on
predicting
future
behavior
for
sentences
were
based
primarily
on
the
offender
s
past
criminal
conduct
the
sentencing
reform
movement
not
only
brought
with
it
a
new
framework
for
sentencing
but
also
led
as
we
and
many
others
have
documented
to
an
extraordinary
increase
in
the
use
of
incarceration
the
attorney
general
has
written
and
spoken
regularly
about
the
increase
in
the
nation
s
prison
population
over
the
last
three
decades
and
why
in
particular
it
is
imperative
that
we
control
federal
prison
spending
the
commission
s
recent
vote
to
reset
guideline
offense
levels
for
drug
trafficking
offenses
is
an
important
step
to
meeting
that
imperative
we
continue
to
work
with
congress
and
the
commission
to
find
ways
to
adequately
control
the
federal
prison
population
while
simultaneously
ensuring
public
safety
we
have
also
previously
noted
how
the
increase
in
the
prison
population
led
to
an
explosion
in
the
number
of
people
returning
to
the
community
each
year
from
stints
in
prison
n
then
attorney
general
janet
reno
and
then

of

director
jeremy

recognized
this
phenomenon
in
the
late
s
and
much
has
been
done
to
focus
on
effectively
preparing
offenders
to
return
to
the
community
various
efforts
to
reduce
reoffending
have
yielded
promising
results
and
legislators
prosecutors
courts
and
probation
offices
around
the
country
are
focusing
more

in

we
believe
such
use
has
the
potential
to
dramatically
improve
performance
of

to
transform
the
work
of
probation

it
holds
the

make
it

more

than
it
is

and
also
a

more
palatable
alternative
to

in
certain
cases
the
deployment
of
analytics
and
other
information

in
furtherance
of
reentry
can
improve
risk
and
needs
assessments
but
also
has
the
potential
to
do
far
more
for
example
we
believe
that
properly
deployed
analytics
and
information
technology
more
generally
can
provide
early
warnings
when
an
offender
is
straying
from
her
reentry
plan
they
can
enable
faster
responses
from
probation
officers
to
get
an
offender
back
on
track
they
can
provide
more
effective
delivery
of
needed
services
the
real
time
awareness
to
let
probation
officers
know
what
s
happening
on
the
ground
moment
by
moment
and
real

feedback
comparing
what
s
happening
relative
to
what
was
intended
effective
service
delivery
combined
with
swift
certain
and
fair
responses
to
misconduct
the
keys
to
successful
corrections
can
be
greatly
facilitated
by
these
technologies
and
analytics
we
think
the
role
effectiveness
and
efficiency
of
community
corrections
and
individual
probation
officers
could
be
dramatically
reengineered
with
the
use
of
varied
technologies
and
analytical
tools
and
that
recidivism
rates
can
be
brought
down
on
the
same
scale
that
violent
crime
has
been
reduced
over
the
last
two
decades
linking
diverse
datasets
deploying
analytics
and
applying
advances
in
knowledge
of
human
behavior
we
believe
will
all
be
part
of
that
reengineering
as

jersey

anne
milgram
stated
the
returns
for
better
applying
technology
in
criminal
justice
extend
far
beyond
reducing
crime
or
costs
to
something
that
government
officials
are
sworn
to
uphold
justice
n
the
research
and
development
around
this
potential
transformation
is
something
the
sentencing
commission
is
in
a
unique
position
to
accomplish

prominent
place
in

was
enacted
to
reduce
the
role
of
such
assessments
and
to
base
imprisonment
terms
largely
but
not
entirely
on
the
crime
committed
and
proven
in
court
in
recent
years
states
are
increasingly
adding
risk
assessments
to
the
criminal

process
pennsylvania

first
most
current
risk
assessments
and
in
particular
the
pcra
which
is
specifically
mentioned
in
the
pending

legislation
determine
risk
levels
based
on
static
historical
offender
characteristics
such
as
education
level
employment
history
family
circumstances
and
demographic
information
we
think
basing
criminal
sentences
and
particularly
imprisonment
terms
primarily
on
such
data
rather
than
the
crime
committed
and
surrounding
circumstances
is
a
dangerous
concept
that
will
become
much
more
concerning
over
time
as
other
far
reaching
sociological
and
personal
information
unrelated
to
the

at

are
incorporated

tools
th
is
phenomenon
ultimately
raises
constitutional
questions
because
of
the
use
of
group
based
characteristics
and
suspect
classifications
in
the
analytics
criminal
accountability
should
be
primarily
about
prior
bad
acts
proven
by
the
government
before
a
court
of
law
and
not
some
future
bad
behavior
predicted
to
occur
by
a
risk
assessment
instrument
second
experience
and
analysis
of
current
risk
assessment
tools
demonstrate
that
utilizing
such
tools
for
determining
prison
sentences
to
be
served
will
have
a
disparate
and
adverse
impact
on
offenders
from
poor
communities
already
struggling
with
many
social
ills
the
touchstone
of
our
justice
system
is
equal
justice
and
we
think
sentences
based
excessively
on
risk
assessment
instruments
will
likely
undermine
this
principle
third
use
of
risk
assessments
to
determine
sentences
erodes
certainty
in
sentencing
thus
diminishing
the
deterrent
value
of
a
strong
consistent
sentencing
system
that
is
seen
by
the
community
as
fair
and
tough
our
brothers
and
sisters
in
the
defense
and
research
communities
have
repeatedly
cited
research
to
the
commission
about
the
value
and
efficacy
of
certainty
of
apprehension
and
certainty
of
punishment
in
deterring
crime
swift
certain
and
fair
sanctions
are
what
work
to
deter
crime
both
individually
and
across
society
we
know
that
certainty
in
sentencing
certainty
in
the
imposition
of
a
particular
sentence
for
a
particular
crime
and
certainty
in
the
time
to
be
served
for
a
sentence
imposed
simultaneously
improves
public
safety
and
reduces
unwarranted
sentencing
disparities
we
are
concerned
that
excessive
reliance
on
risk
tools
will
greatly
undermine
what
has
been
achieved
around
certainty
of
sentencing
in
the
federal
system
determining
imprisonment
terms
should
be
primarily
about
accountability
for
past
criminal
behavior
while
any
effective
sentencing
and
corrections
policy
will
take
account
of
future
behavior
to
some
extent
incapacitating
those
more
likely
to
recidivate
and
utilizing
effective
reentry
efforts
to
reduce
the
likelihood
of
recidivism
we
believe
the
length
of
imprisonment
terms
should
mostly
be
about
accounting
for
past
criminal
conduct
as
analytics
evolve
we
are
concerned
about
the
implications
of
sentencing
policy
moving
away
from
this
precept
we
think
the
sentencing
commission
s
agenda
should
include
the
study
of
risk
assessment
tools
and
their
various
uses
in
the
sentencing

reentry

we
remain
concerned
by
this
evolution
of
federal

into
two
separate
practices
most
importantly
the
research
and
data
make
increasingly
clear
that
this
divide
leads
to
unwarranted
sentencing
disparities
more
and
more

are

defendant
s
sentence
will
be
significantly
influenced
by
the
judicial
assignment
of

case
and
the
particular
court
that
conducts
the
sentencing
n
this
is
quite
troubling
in
our
consideration
of
federal
sentencing
policy

begin
from
the
principle
that
offenders
who
commit
similar
offenses
and
have
comparable
criminal
histories
should
be
sentenced
similarly
this
was
the
foundational
principle
of

when
the
guideline
calculation
was
intended
to
be
the
last
word
for
most
cases
to
this
end
much
can
be
learned
from
state
sentencing
guideline
systems
there
has
been
significant
research
of
state
guideline
systems
n
as
we
have
stated
before
these
systems
by
and
large
differ
structurally
from
the
federal
sentencing
guidelines
in
that
they
have
simpler
sentencing
grids
fewer
grid
cells
and
less
complex
guideline
formulas
i
e
fewer
aggravating
and
mitigating
factors
embodied
in
rules
for
litigators
to
fight
over
conventional
thinking
would
suggest
that
a
greater
numbers
of
cells
with
more
factors
embodied
in
rules
would
create
a
greater
number
of
sets
of
similarly
situated
offenders
and
result
in
a
greater
degree
of
sentencing
consistency
and
meaningful
differentiation
among
offenders
n
however
the
available
research
and
experience
suggest
that
greater
detail
in
the
sentencing
grid
and
sentencing
formulas
does
not
better
sort
offenders
into
more
meaningful
categories
for
purposes
of
sentencing
decisions
n
in
particular
our
experience
with
the
very
detailed
federal
guidelines
when
applied
through
the
legal
framework
created
by
booker
has
seen
quite
disparate
guideline
application
and
sentencing
outcomes
these
findings
should
guide
the
commission
in
its
work
evaluating
unwarranted
disparities
as
much
as
data
on
guideline
compliance
by
federal
judges
moreover
we
think
these
findings
along
with
many
other
factors
should
guide
the
commission
to
consider
structural
guidelines
reform
to
produce
a
simpler
guideline
system

footnotes
we
continue
to
believe
that
a
strong
and
consistent
federal
sentencing
system
is
important
to
improving
public
safety
across
the
country
as
it
has
over
the
past
decades
and
to
furthering
greater
justice
for
all
in
a
cost
effective
manner
and
we
further
believe
that
much
can
be
learned
from
the
states
including
how
a
simpler
form
of
sentencing
guidelines
can
improve
consistency
reduce
unwarranted
sentencing
disparities
and
better
allocate
sentencing
decisions
among
the
stakeholders
in
the
criminal
justice
system
a
strong
and
effective
federal
sentencing
system
is
critical
to
keeping
national
crime
rates
low
moving
them
still
lower
improving
justice
and
addressing
specific
and
acute
crime
problems
conclusion
the
policy
agenda
we
suggest
here
is
substantial
the
range
of
issues
represents
the
range
of
the

statutory
responsibilities
including
overseeing
the
systemic
health
of
the
federal

and
its
structural

resolving

and
more
we
look
forward
to
discussing
all
these
issues
with
you
and
the
other

with
the
goal
of
refining
the
sentencing

the
future
under

domestic
violence
victims
often
face
the
impossible
choice
between
physical
safety
and
financial
security
state
intervention
can
offer
some
protection
to
victims
but
enlisting
the
criminal
justice
system
through
reporting
domestic
violence
or
restraining
order
violations
can
have
drastic
financial
consequences
involving
the
state
is
likely
to
lead
to
sanctions
for
the
abuser
that
would
ultimately
deprive
the
victim
of
child
support
alimony
and
other
financial
support
which
may
be
the
totality
of
the
victim
s
financial
resources
to
avoid
this
result
many
victims
refuse
to
enforce
court
orders
intended
to
maximize
their
safety
this
article
examines
the
context
in
which
victims
must
choose
between
physical
safety
and
financial
security
and
the
lawyer
s
difficult
position
when
a
client
prioritizes
financial
stability
using
a
compelling
case
study
that
exemplifies
this
impossible
choice
the
article
examines
the
role
of
economic
dependence
in
victim
decision
making
reasons
why

avoid

the

authors

through
the
lens
of
law
school
clinical
programs
and
the
experiences
of
students
who
work
on
the
cases
and
what
limitations

any
there
are
to
representation
when
the
client
trades
safety
for
economic
stability
introduction
we
co
taught
a
domestic
violence
clinic
at
yale
law
school
our
clinic
followed
a
holistic
model
in
which
the
clinic
students
represented
victims
of
domestic
violence
in
a
full
range
of
legal
problems
including
family
law
immigration
tort
actions
against
abusers
mortgage
foreclosure
consumer
landlord
tenant
public
benefits
and
tax
matters
we
found
that
many
of
our
clients
were
forced
to
balance
the
issue
of
physical
abuse
with
the
threat
of
severe
financial
stress
in
this
article
we
offer
a
case
study
in
which
our
client
largely
out
of
concern
for
her
children
s
economic
security
refused
to
enforce
civil
restraining
and
criminal
protective
orders
to
ensure
that
her
husband
would
be
able
to
work
and
support
the
family
this
situation
is
not
unique
many
of
our
clients
were
loath
to
enforce
existing
restraining
orders
or
protective
orders
fearing
that
enforcement
would
result
in
incarceration
of
the
abuser
which
would
interrupt
financial
support
these
pressures
were
particularly
severe
for
clients
with
minor
children
this
article
focuses
on
the
role
of
economic
security
in
a
domestic
violence
victim
s
decision
making
and
the
role
of
the
attorney
in
trying
to
assist
in
and
execute
the
domestic
violence
victim
client
s
decisions
we
concentrate
on
the
economic
pressures
that
make
it
difficult
to
leave
but
recognize
that
financial
matters
represent
one
piece
of
a
complicated
picture
we
are
concerned
with
isolating
any
single
factor
in
what
is
often
a
multi
faceted
decision
as
a
result
we
have
purposely
taken
a
wide
ranging
approach
in
examining
both
the
factors
that
lead
to
a
decision
to
stay
or
not
enforce
court
orders
as
well
as
the
role
of
the
lawyer
in
helping
to
effectuate
these
decisions
we
analyze
this
situation
through
the
lens
of
one
clinic
case
offering
the
perspectives
of
the
clinic
students
who
worked
on
the
case
and
discussing
what
limitations
if
any
there
are
to
representation
in
a
case
like
this
when
a
client
trades
safety
for
economic
stability
this
is
a
broad
analysis
and
we
appreciate
that
we
raise
more
questions
than
we
answer
but
we
are
looking
for
ways
to
better
inform
representation
of
clients
in
dangerous
situations
and
we
have
not
found
the
answers
to
be
easily
forthcoming
in
part
i
we
discuss
our
client
barbara
s
situation
as
a
case
study
that
provides
a
context
in
which
to
examine
these
complex
issues
we
provide
background
about
barbara
s
case
along
with
the
perspectives
of
the
two
clinic
students
who
under
our
supervision
represented
barbara
and
identified
many
of
the
issues
relevant
to
this
article
in
a
contemporaneous
g
chat
instant
messaging
through
google
about
her
case
in
part
ii
we
provide
an
overview
of
the
problem
presented
by
barbara
s
situation
and
many
other
similar
situations
namely
what
limits
if
any
there
might
be
in
a
lawyer
s
representation
of
a
domestic
violence
victim
when
that
representation
may
increase
the
victim
s
risk
of
harm
or
circumvent
legal
processes
that
are
meant
to
protect
the
victim
we
look
at
issues
of
capacity
and
competence
and
when
a
lawyer
can
limit
or
withdraw
from
representation
under
the
model
rules
of
professional
conduct
part
iii
examines
how
financial
pressures
and
economic
dependency
cause
many
domestic
violence
victims
to
eschew
court
involvement
or
opt
out

the
criminal
justice
system
in
part
iv
we
discuss
other
reasons
why
victims
opt
out
of
court
protections
including
problems
with
the
criminal
justice
system
fear
of
retaliation
concerns
about
immigration
consequences
for
the
victim
or
the
abuser
and

for
and

i
the
case
study
a
the
client
barbara
each
week
we
went
with
our
clinic
students
to
a
local
domestic
violence
advocacy
center
located
in
a
beautiful
old
victorian
house
in
a
nearby
neighborhood
in
new
haven
connecticut
we
interviewed
prospective
clients
at
a
dining
room
table
under
a
chandelier
in
what
had
once
been
an
upscale
dining
room
it
was
there
that
we
met
barbara
barbara
had
been
married
to
her
abuser
for
years
and
had
two
minor
children
ages
and
during
the
marriage
barbara
had
never
been
away
from
home
overnight
without
her
husband
tom
although
he
had
taken
several
trips
with
girlfriends
her
husband
was
extremely
controlling
she
was
not
permitted
to
work
or
learn
a
trade
he
owned
a
business
had
substantial
earnings
built
a
house
paid
all
the
bills
and
doled
out
household
money
in
modest
amounts
the
business
was
labor
intensive
and
was
entirely
dependent
on
his
ability
to
bid
on
public
contracts
and
perform
strenuous
physical
labor
if
he
did
not
work
the
income
stream
would
end
barbara
s
husband
beat
her
frequently
on
two
occasions
she
took
pictures
of
her
black
eyes
and
bruises
the
only
time
she
went
to
a
doctor
she
gave
a
false
account
of
the
cause
of
her
injuries
she
was
afraid
to
take
any
action
that
could
lead
to
her
husband
s
arrest
her
main
concerns
were
that
she
be
able
to
pay
the
mortgage
and
household
bills
and
continue
to
maintain
her
children
s
home
and
lifestyle
two
years
before
we
met
her
barbara
prepared
a
pro
se
divorce
complaint
connecticut
has
an
unusual
procedure
in
which
a
complaint
is
served
before
being
filed
with
the
court
when
barbara
served
her
husband
in
their
home
by
handing
him
a
copy
she
was
afraid
of
physical
violence
instead
he
looked
at
the
papers
tore
them
in
half
told
her
she
was
not
getting
a
divorce
and
left
the
house
she
felt
trapped
but
assumed
that
her
husband
was
correct
she
believed
there
was
no
way
she
could
pay
for
an
attorney
and
there
was
no
way
she
could
get
the
divorce
on
her
own
it
was
only
after
she
contacted
a
domestic
violence
hotline
that
she
learned
that
she
might
be
able
to
receive
free
legal
services
we
represented
barbara
for
three
years
obtaining
a
divorce
custody
alimony
child
support
and
a
property
settlement
during
that
period
the
only
time
she
was
inconsolable
was
when
her
husband
was
arrested
when
a
neighbor
reported
a
domestic
dispute
at
barbara
s
home
barbara
told
us
that
the
one
thing
she
could
not
allow
was
for
her
husband
to
go
to
jail
she
could
put
up
with
anything
so
long
as
she
could
provide
for
her
children
and
the
only
way
she
could
do
that
was
for
her
husband
to
keep
working
although
the
court
had
entered
restraining
orders
and
due
to
a
third
party
complaint
a
criminal
protective
order
barbara
refused
to
enforce
those
orders
n
in
a
remarkably
successful
multi
day
divorce
trial
the
court
awarded
barbara
over
of
her
husband
s
income
for
child
support
and
alimony
as
well
as
of
the
equity
in
the
marital
home
valued
at
connecticut
is
an
equitable
distribution
state
and
the
evidence
was
quite
compelling
and
was
a
major
factor
in
the
property
distribution
as
just
one
example
barbara
testified
that
one
morning
on
awakening
after
a
beating
the
night
before
she
was
exhilarated
when
she
looked
in
the
mirror
because
she
had
only
one
black
eye
when
she
expected
two
family
lawyers
reading
about
a
remarkably
successful
result
in
a
domestic
violence
case
will
probably
ask
then
what
happened
even
before
the
end
of
the
trial
we
knew
that
compliance
with
the
terms
of
the
judgment
was
unlikely
at
a
recess
during
the
last
day
of
the
trial
when
things
were
not
going
well
for
the
defendant
we
saw
him
huddled
with
his
brother
who
then
made
a
series
of
telephone
calls
they
conducted
their
business
openly
with
an
occasional
smirk
for
our
benefit
it
was
clear
that
they
were
planning
something
and
equally
clear
that
they
wanted
us
to
be
worried
about
it
when
our
client
got
home
most
of
her
furniture
was
missing
in
one
sense
we
were
relieved
that
the
plan
was
limited
to
possessions
but
we
filed
a
motion
for
contempt
the
next
morning
the
problem
was
resolved
when
the
older
son
then
drove
to
his
father
s
house
convinced
his
father
to
help
him
load
the
furniture
on
a
truck
and
brought
it
home
at
trial
the
judge
issued
a
new
restraining
order
on
her
own
motion
noting
that
this
was
the
first
time
in
her
twelve
years
on
the
bench
she
had
issued
a
restraining
order
without
an
application
an
earlier
restraining
order
had
expired
and
barbara
did
not
want
a
new
order
having
experienced
panic
when
her
husband
was
arrested
for
violating
the
order
tom
continued
his
attempts
to
control
barbara
he
violated
the
restraining
order
on
a
regular
basis
he
came
to
the
house
frequently
barbara
refused
to
take
any
action
to
enforce
the
order
he
failed
to
pay
alimony
and
child
support
and
we
were
in
court
on
contempt
motions
on
many
occasions
always
seeking
compliance
with
the
financial
orders
but
never
raising
the
restraining
order
violations
usually
he
showed
up
at
court
with
a
check
once
he
brought
forty
bills
eventually
the
court
scheduled
monthly
hearings
requiring
that
he
keep
current
on
payments
at
a
post
judgment
contempt
hearing
for
failure
to
pay
child
support
and
alimony
the
defendant
described
a
conversation
he
had
with
barbara
at
the
marital
home
noting
that
he
had
frequent
conversations
with
her
at
the
house
the
judge
was
livid
about
his
failure
to
comply
with
the
restraining
order
and
said
she
should
throw
him
in
jail
until
he
learned
the
meaning
of
a
court
order
the
judge
suggested
that
we
might
need
a
public
defender
for
the
unrepresented
defendant
a
sure
sign
that
she
was
considering
jail
time
we
expected
this
issue
to
arise
and
the
students
were
prepared
they
found
themselves
arguing
strenuously
and
effectively
that
the
court
should
issue
additional
monetary
sanctions
but
not
incarceration
we
had
warned
barbara
that
the
restraining
order
violations
were
likely
to
be
disclosed
barbara
remained
adamant
that
she
wanted
to
enforce
the
financial
orders
but
not
the
restraining
order
in
fact
the
mortgage
was
in
arrears
and
without
access
to
support
and
alimony
payments
a
mortgage
foreclosure
was
imminent
the
judge
expressed
fear
for
barbara
s
safety
a
fear
that
we
had
lived
with
for
over
two
years
with
constant
self
doubts
about
our
failure
to
enforce
the
restraining
and
protective
orders
we
had
discussed
this
as
a
class
and
as
a
litigation
team
we
had
the
benefit
of
consultation
with
a
psychologist
specializing
in
domestic
violence
issues
social
workers
who
consulted
with
barbara
victim
advocates
and
a
prosecutor
assigned
to
domestic
violence
prosecutions
in
the
end
the
students
and
the
authors
agreed
that
the
choice
was
the
client
s
not
ours
when
the
judge
raised
her
concerns
the
students
explained
and
advocated
for
the
client
s
position
the
judge
looked
surprised
and
took
a
recess
when
she
returned
to
the
bench
the
judge
allowed
the
defendant
to
remain
free
and
to
continue
working
the
defendant
continued
to
violate
the
restraining
and
protective
orders
and
barbara
continued
in
her
insistence
that
she
wanted
us
to
enforce
the
financial
orders
but
to
do
everything
we
could
to
keep
her
now
ex
husband
out
of
jail
ultimately
he
came
to
the
house
one
day
when
barbara
s
friend
was
visiting
when
the
friend
told
him
to
leave
tom
told
the
friend
to
mind
his
own
business
and
pushed
him
causing
him
to
crash
into
a
bookcase
and
hurt
his
shoulder
someone
called
the
police
they
came
and
the
defendant
was
arrested
after
a
lengthy
plea
bargain
he
pled
to
five
violations
of
restraining
orders
and
protective
orders
and
was
sentenced
to
four
years
imprisonment
b
the
students
perspective
mary
and
elizabeth
when
we
started
writing
this
article
we
contacted
mary
adkins
and
elizabeth
tulis
the
yale
law
school
students
who
represented
barbara
throughout
the
above
case
study
yale
law
school
permits
first
year
law
students
to
enroll
in
a
clinic
and
mary
met
barbara
at
an
outreach
site
a
few
weeks
into
the
spring
semester
of
her
first
year
of
law
school
elizabeth
worked
in
the
yale
clinic
during
the
summer
between
her
first
and
second
years
of
law
school
and
as
part
of
her
responsibilities
represented
barbara
throughout
the
summer
both
mary
and
elizabeth
continued
to
represent
barbara
throughout
their
second
and
third
years
of
law
school
we
appreciate
the
luxury
of
having
the
same
students
work
with
a
client
for
over
two
years
but
we
do
not
think
that
changes
the
issues
after
an
initial
discussion
about
this
article
elizabeth
offered
an
extraordinary
g
chat
that
she
had
with
mary
during
the
representation
the
content
has
been
edited
slightly
for
length
but
the
words
are
entirely
our
students
while
this
paper
is
about
a
lawyering
problem
and
not
about
clinical
pedagogy
our
case
study
did
arise
in
the
context
of
a
domestic
violence
clinic
and
as
the
conversation
shows
the
students
were
conscious
of
and
concerned
with
our
client
s
refusal
to
enforce
orders
and
it
brings
to
life
in
real
time
the
difficult
issues
with
which
we
were
all
struggling
the
clinical
setting
adds
a
dimension
to
the
lawyering
skills
involved
and
we
think
it
is
helpful
to
consider
the
real
time
concerns
of
the
students
mary
tom
husband
comes
over
a
lot
according
to
joe
barbara
s
friend
joe
was
like
he
has
to
go
to
jail
to
get
his
attention
elizabeth
joe
saw
him
come
over
was
barbara
there
when
tom
came
over
mary
yes
and
she
hid
upstairs
he
has
a
key
elizabeth
tom
came
in
the
house
did
barbara
get
the
locks
changed
mary
yes
but
it
doesn
t
matter
i
don
t
think
he
has
the
order
yet
whether
or
not
barbara
wants
tom
to
go
to
jail
something
has
to
change
in
the
way
she
s
been
dealing
with
this
or
else
tom
simply
won
t
stop
he
won
t
stop
elizabeth
i
wonder
if
we
could
ask
for
financial
sanctions
barbara
really
might
need
to
get
used
to
the
idea
of
him
being
in
jail
for
a
while
we
re
just
no
longer
in
a
place
where
we
can
use
this
to
get
assets
divided
etc
mary
i
think
the
judge
is
smart
and
caring
elizabeth
but
even
the
judge
is
going
to
lose
patience
at
some
point
and
be
like
if
he
keeps
doing
these
things
and
she
wants
him
to
stop
he
needs
to
face
the
consequences
i
just
feel
like
in
this
case
i
am
really
walking
a
line
between
serving
what
barbara
wants
and
giving
her
good
legal
advice
honest
legal
advice
about
what
her
options
are
and
good
practical
advice
responsible
advice
about
what
i
think
she
should
do
legally
mary
i
think
we
ve
told
her
what
she
has
to
do
legally
she
s
not
doing
it
elizabeth
i
feel
like
there
s
a
certain
point
in
this
case
though
where
i
can
t
honestly
be
asking
for
a
tro
temporary
restraining
order
n
that
she
won
t
enforce
or
there
s
not
anything
i
can
do
if
she
won
t
enforce
it
by
not
allowing
us
to
report
violations
we
re
not
serving
her
interests
at
least
if
we
think
that
subjective
assessments
of
interest
in
cases
like
barbara
s
are
not
all
there
is
if
barbara
thinks
that
everything
would
be
fine
if
she
took
tom
back
that
that
was
what
she
wanted
would
we
be
serving
her
interest
by
facilitating
that
or
by
say
transferring
property
to
tom
i
don
t
know
i
guess
i
ve
just
been
feeling
really
frustrated
to
some
extent
with
barbara
herself
mary
i
mean
i
think
this
is
the
fundamental
question
in
dv
work
right
mary
but
what
she
s
asking
from
us
in
this
particular
kind
of
instance
is
not
action
but
inaction
not
pushing
the
violation
in
front
of
the
court
which
is
a
passive
kind
of
facilitating
i
realize
but
it
s
more
palatable
to
me
elizabeth
it
s
making
tom
think
she
won
t
enforce
it
just
feels
very
hypocritical
when
our
whole
case
was
premised
on
he
s
so
abusive
and
he
needs
to
be
away
from
her
mary
i
know
i
asked
her
today
if
she
felt
scared
of
him
and
she
said
no
not
right
now
i
said
well
he
has
the
key
to
the
house
you
know
he
s
going
to
change
his
tune
at
any
point
and
he
could
hurt
you
elizabeth
and
if
at
some
future
point
she
does
want
to
enforce
and
report
him
say
coming
to
the
house
he
ll
go
to
court
and
say
she
s
just
mad
at
me
for
something
else
i
ve
been
coming
to
the
house
all
the
time
and
she
hasn
t
complained
the
judge
told
barbara
not
to
have
contact
with
him
at
the
hearing
mary
i
m
not
sure
she
would
have
told
me
today
except
joe
was
there
and
he
said
it
elizabeth
i
just
feel
weird
going
to
the
judge
and
asking
her
to
enforce
child
support
say
but
refusing
to
bring
up
the
other
contempt
it
suggests
that
barbara
like
tom
is
being
selective
in
her
respect
for
the
orders
i
know
that
s
not
exactly
what
it
is
but
it
doesn
t
feel
right
to
me
when
we
put
on
such
a
dramatic
dv
case
and
emphasized
that
this
was
about
getting
him
out
of
her
life
to
tolerate
him
staying
in
it
in
such
blatant
ways
ethically
not
legally
ethically
just
ethically
it
is
getting
to
me
mary
she
s
legitimately
scared
about
his
incarceration
i
mean
scared
for
legit
reasons
elizabeth
but
she
s
not
being
particularly
respectful
towards
the
legal
orders
mary
well
right
but
they
are
orders
that
she
asked
for
elizabeth
or
to
the
legal
framework
her
case
assumed
when
we
decided
to
present
dv
evidence
at
trial
and
asked
the
judge
to
rule
on
it
it
would
be
different
if
we
had
not
gotten
all
those
financial
orders
etc
on
the
basis
of
the
dv
mary
because
those
aren
t
the
priorities
in
her
life
she
s
thinking
about
her
priorities
which
i
think
are
reasonable
to
a
certain
extent
elizabeth
but
tom
s
violation
of
the
ro
restraining
order
is
a
criminal
act
maybe
that
s
part
of
the
reason
this
is
bothering
me
because
literally
legally
by
imposing
the
ro
barbara
was
involving
the
state
and
making
it
the
state
s
interest
too
mary
well
she
certainly
picks
and
chooses
elizabeth
i
guess
maybe
i
ve
just
sort
of
internalized
the
basic
premise
of
the
civil
criminal
distinction
which
is
that
once
you
enter
the
criminal
law
system
it
s
not
just
the
interest
of
the
victim
but
of
society
that
is
at
issue
going
into
the
system
you
marshal
the
resources
of
the
state
to
protect
you
but
you
also
cede
some
control
of
the
case
to
the
state
mary
i
think
you
really
hit
the
nail
on
the
head
when
you
told
her
that
she
can
t
have
someone
to
keep
mowing
the
lawn
but
not
beating
her
up
her
lifestyle
will
change
i
don
t
think
she
s
accepted
that
elizabeth
i
know
like
she
says
she
s
trying
to
but
i
feel
like
she
s
saying
that
to
please
us
ii
the
problem
capacity
competence
and
limiting
or
withdrawing
from
representation
a
the
problem
our
case
study
raises
several
issues
what
does
client
centered
lawyering
mean
in
such
a
context
it
is
easy
to
say
that
we
take
direction
from
the
client
but
does
it
matter
that
the
client
is
placing
herself
in
danger
of
serious
harm
or
death
not
to
mention
using
our
services
to
facilitate
an
ongoing
violation
of
court
orders
the
question
of
the
limits
of
a
lawyer
s
advocacy
on
behalf
of
a
domestic
violence
victim
has
gone
largely
unexamined
lawyers
who
work
with
domestic
violence
victims
regularly
represent
clients
who
continue
to
be
subjected
to
physical
and
sexual
violence
these
clients
might
still
be
in
a
relationship
with
the
abuser
or
may
have
intended
or
undesired
contact
with
the
abuser
the
abuser
continues
to
perpetrate
abuse
and
the
victim
based
on
the
abuser
s
prior
conduct
knows
that
she
is
likely
to
suffer
further
abuse
the
lawyer
often
knows
of
the
ongoing
abusive
conduct
although
the
client
does
not
always
disclose
this
information
n
the
ongoing
abuse
can
range
greatly
in
its
severity
from
minor
pushing
to
lethal
violence
we
ask
if
there
is
a
point
at
which
a
lawyer
should
or
can
reconsider
his
or
her
role
in
representing
the
client
especially
when
the
lawyer
s
advocacy
increases
the
likelihood
of
the
client
s
exposure
to
violence
we
are
particularly
concerned
with
the
lawyer
s
limits
if
any
when
the
client
is
making
decisions
that
put
her
at
risk
of
harm
for
the
purposes
of
this
article
we
are
thinking
about
the
lawyer
s
boundaries
arising
in
two
related
categories
when
advocacy
facilitates
contact
with
the
abuser
that
might
subject
the
victim
to
risk
of
further
violence
and
when
the
client
requests
that
the
lawyer
assist
in
circumventing
legal
processes
meant
to
provide
safety
to
the
victim
first
there
might
be
a
level
or
risk
of
violence
to
which
the
client
is
exposing
herself
that
would
cause
a
lawyer
to
reconsider
representation
of
the
client
most
domestic
violence
attorneys
are
accustomed
to
representing
clients
who
experience
ongoing
low
or
mid
level
violence
a
typical
domestic
violence
caseload
often
also
includes
some
ongoing
high
level
violence
is
there
a
level
of
risked
harm
at
which
the
lawyer
can
question
whether
the
client
s
directions
accurately
represent
her
interests
does
the
lawyer
pause
when
the
abuser
uses
or
poses
the
risk
of
extreme
violence
or
potentially
lethal
violence
and
the
lawyer
s
services
are
helping
to
facilitate
contact
between
the
parties
or
does
the
lawyer
continue
advocacy
regardless
of
the
risk
to
the
client
we
are
concerned
when
the
client
is
voluntarily
exposing
herself
to
a
high
risk
of
harm
but
it
is
not
clear
how
we
should
best
inform
our
decision
about
representation
when
the
risk
arises
in
our
case
study
we
knew
that
barbara
had
ongoing
contact
with
tom
although
barbara
was
rarely
forthcoming
about
the
type
and
frequency
of
the
contact
given
the
history
of
violence
in
the
relationship
we
were
constantly
concerned
about
barbara
s
safety
but
we
continued
to
proceed
on
barbara
s
directions
second
the
lawyer
might
reconsider
representation
when
the
client
requests
that
her
attorney
attempt
to
circumvent
or
even
obstruct
legal
processes
that
are
meant
to
protect
the
client
the
client
might
ask
that
the
attorney
conceal
the
abuser
s
conduct
from
the
court
to
purposely
avoid
remedies
meant
to
protect
the
client
she
may
ask
that
the
attorney
not
disclose
the
abuser
s
violation
of
court
orders
she
may
request
that
the
attorney
advocate
against
civil
court
protections
like
issuance
of
a
restraining
order
or
criminal
court
protections
like
prosecution
that
are
meant
to
provide
safety
to
the
victim
the
issue
presented
by
our
case
study
arises
when
the
client
asks
the
lawyer
to
advocate
that
the
perpetrator
not
be
prosecuted
for
an
incident
of
domestic
violence
or
violating
a
restraining
or
a
protective
order
even
when
the
failure
to
prosecute
will
almost
certainly
allow
for
additional
violence
a
lawyer
might
refuse
to
provide
certain
types
of
advocacy
when
that
advocacy
is
likely
to
bring
the
client
harm
we
examine
the
circumstances
that
create
sufficient
concern
for
the
attorney
such
that
she
might
establish
a
boundary
in
the
representation
the
model
rules
of
professional
conduct
require
that
a
lawyer
shall
abide
by
a
client
s
decisions
concerning
the
objectives
of
representation
but
when
can
a
lawyer
deviate
from
a
client
s
direction
n
b
capacity
and
competence
one
exception
to
the
requirement
that
the
lawyer
abide
by
the
client
s
decisions
is
provided
under
rule
when
the
client
has
diminished
capacity
n
some
may
question
a
victim
s
capacity
or
competence
to
make
decisions
involving
exposure
to
harm
this
line
of
questioning
implicates
our
first
inquiry
above
namely
whether
there
is
a
level
or
risk
of
violence
to
which
the
client
is
exposing
herself
that
would
cause
a
lawyer
to
reconsider
representation
of
the
client
there
has
been
limited
discussion
of
the
capacity
and
competence
of
domestic
violence
victims
to
make
autonomous
rational
decisions
and
realize
those
decisions
n
society
treats
a
victim
s
decision
as
to
whether
to
leave
an
abusive
relationship
as
indicative
of
her
capacity
or
competence
n
some
might
perceive
that
a
victim
choosing
to
stay
with
an
abuser
or
have
contact
with
an
abuser
after
separation
indicates
clouded
judgment
while
competence
and
capacity
are
similar
and
often
used
interchangeably
n
they
are
distinct
concepts
competence
referring
to
legal
competence
means
a
legal
standard
relating
to
a
person
s
mental
ability
to
understand
problems
and
make
decisions
n
competency
is
required
in
order
to
complete
a
legal
task
n
to
be
competent
an
individual
s
capacities
or
functional
abilities
must
be
sufficient
for
the
legal
context
in
which
a
decision
is
being
made
n
capacity
on
the
other
hand
speaks
to
an
individual
s
level
of
psychological
functioning
n
psychological
or
psychiatric
evaluations
can
determine
an
individual
s
capacity
to
make
rational
decisions
understand
complex
concepts
or
understand
the
nature
and
effect
of
one
s
acts
n
some
have
argued
that
domestic
violence
victims
lack
competence
to
make
legal
decisions
consistent
with
their
values
and
priorities
if
they
are
afraid
of
their
abusers
n
this
alleged
incompetence
arguably
arises
as
duress
when
victim
decision
making
is
controlled
by
fear
of
the
abuser
and
desire
to
avoid
retaliation
n
because
of
this
duress
it
is
argued
that
the
victim
is
not
able
to
make
decisions
serving
her
own
best
interests
n
the
discussion
of
victims
ability
to
make
decisions
has
focused
more
on
capacity
rather
than
competence
rule
n
considers
the
messy
notion
of
diminished
capacity
the
comment
to
rule
which
requires
that
a
lawyer
shall
abide
by
a
client
s
decisions
concerning
the
objectives
of
representation
n
notes
that
rule
controls
in
a
case
in
which
the
client
appears
to
be
suffering
diminished
capacity
n
rule
a
states
that
capacity
may
be
diminished
because
of
minority
mental
impairment
or
for
some
other
reason
n
this
definition
is
very
broad
and
could
arguably
extend
to
some
victims
especially
given
the
catchall
phrase
for
some
other
reason
in
a
case
of
diminished
capacity
the
lawyer
may
take
reasonable
action
to
protect
the
client
rule
b
provides
that
when
the
lawyer

should
be
appointed
legal
guardians
due
to
capacity
issues
n
for
jones
some
domestic

victims
are
unable
to
act
on
their
own
and
require
an
intervention
that
permits
someone
else
to
act
on
their
behalf
to
protect
them
from
their
abusers
until
they
can
protect
themselves
n
she
argues
that
appointment
of
a
guardian
for
a
victim
may
be
necessary
when
the
abuse
has
deprived
the
victim
of
the
ability
to
exercise
independent
judgment
n
this
guardianship
would
remain
in
effect
until
the
abuser
s
control
of
the
victim
is
removed
and
a
victim
can
make
decisions
for
herself
n
the
guardian
could
obtain
public
benefits
and
obtain
and
enforce
a
restraining
order
on
the
victim
s
behalf
n
the
guardian
could
also
restrict
the
victim
s
contact
with
the
abuser
and
petition
the
court
to
remove
the
abuser
from
the
shared
residence
or
move
the
victim
into
separate
housing
n
the
desired
outcome
of
the
aggressive
intervention
of
a
guardianship
is
for
the
victim
to
decide
to
end
the
abusive
relationship
n
the
court
of
appeals
of
minnesota
addressed
the
capacity

appellate
court
upheld
the
lower
court
s
decision
to
appoint
a
conservator
for
a
domestic
violence
victim
due
to
incapacity
n
barbara
frarck
was
in
an
abusive
relationship
and
suffered
from
borderline
personality
disorder
n
the
court
wrote
that
despite
being
physically
abused
by
her
boyfriend
frarck
remains
involved
in
their
relationship
and
that
the
testimony
indicated
that
if
a
conservator
were
appointed
and
sought
a
restraining
order
frarck
could
be
protected
from
his
abuse
while
the
court
appointed
a
conservator
based
on
both
the
domestic
violence
and
frarck
s
mental
condition
the
court
focused
more
on
the
domestic
violence
in
concluding
that
a
conservatorship
was
appropriate
the
court
stated
that
frarck
s
continued
threats
to
move
in
with
her
boyfriend
despite
his
abusive
treatment
indicate
that
she
is
unable
to
make
rational
decisions
about
her
living
arrangements
n
the
court
went
on
to
state
without
a
conservator
there
is
no
legal
mechanism
to
stop
the
abuse
given
frarck
s
refusal
to
obtain
a
protective
order
n
this
focus
on
exiting
the
relationship
as
the
test
of
capacity
or
competency
n
is
highly
problematic
a
victim
s
decision
as
whether
to
remain
with
an
abuser
or
separate
cannot
be
the
test
of
whether
a
victim
is
acting
rationally
or
in
her
own
best
interests
n
victims
are
competent
rational
decision
makers
but
the
nature
of
abusive
relationships
limits
their
choices
their
options
are
narrowed
by
a
number
of
factors
including
conditions
of
the

economic
dependence
and
possible
consequences
for
violating
the
confines
of

we
do
not
support
seeking

of
a

as
allowed
by
the
capacity
rule
but
we
question
whether
there
might
be
some
circumstances
in
which
it
would
be
appropriate
to
set
a
boundary
on
representation
the
model
rules
of
professional
conduct
are
not
particularly
helpful
in
determining
what
circumstances
permit
an
attorney
to
deviate
from
the
general
rule
that
the
attorney
must
take
direction
from
the
client
under
rule
d
a

shall
not
counsel
a
client
to
engage
or
assist
a

in
conduct
that
the

knows
is
criminal

fraudulent
n
a
lawyer
cannot
for
example
advise
a
client
to
disregard
a
ruling
of
the
court
n
similarly
rule
allows
an
attorney
to
seek
withdrawal
if
the
client
persists
in
a
course
of
action
involving
the
lawyer
s
services
that
the
lawyer
reasonably
believes
is
criminal
or
fraudulent
or
if
the
client
has
used
the
lawyer
s
services
to
perpetrate
a
crime
or
fraud
n
these
rules
relate
to
our
second
inquiry
into
the
problem
presented
by
our
case
study
namely
whether
the
lawyer
might
reconsider
representation
when
the
client
requests
that
her
attorney
attempt
to
circumvent
or
even
obstruct
legal
processes
that
are
meant
to
protect
the
client
what
does
it
mean
that
the
lawyer
s
services
are
used
to
perpetrate
a
crime
or
fraud
n
what
is
a
course
of
conduct
involving
the
lawyer
s
services
that
the
lawyer
reasonably
believes
is
criminal
or
fraudulent
n
is
it
fraudulent
to
conceal
the
abuser
s
conduct
from
the
court
to
purposely
avoid
remedies
meant
to
protect
the
client
is
the
lawyer
obligated
to
inform
the
court
of
the
abuser
s
violation
of
restraining
and
protective
orders
in
barbara
s
case
we
told
her
that
the
violations
would
likely
arise
and
that
she
would
have
to
testify
truthfully
but
we
did
not
take
affirmative
steps
to
advise
the
court
of
the
violations
had
we
done
so
barbara
s
husband
would
likely
have
been
incarcerated
barbara
would
have
been
safer
at
the
expense
of
our
ignoring
our
client
s
directions
for
the
purpose
of
this
paper
rule
raises
a
more
salient
question
what
is
a
violation
of
the
rules
of
professional
conduct
or
other
law
n
rule
declining
or
terminating
representation
provides
that
a
lawyer
shall
not
represent
a
client
or
where
representation
has
commenced
shall
withdraw
from
the
representation
of
a
client
if
the
representation
will
result
in
a
violation
of
the
rules
of
professional
conduct
or
other
law
n
and
a
lawyer
may
withdraw
from
representing
a
client
if
withdrawal
can
be
accomplished
without
material
adverse
effect
on
the
interests
of
the
client
n
rule
also
provides
that
a
lawyer
may
withdraw
if
the
client
insists
upon
taking
action
that
the
lawyer
considers
repugnant
or
with
which
the
lawyer
has
a
fundamental
disagreement
n
for
the
purposes
of
this
article
we
are
assuming
that
a
lawyer
who
does
not
wish
to
continue
to
represent
a
client
who
refuses
to
enforce
a
restraining
order
can
seek
to
withdraw
pursuant
to
rule
b
of
the
model
rules
of
professional
conduct
if
the
lawyer
considers
this
decision
to
be
repugnant
or
fundamentally
disagrees
with
the
refusal
n
it
may
be
that
the
court
will
not
allow
withdrawal
that
situation
is
beyond
the
scope
of
this
article
one
scholar
has
suggested
that
in
some
situations
domestic
violence
lawyers
should
break
client
confidentiality
and
request
outside
intervention
from
law
enforcement
or
others
when
the
lawyer
assesses
that
a
victim
is
at
risk
of
harm
n
for
support
she
cites
model
rule
of
professional
conduct
b
which
provides
that
a
lawyer
may
reveal
information
relating
to
the
representation
of
a
client
to
the
extent
the
lawyer
reasonably
believes
necessary
to
prevent
reasonably
certain
death
or
substantial
bodily
harm
n
we
have
never
contemplated
going
this
far
outside
of
the
bounds
of
the
attorney
client
relationship
for
one
we
do
not
believe
that
an
attorney
is
in
a
position
to
conduct
risk
assessments
or
make
such
determinations
based
on
the
facts
and
circumstances
of
the
case
and
the
intuition
of
the
lawyer
n
that
conclusion
however
says
little
more
than
reaffirming
our
commitment
to
confidentiality
it
does
not
answer
the
thornier
question
of
the
lawyer
s
responsibility
to
the
client
s
direction
the
client
s
safety
and
the
court
while
we
are
exploring
whether
the
lawyer
must
follow
the
client
s
directions
when
those
directions
place
the
client
in
physical
jeopardy
in
no
way
are
we
suggesting
that
the
client
s
directions
are
not
rational
to
the
contrary
the
problem
is
accentuated
or
created
by
the
fact
that
the
client
s
reasons
are
quite
rational
from
one
perspective
i
e
economics

from
another
perspective
place
her
in
great
physical
danger

the
role

relationships
tend
to
follow
traditional
gender
roles

the

being
particularly
attached
to
his
male
privilege

an

is
likely
to
insist
that
his
female
partner
carry
most
of
the
responsibility

tasks

sees

being
central

to
challenge

the

uses

protect

financial
dominance

the
overwhelming
reason

the
financial

research
reveals
the
significant
financial
impact
incarceration
has
on
families
regardless
of
the
reason
for
the
incarceration
as
early
as
families
of
incarcerated
individuals
were
found
to
have
suffered
financially
to
the
point
of
scarcely
being
able
to
eke
out
an
existence
n
today
any
parent
s
incarceration
creates
significant
economic
deprivation
to
families
n
this
deprivation
is
largely
due
to
the
loss
of
income
that
the
incarcerated
parent
may
have
provided
to
the
family
but
also
includes
lost
informal
contributions
like
child
care
social
support
and
the
purchase
of
toys
and
diapers
n
incarceration
can
compromise
the
well
being
of
family
members
and
require
family
members
to
make
sacrifices
custodial
parents
may
have
less
time
or
money
to
invest
in
their
children
n
they
may
be
required

older

required

leave

market
to
supplement
household
income
n
in
addition
the
loss
of
a
parent
and
the
financial
difficulties
that
result
from
incarceration
can
cause
children
to
suffer
from
a
range
of
emotional
psychological
and
behavioral
problems
n
state
intervention
can
create
a
quagmire
that
pits
a
victim
s
interests
in
financial
security
against
her
interests
in
safety
thus
many
victims
are
put
in
the
position
of
choosing
between
financial
support
from
the
abuser
and
state
intervention
we
do
not
suggest
that
a
victim
is
truly
choosing
between
economic
security
and
physical
safety
the
choices
available
to
domestic
violence
victims
are
limited
and
complicated
by
coercion

threat
of
harm
and
imperfect
options
and
we
use
the
notion
of

guardedly
our
case

offers
an
opportunity
to
examine
the
choice
of
financial
security
over
self
protection
when
reporting
domestic

violations
of
restraining
and
protective
orders
would
negatively
impact
a

further
inquiry

why

opt
out
of

may
be
reluctant
to
enlist
the
assistance

are
largely
out

even
replace

movement
s

n
the
typical
police
response
to
domestic
violence
was
to
tell
the
husband
or
boyfriend
to
take
a
walk
around
the
block
n
police
often
did
not
have
the
legal
authority
to
make
an
arrest

scene

crime

that
era
has
ended

all
fifty
states
allow
an
officer
to

officer
has
probable
cause
to
believe
that
an

has
committed
a

controlling

victims
are
often
emotionally
attached

do
not

to
see
them
incarcerated

punished
these
emotions
can
lead

continuing
contact

victims
may
rationalize
the

behavior
attributing
it
to
substance
abuse
or
a
troubled
childhood
n
reporting
abusive
conduct

terminating
contact
with

may
require

to
give
up
a
fantasy
of
a
healthy
relationship

in

can
trump

stated
they
love

will
break
up

and
most
of
the

they
don

want

break
up
n
it
is
from
within
this
morass
that
victims
ask
their
attorneys
to
advocate
or
not
advocate
on
their
behalf
or
to
pick
and
choose
from
possible
remedies
when
the
victim
is
faced
with
so
many
potential
negative
consequences
it
is
no
wonder
that
victims
ask
their
attorneys
to
help
them
avoid
state
intervention
even
when
their
safety
is
at
risk
the
lawyer
is
left
to
question
whether
she
should
engage
in
the
requested
advocacy
or
non
advocacy
and
if
it
is
ethically
or
morally
responsible
to
do
so
we
turn
to
the
issue
of
different
lawyering
models
for
guidance
about
how
an
attorney
might
approach

there
are
different
views
on

lawyering
we
might
have
treated
this

differently
if

may
be
helpful
to
consider

client
centered
lawyering
starting
in
the
late
s
lawyers
and
law
school
clinics
started
to
move
from
a
traditional
lawyer
client
relationship
to
an
alternative
client
centered
model
n
encouraging
lawyers
and
law
students
to
develop
meaningful
relationships
n
with
their
clients
and
depart
from
a
traditionally
paternalistic
and
adversarial
approach
to
litigation
n
over
time
client
centered
lawyering
has
increasingly
focused
on
treating
the
client
holistically
emphasizing
problem
solving
and
not
just
the
client
s
immediate
case
n
client
centered
lawyering
has
four
primary
components
it
draws
attention
to
the
critical
importance
of
non
legal
aspects
of
a
client
s
situation
it
places
the
lawyer
s
role
in
the
representation
within
limitations
set
by
a
sharply
circumscribed
view
of
the
lawyer
s
professional
expertise
it
insists
on
the
primacy
of
client
decision
making
and
it
places
a
high
value
on
the
lawyers
understanding
their
clients
perspectives
emotions
and
values
n
client
centered
lawyering
seeks
to
place
the
client
in
control
of
the
attorney
client
relationship
and
decision
making
client
centered
lawyering
is
a
model
that
puts
the
attorney
in
the
role
of
an
open
accepting
helper
and
leaves
both
priority
setting
and
decision
making
to
the
client
the
lawyer
helps
the
client
determine
what
is
best
for
him
in
light
of
his
own
priorities
n
in
client
centered
counseling
the
emphasis
is
on
achieving
the
greatest
client
satisfaction
n
this
model
represents
a
diversion
from
the
traditional
paternalistic
attorney
knows
best
role
that
many
attorneys
adopt
where
the
decision
making
is
based
upon
the
attorney
s
knowledge
priorities
and
beliefs
rather
than
the
client
s
interests
n
client
centered
lawyering
advocates
suggest
that
the
adversarial
legal
system
encourages
attorneys
to
make
choices
on
behalf
of
their
clients
that
are
strategically
wise
while
failing
to
recognize
the
client
s
interest
in
participating
in
decision
making
advocates
believe
the
traditional
approach
is
a
product
of
the
adversarial
legal
system
and
the
approach
toward
lawyering
that
was
taught
in
law
school
in
contrast
in
a
client
centered
lawyering
relationship
the
client
does
not
perceive
himself
as
and
is
not
an
instrument
to
be
manipulated
by
the
lawyer
n
a
client
of
a
client
centered
lawyer
directs
his
own
destiny
relying
on
the
lawyer
as
a
helper
and
as
a
guide
through
the
legal
labyrinths
n
this
model
emphasizes
autonomy
and
individual
growth
for
the
client
n
under
the
client
centered
model
mutual
trust
between
the
parties
will
empower
the
client
to
assume
the
dominant
role
of
decision
maker
and
the
attorney
can
adopt
a
more
passive
role
as
the
client
s
counselor
n
the
responsibility
and
ability
to
develop
mutual
trust
between
the
lawyer
and
client
rests
entirely
on
the
attorney
who
is
traditionally
seen
as
being
in
control
of
the
relationship
the
lawyer
should
place
himself
or
herself
in
the
client
s
position
attempting
to
understand
the
client
s
situation
and
emotions
n
a
client
centered
lawyer
helps
the
client
select
the
best
course
of
action
rather
than
merely
outlining
the
options
and
instructing
the
client
to
pick
the
path
of
his
choice
many
scholars
writing
about
client
centered
lawyering
use
the
term
holistic
to
describe
the
lawyer
s
role
within
this
model
n
the
lawyer
remains
neutral
and
serves
as
a
resource
to
the
client
during
his
decision
making
process
n
while
this
model
is
intended
to
allow
the
client
to
make
all
decisions
autonomously
involving
the
lawyer
only
when
necessary
some
scholars
believe
this
cannot
work
in
practice
n
one
critic
argues
that
the
differences
between
the
client
centered
and
traditional
models
are
nonexistent
when
applied
to
everyday
lawyering
the
client
centered
literature
fails
to
present
even
a
single
example
in
which
a
lawyer
sits
down
with
a
client
and
walks
through
alternative
case
theories
and
their
implications
for
the
case
and
client
in
this
respect
the
client
centered
approach
differs
little
from
the
traditional
approach
which
relegates
virtually
every
decision
about
case
theory
to
lawyers
n
other
critics
argue
that
clients
are
not
in
the
best
position
to
make
legal
decisions
instead
when
a
client
hires
you
he
demonstrates
tacit
willingness
for
you
to
make
lawyering
skills
decisions
free
from
consultation
with
them
n
the
difficulty
is
in
the
execution
professor
jane
stoever
writes
about
teaching
her
students
to
be
client
centered
and
client
empowering
advocates
who
provide
representation
that
enhances
both
a
survivors
safety
and
autonomy
n
implicit
in
client
centered
lawyering
is
that
the
client
may
reach
a
different
decision
than
the
lawyer
having
fostered
that
autonomy
what
do
we
do
when
autonomy
and
safety
diverge
professors
susan
bryant
and
maria
arias
also
discuss
empowering
their
clinic
s
domestic
violence
clients
as
part
of
the
clinic
s
design
n
professors
bryant
and
arias
note
that
a
client
centered
approach
allows
the
students
to
see
patterns
of
oppression
and
recognize
the
uniqueness
of
each
client
s
situation
n
they
discuss
a
case
in
which
the
students
determined
that
the
client
wanted
to
file
court
papers
seeking
custody
and
a
restraining
order
which
the
students
prepared
but
the
client
missed
her
appointment
to
sign
the
papers
the
students
later
learned
through
a
social
worker
that
the
client
while
afraid
of
her
husband
was
not
ready
to
pursue
a
legal
remedy
n
professors
bryant
and
arias
note
that
the
clinic
s
client
empowerment
allows
the
client
to
participate
in
defining
what
a
lawyer
s
role
should
be
n
and
that
in
such
a
relationship
the
lawyer
s
role
changes
with
each
client
because
the
lawyer
alone
does
not
set
the
professional
boundaries
n
professor
michelle
jacobs
endorses
client
based
lawyering
as
a
good
model
for
students
but
states
that
a
major
weakness
is
the
failure
to
address
race
class
and
to
a
lesser
extent
gender
in
the
attorney
client
relationship
n
professor
jacobs
argues
that
the
purpose
of
client
centered
lawyering
as
a
model
is
to
return
the
client
to
the
centrality
of
the
lawyer
s
work
but
that
clients
particularly
clients
of
color
and
women
are
still
at
the
margins
of
the
relationship
n
she
reminds
us
that
everyone
including
lawyers
law
students
and
law
professors
have
preconceived
notions
rooted
in
our
cultural
background
n
in
the
domestic
violence
arena
our
preconceived
notions
often
center
on
our
difficulty
in
accepting
that
a
victim
of
domestic
violence
remains
with
her
abuser
a
great
deal
of
the
literature
on
domestic
violence
tries
to
answer
the
question
why
do
abused
women
stay
as
lawyers
we
translate
that
question
to
what
can
we
do
to
help
our
client
leave
as
professor
jacobs
points
out
only
when
we
see
the
client
s
reality
can
we
truly
work
with
the
client
in
a
collaborative
way
n
putting
aside
our
preconceived
notions
does
not
answer
our
question
of
limits
i
e
is
there
a
point
at
which
we
cannot
assist
the
client
in
relation
to
the
court
or
her
own
risky
behavior
but
it
does
move
us
further
down
the
road
in
our
case
study
this
was
the
single
most
important
factor
in
acting
as
we
did
b
cause
lawyering
as
austin
sarat
and
stuart
scheingold
have
noted
providing
a
single
cross
culturally
valid
definition
of
the
concept
of
cause
lawyering
is
impossible
n
writing
on
the
intersections
of
race
space
and
poverty
john
calmore
writes
that
cause
lawyering
encompasses
various
law
related
activities
from
rights
assertion
to
legal
counseling
that
relies
on
law
related
means
to
achieve
social
justice
for
individuals
and
subordinated
or
disadvantaged
groups
n
stuart
scheingold
n
describes
cause
lawyering
as
left
activist
n
richard
abel
writes
that
the
moments
when
law
offers
leverage
to
the
relatively
powerless
as
well
as
those
when
it
is
wielded
or
trumped
by
power
are
occasions
for
cause
lawyering
n
and
thomas
hilbink
reviewing
sarat
and
scheingold
comments
on
the
definitional
difficulty
noting
that
belief
in
a
cause
and
a
desire
to
advance
that
cause
are
the
forces
that
drive
cause
lawyering
actions
for
cause
lawyers
but
how
does
one
determine
what
fits
within
the
rubric
n
ann
southworth
one
of
the
few
scholars
who
has
examined
the
right
s
response
to
the
historic
left
leaning
cause
lawyering
shows
that
the
cause
in
cause
lawyering
can
be
broad
indeed
and
virtually
every
progressive
cause
lawyer
now
has
a
conservative
counterpart
n
today
for
every
cause
we
can
be
confident
that
there
are
cause
lawyers
on
every
side
of
the
issue
cause
lawyering
in
the
field
of
domestic
violence
can
take
a
variety
of
approaches
karen
czapanskiy
notes
that
women
lawyers
and
law
professors
were
the
first
to
construct
the
issue
as
a
legal
problem
partly
as
a
consequence
of
the
identification
of
the
battering
of
women
as
an
issue
affecting
women
s
liberation
feminist
women
lawyers
were
instrumental
in
developing
the
theory
and
legal
regime
addressing
domestic
violence
issues
n
these
efforts
took
a
variety
of
forms
including
criminal
defense
n
family
law
in
both
legal
services
offices
n
and
private
practice
n
and
state
and
federal
legislative
efforts
to
establish
governmental
intervention
on
behalf
of
domestic
violence
victims
a
remarkably
successful
effort
resulting
in
restraining
order
statutes
and
other
protections
in
every
state
n
as
well
as
the
passage
of
the
violence
against
women
act
vawa
in
and
reauthorizations
in
and
n
still
today
s
domestic
violence
lawyers
may
agree
on
the
cause
but
not
necessarily
the
approach
twenty
years
after
professor
czapanskiy
emphasized
their
seminal
role
feminist
attorneys
still
play
a
major
role
in
representing
individual
clients
in
domestic
violence
cases
but
the
advocacy
community
is
split
into
those
who
support
and
those
who
oppose
mandatory
arrest
mandatory
arrest
and
no
drop
prosecutions
have
placed
prosecutors
in
a
more
prominent
role
as
deborah
epstein
has
noted
activists
have
focused
on
transforming
the
responses
of
police
prosecutors
and
the
courts
n
legal
reforms
include
warrantless
arrest
mandatory
arrest
no
drop
prosecutions
and
temporary
orders
with
substantial
implications
and
few
procedural
protections
n
donna
wills
a
veteran
family
violence
prosecutor
in
los
angeles
has
written
that
she
firmly
believes
that
an
aggressive
no
drop
and
no
dismissal
policy
is
the
enlightened
approach
to
domestic
violence
prosecutions
n
wills
approaches
domestic
violence
through
a
cause
lawyer
s
lens
stating
that
it
is
a
societal
problem
not
just
an
individual
or
private
problem
with
a
strong
state
interest
in
maintaining
public
safety
in
focusing
on
the
state
interest
wills
expands
the
protective
umbrella
to
include
children
as
secondary
victims
n
to
wills
and
other
supporters
of
mandatory
arrest
and
no
drop
policies
these
policies
prevent
batterers
from
controlling
the
justice
system
through
their
victims
n
under
this
approach
the
domestic
violence
victim
is
best
protected
by
having
no
power
with
decision
making
resting
with
the
state
in
the
form
of
the
police
and
prosecutor
as
wills
admits
there
is
no
evidence
that
mandatory
arrest
and
no
drop
policies
reduce
the
incidence
of
domestic
violence
n
betsy
tsai
a
domestic
violence
resource
coordinator
for
the
new
york
city
courts
notes
that
criminal
justice
system
employees
are
frustrated
and
embarrassed
by
their
inability
to
protect
victims
of
domestic
violence
and
suggests
that
the
court
system
should
look
toward
specialized
domestic
violence
courts
n
the
specialized
courts
incorporate
therapeutic
jurisprudence
a
multidisciplinary
effort
to
provide
comprehensive
services
n
therapeutic
jurisprudence
is
a
reaction
to
the
inevitable
mental
health
and
psychological
functioning
of
the
participants
in
the
legal
system
n
in
practice
a
therapeutic
approach
would
include
a
supportive
and
informative
environment
to
the
victim
victim
and
witness
advocates
police
training
more
careful
monitoring
of
defendant
compliance
with
court
orders
and
participation
in
intervention
programs
for
abusers
n
this
does
not
mean
that
the
victim
regains
control
of
the
decisions
that
so
dramatically
affect
her
life
in
many
jurisdictions
employing
a
therapeutic
jurisprudence
system

once

of
society
that
is

mary
and
elizabeth
raise
the
question
of
whether
private
rights
become
public
once
a
victim
seeks
state
intervention
does
society
have
an
independent
interest
in
enforcing
the
restraining
order
courts
have
allowed
the
public
interest
to
transcend
private
choices
including
forced
feeding
in
prisons
n
and
forced
medical
care
to
children
even
in
the
face
of
religious
opposition
by
the
child
s
parents
n
the
commonality
in
these
cases
is
the
likelihood
of
harm
and
the
public
interest
in
preventing
that
harm
the
question
when
it
comes
to
domestic
violence
cases
is
the
extent
to
which
we
are
comfortable
predicting
future
violence
and
whether
or
not
our
conclusions
should
affect
our
representation
of
clients
who
are
at
risk
in
the
area
of
domestic
violence
the
rationale
behind
mandatory
arrest
policies
and
forced
testimony
combines
the
notions
of
many
of
the
themes
of
this
paper
including
a
patronizing
view
of
protecting
the
victim
from
her
inability
to
protect
herself
a
reformist
attitude
of
treating
all
cases
uniformly
the
criminalization
of
domestic
violence
and
the
transfer
of
decision
making
to
the
state
does
state
involvement
either
through
civil
or
criminal
process
turn
a
private
domestic
violence
matter
into
a
public
issue
as
we
discussed
earlier
several
courts
have
sanctioned
women
or
forced
them
to
testify
when
the
women
refused
to
cooperate
with
the
state
in
pursuing
domestic
violence
remedies
or
testifying
in
criminal
matters
implicit
in
these
decisions
is
a
belief
that
the
right
to
withdraw
from
civil
or
criminal
prosecution
has
been
supplanted
by
state
interests
to
get
a
sense
of
judicial
reasoning
in
domestic
violence
cases
it
helps
to
look
at
death
penalty
cases
where
the
issue
of
public
rights
trumping
the
private
attorney
client
relationship
has
arisen
prominently
in
a
connecticut
court
sentenced
michael
ross
to
death
after
he
confessed
to
murdering
eight
women
n
he
fought
execution
for
seventeen
years
but
ultimately
withdrew
all
appeals
and
requested
that
the
execution
go
forward
n
starting
a
new
proceeding
questioning
whether
a
defendant
can
rationally
and
competently
choose
to
die
and
whether
the
public
has
a
right
to
contest
an
execution
the
chief
public
defender
s
office
sought
to
intervene
in
ross
s
case
arguing
that
ross
was
trying
to
commit
judicial
state
assisted
suicide
an
argument
based
on
ross
s
alleged
incompetence
to
make
the
decision
to
consent
to
the
execution
n
ross
s
former
lawyer
the
office
of
the
public
defender
argued
that
ross
s
execution
would
make
executions
more
socially
and
politically
acceptable
an
issue
of
great
importance
to
the
public
defender
s
other
clients
facing
execution
n
the
public
defender
s
prediction
was
almost
certainly
factually
correct
but
this
is
not
how
attorneys
usually
act
rule
of
the
model
rules
of
professional
conduct
n
explicitly
prohibited
the
public
defender
from
representing
an
interest
adverse
to
ross
and
rule
explicitly
prohibited
using
information
obtained
during
representation
against
ross
s
interests
n
how
then
could
the
public
defender
use
its
knowledge
of
ross
s
mental
condition
as
the
basis
for
legal
actions
that
in
the
words
of
ross
s
subsequent
attorney
t
r
paulding
are
contrary
to
the
defendant
s
wishes
or
desires
n
the
answer
and
this
is
not
much
of
an
answer
is
that
some
issues
raise
public
as
well
as
private
rights
ross
understood
the
incongruous
nature
of
the
proceedings
stating
on
his
web
site
that
i
fully
support
their
position
and
efforts
to
bring
about
the
abolition
of
capital
punishment
in
this
state
but
i
do
have
a
problem
when
they
interfere
with
my
personal
decisions
to
resolve
this
case
in
a
manner
that
i
believe
will
harm
the
least
number
of
people
these
are
decisions
that
i
and
i
alone
must
make
n
ross
objected
to
the
actions
of
the
public
defender
stating
what
i
m
hoping
is
that
january
i
will
be
executed
i
just
don
t
understand
why
the
public
defenders
can
t
understand
that
i
mean
it

so
simple
and
it
s
my
damned
decision
n
ross
s
sister
and
father
each
filed
separate
next
friend
actions
his
sister
arguing
that
ross
was
not
mentally
competent
to
waive
his
rights
and
his
father
arguing
that
his
rights
were
being
violated
because
he
could
not
volunteer
to
be
executed
n
the
case
was
assigned
to
u
s
district
judge
robert
chatigny
who
raised
concerns
about
the
competency
claims
n
paulding
argued
that
ross
understood
the
appeals
process
was
knowledgeable
about
death
penalty
law
and
was
choosing
to
forego
appeals
n
he
stated
that
ross
had
made
a
logical
rational
decision
he
needed
a
voice
in
our
court
system
i

i
m
an
attorney

m
a
defense
attorney
i
think
your
duty
your
basic
duty
as
an
attorney
is
to
represent
your
client
n
judge
chatigny
tried
to
persuade
paulding
to
pursue
an
appeal
despite
ross
s
expressed
wishes
of
his
client
n
telling
him
what
you
are
doing
is
terribly
terribly
wrong
no
matter
how
well
motivated
you
are
you
have
a
client
whose
competence
is
in
serious
doubt
and
you
don
t
know
what
you
are
talking
about
n
that
failure
to
pursue
an
appeal
was
malpractice
n
and
threatening
to
go
after
paulding
s
license
to
practice
law
if
future
evidence
showed
that
ross
was
not
competent
n
paulding
got
the
message
and
filed
motions
for
another
competency
hearing
in
state
court
the
state
court
held
that
ross
was
mentally
competent
to
waive
future
appeals
and
proceed
to
his
execution
n
he
was
executed
on
may
n
in
the
new
jersey
supreme
court
considering
a
similar
question
explicitly
transformed
the
defendant
s
rights
into
a
public
question
holding
that
appeals
of
a
death
sentence
were
mandatory
and
could
not
be
waived
n
stating
that
the
public
interest
transcends
the
preferences
of
individual
defendants
n
like
ross
john
martini
requested
that
his
execution
proceed
as
scheduled
and
that
his
public
defender
not
pursue
post
conviction
relief
in
proceeding
with
a
post
conviction
review
the
court
noted
that
it
is
difficult
to
explain
why
a
murderer
who
has
admitted
his
guilt
and
had
his
conviction
and
sentence
of
death
affirmed
on
direct
appeal
should
not
be
granted
his
request
to
be
executed
immediately
for
some
no
explanation
may
be
necessary
for
others
no
explanation
will
suffice
for
those
who
wish
to
understand
we
explain
that
under
our
form
of
government
it
is
not
the
inmate
on
death
row
or
the
accused
who
determines
when
and
whether
the
state
shall
execute
a
prisoner
rather
the
law
itself
makes
that
determination
the
public
has
an
interest
in
the
reliability
and
integrity
of
a
death
sentencing
decision
that
transcends
the
preferences
of
individual
defendants
n
the
court
recognized
that
its
view
was
not
universal
we
acknowledge
that
other
jurisdictions
do
not
recognize
the
standing
of
one
such
as
the
public
defender
to
prosecute
a
post
conviction
relief
application
on
behalf
of
a
death
row
inmate
who
does
not
seek
their
assistance
it
is
a
natural
reaction
for
some
to
wish
to
be
rid
of
an
admitted
murderer
who
asks
to
be
executed
the
court
is
nonetheless
required
to
ensure
the
integrity
of
death
sentences
in
new
jersey
n
martini
changed
his
mind
and
requested
that
his
public
defender
pursue
any
available
remedies
n
he
was
subsequently
convicted
of
three
additional
murders
in
pennsylvania
and
arizona
n
on
july
the
new
jersey
supreme
court
upheld
martini
s
death
sentence
but
new
jersey
had
imposed
a
moratorium
on
the
death
penalty
six
months
earlier
n
martini
died
in
prison
in
n
are
public
rights
implicated
in
domestic
violence
cases
as
elizabeth
tulis
noted
when
a
victim
obtains
a
restraining
order
not
to
mention
a
protective
order
she
cedes
some
authority
to
the
state
do
we
as
lawyers
cede
a
part
of
our
relationship
with
our
clients
we
are
trained
as
lawyers
to
separate
ourselves
from
the
consequences
to
third
parties
of
our
representation
criminal
defense
attorneys
accept
that
they
are
representing
the
accused
not
the
victim
society
or
the
hypothetical
future
victim
attorneys
representing
a
parent
in
a
dependency
and
neglect
case
take
direction
from
the
parent
regardless
of
qualms
about
the
child
s
future
care
in
domestic
violence
cases
we
accept
that
there
are
valid
reasons
why
women
do
not
leave
the
abuser
and
that
additional
abuse
may
and
often
does
occur
during
the
representation
there
is
a
different
quality
to
a
case
in
which
a
client
is
using
the
lawyer
s
legal
services
to
avoid
a
court
order
meant
to
protect
her
is
there
a
point
at
which
this
becomes
a
public
right
enforceable
by
the
state
while
it
is
rare
victims
having
obtained
restraining
orders
have
been
charged
with
violating
those
orders
while
some
courts
have
struck
down
the
charges
against
the
victim
as
a
violation
of
the
due
process
clause
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
n
the
analogy
to
death
cases
may
be
useful
on
a
lethality
scale
but
falters
when
considering
the
competing
interests
of
the
victim
when
law
enforcement
intervenes
and
penalizes
the
victim
for
violating
a
restraining
order
against
her
abuser
the
focus
of
the
legal
system
shifts
from
the
abuser
to
the
victim
and
the
abuser
is
not
held
fully
accountable
n
the
victim
is
prosecuted
for
inviting
her
abuser
back
into
her
life
often
for
a
legitimate
purpose
such
as
to
discuss
childcare
or
request
financial
assistance
n
when
a
civil
restraining
order
can
be
enforced
against
either
party
the
purposes
of
the
restraining
order
system
are
undermined
victims
will
be
less
likely
to
report
abuse
for
fear
any
action
on
theirs
will
be
used
against
them
abusers
could
use
the
restraining
orders
as
continued
ploys
against
their
battered
victims
and
the
blame
for
the
abuse
shifts
from
the
batterer
to
the
battered
in
the
abstract
the
public
enforcement
of
restraining
orders
like
mandatory
arrest
policies
has
advantages
however
in
the
context
of
domestic
violence
the
public
s
interest
in
the
victim
s
well
being
is
not
so
black
and
white
the
enforcement
of
the
restraining
order
may
serve
the
public
good
of
protecting
the
victim
but
if
the
means
necessary
for
that
enforcement
further
victimizes
the
battered
woman
and
provides
a
disincentive
for
victims
to
report
abuse
at
all
then
we
need
to
question
whether
the
benefit
of
enhanced
enforcement
outweighs
the
inherent
value
of
client
based
decision
making
we
are
concerned
about
our
clients
safety
and
we
try
to
advise
them
as
best
we
can
but
we
are
not
in
the
business
of
predicting
future
harm
others
however
are
predicting
behavior
and
lethality
assessments
are
increasingly
a
part
of
law
enforcement
and
safety
planning
and
it
is
useful
to
take
a
look
at
this
field
vii
risk
and
lethality
assessment
and
the
predictability
of
violence
and
does
it
matter
legal
scholars
have
devoted
a
good
deal
of
effort
to
the
question
of
character
evidence
and
how
it
can
help
predict
behavior
much
of
the
discussion
starts
with
g
w
allport
a
psychologist
a
founder
of
trait
theory
allport
believed
that
traits
were
the
most
fundamental
building
blocks
of
personality
n
trait
theorists
believed
that
traits
were
stable
and
enduring
and
produced
generally
consistent
behavior
over
a
variety
of
situations
n
in
the
realm
of
trait
theory
a
person
who
lies
in
one
situation
will
lie
in
other
situations
a
person
who
is
violent
in
one
circumstance
will
likely
be
violent
in
other
circumstances
n
trait
theory
would
allow
us
to
predict
behavior
including
criminal
behavior
empirical
research
did
not
support
the
trait
theorists
n
walter
mischel
found
that
behavior
depends
on
stimulus
situations
and
is
specific
to
the
situation
response
patterns
even
in
highly
similar
situations
often
fail
to
be
strongly
related
n
however
between
and
mischel
along
with
his
colleague
yuichi
shoda
modified
his
views
on
character
traits
and
predictability
mischel
and
shoda
assert
that
we
can
develop
a
fuller
personality
profile
that
includes
a
variety
of
psychological
ingredients
one
that
could
successfully
predict
particularized
behavior
n
more
recently
professor
edward
imwinkelried
asserted
that
most
recent
studies
agree
that
predicting
behavior
based
on
interactions
between
character
traits
and
situations
is
more
accurate
than
predictions
based
on
either
traits
or
situations
n
since
legal
scholarship
on
predictability
revolves
around
the
admissibility
in
court
of
character
evidence
a
theory
more
accurate
is
different
from
more
likely
than
not
and
is
not
going
to
result
in
reconsidering
long
standing
rules
of
evidence
the
question
here
however
is
whether
predictability
should
inform
our
representation
of
vulnerable
clients
domestic
violence
is
a
subset
within
the
broader
category
of
violent
crime
many
people
including
members
of
congress
believe
that
crimes
of
sexual
violence
and
child
molestation
deserve
special
treatment
to
the
chagrin
of
many
judges
lawyers
and
scholars
congress
amended
the
federal
rules
of
evidence
to
allow
the
admission
of
past
similar
acts
in
criminal
cases
in
which
the
defendant
is
accused
of
sexual
assault
n
or
child
molestation
n
and
to
allow
the
admission
of
past
similar
actions
for
civil
actions
involving
sexual
assault
or
child
molestation
n
in
a
report
submitted
to
congress
in
the
judicial
conference
requested
that
congress
reconsider
rules
and
reporting
overwhelming
opposition
two
years
later
katharine
baker
wrote
that
advocates
of
rule
unabashedly
and
without
proof
suggest
that
rapists
are
more
likely
than
other
criminals
to
repeat
their
acts
the
evidence
that
we
have
is
to
the
contrary
n
according
to
studies
by
the
bureau
of
justice
statistics
recidivism
for
drug
offenses
larceny
theft
burglary
and
robbery
are
all
much
higher
than
rape
sexual
assault
and
child
molestation
in
fact
only
homicide
is
lower
n
that
did
not
deter
congress
or
the
state
legislatures
of
california
and
illinois
both
of
which
amended
their
rules
of
evidence
to
allow
prior
acts
of
domestic
violence
in
cases
in
which
the
victim
was
murdered
n
california

in
response
to
the

simpson
acquittal
and
illinois
just
prior
to
the
scott
peterson
trial
which
culminated
in
a
conviction
the
history
of
predicting
criminal
behavior
is
at
best
a
cautionary
tale
the
ancient
greeks
including
aristotle
believed
in
physiognomy
the
ability
to
predict
human
character
by
physical
appearance
in
the
th
century
phrenologists
believed
they
could
predict
future
criminal
behavior

certain
bumps

by
many
intellectuals
to
be
a
real

bram
stoker

and
arthur
conan

in
the
adventures
of

refer
to

approval

that

on

findings
of

george

that

the

report

that
overall
all
four
of
the

were
significantly
related
to
subsequent
severity
of
abuse
but
not
very
highly
related
n
a
study
of
dvsi
usage
between
and
found
that
the
predictive
value
of
the
dvsi
across
all
risk
groups
was
not
statistically
significant
n
the
very
existence
of
lethality
and
risk
assessment
tools
reveals
distrust
in
domestic
violence
victims
ability
to
understand
their
situations
or
predict
their
risk
of
being
reassaulted
or
murdered
these
instruments
arise
from
the
belief
that
most
people
do
a
poor
job
of
evaluating
their
own
risk
for
negative
outcomes
n
some
researchers
believe
that
domestic
violence
victims
are
deficient
in
recognizing
danger
in
domestic
violence
relationships
n
others
believe
that
victims
cannot
predict
future
violence
even
with
the
aid
of
risk
assessment
instruments
because
there
is
no
real
way
to
predict
unpredictable
behavior
n
contrary
to
the
inherent
claims
of
the
various
risk
assessment
tools
victims
are
generally
the
best
predictors
of
their
own
risk
of
being
seriously
injured
n
victims
have
a
unique
ability
to
predict
the
violence
and
anticipate
the
degree
of
violence
n
studies
show
that
domestic
violence
victims
ratings
of
their
risk
of
future
violence
committed
by
an
intimate
partner
are
fairly
accurate
n
almost
sixty
five
of
domestic
violence
victims
accurately
predict
their
risk
of
reassault
n
victims
may
not
accurately
predict
lethal
violence
however
in
one
study
only
about
half
of
victims
of
intimate
partner
homicide
or
attempted
homicide
recognized
that
their
abusers
were
capable
of
killing
them
n
in
judging
risk
victims
use
different
factors
than
those
utilized
by
risk
assessment
tools
including
interpretations
of
the
abuser
s
moods
facial
expressions
speech
patterns
and
verbal
threats
n
they
also
rely
on
abuser
personality
traits
and
dynamic
factors
like
the
abuser
s
ability
to
find
the
victim
and
his
desire
for
revenge
n
these
factors
are
difficult
for
risk
assessment
tools
to
capture
victims
also
rely
on
some
of
the
same
factors
used
by
assessment
tools
to
predict
violence
including
the
status
of
the
relationship
the
history
of
violence
in
the
relationship
and
substance
use
n
some
of
the
instruments
primary
indicators
like
the
abuser
s
criminal
history
or
the
abuser
being
in
a
stepparent
role
play
almost
no
role
in
victim
prediction
n
in
fact
lethality
assessments
generally
incorporate
the
victim
s
own
assessment
of
risk
bolstering
the
effectiveness
of
the
instrument
for
example
the
first
risk
factor
listed
by
de
becker
who
developed
mosaic
is
the
woman
has
intuitive
feelings
that
she
is
at
risk
n
this
factor
is
the
only
one
to
appear
in
italics
adding
emphasis
to
its
importance
to
the
assessment
the
last
factor
is
his
wife
partner
fears
he
will
injure
or
kill
her
she
has
discussed
this
with
others
or
has
made
plans
to
be
carried
out
in
the
event
of
her
death
n
both
factors
support
the
importance
of
victim
prediction
in
risk
assessment
and
incorporates
victim
prediction
into
the
instrument
campbell
s
danger
assessment
also
incorporates
victim
risk
assessment
into
its
instrument
the
eighteenth
factor
in
the
danger
assessment
is
do
you
believe
he
is
capable
of
killing
you
n
research
shows
that
incorporating
the
victim
s
assessment
of
danger
improves
instrument
prediction
n
one
study
revealed
that
victims
perceptions
of
risk
were
better
at
predicting
reassault
than
the
k
sid
but
that
the
danger
assessment
was
more
accurate
at
predicting
lethal
violence
than
the
victims
themselves
n
the
research
concluded
that
women
s
perceptions
of
risk
are
a
reasonably
accurate
predictor
of
reassault
n
interestingly
the
study
found
that
a
victim
s
risk
was
to
some
extent
determined
by
the
victim
s
perception
of
the
risk
victims
who
were
at
greatest
risk
of
future
harm
were
those
who
felt
somewhat
safe
and
therefore
did
not
take
proactive
action
to
seek
safety
such
as
separating
from
the
abuser
or
safety
planning
n
victims
who
felt
safe
victims
who
felt
like
they
were
in
danger
and
victims
who
did
not
know
whether
they
were
at
risk
were
less
likely
to
be
reassaulted
because
there
was
less
risk
or
because
precautions
were
taken
n
it
is
not
our
purpose
to
opine
on
whether
mosaic
the
dvsi
or
any
other
instrument
should
be
used
to
predict
serious
or
lethal
intimate
partner
violence
nor
do
we
have
the
capacity
to
do
so
but
it
is
fair
to
assume
that
these
efforts
will
become
increasingly
sophisticated
and
the
implications
are
dramatic
the
notion
of
law
enforcement
profiling
as
a
preventative
tool
is
well
established
and
there
is
a
great
deal
of
literature
on
the
value
or
lack
thereof
of
profiling
our
question
is
different
even
assuming
that
the
perfect
profiling
tool
exists
does
it
affect
the
attorney
client
relationship
put
another
way
when
we
talk
about
the
attorney
client
relationship
particularly
in
the
context
of
client
centered
lawyering
we
take
for
granted
that
the
lawyer
takes
direction
from
the
competent
client
can
we
maintain
that
presumption
if
we
believe
mosaic
is
an
accurate
assessor
and
mosaic
tells
us
that
an
abuser
is
about
to
commit
one
of
america
s
most
predictable
murders
n
murder
can
be
the
ultimate
form
of
control
through
the
threat
of
murder
the
abuser
leverages
everything
the
victim
has
her
access
to
work
her
children
and
the
world
prior
domestic
violence
is
the
single
greatest
predictor
of
femicide
by
an
intimate
partner
in
one
study
of
female
murder
victims
had
been
physically
abused
by
the
same
intimate
partner
who
killed
them
n
thirty
nine
percent
of
all
femicides
and
probably
even
more
are
committed
by
an
intimate
partner
n
in
another
study
domestic
violence
homicide
victims
had
experienced
violence
within
thirty
days
of
the
homicide
some
within
a
day
or
two
before
the
homicide
n
without
using
risk
or
lethality
assessment
tools
domestic
violence
attorneys
know
that
prior
domestic
violence
predicts
homicidal
possibilities
most
domestic
violence
attorneys
fear
that
the
next
news
item
about
domestic
violence
homicide
will
feature
one
of
their
clients
while
attorneys
should
be
concerned
about
the
potential
for
lethal
violence
against
their
clients
this
fear
must
be
subsumed
by
the
responsibilities
we
carry
in
our
professional
capacity
ultimately
the
lawyer
s
own
worries
about
her
role
or
responsibility
in
the
client
s
safety
must
give
way
to
the
client
s
interests
conclusion
we
approached
this
article
as
practicing
lawyers
and
clinical
teachers
looking
at
a
problem
that
domestic
violence
victims
and
their
lawyers
face
every
day
given
the
many
vagaries
of
the
rules
of
professional
responsibility
and
the
basic
agency
role
of
the
lawyer
it
is
not
surprising
that
our
own
discipline
offered
little
help
does
anything
else
matter
we
think
that
is
a
fair
question
in
writing
this
article
we
have
come
full
circle
the
project
started
with
a
post
hoc
reflection
of
our
actions
in
barbara
s
case
as
is
evident
from
the
paper
each
question
led
to
new
questions
some
of
which
were
unexpected
all
domestic
violence
practitioners
are
conscious
of
the
nightmare
scenario
inherent
in
their
cases
and
we
are
no
different
we
are
aware
that
barbara
s
case
could
have
turned
out
differently
that
is
a
sobering
thought
and
in
the
clinical
context
we
asked
ourselves
whether
students
should
be
put
into
the
position
of
being
in
the
front
lines
of
a
case
that
has
the
potential
to
be
so
devastating
in
the
end
we
came
back
to
where
we
started
while
we
do
not
discount
the
effect
of
a
positive
result
for
the
client
on
our
views
we
believe
strongly
that
our
commitment
to
our
client
included
the
trust
in
her
ability
and
judgment
to
make
the
decision
to
argue
that
her
husband
should
not
be
incarcerated
and
that
our
commitment
to
our
students
included
sharing
the
full
responsibilities
of
our
representation
in
making
the
latter
conclusion
we
are
informed
and
impressed
by
our
students
views
we
discussed
these
issues
with
them
and
as
is
evident
from
their
g
chat
they
discussed
the
issues
with
each
other
that
said
we
have
three
caveats
first
we
and
our
students
benefitted
from
a
multi
disciplinary
approach
which
included
classes
by
a
psychologist
and
social
workers
on
the
nature
of
domestic
violence
along
with
the
opportunity
to
consult
with
the
same
professionals
on
cases
we
encouraged
students
to
use
these
opportunities
to
talk
about
their
own
concerns
and
provided
the
opportunity
to
do
so
in
confidential
settings
this
is
not
a
luxury
we
think
it
is
a
critical
part
of
clinical
work
in
domestic
violence
second
we
cannot
underestimate
the
benefit
to
both
clients
and
students
of
having
students
working
on
the
same
case
for
at
least
two
semesters
with
the
opportunity
to
continue
longer
especially
for
the
purpose
of
continuing
with
an
existing
client
during
our
representation
of
barbara
our
students
prepared
filed
mediated
and
litigated
motions
and
the
trial
defended
an
appeal
prepared
and
filed
a
successful
petition
for
innocent
spouse
tax
relief
negotiated
forbearance
on
a
mortgage
foreclosure
negotiated
forbearance
and
obtained
a
court
ordered
title
transfer
on
an
automobile
talked
with
accountants
bankers
psychiatrists
social
workers
victim
advocates
court
mediators
and
lawyers
and
generally
lived
with
the
case
throughout
law
school
they
appeared
in
court
numerous
times
before
four
judges
and
by
the
time
the
graduated
were
greeted
warmly
in
the
courthouse
by
state
marshals
family
relations
advisors
and
court
clerks
as
barbara
mentioned
several
times
the
relationship
she
built
with
mary
and
elizabeth
provided
relief
at
times
of
stress
it
would
have
been
difficult
to
change
students
every
semester
third
as
professor
carey
has
written
elsewhere
n
we
continue
to
believe
in
the
need
to
provide
holistic
services
with
a
full
range
of
legal
services
we
believe
our
obligation
to
our
client
is
to
use
our
skills
to
try
to
solve
her
problems
and
our
obligation
to
our
students
is
to
teach
the
skills
necessary
to
make
that
effort
there
are
cases
that
conclude
with
the
granting
of
a
restraining
order
but
many
cases
involve
other
family
issues
as
well
as
collateral
legal
issues
arising
from
the
breakup
of
the
relationship
if
we
are
truly
committed
to
teaching
best
practices
we
need
to
be
willing
to
provide
the
highest
quality
services
in
the
case
of
domestic
violence
obtaining
a
restraining
order
without
resolving
child
custody
support
and
other
critical
family
issues
will
inevitably
leave
many
clients
at
a
loss
when
we
limit
our
representation
we
start
from
the
proposition
that
we
are
not
intending
to
resolve
the
client
s
problems
the
message
to
students
is
that
skills
are
enough
we
should
be
striving
for
higher
standards

introduction
rapid
technological
advancement
has
dramatically
expanded
the
warrantless
powers
of
government
to
obtain
information
about
individual
citizens
directly
from
the
private
domain
biometrics
technology
n
such
as
voice
recognition
hand
measurement
iris
and
retinal
imaging
and
facial
recognition
technology
frt
offers
enormous
potential
for
law
enforcement
and
national
security
but
it
comes
at
a
cost
although
much
of
the
american
public
is
complacent
with
government
monitoring
for
security
reasons
n
people
also
expect
to
go
about
daily
life
in
relative
obscurity
unidentifiable
to
others
they
do
not
already
know
do
not
care
to
know
or
are
not
required
to
know
so
long
as
they
abide
by
the
law
the
reality
is
quite
different
the
government
and
the
private
sector
have
the
capacity
for
surveillance
of
nearly
everyone
in
america
as
one
commentator
puts
it
soon
there
really
will
be
nowhere
to
run
and
nowhere
to
hide
short
of
living
in
a
cave
far
removed
from
technology
n
frt
is
a
major
contributor
to
the
spectre
of
an
orwellian
society
n
facebook
uses
it
to
identify
friends
from
uploaded
photos
which
are
permanently
affixed
in
cyberspace
n
and
accessible
to
the
government
n
federal
and
state
authorities
have
their
own
databases
of
images
collected
from
drivers
licenses
public
surveillance
cameras
unmanned
aerial
drones
and
tiny
recording
devices
attached
to
police
uniforms
n
currently
the
fbi
is
working
on
a
billion
effort
to
expand
its
fingerprint
identification
system
to
cross
reference
frt
and
other
biometric
data
against
a
vast
data
repository
that
includes
some
million
criminal
mug
shot
photos
n
with
frt
a
federal
agent
or
corporate
marketer
can
convert
any
number
of
these
facial
images
into
algorithms
associate
them
with
countless
other
bits
of
personal
data
accumulating
throughout
the
global
information
network
and
track
the
most
intimate
details
of
an
unsuspecting
person
s
daily
life
there
is
no
recognized
constitutional
theory
for
placing
boundaries
on
the
government
s
ability
to
engage
in
ubiquitous
monitoring
of
citizens
based
on
images
snapped
in
public
or
posted
online
the
supreme
court
has
made
clear
that
the
fourth
amendment
does
not
protect
what
a
person
knowingly
exposes
to
the
public
n
nor
does
it
cover
information
revealed
to
third
parties
n
thus
although
corporations
and
individual
citizens
generate
the
largest
storehouses
of
personal
data
today
the
government
through
its
subpoena
powers
contractual
agreements
and
public
access
to
online
data
can
effectively
bootstrap
private
information
into
its
own
domain
without
contending
with
the
constitution
as
a
consequence
technology
has
minimized
the
constitution
s
importance
as
a
mechanism
for
protecting
against
arbitrary
government
tracking
of
one
s
movements
habits
relationships
interests
and
thoughts
this
article
attempts
to
reassert
the
constitution
s
relevance
when
it
comes
to
surveillance
through
frt
and
related
technologies
in
two
ways
first
it
argues
for
recognition
of
anonymity
as
a
constitutional
value
that
is
both
implicit
in
the
court
s
fourth
amendment
jurisprudence
and
explicit
in
its
first
amendment
jurisprudence
second
it
suggests
that
a
shift
in
technology
s
intersection
with
data
from
analysis
of
static
bits
of
information
in
the
pre
digital
age
to
a
growing
respect
for
correlations
among
data
in
the
digital
age
warrants
a
fresh
look
at
fourth
amendment
doctrine
that
ex
cuses
surveillance
based
on
information
obtained
in
public
or
from
third
parties
n
frt
allows
users
to
correlate
numerical
faceprint
algorithms
with
other
data
points
to
create
new
information
relating
to
an
individual
s
past
present
and
future
life
n
constitutional
law
must
account
for
this
modern
capacity
to
manipulate
data
for
predictive
intelligence
to
this
end
the
article
derives
doctrinal
guidelines
for
grappling
with
technology
s
threat
to
the
constitutional
value
of
anonymity
from
a
reconciliation
of
the
fourth
and
first
amendment
law
bearing
on
the
issue
part
i
defines
anonymity
and
explains
that
respect
for
the
capacity
to
remain
physically
and
psychologically
unknown
to
the
government
traces
back
to
the
founding
with
the
advent
and
expansion
of
new
technologies
such
as
frt
the
ability
to
remain
anonymous
has
eroded
leading
to
a
litany
of
possible
harms
part
ii
reviews
the
existing
fourth
and
first
amendment
doctrine
that
is
available
to
stave
off
ubiquitous
government
surveillance
and
identifies
anonymity
as
a
constitutional
value
that
warrants
more
explicit
doctrinal
protection
although
the
fourth
amendment
has
been
construed
to
excise
surveillance
of
public
and
third
party
information
from
its
scope
the
court
s
recent
jurisprudence
indicates
a
growing
recognition
that
constitutional
doctrine
is
out
of
step
with
modern
surveillance
technologies
the
supreme
court
has
expressly
recognized
a
first
amendment
right
to
anonymous
speech
which
should
be
taken
into
account
in
assessing
the
constitutionality
of
government
surveillance
systems
under
the
fourth
amendment
this
part
accordingly
draws
a
distinction
between
cases
that
arose
in
the
pre
digital
age
in
which
content
was
often
collected
through
physical
trespass
or
eavesdropping
and
those
arising
in
the
digital
age
in
which
correlations
among
disparate
points
of
big
data
are
used
to
make
predictions
part
iii
argues
that
fourth
and
first
amendment
doctrine
should
be
reconciled
to
address
the
manipulation
versus
acquisition
of
frt
data
to
derive
new
information
about
individuals
which
is
exceedingly
intimate
and
otherwise
out
of
the
government
s
reach
this
part
suggests
that
this
qualitative
shift
in
information
gathering
is
constitutionally
significant
under
existing
doctrine
part
iii
also
offers
guidelines
gleaned
from
the
intersection
of
first
and
fourth
amendment
jurisprudence
for
consideration
by
lower
courts
and
legislators
as
they
address
the
threat
of
limitless
surveillance
which
big
data
and
new
technologies
present
i
the
public
value
of
anonymity
in
a
commentator
observed
that
one
day
automated
society
might
look
upon
privacy
with
the
same
air
of
amused
nostalgia
we
now
reserve
for
say
elaborate
eighteenth
century
drawing
room
manners
n
numerous
modern
scholars
have
similarly
declared
that
privacy
is
in
peril
distress
or
danger
n
much
has
been
written
about
the
need
to
adapt
fourth
amendment
law
to
accommodate
modern
infringements
on
privacy
interests
n
as
this
part
explains
frt
focuses
particular
attention
on
one
aspect
of
privacy
the
ability
to
manage
and
retain
one
s
anonymity
this
part
defines
anonymity
and
attempts
to
place
it
in
some
historical
context
although
american
colonists
lived
under
the
constant
gaze
of
their
communities
they
abhorred
the
officious
prying
of
british
authorities
they
also
robustly
engaged
in
anonymous
speech
this
part
goes
on
to
describe
modern
day
frt
and
the
threat
it
poses
to
privacy
in
the
twenty
first
century
in
short
technology
has
put
in
jeopardy
a
value
that
most
americans
take
for
granted
the
ability
to
carry
on
largely
incognito
if
we
so
choose
a
anonymity
defined
privacy
is
a
vague
notion
that
means
different
things
to
different
people
in
various
contexts
n
scholars
have
painstakingly
developed
taxonomies
for
privacy
parsing
its
subcomponents
in
an
effort
to
develop
a
more
accurate
vocabulary
for
debate
and
analysis
n
two
conceptions
of
privacy
are
particularly
accessible
to
most
laypeople
n
informational
privacy
is
the
interest
in
avoiding
disclosure
of
personal
matters
and
controlling
one
s
own
personal
information
which
the
supreme
court
has
suggested
is
constitutionally
protected
when
gathered
and
held
by
the
government
n
today
the
term
often
relates
to
information
stored
on
computer
systems
such
as
medical
records
financial
data
criminal
records
political
records
business
related
information
and
online
data
n
physical
privacy
has
traditionally
been
equated
with
the
protection
of
one
s
person
or
physical
space
such
as
a
home
or
vehicle
violations
of
physical
privacy
can
trigger
fourth
amendment
and
or
common
law
scrutiny
n
people
intrinsically
appreciate
the
need
for
legal
limits
on
the
ability
of
the
government
and
others
to
invade
one
s
home
or
body
absent
consent
related
to
both
informational
and
physical
privacy
but
less
salient
in
the
collective
mind
of
the
public
is
the
concept
of
anonymity
the
state
of
hiding
in
plain
sight
from
the
government
so
long
as
one
abides
by
the
rule
of
law
anonymity
is
the
freedom
from
being
identified
and
tracked
by
name
while
going
through
the
motions
of
daily
life
including
physical
movement
in
private
and
public
spaces
the
transaction
of
business
online
and
the
maintenance
of
personal
and
professional
relationships
habits
and
beliefs
however
unpopular
or
repugnant
n
anonymity
enables
one
to
re
main
undifferentiated
in
public
in
literal
terms
it
means
nameless
n
as
justice
sotomayor
suggested
in
united
states
v
jones
n
the
everyday
occurrences
for
which
anonymity
is
appreciated
take
little
imagination
to
conjure
trips
to
the
psychiatrist
the
plastic
surgeon
the
abortion
clinic
the
aids
treatment
center
the
strip
club
the
criminal
defense
attorney
the
by
the
hour
motel
the
union
meeting
the
mosque
synagogue
or
church
the
gay
bar
and
on
and
on
n
in
protecting
against
government
access
to
one
s
physical
whereabouts
anonymity
shelters
private
information
about
one
s
thoughts
relationships
and
plans
for
the
future
n
it
fosters
the
capacity
to
control
or
limit
access
to
one
s
intimate
relationships
or
aspects
of
life
n
and
accordingly
to
exclude
others
from
the
very
consciousness
of
the
mind
n
in
the
late
eighteenth
century
philosopher
jeremy
bentham
famously
unveiled
his
panopticon
design
for
institutional
buildings
which
contained
a
central
tower
surrounded
by
a
perimeter
of
backlit
cells
from
which
inmates
could
not
see
their
surveyors
n
bentham
described
the
design
as
a
new
mode
of
obtaining
power
of
mind
over
mind
as
a
single
guard
could
theoretically
control
all
of
the
prisoners
simultaneously
n
as
french
philosopher
michel
foucault
later
explained
the
prisoners
would
internalize
the
presumption
that
they
are
being
watched
and
modify
their
behavior
to
comply
with
expectations
n
rendering
the
guards
virtually
superfluous
legal
theorists
who
have
studied
the
panopticon
effect
posit
that
anonymity
in
public
promotes
freedom
of
action
and
an
open
society
while
a
lack
of
public
anonymity
promotes
conformity
and
an
oppressive
society
n
in
which
majoritarian
authority
will
coerce
citizens
into
silence
or
acquiescence
n
although
bentham
never
built
his
panopticon
the
association
of
privacy
with
anonymity
from
the
government
later
appeared
in
the
writings
of
samuel
warren
and
louis
brandeis
who
in
recognized
the
right
to
be
let
alone
n
as
an
important
definitional
component
of
privacy
and
one
that
has
since
become
the
foundation
of
privacy
law
in
the
united
states
n
in
the
twentieth
century
professor
william
prosser
similarly
identified
intrusions
upon
a
person
s
seclusion
or
solitude
as
a
distinct
kind
of
privacy
invasion
against
which
the
law
should
provide
protection
n
social
science
research
suggests
that
contemporary
americans
view
the
ability
to
move
about
in
public
or
online
without
being
tracked
as
an
important
aspect
of
privacy
n
surveys
indicate
that
internet
users
perceive
an
invasion
of
privacy
when
their
web
surfing
information
is
collected
and
shared
with
other
parties
n
people
especially
want
to
maintain
a
meaningful
degree
of
independence
from
the
government
when
it
comes
to
personal
thoughts
and
communications
with
others
even
before
online
technology
took
hold
survey
respondents
ranked
the
monitoring
of
phone
calls
for
thirty
days
and
the
reading
of
a
personal
diary
as
more
intrusive
than
the
government
s
withdrawal
of
blood
n
an
area
of
particular
public
concern
is
video
surveillance
which
may
arouse
fears
of
rigid
and
arbitrary
law
en
forcement
by
an
omniscient
state
n
national
surveys
and
focus
groups
indicate
that
the
threat
of
misuse
of
biometric
identifiers
is
a
point
of
concern
and
an
obstacle
to
social
acceptance
of
such
technologies
n
this
attitude
is
reflected
in
survey
participants
relative
distaste
for
the
use
of
biometric
identification
systems
in
public
events
like
a
professional
football
game
which
was
viewed
as
a
transgression
of
anonymity
and
decisional
autonomy
without
sufficient
policy
justification
or
assurance
that
the
identification
could
be
carried
out
with
accuracy
and
reliability
n
people
appear
to
be
more
willing
to
tolerate
privacy
intrusions
where
the
government
s
use
of
their
personal
information
would
foster
their
own
well
being
n
the
cost
benefit
calculus
imperceptibly
performed
around
the
acceptability
of
new
technology
moreover
can
be
affected
by
the
perceived
urgency
of
its
public
safety
benefits
in
the
months
after
percent
of
people
surveyed
expressed
greater
trust
in
government
than
survey
respondents
did
a
year
earlier
n
respondents
were
also
more
comfortable
with
decreased
anonymity
when
biometric
technology
was
used
for
boarding
a
plane
accessing
government
buildings
checking
against
a
terrorist
watch
list
or
requiring
background
checks
on
foreigners
n
in
a
cbs
new
york
times
poll
taken
after
the
boston
marathon
attacks
percent
of
respondents
endorsed
the
idea
of
having
more
public
surveillance
cameras
such
as
those
that
helped
identify
the
bombing
suspects
only
percent
said
that
the
government
has
gone
too
far
in
restricting
civil
liberties
in
the
battle
against
terrorism
n
anonymity
is
nonetheless
something
that
americans
generally
take
for
granted
people
expect
to
be
able
to
recede
into
a
crowd
or
go
unnoticed
while
walking
down
the
street
so
long
as
they
have
nothing
illegal
to
hide
at
this
juncture
there
is
insufficient
public
awareness
about
frt
as
well
as
zero
auditing
mechanisms
in
place
for
any
entity
using
the
technologies
n
as
a
consequence
the
public
is
unable
to
meaningfully
perform
a
cost
benefit
calculus
regarding
the
government
s
use

age

what
many
americans
fail
to
appreciate
is
that
technology
has
put
society
on
a
trajectory
whereby
even

the
interiors

kept
private

even

the
law
continues
to
protect
against
disclosures

will
soon
become
a
relic
of

n
b
anonymity
historically
personal
privacy
was
hard
to
come
by
in
colonial
america
n
colonial
travelers
shared
beds
with
strangers
due
to
the
practical
necessity
of
the
warmth
and
protection
of
a
small
group
n
the
lack
of
ceilings
in
early
homes
enabled
gawking
from
the
roof
beams
n
individuals
were
perceived
primarily
as
part
of
a
family
or
community
which
collectively
monitored
members
habits
and
exerted
pressure
to
conform
n
newcomers
to
new
england
towns
needed
permission
to
settle
there
n
and
residents
were
required
to
register
the
names
of
overnight
guests
n
colonial
laws
forbade
residents
from
living
alone
or
far
from
the
meeting
house
or
center
of
town
as
was
the
practice
in
england
n
court
records
show
that
massachusetts
homes
were
systematically
searched
in
for
single
persons
to
be
relocated
with
families
n
opposition
to
solitary
living
was
motivated
not
by
lack
of
concern
for
privacy
but
by
traditions
practicality
and
an
underlying
fear
of
sin
n
from
the
perspective
of
the
church
living
together
as
a
family
unit
was
the
best
arrangement
for
individuals
and
the
community
as
a
whole
n
by
the
eighteenth
century
however
new
england
society
was
prepared
to
accept
the
person
who
wanted
to
live
alone
because
he
enjoyed
the
privacy
this
way
of
living
provided
n
while
living
conditions
afforded
colonists
little
privacy
the
pre
technological
world
enabled
greater
privacy
relative
to
the
present
day
in
other
respects
inevitably
reputational
information
was
circulated
as
people
moved
about
n
but
people
could
avoid
eavesdropping
by
conducting
conversations
beyond
the
earshot
of
others
n
business
was
transacted
with
scant
written
exchanges
n
and
personal
records
consisted
largely
of
diaries
or
letters
n
only
one
person
possessed
a
paper
at
any
given
time
and
copies
had
to
be
painstakingly
recreated
n
individuals
could
control
personal
documents
by
securing
them
in
a
desk
or
cabinet
in
their
own
home
moreover
despite
the
casualness
of
delivery
there
seems
to
have
been
little
premeditated
and
malicious
perusal
of
other
people
s
mail
in
the
seventeenth
century
n
the
post
office
act
of
mandated
that
no
person

shall
presume
wittingly
willingly
or
knowingly
to
open
detain
or
delay
any
letter
or
letters
packet
or

n
colonists
who
were
concerned
about
prying
british
authorities
developed
codes
for
encrypting
their
letters
n
and
used
sealing
wax
and
wrapping
paper
on
packages
n
it
was
not
until
that
postmasters
attempted
to
monitor
content
in
response
to
efforts
by
southerners
to
make
illegal
the
transmission
of
abolitionist
literature
through
the
mail
n
in
ex
parte
jackson
n
the
supreme
court
upheld
a
statute
banning
the
transmission
of
lotteries
via
the
mail
but
noted
that
letters
and
sealed
packages
of
this
kind
in
the
mail
are
as
fully
guarded
from
examination
and
inspection
as
if
they
were
retained
by
the
parties
forwarding
them
in
their
own
domiciles
n
thus
when
given
the
opportunity
the
late
nineteenth
century
court
upheld
citizens
privacy
in
their
personal
mail
although
colonists
lived
in
the
public
eye
of
their
communities
the
framers
forbid
their
newly
formed
american
government
from
searching
a
person
s
private
papers
without
first
obtaining
a
warrant
n
a
requirement
that
dates
back
to
the
english
common
law

whereas
specific
warrant
provisions
were
included
in
even
the
earliest
state
constitutions
n
the
fourth
amendment
came
into
effect
as
part
of
the
bill
of
rights
in
n
the
supreme
court
has
deemed
the
familiar
history
of
the
fourth
amendment
as
reflecting
a
choice
that
our
society
should
be
one
in
which
citizens
dwell
in
reasonable
security
and
freedom
from
surveillance
n
its
commands
grew
in
large
measure
out
of
the
colonists
memories
of
the
general
warrants
formerly
in
use
in
england
these
writs
granted
sweeping
power
to
agents
of
the
king
to
search
at
large
for
smuggled
goods
n
indeed
aside
from
searches
incident
to
arrest
such
warrantless
searches
were
not
a
large
issue
in
colonial
america
n
while
the
warrant
requirement
was
adopted
to
stave
off
the
intrusiveness
of
the
crown
anonymous
speech
flourished
in
social
and
political
life
around
the
time
that
freedom
of

of

became
constitutionally
protected
under
the
first
amendment
n
for
the
founding
fathers
anonymity
in
the
authorship
of
newspapers

was
central
to
attracting
public
support
for
the
revolution
and
formation
of
an
independent
government
without
evoking
british
punishment

although
speech
was
strictly
limited

years

constitutionality

the
subject

trial

a
printer
refused
to
reveal
the
authors
of
anonymous
attacks
on

york
an
act
which
according
to
justice
thomas
in
his
concurring
opinion
in
mcintyre
v
ohio
elections
commission
n
signified
at
an
early
moment
the
extent
to
which
anonymity
and
the
freedom
of
the
press
were
intertwined
in
the
early
american
mind
n
in
alexander
hamilton
james
madison
and
john
jay
published
the
most
famous
example
of
the
outpouring
of
anonymous
political
writing
that
occurred
during
the
ratifica
tion
of
the
constitution
n
the
federalist
papers
they
used
the
pseudonym
publius
to
disseminate
the
treasured
constitutional
writings
and
signed
others
as
an
american
citizen
marcus
and
americanus
n
anonymous
speech
and
opposition
to
it
continued
to
play
a
central
role
in
political
discourse
after
ratification
the
continental
congress
famously
attempted
to
identify
an
article
by
benjamin
rush
who
published
his
attack
on
members
of
congress
for
inflation
embezzlement
and
fraud
under
the
name
leonidas
n
when
a
massachusetts
delegate
moved
to
require
the
article
s
printer
to
appear
before
congress
and
discuss
leonidas
several
members
successfully
opposed
the
motion
on
the
grounds
that
it
violated
freedom
of
the
press
n
federalists
and
anti
federalists
continuously
sparred
in
essays
written
under
fictitious
names

cato
brutus

over

washington

decision
to
remain
neutral
in
the
war
between
the
british
and
the
french
n
scholars
have
surmised
from
these
and
other
examples
that
the
historical
use
of
anonymous
speech
strongly
suggests
that
the
framers
originally
viewed
anonymity
as
a
vital
part
of
free
speech

freedom
of
the
press
n
in
the
nineteenth

technologies
for

data
points
which
poses
unprecedented
threats
to
the
ability
to
remain
anonymous
in
modern
society
rendering
traditional
fourth
amendment
doctrine
outmoded
for
the
digital
age
as
explained
below
a
contingent
of
the
supreme
court
is
beginning
to
recognize
that
constitutional
doctrine
must
be
adapted
to
establish
boundaries
on
the
use
of
technology
for
constant
surveillance
of
the
general
public
pre
digital
age
the
categorization
of
government
activity
as
a
search
under
the
fourth
amendment
is
important
under
traditional
doctrine
if
something
is
not
a
search
the
analysis
ends
and
the
government
is
not
required
to
show
probable
cause
n
a
traditional
search
is
like
the
tort
of
trespass
which
existed
at
the
time
the
fourth
amendment
was
adopted
it
involves
a
physical
intrusion
on
private
property
the
supreme
court
deviated
from
this
property
based
approach
to
determining
whether
something
is
a
search
early
on
however
and
developed
a
reasonable
expectation
of
privacy
trigger
n
in
the
absence
of
a
trespass
a
fourth
amendment
search
occurs
when
the
government
violates
a
subjective
expectation
of
privacy
that
society
recognizes
as
reasonable
n
the
legitimate
expectation
of
privacy
in
a
searched
person
or
location
must
meet
both
a
subjective
and
an
objective
test
of
reasonableness
first
has
the
individual
manifested
a
subjective
expectation
of
privacy
in
the
object
of
the
challenged
search
second
is
society
willing
to
recognize
that
expectation
as
reasonable
n
for
subpoenas
the
court
has
invoked
the
fourth
amendment
only
minimally
applying
a
reasonableness
test
that
is
satisfied
if
a
subpoena
is
not
too
sweeping
in
its
terms
n
it
has
also
authorized
warrantless
searches
in
three
circumstances
if
there
is
reasonable
suspicion
of
a
past
or
imminent
crime
to
justify
a
stop
and
frisk
n
if
special
needs
other
than
the
normal
need
for
law
enforcement
provide
sufficient
justification
for
a
search
n
as
in
cases
of
mandatory
drug
testing
for
employment
or
in
schools
n
and
if
a
regulatory
scheme
authorizes
warrantless
inspections
of
property
for
compliance
with
health
and
safety
standards
n
for
example
additionally
the
court
has
established
a
status
based
continuum
of
diminished
privacy
rights
under
the
fourth
amendment
which
includes
parolees
having
fewer
expectations
of
privacy
than
probationers
n
the
question
of
what
privacy
means
under
the
fourth
amendment
has
nonetheless
been
in
flux
from
the
phrase
s
inception
n
in
olmstead
v
united
states
n
louis
brandeis
famously
dissented
from
the
majority
s
holding
that
wiretapping
was
not
a
fourth
amendment
violation
absent
physical
trespass
to
the
home
employing
his
familiar
theory
that
the
makers
of
our
constitution
conferred
as
against
the
government
the
right
to
be
let
alone
the
most
comprehensive
of
rights
and
the
right
most
valued
by
civilized
men
n
employing
a
property
based
approach
to
the
fourth
amendment
boyd
v
united
states
n
marked
a
high
point
of
the
supreme
court
s
recognition
of
broad
protections
against
government
invasion
of
privacy
under
the
fourth
amendment
in
refusing
to
uphold
a
court
order
directing
a
defendant
in
a
civil
forfeiture
proceeding
to
produce
documentary
evidence
of
liability
the
court
framed
the
essence
of
the
government
s
offense
as
the
invasion
of
the
indefeasible
right
of
personal
security
personal
liberty
and
private
property
as
the
framers
were
keenly
attuned
to
the
struggles
against
arbitrary
power
in
which
they
had
been
engaged
for
more
than
years
when
they
approved
the
fourth
and
fifth
amendments
n
in
katz
v
united
states
n
however
a
majority
of
the
court
rejected
the
property
based
reasoning
of
boyd
and
held
that
the
relevant
fourth
amendment
inquiry
is
whether
the
practice
at
issue
violated
the
privacy
upon
which
the
defendant
justifiably
relied
n
it
wrote
that
the
constitu
tion
protects
people
not
places
n
thus
the
government
violated
the
fourth
amendment
in
electronically
listening
to
and
recording
the
defendant
s
conversation
in
a
public
telephone
booth
once
a
fixture
on
american
street
corners
and
in
superman
comics
the
court
found
it
insignificant
that
the
electronic
device
did
not
penetrate
the
structure
s
walls
n
in
doing
so
the
court
rejected
the
property
based
approach
to
electronic
surveillance
instead
embracing
brandeis
s
articulation
of
the
right
to
be
let
alone
n
it
has
restated
this
refrain
many
times
since
n
despite
the
doctrinal
shift
in
katz
existing
fourth
amendment
doctrine
provides
no
clear
protection
from
government
surveillance
conducted
through
an
amalgamation
of
frt
algorithms
and
other
data
that
court
made
clear
that
what
a
person
knowingly
exposes
to
the
public
even
in
his
own
home
or
office
is
not
a
subject
of
fourth
amendment
protection
n
accordingly
the
court
has
held
that
because
the
exterior
of
a
car
is
thrust
into
the
public
eye
to
examine
it
does
not
constitute
a
search
n
nor
is
there
a
reasonable
expectation
of
privacy
in
the
phone
numbers
voluntarily
conveyed
to
the
telephone
company
and
exposed
in
the
ordinary
course
of
business
n
there
is
no
reasonable
expectation
of
privacy
in
abandoned
property
like
garbage
left
out
for
collection
n
or
in
the
movements
of
an
automobile
on
public
thoroughfares
n
as
a
consequence
the
collection
of
a
faceprint
does
not
constitute
a
search
under
the
court
s
longstanding
view
that
mere
visual
observation
does
not
constitute
a
search
n
non
consensual
facial
scanning
amounts
to
no
more
than
visual
observation
of
what
is
held
out
to
the
public
to
the
extent
that
frt
is
considered
part
and
parcel
of
the
traditional
visual
surveillance
that
police
conduct
in
unmarked
vehicles
which
has
long
been
considered
constitutional
n
the
fourth
amendment
does
not
apply
frt
also
targets
an
area
of
the
body
that
a
person
would
not
reasonably
expect
to
consider
private
the
court
has
held
that
the
taking
of
a
photograph
does
not
constitute
a
search
because
it
does
not
involve
a
physical
intrusion
onto
the
person
and
does
not
invade
any
recognized
expectation
of
privacy
n
insofar
as
frt
enables
law
enforcement
to
identify
a
subject
from
an
anonymous
photo
moreover
hiibel
v
sixth
judicial
district
court
n
suggests
that
such
identification
is
constitutional
n
there
the
court
rejected
a
fourth
amendment
challenge
to
a
law
requiring
people
to
identify
themselves
during
a
police
stop
on
the
theory
that
answering
a
request
to
disclose
a
name
is
likely
to
be
so
insignificant
in
the
scheme
of
things
as
to
be
incriminating
only
in
unusual
circumstances
n
in
dissent
justice
stevens
highlighted
the
ability
to
attach
a
name
to
a
broad
array
of
information
about
the
person
which
in
turn
can
be
tremendously
useful
in
a
criminal
prosecution
n
even
if
the
fourth
amendment
were
construed
to
broaden
the
meaning
of
search
to
encompass
frt
it
would
be
an
empty
victory
for
privacy
advocates

citizens

countless
images

day

from
the
thirteenth

on
slavery
n
the
constitution
and
thus
brandeis
s
constitutional
formulation
of
a
right
to
be

alone
applies
only
as
against
the

apparent
constitutional
remedy
if
governmental
use
of
such
data
effectively
results
in
indiscriminate
twenty
four
hour
passive
surveillance
relatedly
the
supreme
court
has
held
repeatedly
that
the
fourth
amendment
does
not
prohibit
the
obtaining
of
information
revealed
to
a
third
party
and
conveyed
by
him
to
government
authorities
n
there
is
no
fourth
amendment
ban
on
the
use
of
information
obtained
through
government
informants
for
example
n
even
though
they
frustrate
actual
expectations
of
privacy

the
court
has
also
upheld
the
warrantless
installation
of
pen
registers
to
record
numbers
dialed
from
a
subject
s
home
on
the
theory
that
telephone
subscribers
do
not
harbor
any
general
expectation
that
the
numbers
they
dial
will
remain
secret
n
it
has
condoned
government
scrutiny
of
documents
provided
to
accountants
n
banks
n
and
physicians
n
because
such
documents
contain
only
information
voluntarily
conveyed
and
the
individual
takes
the
risk
that
the
information
will
be
conveyed
by
that
person
to
the
government
n
with
the
advent
of
the
internet
lower
courts
have
applied
the
third
party
doctrine
to
justify
government
subpoenas
of
shared
computer
files
information
sent
or
received
through
the
internet
and
stored
on
a
third
party
server
n
and
individual
subscriber
information
obtained
from
internet
service
providers
without
a
warrant
n
by
treating
public
exposure
and
third
party
access
to
personal
information
as
waivers
of
fourth
amendment
protections
modern
doctrine
offers
a
difficult
path
to
erecting
protections
against
government
surveillance
conducted
by
piecing
together
various
public
and
private
sector
data
with
images
posted
online
or
captured
in
plain
sight
digital
age
the
court
has
grappled
for
decades
with
the
related
question
of
whether
and
the
extent
to
which
government
can
use
technology
to
enhance
its
ability
to
see
what
is
arguably
exposed
to
the
public
it
held
in
that
there
is
no
legitimate
expectation
of
privacy
in
the
interior
of
a
car
illuminated
by
a
flashlight
because
the
use
of
artificial
means
to
illuminate
a
darkened
area
simply
does
not
constitute
a
search
n
three
years
later
it
found
that
warrantless
naked
eye
aerial
observation
of
a
fenced
in
backyard
was
not
unreasonable
under
the
fourth
amendment
as
any
member
of
the
public
flying
in
this
airspace
who
glanced
down
could
have
seen
everything
that
these
officers
observed
n
in
however
the
court
recognized
emerging
technologies
privacy
implications
when
it
decided
that
the
use
of
thermal
imaging
technology
to
measure
heat
emanating
from
a
home
was
a
search
because
it
amounted
to
more
than
naked
eye
surveillance
with
a
device
that
is
not
in
general
public
use
n
as
justice
alito
recently
described
it
kyllo
v
united
states

was
a
decision
about
the
use
of
new
technology
n
writing
for
the
majority
in
florida
v
jardines
n
justice
scalia
similarly
distinguished
kyllo
as
a
case
involving
surveillance
technology
that
allows
law
enforcement
to
learn
details
that
would
previously
have
been
unknowable
without
physical
intrusion
n
he
reached
the
conclusion
that
a
drug
sniffing
police
dog
deployed
from
the
front
porch
of
a
home
constituted
a
fourth
amendment
search
despite
the
antiquity
of
forensic
dogs
as
an
investigative
tool
because
there
was
no
implicit
license
or
invitation
for
the
police
to
approach
the
home
for
the
purpose
of
obtaining
incriminating
evidence
inside
n
earlier
in
city
of
ontario
v
quon
n
the
court
similarly
highlighted
the
novelty
of
new
technology
as
relevant
to
whether
the
user
of
a
government
issued
pager
had
a
reasonable
expectation
of
privacy
in
messages
retained
by
the
service
provider
sidestepping
the
fourth
amendment
question
on
the
merits
justice
kennedy
cautioned
that
it
must
proceed
with
care
when
considering
the
whole
concept
of
privacy
expectations
in
communications
made
on
electronic
equipment
else
it
risks
error
by
elaborating
too
fully
on
the
fourth
amendment
implications
of
emerging
technology
before
its
role
in
society
has
become
clear
n
he
explained
that
modern
judges
are
not
on
so
sure
a
ground
as
the
katz
court
was
in
relying
on
its
own
knowledge
and
experience
to
conclude
that
there
is
a
reasonable
expectation
of
privacy
in
a
telephone
booth
n
rapid
changes
in
the
dynamics
of
communication
and
information
transmission
are
evident
not
just
in
the
technology
itself
but
in
what
society
accepts
as
proper
behavior
he
continued
and
cell
phone
and
text
message
communications
are
so
pervasive
that
some
persons
may
consider
them
to
be
essential
means
for
self
expression
even
self
identification
thus
potentially
strengthening
the
case
for
an
expectation
of
privacy
n
two
additional
cases
highlight
the
modern
court
s
struggle
with
fitting
modern
technologies
within
the
existing
fourth
amendment
rubric
in
united
states
v
jones
n
the
court
held
that
the
warrantless
installation
of
a
global
positioning
system
gps
device
to
monitor
the
location
of
a
person
s
car
constituted
a
search
because
the
police
physically
occupied
private
property
for
the
purpose
of
obtaining
information
n
justice
scalia
thus
revived
for
the
majority
the
old
property
based
approach
to
the
fourth
amendment
n
instead
of
taking
an
arguably
more
obvious
tactic
applying

it
to
situations

the
transmission

electronic
signals

trespass

while
conceding
that
electronic
surveillance

an
accompanying
trespass

amount
an
unconstitutional

sotomayor

kagan
expressed
concern
that
modern

eroding
individuals
ability
to
be
free
of

monitoring
she
wrote
that
electronic
or
other
novel
modes

generate
a
precise
comprehensive
record

that
reflects

of
detail
about

sexual
associations
without
any
physical
invasion
of
property
n
the
government
she
added
can
store
and
mine
such
data
indefinitely
n
because
modern
electronic
surveillance
is
cheap
by
comparison
to
traditional
surveillance
techniques
it
proceeds
surreptitiously
and
evades
the
ordinary
checks

community
hostility
n
she
referred
to
the
fourth
amendment
s
goal
to
prevent
a
too
permeating
police
surveillance

questioned
the
propriety
of
the
third
party
doctrine
as
ill
suited
to
the
digital
age
in
which
people
reveal
a
great
deal
of
information
about
themselves
to
third
parties
in
the
course
of
carrying
out
mundane
tasks
such
as
phone
numbers

email
addresses

the
books
groceries
and
medications
they
purchase
online

although
some
people
might
accept
this
diminution
of
privacy
as
a
tradeoff
for
access
to
technology

simply
inevitable
she
expressed
doubt
that
people
would
accept
without
complaint
the
warrantless
disclo
sure
to
the
government
of
a
list
of
every
web
site
they
had
visited
in
the
last
week
or
month
or
year
n
for
his
part
justice
alito
focused
on
the
problem
of
long
term
monitoring
agreeing
in
principle
with
the
majority
that
we
must
assure
preservation
of
that
degree
of
privacy
against
government
that
existed
when
the
fourth
amendment
was
adopted
n
of
course
he
added
it
is
almost
impossible
to
think
of
late
th
century
situations
analogous
to
the
capabilities
of
modern
surveillance
technology
n
the
majority
s
physical
trespass
theory
he
explained
would
provide
no
protection
to
long
term
monitoring
accomplished
without
committing
a
technical
trespass
n
yet
for
such
offenses
society
s
expectation
has
been
that
law
enforcement
agents
and
others
would
not
and
indeed
in
the
main
simply
could
not
secretly
monitor
and
catalogue
every
single
movement
of
an
individual
s
car
for
a
very
long
period
n
justice
alito
thus
recognized
that
because
new
devices
such
as
closed
circuit
television
video
monitoring
automatic
toll
collection
systems
with
recording
technology
built
in
gps
systems
and
wireless
tracking
devices
embedded
in

permit
the
monitoring
of
a
person

movements
in
ways
that
were
impossible
before
the
digital

traditional
fourth

analysis
is
inapposite
n
maryland
v
king
n
is
the
most
recent
case
in
which
the
supreme

addressed
the
vexing
intersection
of
technology
and
privacy
under
the
fourth
amendment
at
a
booking

dna
matched
that
of

victim
taken
six
years

connects

that

unreasonable

that

make

choices

ensuring
that
the

remains
available
for

helping
protect

that
taken
together
outweighed
the
arrestee

would
appear
to
narrow
the
availability
of

protections
against

new

three
aspects
of
justice
kennedy
s
decision
distinguish
dna
sampling
from
the
dragnet
style
surveillance
of
the
general
public
which
frt
makes
possible
first
he
emphasized
that
an
arrestee
s
diminished
expectations
of
privacy
are
distinguishable
from
those
of
the
public
at
large
or
a
particular
class
of
law
abiding
citizens
n
second
justice
kennedy
stressed
that
technology
could
progress
to
the
point
at
which
the
fourth
amendment
balance
would
be
struck
in
the
arrestee
s
favor
such
as
if
dna
showed
a
predisposition
for
a
particular
disease
or
other
hereditary
factors
not
relevant
to
identity
n
it
is
thus
possible
that
the
court
would
condemn
the
warrantless
use
of

for
particularly
invasive
purposes
third
a
maryland
statute

generally
allayed

in
the
absence

grant

confirm
whether
someone
is
whom
he
appears
to
be
with

which
properly
understood
is
more
like
searching
for
evidence
that
a
person
has
committed
crimes
unrelated
to
the
crime
of
his
arrest
n
it
taxes
the
credulity
of
the
credulous
justice
scalia
quipped
to
assert
that
the
dna
in

was
not
in
fact
used
to
solve
crimes
n
an
aim
that
has
never
been
thought
to
justify
a
suspicionless
search
n
justice
scalia
likened
the
practice
to
so
called
general
warrants
at
the
time
of
the
founding
those
not
grounded
upon
a
sworn
oath
of
a
specific
infraction
by
a
particular
individual
and
thus
not
limited
in
scope
and
application
n
justice
scalia
also
noted
that
the
suspect
s
identity
was
already
known
when
the
state
ran
his
dna
through
the
codis
system
long
after
he
was
arrested
the
matching
was
thus
performed
in
order
to
identify
the
dna
sample
from
the
rape
not
to
verify
identity
n
what
dna
offers
that
fingerprinting
does
not
he
added
is
the
ability
to
solve
unsolved
crimes
by
matching
old
crime
scene
evidence
against
the
profiles
of
people
whose
identities
are
already
known
n
justice
scalia
warned
that
if
one
believes
that
dna
will
identify
someone
arrested
for
assault
he
must
believe
that
it
will
identify
someone
arrested
for
a
traffic
offense
n
his
dissent
in
king
is
thus
an
acknowledgement
that
some
constitutional
limits
must
be
placed
on
the
uses
of
surveillance
technologies
that
enable
government
to
create
new
information
by
identifying
correlations
among
otherwise
disparate
data
points
perhaps
the
construction
of
a
genetic
panopticon
is
wise
he
wrote
but
i
doubt
that
the
proud
men
who
wrote

of

would
have
been
so
eager
to
open
their

observed
that

played
an
important
role
in

struck
down
an

a
prior
restraint
on

also
because
the
law
vitiated
the
possibility

characterized
the

resulting
in

surrender
of

even
where
circulators
revealed
their

unmoved

make
themselves
physically
known

revealing
themselves

that

expression

the
state

interest
in
preserving
the

informing
the

made
a
point
of
deeming
significant
the

argument
that

feared

based
on

considered
breathtaking
the

an
interest
in

about

that

that

this
part
seeks
to
reclaim
the

in

points
at

in
ways
that

impossible

a
few
years
ago
n
it
is
through
such
correlations
that
frt
enables
users
to

and
from
that
data
erect
a
comprehensive
portrait
of
that
person
s
past
present
and
future
life
at
least
three
guidelines
can
be
inferred
from
the
court
s
first

fourth

courts
legislators
and
regulators
should
take
into

be
treated
as
a
significant
factor
in
assessing
the
proper
constitutional
statutory
and
regulatory
scope
of
government
activity
that
has
the
potential
to
expose
an
individual
s

to
scrutiny

accordingly
the
law
should
place
boundaries
around
the
ability
of

to
match
faceprints
with
other
data
points
for
purposes
other
than
verification
of
an
individual

third
courts
and
lawmakers
should
keep
in
mind
that
legislative
protection
of
an
individual
s
ability
to
invoke
anonymity
through
conspicuous
and
mandatory
opt
out
provisions
for
web
tracking
for
example
is
constitutionally
prudent
if
not
necessary
a
recognition
through
correlation
as
the
first
amendment
cases
indicate
anonymity
implies
a
freedom
from
being
recognized
versus
just
being
seen
in

of

still
expect
to
mostly
avoid

the

about

as
protecting

in

arenas
the
court
has
treated
the
right
to
pursue

privately
as
constitutionally
protected
from

it
has
never
suggested
that
the
public
disclosure
of
one
s
face
is
itself
an
act
of
constitutional
dimension
in
addressing
anonymity
the
court
has
instead
drawn
a
distinction
between
mere
observance
of
physical
identities
and
recogni
tion
n
a
stranger
knocking
on
a
door
might
remain
anonymous
even

his

a
surrender
of
anonymity
takes
place
when
the
face
is
linked
to
other
identifying
information
such
as
a
name
on
a
pamphlet
n
chief
justice
roberts
extended
this
principle
to
modern
technology
when
he
emphasized
in
doe
v
reed
that
once
on
the
internet
names
and
addresses
contained
in
referendum
petitions
could
be
matched
with
other
data
in
what
will
effectively
become
a
blueprint
for
harassment
and
intimidation
n
similarly
justice
alito
deemed
breathtaking
the
implications
of
the
government
s
ability
to
match
referendum
petition
information
with
other
online
data

and

thomas
associated

dissemination
of

v
roe
n
justice
brennan
was
presciently
troubled
by
the
central
computer
storage
of
the
data
collected
back
in
because
it
allowed
government
to
manipulate
information
in
ways
that
could
harm
privacy
interests
even
though
the
fourth
amendment
did
not
shield
the
information
itself
from
government
scrutiny
in
that
case
n
in
his
view
the
central
storage
and
easy
accessibility
of
computerized
data
vastly
increase
the
potential
for
abuse
of
that
information
n
future
developments
he
suggested
might
one
day
demonstrate
the
necessity
of
some
curb
on

n
in

v
knotts
the

similarly
acknowledged
that
if
dragnet
type
law
enforcement
practices
such
as
twenty
four
hour
surveillance
without
judicial
knowledge
or
supervision
should
eventually
occur
there
will
be
time
enough
then
to
determine
whether
different
constitutional
principles
may
be
applicable
n
that
time
has
come
technology
has
progressed
to
the
point
at
which
frt
and
big
data
can
be
used
to
make
predictions
about
people
s
behavior
this
occurs
through
the
analysis
of
the
statistical
relationship
between
two
data
values

similarly
although
a

algorithm
in

of
itself
is
just
a
numerical
record
of
something
that
has
already
been
made
public
the
correlation

is
altogether
different
the

may
not

with

it
can
easily
be
traced
back
to
the
individual

be
deduced
n
the
supreme
court
s
view
that
there
is
no
reasonable
expectation
of

thus
been
criticized
for
narrowly
defining

as
mere
secrecy
n
correlating
an
image

is
more
intrusive
than

do
not
expect

patterns
n
even
if
the
gathering
of

is
unobjectionable
its

produces

that
the
action
of
correlating

therefore
should
trigger
the

constitutional
scrutiny
that
applies
to
other
means
of
surveillance
such
as
the
gps
device
in
jones
n
whether
the

retrieves
the

not
determine

is
constitutionally
confined
nor
should
the
public
or

party
nature
of

collected
undermine
the

role
in
protecting
against
the
use
of

for
omnipresent
government
monitoring
instead
as
the
court
implied
in

n
new

should
be
afforded
distinct
modes
of
fourth

analysis
the
action
of
correlating
numerical
faceprints
with
other

amounts
to
more
than
naked
eye
surveillance
of
a
home
with
a
device
that
is
not
in
general
public
use
under
kyllo
s
formulation
n
as
justice
sotomayor
explained
in
jones
modern
methods
of
government
monitoring
rely
on
data
mining
and
storage
proceed
surreptitiously
and
cheaply
and
evade
the
ordinary
checks
that
constrain
abusive
law
enforcement
practices
n
technology
has
enabled
the
government
to
generate
a
precise
comprehensive
record
of
a
person
s
public
movements
that
reflects
a
wealth
of
detail
about
her
familial
political
professional
religious
and
sexual
associations
n
this
novel
use
of
bits
of
data
defies
what
justice
alito
called
society
s
expectation
that
law
enforcement
agents
and
others
would
not
and
indeed
in
the
main
simply
could
not
secretly
monitor

catalogue
one
s
every
single
movement
over
a
long
period
of

b
limited

the
court
s
first
amendment
approach
to
anonymity
and
its
fourth

treatment
of
technology
in
the
digital
age
further
suggest
that
doctrinally
the

might
be
constitutional

one
use

not
for
another
frt
analysis

users
to
make
predictions
about

s
behavior
which
can
be
tremendously
useful
in
preventing

also
hugely
problematic
in
terms
of
personal
privacy
and
autonomy
even
if
the
collection
of
personal
data
through
public
interfaces
is
lawful
the
constitution
could
confine
the
extent
to
which
law
enforcement
can
employ
new
technologies
for
predictive
surveillance
in
their
opinions
in
doe
justices
alito
and
thomas
suggested
that
there
is
a
meaningful
distinction
under
the
first
amendment
between
using
personal
information
contained
on
referendum
petitions
for
verification
and
using
the
information
for
other
purposes
n
unlike
verification

links
a
face
with
a
wealth
of
personal
information
about
an
individual
from
the
internet
and
other
public
and
private
sources
such
as
birth
date
and
place
medical
data
affiliated
friends
and
organizations
and
criminal
history
this
data
can
be
put
toward
law
enforcement
aims
that
go
well
beyond
verification
that
a
person
is
in
fact
whom
he
claims
to
be
justice
scalia
emphasized
as
much
in
his
maryland
v
king
dissent
when
he
assailed
the
majority
for
characterizing
the
government
s
use
of
the
suspect
s
dna
as
unrelated
to
crime
solving
n
he
explained
in
great
detail
how
the
police
employed
the
dna
sample
to
solve
unsolved
crimes
by
matching
old
crime
scene
evidence
against
the
profiles
of
people
whose
identities
were
already
known
n
in
jardines
as
well
justice
scalia
suggested
that
the
intended
use
of
a
technology
such
as
a
drug
sniffing
dog
is
an
important
element
of
the
fourth
amendment
analysis
n
he
distinguished
between
licensed
and
unlicensed
entries
into
a
curtilage
e
g
knocking
on
a
door
versus
arriving
with
a
bloodhound
or
a
metal
detector
and
suggested
that
an
invitation
to
engage
in
canine
forensic
investigation
assuredly
does
not
inhere
in
the
very
act
of
hanging
a
knocker
n
as
to
the
reasonableness
of
a
search
justice
scalia
similarly
observed
that
it
depends
upon
whether
the
officers
had
an
implied
license
to
enter
the
porch
which
in
turn
depends
upon
the
purpose
for
which
they
entered
n
if
unlike
the
dna
in
king
faceprints
were
used
for
surveillance
of
common
citizens
a
majority
of
the
court
might
find
that
the
fourth
amendment
applies
to
limit
the
use
of
such
data
for
secondary
purposes
that
include
identification
versus
mere
verification
of
identity
the
first
amendment
anonymity
cases
provide
insight
into
how
courts
might
determine
whether
a
secondary
use
of
faceprint
data
is
constitutional
in
mcintyre
v
ohio
elections
commission
for
example
the
court
credited
the
state
s
interest
in
preventing
fraud
and
libel
during
elections
when
false
statements
if
credited
may
have
serious
adverse
consequences
for
the
public
at
large
but
found
it
insufficient
under
the
exacting
scrutiny
applicable
to
core
political
speech
n
under
that
standard
the
simple
interest
in
providing
voters
with
additional
relevant
information
did
not
justify
the
anonymity
ban
which
did
little
to
help
voters
evaluate
the
pamphlet
s
message
n
by
the
same
token
the
fbi
shouldn
t
be
in
the
business
of
monitoring
demonstrations
unless
it
has
a
cause
a
tip

reason

in

to
develop
meaningful
constitutional
distinctions
between
the
various
possible
uses

the
public
sphere
the
court
s
identification
of
the
government

rationale
for
collecting

could
be
extrapolated
to
the
fourth
amendment
context
in
other
words
if
anonymity
warrants
constitutional
protection
under
the
first
amendment
some
requisite
showing
should
be
made
before
the

can
perform
a
matching
that
results
in
monitoring
of
an
individual
s
activity
as
a
matter
of
fourth

law
as
well
n
lower
courts
have
held
that
before
the

can
utilize
fingerprint
evidence
gathered
from
the
general
public
it
must
demonstrate
probable
cause
if
the
government
cannot
show
probable
cause
it
must
at

show
an
articulable
suspicion

believe
that

committed
a
criminal
offense

that
fingerprinting
will
establish
or
negate
the

should
be
treated
no
differently

whether

first
amendment
doctrine
suggests
that
the

should
have
to
justify
its
correlation

data
with
other
information

form
a
working
profile

c
the
importance
of

an
important
distinguishing
feature
of

first

anonymity
cases
is
the
involvement
of
legislative
attempts
to
coerce
the
disclosure
of
personal
identities
frt
presents
a
particularly
difficult
problem
under
prevailing
constitutional
law
because
most
faces
are
routinely
exposed
in
public
no
domestic
law
requires
that
a
person
s
facial
features
be
unobstructed
while
she
maneuvers
about
in
public
places
so
that
the
government
can
use
them
for
identification
purposes
her
visage
is
there
for
the
government
s
taking
technology
has
thus
become
deterministic
of
personal
privacy
today
yet
there
is
no
reciprocal
power
on
the
part
of
individuals
to
direct
how
technology
will
evolve
in
relationship
to
their
privacy
interests
or
even
to
opt
out
of
its
implications
for
their
daily
lives
the
first
amendment
anonymity
cases
and
fourth
amendment
doctrine
assume
that
a
person
possesses
the
discretion
to
take
steps
to
protect
communications
or
other
effects
from
governmental
intrusion
that
is
by
keeping
personal
information
private
in
the
first
amendment
context
the
court
has
upheld
private
individuals
ability
to
choose
to
keep
their
identities
anonymous
in
some
respect
indeed
the
fact
that
the
mcintyre
plaintiff
simultaneously
disclosed
her
identity
in
other
pamphlets
was
irrelevant
to
the
court
s
analysis
and
ultimate
conclusion
that
her
choice
to
remain
anonymous
was
protected
by
the
first
amendment
n
in
the
fourth
amendment
arena
disclosure
operates
as
a
waiver
of
sorts
but
the
court
has
taken
pains
to
identify
how
the
subject
of
police
inquiry
could
have
effectively
invoked
constitutional
protections
by
keeping
information
private
in
both
contexts
the
underlying
assumption
supporting
the
court
s
analyses
of
the
constitutional
guarantee
at
issue
is
that
citizens
have
a
choice
and
caveat
emptor
if
they
choose
public
disclosure
the
constitution
cannot
save
them
from
the
consequences
of
that
choice
facebook

it

currently
there
are
no

how
long
that

will
be
stored
whether
and
how
it
will
be
shared
or
how
it
will
be
used
n
other
countries
have
regulations
that
give
internet
users
control
over
their
own

n
in
the
united
states
however
private

are
free
to
sell

biometric

private
companies
can
also
disclose

authorities
without
their
consent
n
fourth
and
first
amendment
law
is
remarkably
consistent
in
its
deference
to
the
subject
s
choice
to
remain
anonymous
or
put
information
into
the
public
domain
if
people
protect
their
privacy
the
constitution
protects
it
too
in
modern
times
the
problem
with
this
tautology
is
that
the
concept
of
choice
implies
that
there
is
more
than
one
meaningful
option
with
frt
and
other
emerging
technologies
there
is
no
mechanism
for
opting
out
of
the
various
sources
that
are
amalgamated
into
what
amounts
to
surveillance
the
theory
behind
the
fourth
amendment
doctrines
that
lift
its
protections
for
information
disclosed
publicly
or
to
third
parties
is
thus
unsustainable
accordingly
the
recognition
of
anonymity
as
a
constitutional
value
that
warrants
protection
under
the
first
and
fourth
amendments
may
require
numerous
safeguards
in
place
for
forestalling
indiscriminate
disclosure
as
justice
brennan
suggested
in
whalen
n
in
his
words
whether
sophisticated
storage
and
matching
technology
amounts
to
a
deprivation
of
constitutionally
protected
privacy
interests
might
depend
in
part
on
congressional
or
regulatory
protections
put
in
place
to
forbid
the
government
s
use
of
big
data
for
arbitrary
monitoring
of
the
populace
without
individuals
consent
n
this
will
not
be
easy
choosing
to
opt
out
of
google
s
tracking
technologies
itself
leaves
a
trace
and
technology
exists
to
re
identify
people
whose
personal
identifiers
such
as
name
address
credit
card
information
birth
date
and
social
security
number
had
been
removed
from
a
dataset
n
but
constitutional
limits
on
the
government
s
ability
to
work
around
individuals
attempts
to
protect
their
privacy
would
be
an
important
step
toward
rescuing
the
constitutional
value
of
anonymity
before
frt
and
big
data
are
used
to
do
more
than
simply
predict
who
may
commit
crimes
i
e
to
punish
people
for
future
acts
n
conclusion
the
writing
is
on
the
wall
one
day
soon

moving

comes
to

ability

n
the
third
party
doctrine
and
the
longstanding
judicial
rejection
of
a
reasonable
expectation
of
privacy
in
matters
made
public
have
depleted
the
fourth
amendment
of
vitality
for
purposes
of
establishing
constitutional
barriers
to
the
government
s
use
of
frt
to
profile
and
monitor
individual
citizens
although
the
court
has
expressly
affirmed
protections
for
anonymous
speech
under
the
first
amendment
that
doctrine
has
not
been
extended
to
address
the
harms
that
flow
from
dragnet
style
surveillance
yet
every
member
of
the
modern
court
has
at
some
point
recognized
that
technology
necessitates
a
rethinking
of
traditional
constitutional
boundaries
this
article
argued
that
existing
first
amendment
protections
for
anonymity
should
be
brought
to
bear
in
assessing
how
fourth
amendment
doctrine
can
adapt
to
the
challenges
of
modern
surveillance
methods
today
the
conglomerate
of
publicly
available
data
is
colossal
and
constantly
expanding
technology
enables
the
government
and
private
companies
to
identify
patterns
within
such
data
which
reveal
new
information
that
does
not
exist
anywhere
in
isolation
as
a
consequence
information
in
the
digital
age
is
fundamentally
distinct
from
information
in
the
pre
digital
age
in
which
the
court
s
fourth
amendment
doctrine
evolved
this
article
thus
identified
constitutionally
derived
guidelines
for
courts
and
lawmakers
to
consider
in
crafting
judicial
legislative
and
regulatory
responses
to
the
government
s
newfound
capacity
to
create
new
information
from
storehouses
of
data
gleaned
from
social
media
sites
public
cameras
and
increasingly
sophisticated
technologies
like
frt
by
giving
these
guidelines
serious
consideration
courts

alhambra
a
year
after
the
police
department
implemented
predictive
policing
software
car
burglaries
and
vehicle
thefts
have
decreased
chief
mark
yokoyama
said
in
january
alhambra
was
the
first
law
enforcement
agency
in
southern
california
to
have
citywide
implementation
of
predpol
a
cloud
based
software
that
forecasts
areas
where
crimes
are
likely
to
be
committed
nine
months
ago
some
residents
expressed
reservations
about
technology
that
could
target
the
homeless
or
minorities
but
co
founder
jeffrey
brantingham
a
ucla
anthropology
professor
said
predpol
doesn
t
use
personal
information
to
predict
crime
it
doesn
t
include
who
the
offenders
are
or
what
type
of
music
they
like
or
anything
like
that
he
said
it
s
focusing
on
where
the
crimes
are
happening
the
public
calls
the
police
and
report
crime
police
are
using
data
they
are
given
they
re
actually
doing
what
the
public
wants
it
s
nothing
like
minority
report
or
criminal
profiling
predpol
uses
five
years
worth
of
law
breaking
data
to
map
a
by
square
foot
area
where
crime
will
likely
happen
the
technology
essentially
places
officers
at
the
right
place
and
time
to
prevent
lawbreaking
the
alhambra
police
department
focused
on
the
two
most
common
crimes
in
alhambra
yokoyama
said
by
year
s
end
when
compared
to
numbers
car
burglaries
decreased
by
percent
and
auto
theft
declined
by
percent
a
statistics
report
showed
yokoyama
said
the
system
works
he
recalled
a
time
when
police
officers
were
patrolling
valley
boulevard
at
predpol
s
direction
and
noticed
a
suspicious
vehicle
they
found
ski
masks
inside
the
vehicles
and
arrested
the
individuals
on
suspicion
of
robbery
he
said
the
act
of
robbery
burglary
et
cetera
does
not
have
to
be
committed
for
a
crime
to
occur
yokoyama
said
the
planning
and
actions
toward
committing
the
crime
is
a
crime
in
and
of
itself
in
fact
it
would
always
be
our
preference
to
stop
a
crime
at
this
stage
than
for
an
act
to
occur
yokoyama
added
that
giving
officers
direct
clear
missions
to
patrol
particular
areas
has
had
a
positive
effect
that
residents
and
business
owners
have
noticed
it
s
actually
increased
our
communication
and
visibility
to
the
community
because
police
officers
are
spending
more
time
in
the
residential
area
as
an
example
yokoyama
said
i
get
positive
calls
all
the
time
about
why
the
police
are
in
their
neighborhood
more
residents
such
as
william
rising
however
said
he
hasn
t
noticed
more
officers
on
the
streets
but
he
said
response
time
to
emergency
calls
has
improved
just
a
more
visible
police
presence
can
avert
many
potential
criminal
activities
such
as
car
theft
break
ins
and
drug
dealing
he
said
in
a
facebook
post
in
addition
to
printouts
of
potential
crime
areas
yokoyama
said
every
police
car
is
now
equipped
with
in
car
computers
that
receive
refreshed
information
every
five
minutes
in
general
he
said
officers
spend
about
percent
of
their
time
doing
random
patrols
based
on
their
knowledge
of
the
city
and
they
spend
percent
of
their
time
focused
in
the
by
square
foot
areas
to
which
predpol
directs
them
yet
the
crime
rate
forcertain
activities
has
increased
residential
burglaries
went
up
by
percent
and
robberies
increased
by
percent
a
report
found
although
the
numbers
are
up
based
on
predpol
predictions
we
feel
a
number
of
crimes
were
prevented
and
would
have
been
higher
if
not
for
predpol
missions

finally

re

here
s
why
the
main
crises
he
describes
now
six
months
into
his
second
tour
as
new
york
city
police
commissioner
are
less
likely
to
bring
declarations
of
victory
frayed
relations
in
minority
communities
a
department
facing
increased
oversight
the
ever
present
threat
of
terrorism
he
is
acutely
aware
of
predictions
that
crime
would
rise
in
a
post
stop
and
frisk
new
york
run
by
a
liberal
mayor
bill
de
blasio
and
mr
bratton
accepts
that
in
many
ways
his
mandate
is
to
bolster
public
confidence
that
the
city
will
remain
safe
a
lot
of
this
mr
bratton
said
is
about
effectively
trying
to
just
calm
everybody
down
hey
it
s
going
to
be
fine
the
city
is
not
going
to
fall
apart
the
four
horsemen
of
the
apocalypse
are
not
riding
into
town
to
rape
and
plunder
for
a
quarter
century
in
police
departments
on
both
coasts
mr
bratton
has
made
a
name
for
himself
based
largely
on
a
broken
windows
theory
of
policing
an
aggressive
approach
to
maintaining
order
by
pursuing
low
level
offenses
like
vandalism
as
a
means
of
preventing
serious
crime
but
on
his
return
to
new
york
he
is
searching
for
ways
to
apply
that
same
playbook
developed
in
the
high
crime
early
s
to
a
safer
city
filled
with
new
yorkers
who
have
never
known
it
any
other
way
he
has
looked
for
blight
in
manhattan
and
found
little
to
report
he
has
marveled
that
grievances
about
noise
are
now
a
leading
complaint
from
residents
in
washington
heights
an
area
he
associates
with
the
violent
drug
gangs
of
an
earlier
time
crime
is
not
interestingly
enough
a
big
issue
at
this
time
in
the
city
he
said
in
a
recent
interview
the
city
is
a
vastly
different
place
than
mr
bratton
knew
in
the
s
in
his
first
year
as
police
commissioner
there
were
robberies
in
manhattan
alone
and
homicides
across
the
city
this
year
through
sunday
there
have
been
just
over
robberies
citywide
and
killings
but
mr
bratton
is
not
veering
from
his
focus
on
low
level
offenses
rather
he
is
doubling
down
although
for
different
reasons
if
two
decades
ago
mr
bratton
championed
the
zealous
pursuit
of
subway
fare
beaters
he
did
so
partly
because
it
led
to
the
arrest
of
more
serious
criminals
in
those
crime
plagued
years
one
in
turnstile
jumpers
was
found
to
have
a
weapon
now
his
attention
to
minor
offenses
is
more
about
banishing
the
specter
of
disorder
crime
endures
in
the
city
but
it
often
differs
from
what
he
faced
last
time
around
heroin
is
resurgent
but
users
are
now
more
frequently
found
in
staten
island
houses
than
derelict
shooting
galleries
youth
gangs
rarely
battle
over
drug
turf
but
engage
in
violence
for
violence
sake
mr
bratton
has
said
with
a
kind
of
disgusted
wonder
while
homicides
are
down
shootings
are
up
percent
so
far
this
year
to
an
increase
that
has
been
seized
upon
by
his
critics
and
those
of
the
mayor
but
in
the
interview
mr
bratton
spoke
with
evident
frustration
at
how
each
uptick
in
violence
has
been
treated
as
evidence
that
public
safety
was
slipping
that
s
something
that
we
had
to
address
and
the
mayor
has
to
continually
keep
addressing
because
everybody
is
still
waiting
and
watching
he
said
god
forbid
we
had
more
shootings
than
we
had
last
year
he
added
people
tend
to
forget
what
this
place
looked
like
in
the
s
for
mr
bratton
the
present
reality
is
best
tackled
with
what
he
sees
as
a
time
tested
approach
signaling
for
officers
to
go
after
highly
visible
conditions
such
as
subway
begging
and
graffiti
and
he
is
resisting
an
effort
by
the
brooklyn
district
attorney
to
be
more
lenient
with
low
level
marijuana
offenders
he
has
even
sought
to
brand
the
showtime
performers
who
dance
in
train
cars
or
as
mr
bratton
often
calls
them
the
subway
acrobats
as
resonant
symbols
of
disorder
much
as
he
once
did
with
the
squeegee
men
of
a
generation
ago
you
re
seeing
activity
directed
against
the
acrobats
against
the
aggressive
beggars
soaring
he
said
he
announced
with
satisfaction
the
arrest
last
week
of
a
long
island
man
accused
of
routinely
spray
painting
on
highway
overpasses
and
walls
in
queens
graffiti
along
the
long
island
expressway
has
come
under
particular
scrutiny
from
mr
bratton
who
gets
a
close
view
of
the
vandalism
as
he
returns
from
his
weekend
home
in
the
hamptons
i
get
criticized
about
what
are
you
going
after
graffiti
for
we
ve
got
kids
killing
each
other
mr
bratton
said
it
s
just
this
sense
of
in
public
spaces
who
s
in
control
when
he
reflects
on
his
policing
career
mr
bratton
speaks
in
terms
of
big
challenges
he
has
overcome
helping
to
turn
the
tide
against
crime
in
new
york
in
the
early
s
and
a
decade
later
to
remake
a
los
angeles
police
department
which
had
come
to
be
defined
by
brutality
and
racism
he
can
seem
at
times
cramped
by
the
challenges
enumerated
for
him
by
mr
de
blasio
who
campaigned
on
reducing
and
reforming
the
stop
and
frisk
tactic
the
aggressive
use
of
which
led
to
new
court
oversight
and
the
city
council
to
create
an
inspector
general
for
the
department
while
the
mayor
hailed
mr
bratton
as
the
right
leader
to
carry
out
changes
to
the
stop
and
frisk
policy
mr
bratton
soon
began
describing
the
issue
as
moot
pointing
out
that
by
the
end
of
the
bloomberg
administration
officers
had
abandoned
it
as
a
tactic
mr
bratton
has
also
grown
quieter
about
mr
de
blasio
s
signature
public
safety
initiative
reducing
traffic
deaths
with
less
fanfare
mr
bratton
has
embarked
on
several
new
initiatives
including
detectives
focused
on
cellphone
theft
and
cybercrime
and
a
push
aimed
at
those
who
disable
metrocard
machines
and
sell
swipes
to
desperate
straphangers
he
said
he
wants
the
department
to
embrace
so
called
predictive
policing
which
uses
data
streams
to
anticipate
crime
patterns
or
allocate
police
resources
already
the
department
is
looking
back
at
the
hours
before
every
shooting
to
see
which
complaints
and
calls
for
minor
events
loud
music
playing
crowds
gathering
preceded
the
violence
and
if
addressed
in
the
future
could
help
head
it
off
mr
bratton
has
brought
in
familiar
non
officers
from
his
past
postings
john
linder
who
is
working
on
the
re
engineering
of
the
department
as
he
did
in
john
miller
a
former
reporter
to
head
the
department
s
intelligence
and
counterterrorism
efforts
and
zachary
tumin
the
co
author
of
mr
bratton
s
book
on
leadership
to
direct
efforts
on
data
driven
policing
and
social
media
but
one
of
his
most
urgent
priorities
in
the
wake
of
the
political
and
legal
fight
over
stopping
and
frisking
has
been
improving
morale
in
what
he
describes
as
an
unhappy
organization
to
that
end
he
has
traveled
the
city
shaking
hands
with
patrol
officers
adding
his
signature
to
their
memo
books
last
month
during
a
late
night
tour
of
the
th
precinct
in
the
bronx
he
stopped
by
the
station
house
in
the
neighboring
th
precinct
at
a
m
on
a
whim
a
lot
of
my
role
at
this
juncture
in
this
department
is
personal
touching
of
the
cops
and
the
public
he
said
indeed
mr
bratton
is
trying
to
find
new
ways
to
improve
the
public
s
confidence
in
the
police
department
soon
he
said
the
department
will
regularly
conduct
a
question
survey
with
residents
in
each
precinct
to
ask
the
old
ed
koch
thing
how
am
i
doing
at
his
direction
precinct
commanders
have
taken
to
twitter
it
is
part
public
relations
and
part
responding
to
citizens
everyday
complaints
to
build
a
better
relationship
with
the
public
but
mr
bratton
has
also
encouraged
his
precinct
commanders
to
make
more
decisions
on
their
own
potentially
leading
to
conflicts
if
say
the
dictates
of
a
computer
algorithm
do
not
align
with
the
approach
taken
by
a
local
commander
a
situation
like
that
presented
itself
in
the
th
precinct
during
mr
bratton
s
visit
last
month
when
the
area
was
leading
the
city
in
homicides
by
design
teams
of
young
officers
sent
to
handle

old
operation
impact
are
assigned
to
high
crime
zones
determined
by
analytics
at

and
can
be
moved
only
after
a
lengthy
approval
process
but
the
commander
of
the
th
precinct
ruel
r
stephenson
said
the
system
limited
his
ability
to
respond
to
pockets
of
crime
as
they
cropped
up
around
the
sprawling
precinct
after
the
precinct
commander
described
the
situation
mr
bratton
instructed
his
new
chief
of
patrol
james
o
neill
to
fix
it
he
then
set
off
for
a
midnight
tour
of
the
unfamiliar
north

terrain
where
shootings
have
doubled
this

very
clean

californians
and
position
the
state
to
be
a
leader
of
the
big
data
movement
on
its
face
proposition
is
a
simple
state
constitutional
amendment
the
measure
clarifies
that
local
governments
must
comply
with
california
s
open
records
laws
cities
and
counties
will
no
longer
be
able
to
simply
say
they
cannot
afford
to
answer
citizens
requests
for
information
the
measure
could
also
finally
force
local
agencies
to
provide
key
sets
of
data
that
have
been
unavailable
and
allow
the
state
for
the
first
time
to
direct
what
kinds
of
data
must
be
made
available
and
help
turn
government
into
a
clearing
house
for
vital
sets
of
public
information
having
comprehensive
reliable
public
data
will
give
developers
and
policymakers
alike
the
ability
to
create
better
solutions
to
help
the
public
prop
could
transform
the
role
of
the
state
from
a
simple
deliverer
of
services
into
a
platform
for
data
that
will
allow
the
private
sector
to
provide
those
services
more
efficiently
it
could
pave
the
way
for
the
uberization
of
public
services
creating
new
kinds
of
solutions
that
are
enabled
by
government
but
driven
by
the
market
it
is
a
st
century
vision
for
what
government
can
and
should
become
people
use
a
lot
of
words
to
describe
government
but
efficient
is
rarely
one
of
them
but
if
it
can
be
an
agent
for
accurate
and
vital
information
it
will
allow
both
the
private
and
public
sector
to
recognize
inefficiencies
and
gaps
in
government
services
and
come
up
with
ways
to
fill
those
gaps
it
will
also
allow
for
the
kind
of
government
transparency
needed
to
hold
elected
officials
accountable
if
done
properly
the
measure
can
help
us
get
a
better
understanding
of
what
our
elected
representatives
are
up
to
and
whether
promises
that
are
so
often
attached
to
policy
choices
actually
bare
fruit
did
that
sales
tax
increase
aimed
at
improving
transportation
infrastructure
actually
help
with
the
problem
good
quality
data
can
help
us
find
that
answer
if
prop
passes
it
could
unlock
massive
troves
of
data
and
allow
the
private
sector
to
set
about
addressing
some
of
our
most
pressing
issues
in
the
state
already
for
example
there
is
a
movement
afoot
to
address
the
current
drought
by
mining
local
water
consumption
data
finding
data
that
can
help
solve
big
problems
will
become
easier
under
prop
the
current
state
of
public
data
in
california
is
quite
frankly
embarrassing
for
example
we
have
no
reliable
statewide
numbers
for
how
many
businesses
are
opening
and
closing
in
california
or
what
kinds
of
businesses
are
setting
up
shop
or
moving
out
of
the
state
our
current
information
is
haphazard
and
largely
anecdotal
and
laws
are
made
based
on
hypotheses
and
incomplete
information
prop
will
allow
state
lawmakers
to
require
local
governments
to
track
specific
types
of
information
and
make
it
available
to
the
public
we
are
already
seeing
the
power
of
data
and
how
reliable
and
current
information
can
lead
to
better
delivery
of
services
in
los
angeles
for
example
the
lapd
rolled
out
predictive
policing
technology
that
analyzes
historic
crime
data
to
forecast
where
police
resources
are
likely
to
be
needed
in
the
future
government
can
improve
the
lives
of
californians
but
it
may
not
in
the
way
the
state
has
intervened
in
the
lives
of
citizens
throughout
the
th
century
with
the
passage
of
prop
government
can
evolve
into
a
platform
to
enable
innovative
ways
to
better
serve
